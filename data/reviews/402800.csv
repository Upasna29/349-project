Garry and co are no strangers to what the community can create (see Garry's Mod), hopefully Chunks sees a similar level of support.  Given that Chunks is still in early access it's expected that we will also see official developer created content added as well.\n\nIf you want to see what the game is like at release here's some footage.  Just keep in mind that when using VR you may become sensitive to motion when riding in a coaster, going forward I'll probably make sure I'm seated for it. :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFp6l-RM1mc","April 11","true","0.8"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","22","30","4","1"

The placement of track is really freaking intuitive and fun so I went all out and finally make a cart and gave it a whirl.  At first it was awesome, but then the curves I made got to me and I had to forfeit my dinner and lay on the ground for 10 minutes just to recalibrate my sense of direction.  Karma finally caught up with me.  After 15 years of torturing peeps in Rollercoaster Tycoon, I now know the misery that those countless victims experienced while riding my constructions of pure evil.\n\n10/10 would vomit and lay on the ground with horrible vertigo again.\n\nLooked neat though.  The game, not the bucket of sick and spinning room.  I found out the hard way why it's called "Chunks", cause I blew them.  Gotta go easy on the VR.","April 28","true","3.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","93","13","14","14","0"

The wait was well worth it! I spent what felt like a few minutes building an insane rollercoaster which ended up taking 2 hours. I can't wait for new features and community plugins. There are so many possibilities!\n\nThe minecraft like textures don't bother me much and I love how easy it is to build things as you are free to scale from 1:1 to 1:64 very easily.

Whether you're building a castle or a rollercoaster (and then riding it!).\n\nI am having performance issues at times but reducing the loaded chunks mostly took care of this.\n\nThe UI is a little bit clunky, but thankfully you can rearrange it. I'm sure this will improve in the near future.\n\nThe moddability is already there, so people can expect a fair ammount of additional content. Can't wait to see what people are coming up with!\n\nAlready feel like I've gotten my money's worth with this!","April 12","true","4.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Beautiful. Absolute must have. The building is really intuitive, though menu navigation can be tricky at first. Once you figure out the controls, which are labled if you turn the Vmotes to the side, it's really easy to teleport and start building. It might take a good 20 minutes until you get fluent with it though. The rollercoaster implementation is amazing as well. You need be careful though or you're not going to have a good time. Building of the tracks is easy and works great with the controllers in that you can twist the Vmote to twist the track, and tilt to tilt etc. Just don't make one that will make you sick when you ride it. This game exceeded expectations. It's been my favorite room scale experience so far and has given me the sense of scale no other game has done yet. Highly recommend.","May 19","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The roller coaster builder is pretty cool although I made myself a bit nauseous. I do miss the survival mode, hopefully something like that comes out of the workshop. Switching scale is very cool. I really look forward to seeing what the community comes up with in the steam workshop.\n\nI think the controls could use some improvement or a faster way to switch between them rather than having to go to the menus. Maybe something closer to how you switch weapons in Hover Junkers or Budget Cuts. Maybe like recently used items or favorites. The menus in their default position are a bit difficult for me to see without straining my eyes luckily you can move them around.","April 11","true","0.6"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","12","23","0","0"

I don't think that will ever happen.  It will fail if it relies on the workshop.\n\nIt takes too much time to move around as you have to reselect it on the controller.  Making coasters is not that fun either.  I think it would work better with track selection buttons, like in RCT games, instead of dragging the controller.  It is difficult to get the track to look clean and straight.  It ends up twisted.\n\nIf this game is going to be only about roller coasters, then it needs tons of options and different types of coasters.\n\nGame is only worth $5.","May 9","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Even without a headset you are able to fly around, mess with workshop maps, and press random buttons on the menu. However, you can't interact with anything, spawn critters, or build and ride roller coasters. Chunks has so much potential.

Thank you for becoming better as a dev and person, Garry.\n\nFacepunch continues to become a better and better company. Their games, like Rust, are the best in their genre (though no dinosaurs to draw people in). Messing around with the game, things look good. I won't be able to truly test it until I get a Vive, but I'm supporting it and the developers (yes, yes, you too Helk and all the rest).\n\nThe only thing I'd like to see in this game is no official servers run by people who let racism slide like Rustafied does.","April 30","true","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Combined with the ability to explore Minecraft-style environments at giant scale, then cozy up into a cave at 1:1, this is basically everything I've ever wanted from VR.\n\nAlso, if you're into experiments in VR interface design, Chunks' panel system has innovations left and right.","May 13","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For such an early version of a game it is amazing compared to much of the VR dreck currently available, sure it's not perfect and doesn't have a lot of content yet but I thought it was worth the price for the amount of fun I've had playing and letting friends & family ride the coasters I've created.\n\nThe only real issue I had was I don't have a lot of space available so building can be challenging but once you get the hang of teleporting and changing your scale it gets easier.","May 14","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
