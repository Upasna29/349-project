What could the end hold? Possibly the meaning of life, at least to Mr square.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yye6QdDUpf4\ngravilon is the definition of minimalistic, there are no enemies, collectables, achievements or random dubstep outtakes. Controls are very simple, move left and right or slow down time briefly. Using these skills you need to find your way through each level. Design of the levels is where the genius comes in to play. Each crafted in ways that give a multitude of ways to finish them so not only does it leave plenty of room for experimentation but you feel like superman after pulling certain moves off successfully.\n\nNot sure exactly how many levels the game contains but you will quickly be scratching your head, progress is also rewarded with a subconscious story that slowly evolves in the background which I've yet to completely understand, which I think is the point but certainly adds a nice element.\n\nBasically if Super Meat Boy and Thomas was Alone had a stepchild, gravilon would be his name. If you ever wondered how a platformer might play with no jump button, this will give you some serious insight. Only small complaint is no native gamepad support but certainly not a dealbreaker.

Its a game that requires patience from the player and it does everything it can in its minimalist art style to keep you calm and relaxed. You won't hear music so much as what sounds like rolling dice as your square tumbles end over end. Every level consists of black lines as platforms with a grey background. You'll see the previous level in the foreground and the next level in the background. Getting to the exit will fly you into the background and it makes for a beautiful touch.\n\nThe object of each level is simply to make it to the end door a large blue square. The controls are simple,A and D keys will to shift your weight to tumble and the space bar will make slow motion that will give you greater control when you're in the air. Otherwise your momentum can make you easily miss something. Using slow motion drains the meter and it will build back up over time.\n\nSince there's no jump, its all about your momentum, the tumble will make you jump depending on the angle your square hits a surface. To make things interesting there are white anti-gravity cubes that will shift your square's gravity from the bottom to the top of the screen and vise versa. These cubes regenerate in a few seconds.\n\nThe game benefits the tumbling with platforms that are on angles to tumble or slide down. Trying to move up any incline is a difficult feat that you'll need to shift your square's weight backward before you can shift it forward to have enough momentum to climb. Any over calculation can send you tumbling back down again.\n\nIf you ever get stuck, just hit R to respawn. There are no lives. It doesn't reset the level, but it does put you back at the start. Any time you die from a death pit a hazard or a respawn, it leaves a dead black square. This makes the level feel alive seeing all your dead squares there. You can move them and bump into them. If you hit them hard enough they'll disintegrate.\n\nWith the level design, you can make your own way. There's not one clear path to take. Its all about how you take the path you're on. Take one path too slow and you might be stuck. Take another path too fast you might not have the precision it takes to get through it. Levels get more difficult with the inclusion of yellow lines as hazards. One touch and you're dead just like a death pit.\n\nFrom the moment you start, you're in the game, with a quick hub world that lets you tumble to a doorway with continue, act 1, act 2, act 3, bonus and even quit. There's no main menu and it goes a long way to making you feel in game and keeping you there.\n\nIf you're looking for a hand holding experience you won't find it here. Gravilon is a frustrating game almost from the start. The tumbling mechanic ensures that no attempt is exactly the same and a lot of the time it feels like luck rather than skill. Even when you spawn, its at a different angle, causing you to bounce from there. Your tumble could be off and it might send you somewhere completely different. That's why you need to use the slow motion a lot and even then I felt like I would die again and again. There are no checkpoints, every death restarts the level over again. It wouldn't be an issue if you weren't a tumbling square.\n\nTo make matters worse your view can get obscured by the previous level. As much as I love the artistic effect it does get annoying. There might not be hand holding, but I don't expect them to cover my eyes either. The game will even turn my level transparent to focus in on the background.\n\nSince you can take your own path, you are allowed to keep trying to make the wrong path work. If you can only get the momentum to tumble up high enough you can make this path work! 15 minutes later, its time for a new path. Yet going back to the game, then you can get the momentum to make it work. Again, it feels like luck and not skill. Doing the same thing 100 times might yield the result you want.\n\nThe beginning of the seventh level has a dead square and with that dead square you can make a path to an anti-gravity cube. Hitting that dead square knocks it out of place, preventing you from using it again on your next attempt, unless you set up your living square then kill it with a retry to have it in place as a dead square. That was my path for a while.\n\nThe other path I could take is gaining enough momentum, but not too much because you'll knock yourself on a platform or overshoot the needle thin platforms you'll need to slow motion jump to. Then hope you have enough momentum to carry you into the anti-gravity cube or else you'll just have to try again and again. That's just how Gravilon is. You need patience. Your skill will not get you there.\n\nEach level can take under two minutes from start to finish and I'm telling you that to inform you that I'm three hours into the game and I have yet to complete the seventh level. I've never made it through the first act. Perhaps that truth is a testament to how bad I am at this game, or its a testament of a game that's a lot like a roll of the dice.\n\nSometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't. Its all in the unique tumble mechanic. While it is an unique game with a great art style, its just not fun. Its painful and frustrating, but there are people out there that will love the steep difficulty and soothing atmosphere.\n\nThe game wouldn't as frustrating if it weren't for the tumbling or even if it gave you a reward; some incentive to continue playing and push through the frustration. Your reward is another level. A game should be fun enough to be its own reward. Maybe there are fun, rewarding bonuses, but three hours and seven levels in, I wasn't able to unlock anything from the bonus content.\n\nWhile I can recommend it for its art style and low price tag, I just can't recommend it as a fun game. Perhaps I found it more frustrating than relaxing. Even if I didn't care for the game, I'd like to thank Fan Wu for giving me the game.","April 3, 2015","false","2.9"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","36","49","2","0"

Not that it should be easy, but the difficulty is not based on any skill or timing but on getting lucky on how your cube bounces. The game requires a precision that the controls don't afford, and the levels are either straightforward to the point of being linear or so jumbled that the solution is lost in a mess of lines and dots. The main menu is as difficult to navigate as the levels, and the "minimalism" just leaves the player hanging for some kind of story or reason to reach the end of the level.

The whole game is minimalistic, the visuals, the audio, the controls, the level design.  But from only a handful of game mechanics there is a lot of depth.  The physics-based platforming is very difficult, but it feels so good that you just want to keep doing it and getting better.\n\nThis game does not hold your hand.  Some of the paths you need to take are a bit hidden at first, but the level design is clever enough that when you do find the path, you know that you've found it.  It doesn't coddle you, but it sets you up well to figure it out yourself.\n\nSo far I'm only up to level 1.7, which has a puzzle right at the start.  Up till that point there was a feature of the game that I'd noticed, but I didn't really understand why it was there.  Then I realised that this little feature I'd been ignoring was the solution to the puzzle, and I was blown away.  gravilon had been teaching me this mechanic for the last few levels and I had hardly noticed it, then it said, "Nope, you're not going any further till you pay attention and notice what's going on here."  I love it when a game teaches me a new way of thinking, and gravilon has done that in the first Act.  I'm seriously looking forward to seeing what else is in store.\n\nI only have a few little complaints, mainly that there is no built in gamepad support.  I can map keys with Xpadder or joy2key, but it would be nice not to have to do this.  If you die you don't automatically restart, you have to hit R, but I can see why that decision was made.  The game isn't hurrying you along to keep trying, it's letting you set the pace.  It's good to be aware of though.  Finally, there is a time slowing mechanic, which I think is just to help with tricky spots, but I don't use it.  It's not really taught to the player, and I haven't needed it so far.  It's entirely possible it will become more relevant later.\n\nTL;DR haiku:\n\na minimal game\nlooked interesting\ntotally blew me away","March 30, 2015","true","4.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

You start out 'running' above the platforms but you can change the gravity of the game so that you are then 'running' underneath those same platforms. But I should have read some more reviews here before I actually bought Gravilon. You see, besides that basic idea there is nothing here.\n\n- Movement is clunky. Yeah I know: "What do you expect when your 'character' is a square?" Well, I expected the flow of the game to be surprisingly smooth despite the fact that you're controlling a square. But it's not.\n\n- The game has no instructions or tutorial at all. Once you struggle through the initial menu and manage to start the game, you have no idea what the goal is. By chance, you'll discover how to change the gravity (hit a white square). Besides that, you'll 'do things' but will have no idea what you just did. Every time I hit a black square, I heard a sound effect telling me that 'did' something but I haven't got a clue what it was.\n\n- Level design is bland and uninspired. Look at the screenshots.\n\n- The game menus are confusing. For example, I still have no idea how to exit the game properly.\n\n- There is 'Partial Controller Support'. This means you can use the buttons of compatible controllers, but not the stick. The dev replied to a discussion about this that that was intended. Ow-kay...\n\nBottom line: this game is just no fun.

Now, back on topic. The game is very cool, when you talk about graphics. Some of the levels make no sense, and since the turning controls don't work too well, this can make some levels, more difficult than they needed to be.

Maybe it's thought-provoking, in the sense than you'll be thinking about how much you want to shove something up this cube's a**, that it'll finally jump! Or maybe properly move around. I first thought it was odd how in Pretentious Game and Thomas Was Alone, that the blocks moved by sliding around. But that's leagues better than Gravilon, because actually getting the damn cube to move is a challenge in itself. Who thought it was a good that you had to build momentum by rolling a cube!?\n\nOn top of the awkward movement, it's enhanced all the more by the fact that you can't jump! I'm serious. You cannot jump in this puzzle-platformer. I thought that the designers might have used that as an excuse for more unique level designs, but most of these puzzles would be far easier if you could actually jump instead of fall of the edge of a platform and awkwardly steer your way to a cube that's one-tenth smaller than you in the hopes you can reverse your gravity.\n\nThe level design is, needless to say, garbage. The backgrounds are just gray, with the next level in the background, and the previous level usually blocking platforms you'll have to land on and end up having to guessing when you move onto them. There's so much crap thrown around in each level that it can leave the level open to a player's interactions, but there's usually only one way to get to the final gate conventionally and one completely unorthodox way (most of the time I found this method unintentionally). See, VVVVVV (a similarly blocky gravity-related platformer) gave you a character you could actually control with nice, tight controls and let you "jump" by reversing your gravity whenever you want. And it even had a story! Not a very interesting story, but at least it had one.\n\nThere's little reason to buy Gravilon. You can tell someone had a good idea, and designed a very pretty game. The sound is great (if only there was some actual music to compliment it) and that aside, I think, pretty much sums up Gravilon. A pretty game that still needs a lot of work. Movement needs to be a lot tighter, a story wouldn't hurt to make the game more "thought-provoking", added-in jumping mechanics would help immensely, and a better menu at this point is definitely mandatory. The in-game menu and main menu are total garbage, with their Calibri font and odd placement of options. If the designers actually take in this criticism, Gravilon could potentially become the next ORION: Prelude. Until then, Gravilon still needs a lot of work to actually become "decent".","December 28, 2015","false","2.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I spent almost 2 hours on stage 1-7, because of the stupid beginning, that is more luck than skill to pass by. I wish I was playing something else than wasting my time on a stupid stage over and over, but unfortunally I was waiting for last card to drop.\n\n- This game feels like no one tested it, cause the square you control sometimes stuck, and some of the "gravity pills" you gotta pick to change gravity are almost impossible to get before die 1000000 times. Games are supposed to be fun, and not to make us angry!\n\n- I couldn't find a way to quit the game. Seriously! I had to press Alt+F4. That is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!\n\n- Menu sucks, and there is NO control support for a game like this? You just need left and right, and a button to slow motion, and another to reset. Four buttons, and you couldn't make it to Xbox controller? Thanks god for JoyToKey.\n\n- The game tries to be different, leaving the last stage you played in front of the stage you are currently playing, but this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t always keeps getting in the way, making it hard/impossible to see where to go. Unnecessary.\n\n\n\nI usually do not vote or review puzzle games, because they are something that usually differ from person to person, some may have patience, some not. But this game really ♥♥♥♥ me off. It is so frustrating that I really regret the money I spent on it (and I got it on a sale, just to mention).

Not push, roll. I'm sure the concept has been done well somewhere (EDGE comes to mind), but it's certainly not an appealing hook, clunking a box all around. You'd have to do something really special with the controls or levels to overcome how onerous the basic movement is. Have you noticed I've been talking around the game in question here?\n\nGravilon is a puzzle platformer where you roll a square around a bunch of floating lines. Other than some floaty movement and dots you can touch to reverse gravity, the rolling is just as clunky as you're imagining. You can build up momentum to cross gaps, which you'll need to do pretty much all the time, but it makes your box extremely difficult to control. And that's a pretty core problem with the game, because not half a dozen levels in it gets blisteringly hard. You'll start being expected to make long precision jumps and clutch gravity flips, and falling off the level or touching deadly yellow lines starts the whole level over.\n\nThere are a few extra tools you have to overcome these difficulties, like a slow-motion button and the fact that when you die or reset, your previous square remains in the level. But rather than supporting your efforts, these mechanics become required before even warming you up to how they work. All of this takes place in a gray void with the next and previous levels visible in the back and foregrounds, which sounds cool except they're all made of the same black lines and blend together into a visual mess. Add a plain-text menu that looks like fifteen minutes of placeholder programming, and you have an unpolished, unbalanced ball of frustration on your hands. And it doesn't even roll right.","February 25","false","0.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Gravilon has a unique spin on a combining minimalist graphics and creating a 2D-platforming-puzzle atmosphere. While the game is very simple in appearance the game jumps in difficulty very quickly.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: There really isn't a story in Gravilon, you're a block exploring the vastness of.... Gravilon.\n\nGame Play: I personally love simple controls, because then you can make the gameplay more complex and difficult based around simple controls. (for example, with Super Meat Boy, you have insanely difficult levels, but simple controls)\nFor Gravilon, you move right or left, and have a "slow down time" move, most of the game complexity and difficulty comes from the environment, you can reverse your gravity by touching little white blocks.There are often times multiple paths to complete a level, once you spawn into a level, you need to make your way to the "end block".\n\nAchievements: There are no achievements for Gravilon at this time. Thank goodness, the achievements would undoubtedly be as difficult as the game. (it's always possible they might be added, just so I pull out my hair in frustration.)\n\nPrice Gravilon is priced at $1.99, that's a fair asking price for the amount of time most people will spend playing this game.\n\nConclusion: Gravilon is a nice short game that you'll play for a couple hours, depending on how good you are at puzzle + 2D + platformers and or divided by stubbornness, you can probably drag out more time from the game.\nWhile I don't really feel too strongly one way or another towards this game, I would recommend checking it out if for no other reason then supporting the indie developer, quaint games like there are abundant but I personally always enjoy playing them.","January 2","true","0.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Now, I'm not one to say that games are bad usually, and like to think that I think the best of things, and the good reviews said amazing things.  So I ignored the bad reviews, mistake number one, I then bought the game, mistake number two.  When the game opened it opened the default unity menu, which I'm fine with, however once the menu opened and I saw that the left and right keys ('a' and 'd') were completely different from the up and down keys ('u' and 'n') I began to have second thoughts, and when I realised I couldn't change the controls I began having third thoughts.  I then started playing, I still have no clue what the up and down do, it doesn't move the character up and down, it doesn't change gravity to be more or less, or if it does it does it in the smallest increments imaginable.  And the first level (spoilers?) is possible to complete by holding the 'a' key... SOMETIMES... because at random the character doesn't bounce the same way it did the last time, so by holding the 'a' key multiple results can be achieved, the square can win by getting to the end of the level, the square can hit a wall, lose all it's momentum and fall out the world, or fall out a hole in the ground because it didn't bounce the right way over it.\n\nHOWEVER, it does have very nice music\n\nkinda summing up:\n-  bad control setup - can't be changed\n-  gameplay? - winning levels by holding a key down\n-  explanations - or rather the lack of\n-  nice music\n\nTL:DR\ndon't get\n\nEDIT:\nthere's a story?

The goal is simple: navigate a square from one door to another, using tiny cubes to defy gravity, become gravity-bound, and reach each door.  Even in the first few levels, however, this is somewhat difficult, and can even become repetitive.  Here's why:\n\n1. Remember those tiny cubes I mentioned?  Note the word tiny, as these cubes can be extremely hard to grab because of their size.  I give the designers credit for planting more than enough cubes across the level (thus welcoming different strategies to reach the door), but it is very frustrating to go toward one and just miss it, over and over and over.  This usually results in death, and could easily be solved by increasing its size.  But the small size, along with being at the mercy of physics as you (most of the time) hurtle yourself towards them, makes switching your gravity much more difficult than it needs to be.\n\n2. Level design.  It is inherently flawed.  Levels have holes that you can get easily stuck in (again, because of being at the mercy of physics), stopping your movement entirely,  and you must start the level over.  These "holes" are in plenty of places, and are simply frustrating; sometimes, you can even fall in badly-placed holes, and die.  You can also get stuck on high slopes, as they are impossible for a cube to travel up; the cube stops, and often you must restart the level.  It can't be attributed to trying to make the game "more difficult"; this is an inherent flaw of the game.\n\n3. Lack of tutorial.  After Level 2 (could have been after Level 1, actually), the game seems to say, "Got the mechanics?  Good, now you can handle a really long level."  They don't really ease the player into it, but throw the player in the moment the mechanics become understandable.\n\nI like the minimalistic look, colors, and gameplay of Gravilon.  But its bad level design, flawed gravity mechanic, and lack of proper tutorial makes it frustrating.  Even so, it has its charm, and I actually like controlling the cube when it comes down to it (though the slow-mo mechanic is fuctionally useless, but kinda neat).  Its sound design is simple, but also very well done.  I recommend it, but keep in mind its flaws.\n\n(p.s.: According to the description, the "story unfolds in the background', and you will "learn about your role in the world" the more you play.  I have yet to see the story, but look forward to it.)","October 23, 2015","true","2.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I absolutely love the minimalistic style - its very unique and I haven't come across anything else like it.  The controls are simple - left and right.  Instead of using the spacebar to jump, you use it to slow time - another really cool and unique feature that I enjoyed.\n\nAs with all platformers, the goal is simple - make it to the end of the level.  But unlike a sidescrolling platform, your world is smaller and gravity works both ways.  You navigate lines by either rolling on top of them or floating under them, depending on your gravity situation.  Sometimes your exit portal is right beneath you, but you have to manuever around in a circle hitting several gravity switchers to make it to your destination.\n\nAs someone who isn't great at puzzle games, I found the levels very difficult.  This game takes patience to hit small targets precisely and to control the speed of your moving block.  Holding down the A or D button even a second too long would build too much momentum and I would fly off course.\n\nThe lack of music, the minimal look (almost like modern art), the simple controls and the cool gravity switcharoo make this a game that's easy to return to, even for just a couple of minutes.  But be prepared for a challenge!\n\n","November 17, 2015","true","1.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The problem is, even if you know the solution, it's really hard to perform it and that is what made this game so frustrating to me. Since you're a square block, your bouncing is irregular and the game depends a lot in how you bounce. Not only that, but you seem to spawn in a diferent way every round. Do the test yourself:\n-Hold a movement key and let your square block bounce, you'll probably die in diferent places even if you did the exact same thing every single round.\n-Another con is that the levels don't seem to be in any specific order (except the first ones of act 1 that work as tutorials) so some of the last levels will seem easier than the first ones of each act. In fact I found act 2 easier than act 1 (excluding tutorials. Maybe I was just getting used to the game, maybe not).\n-I found some shortcuts that save you a lot of time (I belive they were supposed to be there) but I also found ways (luck based ones) that surely weren't supposed to be there. Due to the irregular bouncing I actually got lucky in like 4 levels solving them in very few tries without following any path at all.\n\nMoving on to the pros.\n-The art style is pretty sober and quite enjoyable (still for long periods of time it hurts your eyes, specially those yellow glowing electric bars)\n-The feeling of finishing a hard level is specially satysfying in this game.\n-Even if the game depends a lot on luck I belive that the idea has a lot of potential. If they manage to make the game (or a sequel) more brain challenging and rid of the luck based element I would be very interested in playing it.\n\nAlso the bonus is turning your square into a four-pointed star that overall increases your chances to get stuck. Still pretty cool.","November 21, 2015","true","13.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Now, I'm not one to say that games are bad usually, and like to think that I think the best of things, and the good reviews said amazing things.  So I ignored the bad reviews, mistake number one, I then bought the game, mistake number two.  When the game opened it opened the default unity menu, which I'm fine with, however once the menu opened and I saw that the left and right keys ('a' and 'd') were completely different from the up and down keys ('u' and 'n') I began to have second thoughts, and when I realised I couldn't change the controls I began having third thoughts.  I then started playing, I still have no clue what the up and down do, it doesn't move the character up and down, it doesn't change gravity to be more or less, or if it does it does it in the smallest increments imaginable.  And the first level (spoilers?) is possible to complete by holding the 'a' key... SOMETIMES... because at random the character doesn't bounce the same way it did the last time, so by holding the 'a' key multiple results can be achieved, the square can win by getting to the end of the level, the square can hit a wall, lose all it's momentum and fall out the world, or fall out a hole in the ground because it didn't bounce the right way over it.\n\nHOWEVER, it does have very nice music\n\nkinda summing up:\n-  bad control setup - can't be changed\n-  gameplay? - winning levels by holding a key down\n-  explanations - or rather the lack of\n-  nice music\n\nTL:DR\ndon't get\n\nEDIT:\nthere's a story?

The big gameplay twist?  You run into little white squares that change the direction in which you fall.   Negotiating levels is a matter of rolling your square to the right coloured rectangle.\n\nAdding esoteric atmosphere to a low effort 2D platformer is not re-inventing the gaming industry.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/355150/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","In Gravilon, the player controls a colored cube through levels resembling a Microsoft paint file made by a person who had the line tool open as he had a seizure. As you can probably tell from the pricetag, the screenshots, and the other reviews, this is yet another physics-based platformer where depth and volume of content gives way to high difficulty.\n\nThat isn't to say that the game doesn't have its moments. I spent far more time with it than I honestly think it was worth, and discovered interesting level design, with solutions often requiring planning and careful application of the game's two big "gimmicks": the ability to slow time, and the ability to reverse gravity.\n\nUnfortunately, the game has a ton of problems. The biggest issue is the distinct gap that may appear to the player, between knowing how to get through a level, and actually being able to do it. Though conquerable through sheer persistence, this game is still quite hard, largely due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t foreground objects that can and will obstruct sight at vital moments, the camera which, especially in the later levels, is incapable of a helpful degree of control, and the inconsistency of platforming afforded by the cube itself.\n\nApart from embedding itself in some objects and phasing through others at high enough speeds, the cube can also be prone to slowing or hopping due to its angles. While this can be helpful, as it can be necessary to build momentum using rocking motions, and the angles are good for hooking onto ledges, the downside is that there is little way to tell in advance how an approach to a certain platform can be handled. Sometimes I can stop myself from going over the edge in time, sometimes I can't. The best analogy I can offer is like trying to fudge a dice roll.\n\nIf you can handle all of that, then it simply comes down to being able to beat a level in one sitting. There are no checkpoints, you screw up once, it's back to the beginning of the level, and of course it's one of those games where each level consists of several "do it perfectly or die" moments. Had there been more depth to the game, I would not have had a problem with trying over and over, but it didn't have enough depth, and I kept at it anyway, and in the end the experience was not very enjoyable.","May 19","false","8.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

The map can confuse your eyes and sometimes you can have no idea where need to go. Although I still thinking this game worth the time.\nHard, great sounds, good re-jogability.\nMaybe I like because I always play listening the song in the video above here.\n\nI don't know why that song isn't in this game. But I will tell you how can you get it.\nThe song in the video is "Apple - Alexis Beulah Garside".\nYou can listen here\n\nhttp://www.audionetwork.com/composer/biography/Alexis-Beulah-Garside_670?composer=670\n\nwhile you play this.\n\n\nWell, there is some negative reviews, I read many but I don't agree with them. I like how hard this game is and liked the concept. Give it a try.\nIf you like puzzle games that you can jump out a phase without doing it or do a phase just trying a lot without trying hard, I think this game isn't for you.\nHowever, if you love a challenge you can like it.\n\nThe best thing I can say is give it a try. In my opnion it's a great game.","November 4, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Moving to left or the right. You can't jump.\nYou have to roll over obstacles.\nYou can slow down things around you, which will allow you to climb a little bit easier and go a bit faster to that direction.\nYou have to reach the goal of a blue square to finish a level.\nThere is No music.\nYou will only hear "Tic, tic tic" sound when moving. (and some background noise)\nYou are able to reset the current level.\nThere are white dots which are changing your gravity upside down.\nYou can not change your controls.\nYou can turn the volume ur or lower by pressing The arrows keys up or down.\n\nOther things.\nIf you are resetting a level, the current square will turn into a black square which will act like an extra blockade.\nThis could prevent you from dying because you have to hit it once before it will vanish away.\n\nIf you complete an Sub-level and you are moving on to the next sub level. Then you will see the previous level in front of you. Which could be distracting.\n\nI find the game very boring and repetive. Especially if there is no music.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 3/10","January 22","false","8.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stefenros96/recommended/355150/","stefenros96","King Piggolo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stefenros96/","40 products in account","Gravilon is a minimalistic, jumpless 2D platformer that has you tumbling a square end over end instead of smooth running and jumping. Its a game that requires patience from the player and it does everything it can in its minimalist art style to keep you calm and relaxed. You won't hear music so much as what sounds like rolling dice as your square tumbles end over end. Every level consists of black lines as platforms with a grey background. You'll see the previous level in the foreground and the next level in the background. Getting to the exit will fly you into the background and it makes for a beautiful touch.\n\nThe object of each level is simply to make it to the end door a large blue square. The controls are simple,A and D keys will to shift your weight to tumble and the space bar will make slow motion that will give you greater control when you're in the air. Otherwise your momentum can make you easily miss something. Using slow motion drains the meter and it will build back up over time.\n\nSince there's no jump, its all about your momentum, the tumble will make you jump depending on the angle your square hits a surface. To make things interesting there are white anti-gravity cubes that will shift your square's gravity from the bottom to the top of the screen and vise versa. These cubes regenerate in a few seconds.\n\nThe game benefits the tumbling with platforms that are on angles to tumble or slide down. Trying to move up any incline is a difficult feat that you'll need to shift your square's weight backward before you can shift it forward to have enough momentum to climb. Any over calculation can send you tumbling back down again.\n\nIf you ever get stuck, just hit R to respawn. There are no lives. It doesn't reset the level, but it does put you back at the start. Any time you die from a death pit a hazard or a respawn, it leaves a dead black square. This makes the level feel alive seeing all your dead squares there. You can move them and bump into them. If you hit them hard enough they'll disintegrate.\n\nWith the level design, you can make your own way. There's not one clear path to take. Its all about how you take the path you're on. Take one path too slow and you might be stuck. Take another path too fast you might not have the precision it takes to get through it. Levels get more difficult with the inclusion of yellow lines as hazards. One touch and you're dead just like a death pit.\n\nFrom the moment you start, you're in the game, with a quick hub world that lets you tumble to a doorway with continue, act 1, act 2, act 3, bonus and even quit. There's no main menu and it goes a long way to making you feel in game and keeping you there.\n\nIf you're looking for a hand holding experience you won't find it here. Gravilon is a frustrating game almost from the start. The tumbling mechanic ensures that no attempt is exactly the same and a lot of the time it feels like luck rather than skill. Even when you spawn, its at a different angle, causing you to bounce from there. Your tumble could be off and it might send you somewhere completely different. That's why you need to use the slow motion a lot and even then I felt like I would die again and again. There are no checkpoints, every death restarts the level over again. It wouldn't be an issue if you weren't a tumbling square.\n\nTo make matters worse your view can get obscured by the previous level. As much as I love the artistic effect it does get annoying. There might not be hand holding, but I don't expect them to cover my eyes either. The game will even turn my level transparent to focus in on the background.\n\nSince you can take your own path, you are allowed to keep trying to make the wrong path work. If you can only get the momentum to tumble up high enough you can make this path work! 15 minutes later, its time for a new path. Yet going back to the game, then you can get the momentum to make it work. Again, it feels like luck and not skill. Doing the same thing 100 times might yield the result you want.\n\nThe beginning of the seventh level has a dead square and with that dead square you can make a path to an anti-gravity cube. Hitting that dead square knocks it out of place, preventing you from using it again on your next attempt, unless you set up your living square then kill it with a retry to have it in place as a dead square. That was my path for a while.\n\nThe other path I could take is gaining enough momentum, but not too much because you'll knock yourself on a platform or overshoot the needle thin platforms you'll need to slow motion jump to. Then hope you have enough momentum to carry you into the anti-gravity cube or else you'll just have to try again and again. That's just how Gravilon is. You need patience. Your skill will not get you there.\n\nEach level can take under two minutes from start to finish and I'm telling you that to inform you that I'm three hours into the game and I have yet to complete the seventh level. I've never made it through the first act. Perhaps that truth is a testament to how bad I am at this game, or its a testament of a game that's a lot like a roll of the dice.\n\nSometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't. Its all in the unique tumble mechanic. While it is an unique game with a great art style, its just not fun. Its painful and frustrating, but there are people out there that will love the steep difficulty and soothing atmosphere.\n\nThe game wouldn't as frustrating if it weren't for the tumbling or even if it gave you a reward; some incentive to continue playing and push through the frustration. Your reward is another level. A game should be fun enough to be its own reward. Maybe there are fun, rewarding bonuses, but three hours and seven levels in, I wasn't able to unlock anything from the bonus content.\n\nWhile I can recommend it for its art style and low price tag, I just can't recommend it as a fun game. Perhaps I found it more frustrating than relaxing. Even if I didn't care for the game, I'd like to thank Fan Wu for giving me the game.","June 3","false","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
