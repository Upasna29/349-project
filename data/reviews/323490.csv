The graphics are watercolor-esque style.\n4:3 aspect ratio (Not widescreen).  Full-screen is achieved by hitting the windows maximize button.\n\nStory:\nThe game summary mentions 7 princesses.  Only 3 are romanceable.  A 4th girl, the head maid, is romanceable with the addition of the DLC.  The news states that the DLC is included with each copy, however I'm not sure if this will apply in the future.\n\nWhile the story flows for the most part, there are moments where the transition is abrupt and the flow is broken.  I'm not sure if it's deliberate.\n\n\nFor instance, there was a scene where you're teaching Finn and she falls asleep.  Then, when you try to wake her she's terrified.  For all of 2-3 clicks.  Then suddenly she's calm and apologetic.   You get the feeling she's either schizophrenic or there's a step missing.\n\nThen, there is another scene where you're at the training hall on the first day, and you find her acting really different...extremely confident I suppose.  She asks you to teach her like you promised and you ask her whether she has androphobia.  You try to comfort her...\n\n...and cut to a childhood memory of Finn's.  You wake up after that memory is complete.\n\nHow did you get from the training hall to your bed?  What happened in the middle?\n\nI haven't noticed this on the other girl's routes yet...I wonder if Finn's route is a bad end or a joke route.\n\nSound:\nMusic is peaceful, appropriate, and doesn't feel repetitive.\n\nThe battle music is rather interesting.  It's the first time I heard battle music arranged this way.\n\nVoices are in Chinese.  Voice acting seems to be a hit or miss thing.  (Whoever's VA'ing Dyanna sounds like her mouth is right on the microphone.  Or maybe there's an echo in the background?)  (Whoever's VA'ing Leira and her maid does a good job though.)\n\nMain character (you) is unvoiced.\n\nGameplay:\nVisual Novel.  Branching appears to be determined by a combination of choices and the number of times you visit a girl.\n\nThere's a "dictionary" button at the top of the screen.  I'm not sure what it's for since I can't use it yet.\nThe "return" button returns you to the previous set of choices.  Failing that, it returns you to the start of the scene.\n\nTranslation:\nMuch improved since it was released last year.  The prologue makes sense now.\n\nThe translation itself does not appear to be machine translated, i.e. since the writing takes the context of the scene into account.\n\n\nSaving / Loading:\nFor those of us that like to make a save point for each branch, you get 40 save slots.  39 are traditional slots.  1 is reserved for quicksave.\n\nYou can only quicksave when you reach the screens where you're picking the girl to visit.  I think the solution is to quicksave, then visit each girl in succession and save normally.\n\nMisc Notes\nMy firewall picked up an outgoing connection from the game when it starts.  I blocked it and the game seems to run fine.  Dunno what it's for though.\n\nConclusion\nI'll recommend for now since the game itself seems interesting.  I'll need to update this review as I play more later.","December 12, 2014","true","7.1"," 129 of 147 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","129","147","0","5"

But during the deciding battle you make a grave mistake, and you lose everything. Shamed and shunned, you return home to your emperor. How can you ever redeem yourself? As it turns out, the emperor already has a new task in mind.\n\nOblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana is a romance-themed visual novel set in a post-medieval fantasy world. You are a humiliated ex-general and your new job is to teach the art of fencing to the seven princesses of the kingdom.\n\nThe first thing you'll likely notice when you're looking at Oblivious Garden for the first time is the unique and stylish artwork. The character portraits and CGs are gorgeous without exception and the gothic/baroque-inspired character designs mesh surprisingly well with the pastel-focused watercolor art style. The VN has a refined visual identity that sticks out of the crowd and will secure it a second look from many prospective readers. The backgrounds are unfortunately of lower quality on average and range from nicely painted landscapes to crude photo manipulations of rooms. The soundtrack is fitting and atmospheric, but a little repetitive. This would have been counteracted by either a bigger selection of tracks or at least less obvious loops (they're not jarring but very apparent after the first few times). There's Chinese voice acting available that complements the character designs pretty well and provides fitting voices to go along with the faces. It has a spiffy opening animation and the technical aspects (controls, save system etc.) leave little to be desired.\n\nThe story is set in the titular "oblivious garden", where the emperor has sealed away the seven princesses. The many parallels drawn to the royal courts in 17th century Europe extend not only to the opulent garden itself, but also to the complex social rules and codes governing the interactions between Irell Reis, the ex-military main character, and the princesses residing in the area. Don't expect much in the way of historical accuracy though, I got the impression that the social aspects were influenced at least as much by the developers' Chinese background as by their impression of past European nobility, which is not a problem at all considering it's a fantasy world. While this sort of setting has been attempted before in fiction, it deserves recognition for originality in the realm of visual novels, even though admittedly I am generous with my praise for any setting that is not a Japanese high school.\n\nIn another contrast to the visual novel archetype, the main character is a young adult with a sizable amount of life experience as a military general. Thematically, in accordance with that choice, Oblivious Garden does not shy away from the heavy-hitters: Recurring topics are the justifiability of war and violence, the vicious circle of revenge, the guilt of enabling and orchestrating mass slaughter versus "just following orders", and of course the dichotomy between fate and free will. The VN uses these issues quite expertly in the interactions between the central characters.\n\nRounding out the package is a charming little mini game about brewing different kinds of tea that maybe could have been slightly more forthcoming with its solutions (or maybe I'm just bad at it), but offers a fun break from the plot and an entertaining experience nudging you to perhaps make a nice cup of tea for yourself as well.\n\nI would have loved to love Oblivious Garden. I saw almost all the building blocks needed for a fantastic visual novel, I really liked the art and the concept, the setting seemed unique and interesting. Yet, I can't love it. I can merely bring myself to say that it is pretty good all things considered. That is because Oblivious Garden commits my one cardinal sin, the one thing that a visual novel can do that I really cannot forgive: The writing is bad. Or rather, it has its good and even great moments (lots of them in fact) but it just can't sustain a consistent level of quality throughout the whole story. And for a visual novel, that is a huge problem.\n\nTo be clear, I am not talking about the low-quality English script that is rife with grammatical errors and vocabulary mixups. I know this can be a dealbreaker for many of you, so it deserves pointing out, but personally I can usually gloss over shoddy translations easily if I set my mind to it. In any case, it is something that can be fixed by putting the script into the hands of a better qualified translator or at least a native English speaking editor, which I have reason to hope might still happen. There were only one or two spots that I straight up didn't understand for which I would blame the lackluster translation. My main gripes run much deeper.\n\nBut if the writing isn't good, then why do I still give Oblivious Garden an overall "thumbs up" rating? There are reasons for that, I like to think they are good ones, and I will tell you all about them, but first I'd like to elaborate on the specific ways in which I consider the writing lacking and the ways in which it actually succeeds, so you can draw your own conclusions about whether or not your opinion would differ from mine and whether the things that bothered me might be non-issues to you.\n\n(This review turned out to be too long for Steam's character limit, please click here to read the full text...)[www.notehub.org]","December 29, 2014","true","13.8"," 84 of 93 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","84","93","2","9"

In one hand, the art style of the characters and backgrounds are gorgeous, the music beautiful and relaxing. The romanceable characters are very unique and deep, and I found myself genuinely interested in finding out more about them and they're well being. (Be warned though, if you're planning on choosing Leira as a romance option, you will need A LOT of patience. Her rudeness can be really hard to take, and at some points your perspective will switch to her's, and the game neglects to state this, leading to some confusion.)\nOn the other hand, the translation is absolutely awful, and english-speaking players will need to read a lot of the lines over and over again to understand what's going on, and there are not that many different music tracks in the game, making long playthrough's a little tiring.\nOh, and a little advice; even though there are multiple paths to take in the game, you can only choose one path and stick to it. I completed Lin's route, and on my second playthrough, decided to take Leira's path. As mentioned before, Leira can be an exhausting romance choice, as she insults you much more often than shows affection to you, so eventullay, I got sick of it. I thought I would take a break from the *cough*♥♥♥♥♥*cough* and visit Lin. And the VN immideatley launched one of the early romance scenes for Lin's story, even though I had never once visited her in the game before, making it very awkward when the main character said, "I know our meetings in the forest have not been a coincidence."\nUm, what meetings in the forest?\nSo, I decided to just shrug that weird moment off and go on to the next day... when I was immediatley expelled from the garden and failed the game.\nIn a nutshell; after a certain point in your chosen path, if you even GLANCE at another option in the game, you're hit with a game over instantly. I guess those princesses assumed I was courting them both. You can just imagine how much this ticked me off.\nThe thing is, this ending would be perfectly fine if they had programmed it better, by say, making the player need to visit a princess a certain amount of times before romance with them becomes possible, and then visiting each one with romantic intent, and NOT allowing the game to jump between romantic scenes at random!\nSo when you do remember to visit one and ONLY one princess after a few in-game days, there's still not that many important decisons you can make that greatly affects the outcome, such as in other VN's like Long Live The Queen. The biggest decisons you make is whether to tell Dyanna that she screwed up baking cookies or not. The result: This visual novel takes the word 'novel' a little too seriously, as you passively click the mouse like crazy, following the story in it's own set path.\nHowever, if you're an avid reader like me, you can probably look past this lack of interaction and choice as the characters and plot make the ride very engaging, and the game itself is beautiful to look at and listen to. And no matter how bad the translation is, I will always have a blast brewing Finn's head into the princesses tea. (I think that may be another glitch...)\nSo, if you like reading, gorgeous backgrounds, amazing music, anime art styles and suprisingly good romance stories, you'll feel right at home, but I would still recommend waiting for it to go on sale or for the developer's to fix the translation. If you demand important decisions leading to endless possibilties of endings, high interactive content, and freedom of choice, you should look elsewhere for your next VN treasure.\n","February 10, 2015","true","1.7"," 64 of 71 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","64","71","3","0"

Just absolutely fell in love with the characters. Definitely great to break away from the typical VN, no school girls, no stereotypical protagionist, nice break from the usual japanese voice overs with the chinese voice overs.\n\nI really love how in depth the story is, more of a book than most VNs. Irell is a great protagionist, how haunted he is by his sins and past. I never cared for the protagionists of other VNs, he really stood out from the bunch.\n\nThe voice overs were great, especially Leira's. She really sold the taunting, cruel speaking character, but was also able to sound cheerful when needed.\n\nThe music was superb, recommend buying the soundtrack.\n\nThe girls are easy to fall in love with. I really wanted and wondered why Marian wasn't a choice to fall in love with but after doing Leira's story, I saw why (You'll see why).\n\nI really liked how the world had religion, magic, and other things but didn't feel the need to go in to depth with it all.\n\n10/10. Playing again for sure. For the price of this game and DLC, recommend for anyone who loves VNs or just a great read all together.\n\n\n\n\n\nPS: Be careful on Leira's story.

From this, I do think that a lot of things are lost in translation because of cultural barriers, and to make matters worse the translation is quite terrible; as I read in the forums the translation is now being reviewed.\n\nOblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana is pretty much similar to other VN's, you move around the garden and go to places where you can interact with its characters. Your decisions will direct which storyline you will go through. In some stages of the game you will be asked to prepare a tea, this will lead you to a minigame. You'll decide which ingridients to use, set the temperature and time for brewing. The game may end early if you somehow suddenly got kicked out of the garden (This was how my first game ended). If you were able to do you job well you may be able to proceed to one of the heroine routes.\n\nI had a hard time understanding it but the story is really good and interesting. The protagonist was presented well,  and some of the characters are pretty unpredictable that you'd be puzzled out on how to interact with them.\n\nIt was a joy listening to the voice acting, there was nothing that I didn't like (This is my first Chinese VN though; I can't understand what they were saying). I like the art and the soundtrack. The OP is what I like the most in this game, I don't know how many times I watched it, really loved the music.\n\nIf you ever find yourself playing this VN, I recommend that you start trying to get to Finn's route first, finish Lin and Leira's before going on to Dyanna. I believe that this is the best way to experience the VN because with this you can have a finale with the Miracle Play.","December 29, 2014","true","24.1"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","29","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/323490/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","IntroI’m not an avid reader but I do enjoy reading a book from time to time (it is rare, though). Visual novels are a little different but they’re easier for me to relate to because you actually see the characters and don’t have to visualize everything. If you’re a fanatic book reader you probably don’t understand this reasoning because interpreting and visualizing is probably what makes reading a book so magical in the first place. The upside to reading a visual novel is that your choices can effect and influence the story. This differs per game though. But Oblivious Garden is such a game. Did I enjoy it ? Let’s find out.\n\nGameplayReading a book – it doesn’t matter if it’s a physical one, digital one or interactive one – requires a lot of patience. You could miss parts of the story just by not paying (enough) attention, which is actually a shame. The story of Oblivious Garden caught my attention and it seemed very interesting to me. That’s why I was eager to give it a try.\nYou play as Irell Reis, a once famous general who is given the task of hosting the next fiesta, where the God will forgive the people who sacrificed themselves on foreign land during the war. You will prepare yourself in the garden of the Emperor, where seven princess live who are going to help and work with you. That’s the short version and it might not be entirely accurate as I usually forget smaller details. So forgive me if I’ve made a mistake.\nI think it was clear that playing this game is like reading a book, but one that requires interaction from you, the player. You’ll be clicking through the conversations, occasionally making a choice that might affect the story and you’ll even be playing a little minigame where you have to brew tea.\nYou’ll be talking with the seven princesses, along with some other characters, and well, that’s basically all that you’ll do. I’ve played the game two times now but haven’t actually left the garden even once. It’s just non-stop conversing with the main characters. This frustrated me a little because the bigger story was the thing that caught my interest in the first place.\nAlso, it isn’t entirely clear what’s expected of you. As I said I’ve played through the game twice, but every time the game ended prematurely because I seemingly didn’t make the right choices. Both times I’ve selected entirely different answers but that didn’t seem to help. It’s very frustrating if you don’t know what to do and it insults my intelligence by simply ending the story so soon without being able to set things right. I don’t want to replay the entire story over again and mouseclick through a story that I’ve already read. This could’ve been handled in a better way, I think because I’m most certainly not going to play through the story for a third time, without knowing for sure that I can complete the story ‘correctly’. It might actually have been the tea minigame which didn’t make much sense to me (I was just randomly adding ingredients, for example), but I doubt the game counts things like that as a failure.\nUnfortunately, the game’s typos and occasional bad grammar didn’t help either. For a game that consists of large pieces of text I actually expect something to proofread it before releasing it to a larger audience. I still understood most sentences/conversations so it’s not that I didn’t make sense of it all. It was just… distracting.\nOther than that the writing is pretty good and the story is somewhat interesting. I just expected a little more here.\n\nAudio & GraphicsThe one thing that’s immediately noticeable is how loud the music is when you first start the game. It can, of course, be easily adjusted through the Options menu but it surprised me a little.\nThe music is actually very good and the Japanese voice acting – even if it’s useless – seemed accurate but since I don’t actually speak Japanese I’m just guessing here. Still, voice acting isn’t something you see very often in visual novels (I haven’t played that many) so it’s absolutely appreciated.\nThe game uses mixed art. Some environments look beautiful and others seem to use a different kind of style, like your own room. Nothing ugly, but, again, distracting. The characters are competently made and what you can expect from a visual novel. This means ‘childish’ Japanese girls, with big eyes, small mouths and perfect bodies. If only something would try something new. I usually can’t really relate to Japanese/anime characters.  Still, it’s all very solid and I can’t really complain here. It’s a ‘love it-or-hate it’ kind of thing.\n\nLength & ReplayabilityI’ve already spoken a bit about this in the Gameplay paragraph but the shortest playthrough seemed to take about 2 hours of my time. That is with normal settings so no uberspeedy text. I’ve been told that a ‘good’ playthrough will take about 4-5 hours of your time so that’s pretty solid. Choices do seem to make a difference, but not much. This means you can replay the game and you might get a different outcome but in my two playthroughs I got the exact same ending. I did notice small variations in the story though. Considering the price I think you get enough gameplay out of it, but to be honest I would wait for a sale. That’s from a person that doesn’t play a lot of visual novels so it might be a different story if you actually do play a lot of these games.\n\nClosingOblivious Garden pulled me in with its interesting story but unfortunately didn’t keep me interested for long. The story stopped short fairly soon and I had no clue what I did wrong. Even during my second playthrough I couldn’t for the life of me see what I did wrong in the first place.\nThe game can absolutely use a little (more) direction, or improve things to make a second (or third, fourth) playthrough worth your time.\nI have played better and more interesting visual novels during my career as a gamer and therefore I can only recommend to wait for a sale or to just grab one of those others. Please take note that I don’t think this is a bad game per se but it just isn’t worth the current asking price in my opinion.\n\nTo be shortLet me sum all of these things up for you, for those of you who don't have the time to read it all.\n\nPros:\n\n■ Okay visuals\n■ Voice 'acting'\n■ Multiple endings\n\nCons:\n\n■ Lacks direction\n■ Story isn't as deep as I hoped it would be\n■ Been there, done that 'visual novel'-style\n■ Typos & grammar mistakes\n\n[Rating: 64/100]","December 18, 2014","true","4.9"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","2"

This is a CHINESE made and voiced game and buyers should be aware of that before they consider anything else. While it isn't too big of a deal for me, some people on the forums are quite upset about it.\n\nGraphics/Art - 5/10\nThe backgrounds looks horrendous; it's almost like they went into paint and brushed some pictures together. The character models on the other hand look relatively crisp and workable. Some characters have a couple awkward postures and the sprites aren't overly polished compared to something like If My Heart Can Fly, but it's passable.\n\nSound/Music - 9/10\nThe soundtrack is phenomenal and I'm going to give them props for voicing most if not all of the female lines. That being said, the Chinese voice actors sound quasi-amateurish but compared to most of the VN's on steam that lack any form of voice-acting, it's still a welcome addition.\n\nTranslation - 6/10\nThis is where the game falls flat. If you are fluent with English and aren't afflicted with any mental handicaps, you will be able to make out ALL of the scripts. BUT, the English translation seems like it was made by people with English as a secondary or tertiary language. It's slightly better than the machine translations I would be getting off Atlas with a modified dicitonary so tbh it's doable.\n\nA welcome addition to the Steam repertoire of visual novels. I am thrilled that more Chinese made ones are making it onto the market and hope there's more to come.

The music works well with the setting.  The character voices sound fine to me.  As with all translated VNs, there are some occasional clunks in the text, but I didn't feel it was bad.  I can't comment on the translation like I might with a Japanese VN as I don't speak any dialect of Chinese, but nothing in the text seemed overly hinky that would hint at a poor translation.\n\nThese are just basic good points you can find in a lot of VNs.\n\nWhat really made this one stand out, in my opinion, is the vast difference in the stories for each path.  Most of the VNs I've read have had pretty much the same plot regardless of what path you're trying to follow, with unique scenes and dialogues inserted in based on your choices.  In this case, without spoiling anything, the entire progression of the plot is different.  Each girl's path is written individually so that if you finish, for example, Leila's path and then go back and play Dyanna's path, the story is brand new (and each plot is VERY different from the others).\n\nThanks to the real replayability of this sort of "four-stories-in-one" novel combined with the well-drawn graphics, I can't recommend it enough.

It is a great piece of work. The game is a typical VN with choices, time playing through, and a sense of dating and options. What I recommend is that you buy it and try it yourself. The ONLY thing I will warn you is the VA. It is in only one language and the text is in english. What I seem to dislike about this is that they had the image, then you hear the character speak, it's just not "fluid". I give credit to the VA and the game creators though for trying however not all Voices work out well and it doesn't hurt to have someone speak the language it's in or keep it silent or even just have small lines in a sublime manner that make them want more. However I digress. The game's OP hit me like a rock. It made me sink. I went to start the game, wonderful story telling right off. Then I see the characters, text pass, GUI. It is an incredible piece of work. It's just the voice. I don't mind it but if it just doesn't seem to fit the character. Now that might just be my opinion but I'll be honest, it's too soft. I expected something more like if it was in this scenario with characters, there was a more "other" tone to the personality. Here I hear some of it but it just doesn't flow together. Sure I can turn off voices but I have to put this critically. It doesn't always work. The girls are nice, the choices good, and the plot makes you think. The days pass and work like a typical VN Dating Sim. Now as I go about this, I have a Mini Game or two. KUDOs to them for this. Not all do and let's be honest, that was a nice touch. I could have recommended this game a 5 but the voice set it down by 1 point but in fairness I will give it a 4.8/5. Reason, you did so much so well, it should not stop the quality the work produced. I give credit, it's one of the games that hit my list and it hit me well. I just cannot emphasize the VOICE enough though... Hnrgh...

This one in particular is pretty awesome. Without spoiling to much of the VN, the artwork and background music is fabulous. The story for the most part is pretty good and each Princess is unique to their own peers, especially with their history/background story. There are 7 Princesses and 2 Maids that stand out. Only 3 Princesses and 1 Maid are options for an ending, maybe more in the future updates? (The staff has stated that it is not 100% done and Finn's chapter will not be a free DLC in future dates, as it stated "Price glitch indeed, we'll fix it asap")\n\nThe Mini-game Finn's Tea Time I thought was good but is also kind of pointless. It does not really affect the story besides the Princesses/Maids giving their opinion on how good/bad your tea tasted. Would of loved it if making the best Tea/crafting a S rank Tea gives you a unique art with each of the Princesses or something of that nature. A little more information on how to craft a Tea would be helpful then whats on the illustrated option. On the illustrated option, it will open 3 tabs.\n-Materials: Explains what the material (Ingredient) is such as what Fragrance is produces, if it is a Seed/Fruit/Flower/ect.., is it Sweet/Bitter, ect...\n-Tea: Unless you crafted the tea itself, the discription box will hint you on what Materials you may need to craft that Tea.\n-Exit: Do I really need to explain what this does?\nYou start at level 1. As you sucessfully craft a Tea, you will level up. The higher your level, you get more Materials to make higher level Tea. You earn more recipes for Tea as well when you level up. There are 4 ranksing you can earn when you craft a Tea, from D to A. D being the worse pretty much means the Materials you used to make Tea does not make Tea at all. If you earn a C or higher rank, it means you did craft a Tea BUT it does not tell you why you earned that rank. Did I put to much dosage? Did I use the wrong Temperature? Did I not put enough Time into it?\n\nI've played many VNs and Eroges ranging from G-senjou no Maou, Fate/Stay Night, Clannad, Little Busters, Grisaia no Kajitsu, Tears to Tiara, My GF Is The President, Kamidori Alchemy Meister, Daibanchou (Big Bang Age), MQG, Galaxy Angel, the list goes on. And yes, most of those VNs I do own the Japanese physical/digital copy unless there was a english release. Now for the ulitmate question: Is the game worth the $15 dollars (or cheaper with Steam sales/discounts)? In my opinion on December 13th, 2014, Yes. That does not mean it comes with it own set of problems.\n\nVOICES\nMajority of the VNs that come out are normally from Japan which means English translation with Japanene voices; HOWEVER, this VN is Chinese which means English translation with Chinese voices, granted it could be in Japanese voices but thats not the point. I have no problem listening to another language but other people may not find this VN as attrative because of the voices, which is Ironic because some people prefer Silent VNs while others criticize VNs for the lack of voices. Most Main Protagonist are silent because it suppoes to be seen on your point of view as the Main Character. very rarely are some voiced but for me personally I would love to hear the Main Character's voice\nTRANSLATION\nTranslation plays a big factor for VNs, that goes without saying (Probably the biggest most important one for most people). For the most part, this VN is diffidently a enjoyable read in English. It is not machine translated and some minor sentences do need editing but as I stated before, I've played many other VNs with machine translation and this VN does not fall into that category. For the most part you can read it in English with no problems understanding what the VN is trying to explain to you.\nCHARACTERS And Their PROGRESSION\nCharacters and their Progression in the VN play another big factor for VNs. This VN has no problem making each Princess/Maid unique to their peers. If I had a problem with it, it would be future releases for this VN. Finn is a free DLC at the moment but the staff releasing the updates have clearly stated that its a price glitch that they will fix in the future which pretty much states that they will be charging people for Finn's chapter of the game at a future date. Also, anyone whos played the VN will know that there are 7 Princesses and 2 Maids that stand out in this VN. The game is not 100% translated/completed which means we are missing 4 Princesses Arc and 1 Maid Arc if they do make all of the Princesses/Maids a possible ending. The only negative I would say is when you unlock the Character's Albums, it does not tell you if you unlocked 100% of their artwork for that Character, if it was a good/bad/true ending, and that sort of detail.\nARTWORK AND MUSIC\nThe art style and choice of music is another big factor for VNs. This VN artwork and music are fabulous. I have no problem with the music and seeing how creative people can make a Princess (female in general) look so different from one another is always fantasic to see. Some people like myself will love it, others will not find it as attrative.\nMINI-GAMES\nMini-games are a rarity in VNs, especially ones that stand out. Finn's Tea Time in my opinion I like but it really does not serve any purpoes besides making the Princesses/Maids comment on how good/bad your Tea is. It does not change any ending nor does it affect the story which means some people will find it a complete waste of time. I like the idea but sadly has no outcome in the game so it not as rewarding as it should be. Maybe a unique Background with the Princess would work, just my wishful thinking. This part is kind of off topic but related to Mini-games. In Little Busters, there is a Player VS AI battle system that takes place (random and funny) and that will affect some endings you can earn in the game. The main Mini-game in that game is obviously the baseball mechanic. It is fun, rewarding, and diffidently affects a ending of the game if you win or lose.\nPHYSICAL/DIGITAL COPIES\nSince the game is released on Steam, it means it is a digital copy. While some people like myself would prefer a physical copy of the VN BUT I say it is better to own any copy of the game then not having a copy of it at all. Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment is guilty of this as well and a perfect example to use. In the US (United States), it is only available through PSN (Playstation NetWork) on the PSV (Playstation Vita) which means it is a digital copy; HOWEVER, if you bought the Chinese Physical copy of the game that comes with English translation  (granted it not 100% but having translation is better then not having any at all), you now have a Physical copy of Sword Art versus the Digital copy of it.\n\n\nAs I stated before, I do not regret buying this VN at all; however, it may not be for everyone. If your a VN lover, this is by all means worth the $15, I find it a bargain compared to other VNs I've purchased. If you judge a book by its cover, this may not be for you unless it has sparked your interest.","December 13, 2014","true","50.6"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/323490/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1583 products in account","Product received for free\n\nPlaying Oblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana is a beautiful and romantic experience. Set in a far-off magical land, you step into the shoes of Irell Reis, who has been ordered to help tutor seven princesses. Each story route brings with it new adventures and dangers, this simple garden isn’t all that it seems. Become immersed in the lives of the princesses and the rich history of the Magical Empire of Latoy, learn about gods and war as you romance the lady of your choice.\n\nEach route gives you different parts of the story, but all you know at the start is that you are Irell, a disgraced general defeated in an important battle that cost the lives of thousands of soldiers. The Emperor sees fit to give Irell another chance and he is sent to the Oblivious Garden to be a fencing instructor. The garden is so named as its residents are oblivious to the outside world, and with good reason: The garden is protected by a magical barrier making it more of a prison. On the surface the game might seem like it’s simply about romance but there is a lot of magic in this world and a complicated backstory that is touched on in pieces in each different route. Despite being in the garden with seven princesses you can only romance three of them as well as a maid.\n\nIrell - One of the greatest warriors serving under the Emperor, he is a skilled fighter but not so skilled with women. After a devastating loss he is stripped of his titles and banished for three years, only to return for a new mission- to tutor the princesses. He wants to atone for his failure, and help the souls of his fallen soldiers find peace.  Due to these burdens, he spends a great deal of the game depressed. Through his experiences in the garden and his relationships with the princesses, he finds peace of mind and a new future to fight for.\n\nLeira - Leira’s route is the simplest, it doesn’t delve too far into magic nor the long history of Latoy, instead it plays more like a traditional dating sim as you work to pursue her. Her backstory is the one most connected to Irell himself and because of her harsh attitude she takes the most work to romance. She is the classic “tsundere” character type though getting to know her explains her personality much more. She is also the focus of the free White Day DLC.\n\nLin - She is the quiet and reserved type, at first seeming standoffish and dull until you get to know her. Of the princesses, her route is the shortest and has the least amount of choices. It does, however, have a good story and I found it to be the most romantic. She is a very skilled swordswoman but rejects the sword because of a deep darkness hidden inside of her. Following her route uncovers some of the history of Latoy and a bit of the Emperor’s true nature but not much.\nDyanna - While Dyanna’s route has less choices than Leira’s, I found it to be the longest. I played this route first because I found her very beautiful but in hindsight it should have been last because of its length and heavy backstory about Latoy. While she and Irell grow close through the story, after you’re done making choices the story continues on explaining her history, her magic and more about the garden and Emperor and Irell himself. It is a pretty heavy story and can seem confusing at first, but the climax is pretty epic.\n\nFinn - Gentle Finn is the head maid in the garden and tends to all of the princesses except for Leira who has a personal maid. She knows everything going on but isn’t the gossiping type. She is friendly, kind and adorable throughout every route. Her own route, however, is a bit confusing. I really can’t go into details but it made Finn seem bipolar, it also didn’t seem to accurately portray Lin either but it is the shortest route with the fewest choices.\n\nIntelia, Ereface, Charlotte and Sherle - The other princesses in the garden that you cannot romance. Intelia serves as the headmaster of the garden. Ereface prefers to stay in the library, and her magic helps keep the garden beautiful. Charlotte is the daughter of a general and a great fencer. Sherle is the youngest in appearance and in her attitude, usually playing the role of a kid sister. You only really learn more about Ereface and that is through Dyanna’s route.  The others get little face time in the game save for Intelia, who is present in all routes but is by her nature very mysterious.\nSince this is a visual novel, the interface is exclusively point-and-click. You read through the story and at times make choices to help move the story in a certain direction. The game has the standard features for this genre; an auto text option, a skip previously seen text option and the ability to scroll back and see past text. You can save, load, remove text from the screen to see pictures fully and the game also auto saves. A nice feature I liked was the dictionary, which is available once you finish any route. It contains facts about Latoy and all of the characters. Another neat feature is the tea-making mini game. Since this game is about refined young ladies, tea takes a high priority, especially in Leira’s route. Through the mini game you can brew different types of tea with ingredients you gain through the story and also through raising your tea-brewing level. The only downside is that the game gives you little or no help on how to figure out how to brew good tea, without a guide you’re probably going to be lost.\n\nArtwise there is nothing negative that can be said, the art in this game is beyond gorgeous. Every princess looks beautiful, the backgrounds are lovely and the menus and user interfaces are very elegant. The music is also amazing, every melody is beautifully orchestrated and I highly recommend picking up the soundtrack as well. Where the game falters is the voice acting. The main game has voices for the entire female cast while the DLC also adds male voice acting. I found the acting to be fine but the audio quality was inconsistent. At times some voices were loud, some very muffled and no one was at the same level or quality. What was worse was that at times there was no audio where there should be. Lin was apart of Finn’s story route but had no voice acting through most of it, she also missed lines in her own route. There were also times when what the actress said didn’t match with the text on the screen, though not many that I noticed with my very limited knowledge of Chinese.\n\nDespite some flaws I personally loved playing this game. It was quite lengthy, easily offering 10-20 hours of gameplay to complete everything. There are many Steam achievements to get and also trading cards as well. While at times the story may feel contrived or confusing, I fell in love with the princesses as much as Irell did. My least-favorite princess, Leira, became one of my favorites. The game also has a side story that is free DLC about Leira though her personality is a bit different from the main story and there is added fan service but also more achievements. If you enjoy visual novels then I highly recommend adding Oblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana to your library.\n\n\nThis review is exclusively written for Visual Novel Vortex, visit the official site here[vnvortex.co]!","May 21","true","25.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsukiyui/recommended/323490/","itsukiyui","伊月ゆい","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsukiyui/","202 products in account","What an oddity.\n\nI have a deep love for everything victorian and regal, and was instantly sold on this game by that fact alone. I was not dissapointed, and yet; I cannot recommend this game at full price.\n\nThe art is gorgeous, and all of the characters are beautiful and a pleasure to take in. The backgrounds and scene images are also beautiful. If I had any complaint it would be how they are used. Your bedroom is also the princess's bedroom, the fencing hall is also the stage, and the a destroyed city is also the same city you visit in present day as another city. They reuse assests in such a way it is quite easy to get confused and you rely heavily on context to figure out where you are. A minor complaint but one that does get your attention when you are suddenly enjoying a festival in an identical city as one that no longer exists.\n\nThe audio is varied. There are voice actors and you can choose to disable any or all of them, they aren't terrible but they aren't great either. All dialogue is spoken in chinese and the audio sounds compressed when compared to the music. I turned off all the voices personally  since I find it easier to get into a character when I hear the voices I gave them in my head as opposed to the ones the game gives you. The music is of higher quality and fits the mood, however I was dissapointed by how forgetable and generic it is with the exception of a few tracks. I was hoping to spend hours enjoying the sound of violins and pianos long after I stopped playing the game, but not once did I feel inclined to listen to the soundtrack outside of the game.\n\nAs a choose your own adventure novel gameplay is a minor point but there are some major issues I have here that I need to speak for. There is a mini game in which you make tea and the quality of tea you make requires you to know recipes which you pick up throughout the game FROM INSANELY VAGUE CLUES. I settled on a walkthrough to create some of these teas and from the comments on the walkthrough (found in steam guides for this game btw) I am not alone in the confusion I had with this mini game. It feels forced into the story and it really pulls you out of the story to have  the crude and sparactic ui (menus that shift around the screen randomly as you click on them) took away a lot from the story  the game wants to tell. I will discuss my other major gameplay issue when talking about story.\n\nSTORY. It starts out a little slow but quickly you become excited as the game unfolds from some dark text, I am talking body parts and the like. That is my first issue, the game is fairly light hearted and when dark elements do arise they are heavy handed and paint a disgusting picture (Babies being pulled from crying mothers and then stomped upon, removal of limbs, etc) which may work in something like higurashi, but when you are having tea with a stubborn princess in a light hearted way moments prior it feels disgusting and out of place.\nI can only speak for Leira's path since it is the only one I have ( and want to ) finished at this moment. The Characters are deep interesting and I did smile on more than a few occasions. Nothing made me laugh out loud or cry but I did feel enjoyment early on for the characters I met. However as the game goes on, some characters personalities completly change for one or two scenes AS PLOT and then turn back without ever really being mentioned again. Some really cute and clever plot twists are thrown in and never developed and the writing goes from being this beautiful old english that had me looking up a few words to writing that felt of a far lower quality. It is jarring and quite noticable. This is a rare occasion where the story could have been three times longer and meaningful had they taken more time to flesh out these plot twists and ideas. The first few hours (minus the intro) is proof of how well they can actually write. So many curve balls and clever twists wasted by trying to tell a complex story in the length of a pulp fiction novel.\nWithout spoilers the ending doesn't know what it wanted to be, tragedy or happy. It hits this odd place of unsatisfying and frustrating but still ok. It pulls the "everything is ♥♥♥♥ but its okay!" approach and with so little time spent on it, it is almost cringey.\nHOWEVER MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT. It commits a huge sin that sadly many games (not just vn's commit) when giving the player options. The lack of clarity and understanding of choices will lead to failures and trial and error. Do you like the sunset or do you just like being 'here'(earth,garden,alive? who knows). choose carefully or you will be cut short on what seemed like an otherwise great relationship. There is no build up or understanding of what you are choosing half the time, and when these choices can lead to failure (sometimes after many other choices leading you into trial and error) it becomes less of choose your own adventure and more of something skin to playing dragons lair minus the onscreen cues. I would have enjoyed this vn 100x more had the choices been removed entirely instead, not ideal but far better than trial and error.\n\nThis is not a great novel nor is it focused however it was enjoyable enough that I felt the need to finish it to completiton, and while I have zero desire to play the other routes, I am still glad I gave it a chance, as it scratched my love for all things victorian itch.\nIf anything the game offers seems interesting consider grabbing it during a sale, but at 15 usd I just can't give it a thumbs up.","December 26, 2015","false","7.6"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","25","39","2","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/left4dinner2/recommended/323490/","left4dinner2","Law Abiding Engineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/left4dinner2/","144 products in account","Earlier this year, the game Oblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana was listed as a game looking to get the green light, and within just a few days of being posted, it was lit by the community.   Just by watching the trailer, I knew this would be an enjoyable visual novel since the music and art style is what got my attention.   Several months later, it has finally been released, and although it is not perfect, it is still a very well done an enjoyable VN.\n\n\nStory\nThe story is simply about a former General who ran away from a war that was already a loss, but by doing so, he is humiliated for being a coward for running away.    After some time, he is then summoned by the Royals, and is told to train seven princesses the art of fencing for an upcoming Dance event.   And with that, the story flows based off your choices.   Do you talk to princess A, or princess B?   Do you act c*cky and bold, or noble and respectful?   Early on, there are ways of being able to 'do it all', but shortly after that, you have to make your choice in who you want to pursue or which ones you want to focus on and which ones you want to ignore.   I have only started, and i can tell that there are some choices that make an impact, even if they are small for now.    For those who are new to Visual Novels, I will briefly explain how they work.    Visual novels are simply novels that are have background pictures, background sounds and/or music, and have minimal text to read along or listen to.   The way a story goes in most VNs, is that you make choices, and based off that, the story can change and even the ending can change.  An example would be that if you were told to not be rude in leaving someone without saying good bye, then doing it again, will lead to the character to think negatively of you.   For more explanation, just google it and read.\n\n\nGame Mechanics\nThis is a visual novel, so there are no mechanics per se, however, there are the usual VN controls such as game saves, HUD remover (for screenshots), and basic audio adjusters.  Overall, they work as any normal VN should, however, I wish that the ability to 'go back' would be more than just viewing a list of what was said, but rather it take you back to the scene itself.\n\n\n\nSounds/Music\nVery much like how a VN is in terms of music style.   Each princess seems to have their own theme, and there are various themes for whatever the occasion is.   Its very enjoyable to listen to, and even if you forget who the person is, you can possibly remember them based off their song, or atleast get a feel for how they are, based off their song.  The sounds used in certain scenes are fitting, like sword clashes when there was a fencing match, or footsteps when someone was approaching from behind.   It might not be much, but its those little touches that give it the extra boost of enjoyment.\n\n\nExtras\nThere are cards, and thus backgrounds, emoticons, and badges.  All of which are nice, simple and look great\n\n\nOverall\nThis is a very enjoyable VN that is great to play.   The visuals are amazing, the sounds are amazing, and the story is amazing.   With all of that said there is one minor issue that should be taken into account, but not as a deal-breaker.   The creators are Chinese, and english was not their primary language.  With that said, there are various grammar issues and awkward wording.  Oddly enough, spelling seems to be fine but the grammar needs some work and there are various typos as well.   They mentioned that they currently have someone working on better translations, which might take some time since there is a LOT of text to go through, but in good time, they plan on having an update that address most, if not all, of the issues.   I recommend this to those who like visual novels, or those who simply like novels that have hints of romance but have not done a visual novel before.","December 19, 2014","true","10.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

So it was no surprise when Oblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana caught my eye and appeared to be one that would fall into this category.\n\nIronically enough I was able to secure a copy from the Christmas contest and as such I am now able to play it. This game review will focus on my first playthrough and will only reflect such until further playthroughs commence and conclude.\n\nUpon starting the game up you are greeted with the beautifully crafted intro (if you have not visited the store page, it is the first video playable) which resembles in a lot of ways your traditional anime series opening by going through different poses and scenes of the characters you will meet throughtout the story. The selection of music was equally pleasant as it accompanied the opening in terms of emotion and ambience well. My only slight complaint is that there are numerous statements and phrases that appear but lack any sort of subtitling, this would be fine other than a large amount of the Steam community has English as a first or even second language and could steer them away from being interested in the game due to language barriers.\n\nOnce you enter the game you are greeted by your text/message box where all speech and events are conveyed throughout the story, this doesn't change but does have a nice gothic/Victorian design to it rather than a plain old box. The enviroment is displayed to you on static but well drawn and designed backgrounds reflecting different settings and scenarios from starry nights, vast corridors, and luscious garden floral. Certain events and actions throughout the story even trigger ambient sounds that accompany the scenario such as woodland noises in the forest. Music is also played throughout most if not all the scenes (which consists of classical themed pieces) which aids in immersion regarding the mood of scenes or characters. One of my favorites treats though I know some prefer not to is the inclusion of the voice acting for certain characters, which can help immerse the player even further if they enjoy such a feature. A more than slight downside however is the numerous grammatical/spelling which are very apparent throughout, despite being a heavily Chinese produced VN this could use touching up.\n\n\n\nWARNING - MILD SPOILERS PAST THIS POINT:\n\n\n\n\nWhile the intention of this review is not to include spoilers I will speak a bit on the story. You play as a famous war general known for his military expertise and glory acquired through many victories. This doesn't last long however as everything is ripped away from him and he is thrown into despair. Years later he is given the opportunity to redeem himself and his honor by assisting his countrie's Emperor by visiting the lustrous Oblivious Garden and interacting with the inhabitants, the noble princesses, in order to successfully carry out the "Miracle Play". Once there you start to learn what the garden is truly like from the inside and your choices will shape your path from there on. Regarding my playthrough there were times where the story didn't seem to flow smoothly and scene transitions were somewhat awkward. I am unsure if this on purpose, in part due to my choices/path, or if it was due to a lack of understanding.\n\n\n\n\nEND MILD SPOILERS\n\n\n\nIn the end Oblivious Garden ~Carmina Burana seems to fall into the category of a pleasant Visual Novel with its decent amount of flaws but by no means something that can't be fixed and addressed given some time and effort. Upon letting yourself get immersed in the characters, story, and music you will be able to experience a emotional ride that will occupy roughly just short of two hours length of your time (again, this was my one playthrough). Whether you are a fan of these sorts of games or even someone new to such a thing I would recommend researching and exploring it a bit to see if it is the sort of story that would peak your interest. As mentioned before though if the problems listed earlier are too much of a deal breaker it would be wise to wait for a later patch/release build.","December 27, 2014","true","20.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

Some full routes, and some partial routes are perfectly readable, but then you reach sections that seems like they were never reviewed by a native english speaker. Which is really a shame because the character storylines and themes are quite iteresting and fairly atypical for the genre. The story touches on the horrors of war, redemption, on Gods and magic, the lives of these princesses trapped in their beautiful cage. There are a good number of achievements to collect as well. Overall I do still recommend playing, but do not make this your first Visual Novel. And wait until you get a good discount, it's only reasonable thanks to the unfinished nature of the writing.","March 20","true","12.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I have played the game thoroughly and, for the most part, it is properly translated. It starts to get iffy toward the end but it's bearable.\n\nI think many players may be confusing translation with 1st and 3rd person writing. In this game, it switches between both and the only indication is the lack of a name for the speaker. This applies to Irell as well as the Princesses so it can get confusing rather quickly.\n\nThe writting format is pretty basic but enough to get descriptions and thoughts across. There's a heavy focus on how Irell Reis feels about every little thing. Some dialogue gets repeated despite already encountering it based on who you are following, ect. Probably about half of the dialogue boxes should be merged together or removed entirely to reduce redunancy.\n\nThe game would do a lot better overall just by enhancing the dialogue to make it more relevant. It would also be more believable and immersive if the vocabulary wasn't juvenile and overused; ex: "cute", "plebian" and nobility titles. I would like to see the game revised this way in the future, or have their next game written more eloquently.\n\nSome of the voices sound like they were recorded at a low quality. Personally, I listen to the first few lines of a character and then turn it off. Most of them sound identical aside from tone. I enjoy imagining their voices on my own, with or without the tone implied by the creator.\n\nIt's very difficult to know who you've picked to follow or how to continue to properly follow them without a lot of trial-and-error, unless you use one of the player made guides. There's a few on Steam that work well. I recommend using the Story Line portions first. After that, you can replay the game to get any of the Achievements missed. Holding the space bar down will rush through all of the dialogue. It should only take a few minutes to get them this way so definitely enjoy the story line first.\n\nMost of what you read is based on original lore and backstory for the characters. Once you've triggered an ending there is a -lot- of reading. You will need to get every ending to learn every characters story as only a few interact per play through. Also, keep in mind that not all of the character stories are updated at the same time.\n\nEach ending varies in length. One of them was a good 3 hours of reading after the choices ran out. I didn't expect this as it was my first playthrough so it quickly became a case of "when is this going to end?" for 2 of those 3 hours. If you like plot twists, and the ones in this game can get ridiculous, as well as learning about characters then it will keep you playing until the end. Fair warning, it gets ridiculous.\n\nThe artwork, for some of the characters, was very well done. I would have liked to have seen more stills of events, especially during major scenes and Dyanna's finale. It would have made the bloated dialogue more bearable and the story more immersive overall.\n\nThe UI needs some work. All of the options in the menu takes a little bit longer than normal to load and usually feels like the game hasn't registered the request. By the time I move the mouse over and click the option a second time it loads. The Quick Save & Quick Load options are not explained. You can only manually save or load during dialogue where it is listed to the right.\n\n[Having now completed the game, I will say that overall it has a low quality plotline from character to character. Personality preference will determine how much you enjoy the game. If you get bored with a character, I recommend either holding space bar and finishing to get the achievements or drop them entirely and move on to someone else.]\n\n\nIt's worth it at 50% off, plus free DLC.\n6.5/10 could be a potential 8/10 as a VN with polishing I recommended.","July 22, 2015","true","10.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/palasvuash/recommended/323490/","palasvuash","Palas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/palasvuash/","66 products in account","It may be just that I want to like this VN so much. First and foremost: yes, the translation is terrible. You can read the mandarin behind the poorly-phrased English words and sometimes the amount of words on screen doesn't quite match the amount of speech you hear - even I, someone who barely has his 你好 and 我爱你 in check, can spot the discrepancies. However, the dev has already stated that it's being revised by native English speakers. Well, sure, the cultural barrier is as big as the language one - since the Chinese imagetic references are so different from ours, most metaphors and comparisons come across as really, really weird. So perhaps not a million revisions could make the text accessible without stripping it away from its, if I should call it this, original spirit. To the point it was impossible for me to read it without a continuous mental exercise of comprehension and abstraction. It's a distant read, that much I can tell.\n\nSo my analysis of the story and the characters is forever tainted. This cultural and lexical veil between the reader and the VN will probably make you feel weird, never at ease. You never really know if you are doing the right thing, you know? So it's a little bit tiring to read Oblivious Garden. The characters are interesting even then, and the protagonist, Irrell Reis, has a solid backstory without having too unique a personality, meaning you at least won't feel disconnected from him.\n\nHaving said this, the VN's structure is not unlike what you'd find in old VNs. It's not a sim, but you do have map movement and you do go to places only to talk to the girl you want to know more about. I have the feeling the VN is a little on the unforgiving side as anything but always choosing the same girl will seemingly give you a bad end. Once you are in someone's route, there are no choices though. I shouldn't tell you this, since the story keeps on making you doubt you're doing anything right, but it's pretty much an auto-pilot if you managed not to be expelled from the garden on a particular day (12/05, if my memory doesn't fail me). There is a tea-brewing minigame, whose effect on the story is unknown to me, which is absolutely arbitrary and demands a guide unless you can afford to be frustrated a lot of times, since you are given no clue whatsoever as to how to succeed at it. Unless you're Chinese, I suppose? Who knows. Anyway, there's a guide at Steam, so use it. Collecting recipes and getting new ingredients is a satisfactory experience and you can evolve across multiple playthroughs, so don't worry about achieving max level in your first attempt. Once you clear a route you can even play the minigame separately.\n\nNow, the story is interesting even if you have a hard time understanding all of it. There's this storytelling technique, you know. Present your protagonist to the player, then sever all said protagonist's ties with his current life and throw him in a faraway, self-contained world. Katawa Shoujo does this and and so does Saya no Uta (in a different way). It's an effective way to put you in the protagonist's shoes, as everything that is new to him is also new to you. The Oblivious Garden is actually a dreamlike place (unsurprisingly, a garden) and everything about it feels cozy even if you read it in the original language. The art does a great job at establishing this place. If not technically incredible, it is vivid and colourful. The interface, which also resembles something you'd see in True Love or Season of Sakura, albeit more polished, blends well with the environment and only helps.\n\nAnd what about the OST? Now, that is a masterpiece. I wish I could link a piece or two, but I couldn't find them. Not with the Latin alphabet anyway. But trust me - the OST is incredible. There are few songs, but each one of them is special and makes the Oblivious Garden feel special. It comprises violins, rapid-fire piano (akin to the one you can hear in the OP and the PVs), acoustic guitar and flutes in excellent blends. Very, very pleasant.\n\n\n\n\nSadly, the same can't be said for the voice acting. Its recording, specifically. It's as though as they'd recorded it all with a cell phone. So it's a little off-putting. Once again, I don't know how much blame can be put on Mandarin being an unusual language for me to listen to, but I pretty damn sure know when there's an awful lot of noise coming with the voice.\n\nSo here's why I actually recommend it to you: it has a unique feeling. I know I liked a VN when it has a unique feeling. Even if not for the story, just its atmosphere is worth it. And the text will be patched, so here's hope that it will become a more complete experience soon.","December 28, 2014","true","14.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","1"

Unlike other visual novels which are either a complete comedy, or a VN with a total tragic story, this VN contains both kinds endings, the bad and the good endings are completely opposing and are in 2 different extremities.\n\n\nThe story involves a man named Irell Reis as the protagonist, he had been fighting for his empire during several years and had always won, but lost an important war. After this, his title of duke was removed and he was expelled for a duration of 3 years before entering this 'oblivious garden'. There are in total 7 princesses, the story goes over 3 of the princesesses and a maid who is working in this garden.\n\n\nWith Lin, you will find her second ''spirit'' inside her body and will find their relationship together with the emperor, you will meet the emperor in the end, most moving one for me ^.^.\n\nWith Dyanna, you will discover her forgotten memories which took place 1000 years ago and will also confront the emperor in the end but for another reason, this route is probably the longest.\n\nWith Leira, you will know her own history as well as her families, and will still meet the emperor in the end. This route contains a good and a bad ending, with ''almost'' no supernatural content involved.\n\nWith Finn, the maid, you will find out how she is related to Lin as well as many kinds of difficulties that she was forced to face, the emperor will be waiting for you in the ending just like the 3 previous routes. This route is the shortest.\n\nDepending on your choices, these stories can go differently, every route has it's specialities, some of them contains both positive and negative endings, but most of them ends happily, there are also some extra bad endings that will occur if you change the choices of routes for each characters too many times. I won't go further in since you can find more details in the strategy guide.\n\n\nFrom the perspective of comedies such as nekopara or sakura series, this VN contains less whimsical or funny content, the story of Oblivious Garden is rather serious but more touching and beautiful. If you are to find the funniest route which possesses the most jokes, I will suggest you to try Leira's route, the dialogue between Irell and Leira are not too friendly (no bad words) but sometimes funny ( since Leira is a tsundere x) ). Leira and Lin are my personally favourite characters, I started with Lin's route at first when I began to go through this visual novel.\n\n\nTo the graphics I found this game a bit inferior than the other VNs, but it doesn't matter a lot to me, the most important point is the story. I have to admit that the soundtrack of this game is really nice, just lacking a bit of horror musics. There are Opening, Identical Conflict which I've fallen in love with for example. I would rather recommend the music fans among the VN fans to buy it's original soundtrack if you like this game. (I didn't forget about the translation issues, for me, it was fine because I had played entirely in chinese, sorry for not giving an opinion on it).\n\n\nPositive remarks +\n+nice storyline, very touching\n+multi-endings\n+nice soundtracks\n+characters in huge contrasts in terms of personalities\n+additional content from dlc white day and memories\n+graphics of the images in the album are well made\n+fantasy content making the story even more exciting and more interesting\n+nice background images\n\nNegative remarks -\n-graphics not very well made in general\n-(little issue) lack of horror background soundtracks which can create an atmosphere of fear in some moments\n\n\n遺忘庭園是一本中國式視覺小說, 其中包含著許多各種不同的結局。不同於其他以喜劇,鬧劇或是以悲劇收場的VN,這本小說不僅包含快樂和悲傷結局,比起另一本巨作’’刻痕’’以14種不同的結局所呈現的悲傷場面,遺忘庭園把好的和壞的結局以兩種不同的極端予以呈現。\n\n故事裡敘述著一名叫做艾爾‧里斯的男子的生平經歷,從一名連戰皆捷的將軍,由於在一次重要的戰役中被敵方用巫術暗算而慘敗,轉變為一名不僅被剝奪了爵位,而且被放逐了四年的’’叛徒’’。三年後,經過皇帝的傳昭,進入了遺忘庭園並成為了七位公主的劍術導師兼神積劇主演。故事內容包含了其中的三位公主,以及另外一名在遺忘庭園服務的女僕主管。\n\n\n如果玩家選擇了冷湛凝(琳)的故事線,便會在故事中發現琳的第二人格以及他們與皇帝的關係,玩家將會在最後的戰鬥前遇見皇帝。\n\n如果玩家選擇了狄安娜的故事線,將會逐漸地找出狄安娜在1000年前所遭遇的慘烈戰役及眾神分裂的前因後果,在最後關頭遇上皇帝並與其決一死戰。個人覺得這條故事線是四條線中最長,也是最令人感動的一條線。\n\n如果玩家選擇了萊拉的故事線,就會逐漸發掘出萊拉自己的來歷和其王族所遭遇的一連串事件,在故事結束前也會遇到皇帝。這條線有一個好結局和一個壞結局,是唯一一條幾乎沒有任何與’’魔法’’相關的內容。\n\n如果玩家選擇了菲茵的故事線,那就會看到菲茵和琳之間的關係,亦會發現其被皇帝虐待的事實和來龍去脈,和其他故事線一樣,皇帝仍然會在最後關頭出現。此線為所有故事線中最短的。\n\n視乎玩家的選擇而定,這些故事會分出多條故事內容,每一條線都有他們的特點和必玩之處,其中有些悲慘的結局,但大部分都是好的。玩家也可以在一直選不同角色線的情況下遇上一,兩個壞結局。就這樣,剩下的請玩家自行發掘,選擇的方法的話,攻略裡都有寫。\n\n\n相較於像nekopara或sakura系列以鬧劇為主題的視覺小說,遺忘庭園比較正經,也比較動人。如果玩家想問出最會讓人笑的故事線的話,個人會回答萊拉線,其故事線不但描寫出了主角艾爾和萊拉在一開始所擁有的不愉快的回憶,同時也包含了許多惡搞人的笑話。個人最喜歡萊拉和琳的個性,也是從琳的故事線開始閱覽這本視覺小說的。\n\n\n個人認為此小說的畫風,比起其他視覺小說品質稍微低下了一點點,不過這並不是大問題,視覺小說的重點是故事的內容而不是其畫風的素質(只要別太差就好)。此視覺小說擁有動聽的背景音樂,個人最喜歡所有背景音樂中兩首:’’開場’’和’’永恆衝突’’。不過,個人認為稍微缺少了點令人聽了毛骨悚然的恐怖音樂算是一處可惜的地方。個人推薦此小說的原聲大碟給所有的VN音樂粉絲,尤其是此遊戲的愛好者。\n\n\n優點 +\n+動人的故事\n+多結局\n+令人賞心悅目的原聲大碟\n+每個角色都擁有著完全不同的個性\n+White Day和Memories的額外故事情節\n+精美的album圖畫\n+超自然(魔法)內容將故事描寫得更加熱血及引人注目\n+美麗的背景圖畫\n\n缺點 –\n-遊戲中的人物(對話時的)畫風不是非常好\n-缺少了點以恐怖為主題的音樂,減少了氣氛所帶來的效果","October 1, 2015","true","20.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Genuinely art and music steps up aswell making whole play entirely a pleasure to read and feel just like with good book, and thats really hard to accomplish by any indie VN.\n\nComing to playthrough it is relatively easy. And it is first problem with the game  for e.g. We shouldnt know in advance where we meet who during day since it is not explained by plot. Simillar problem appears with voice acting. Our heroines sometimes say more than it is translated in chat box. Thankfully it was rather one time accident from the game and you can be calm about that. For the most part you will catch the drift. Translation is just "good enough" to not cut the essence of the experience.\n\nWhat more can I say to sum this up. Well at this point I played quite a lot story based games released on Steam. This VN has something special. It is "maturity" and stable atmosphere which is not easily fading away during the game. Around 8-9 hours is needed to complete 1 of the 4 routes I believe, also there is very fun tea brewing mini game.\nPS: OST Conflict by Xiaozhi is pure pleasure for any violin fans.","March 31","true","20.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It took me a while to get into this game because I thought that the monologues of the main character were far too long and detailed. I played Dyanna's route first and after i completed that route, I was hooked and I went for the other endings as well. But before I finally played through the first path, I had some frustrations. I thought the part that you get to make choices was unbalanced compared to the duration of the whole story. Which means that a large part of the story, I was just watching with nothing more to do. Personally I would have liked more influence later on as well. I enjoyed the three paths from Dyanna, Leira and Lin. They had great character development going on for all the three females. The main character itself... well not so much. All three routes were about the same for him except with a different love interest. I felt they could have done more with that. I didn't like Finn's route. I could tell that this was added later on. The route was way too short and the character development felt rushed. I did love playing Finn's tea mini game and unlocking all the different teas.","December 24, 2015","true","20.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

All the characters are greatly detailed in both story and art. The stories take such unexpected turns that it impresses me how amazing they made the stories. It left me on the edge of my seat wanting more and was definetly worth the money I paid. The only concern I have is how the game mentions a sequel which I cant wait for.","October 13, 2015","true","20.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The characters are well made and distinguished, however what I felt lacking was the plot. The supposed closure in the endings ddn't feel well rounded. It was more like a tease to a sequel which I do not even know is in the works or not. For me, it would have been really great perhaps if the main character sacrificed himself for the freedom of all the princesses and maids spanning from a certain circumstance, at least that would have gave meaning for his time there, and the whole antonment for the lost souls thing. Overall though, soundrrack and character along with the routes work well enough for a fairly enjoyable story. Lots of room for improvement but considering this is an indie, it is very well made. I give it a total of 7/10, it is worth your time if you are willing to indulge yourself in the story and the characters emotions.","October 30, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
