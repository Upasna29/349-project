After playing this game and a few others from an Indie Royale bundle I'd say these games are definitely worth it. There's a couple of 7 Wonders games but this particular one is a lot better looking visually than the others and there are a lot of minigames in between the main 'match 3' puzzle style. I'd even go so far to say that this game rivals Bejeweled and other games of this type.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/naogilles/recommended/223000/","naogilles","Nao 尚","http://steamcommunity.com/id/naogilles/","1700 products in account","Quick summary: if you play casually in the easiest mode and do not care for achievement hunting, this is a FUN little game. Otherwise, be prepared to spend an awful LOT of time redoing some of those long levels!\n\nThese days I've been playing a lot of little match-3 games because they're quick to play and this prevents me from having to choose what 'big' game I'll be playing next, ah ah. I spent 200+ hours on Witcher 3 on GOG, so I come to Steam for shorter game sessions, out of habit. I'm giving this one a negative recommendation but a positive review, because if you're like me you tend to read negative reviews mostly and prefer to see well weighed opinions that will focus on the negative issues but still encourage you to try out the game if they don't bother you.\n\nOut of everything I've played these last few weeks (Heroes of Hellen, Bejeweled, Montezuma, Luxor and a couple others), this is on par with Hellen in terms of complexity (although not as interesting), and much worse when it comes to readability. I think this is very important in a game, and if I fail some boards because some of the rules weren't properly explained, or because the rich graphics hurt your eyes (for instance, good luck trying to determine if that special tile needs brown, red or orange matches!), I tend to be unhappy and give up. The problem is that it gets excruciatingly long to finish a single board after the first few tutorialesque wonders. Indeed, after a while your levels will consist of 5 things you'll have to do and be careful about (1) destroy all tiles behind the gems by having them in a match, (2) destroy metal tiles twice, (3) collect up to 5 different resources from special gems (which will take the most effort to do, and don't even try to forget a single one if you don't want to waste more time!), (4) be careful with the board layout, as it often gets convoluted and forces you to use destructive powers in a few places, and (4) do a specific color match on two specific tiles (later in the game, the 'singled out' power-up will help you with those, but by the time you get it, you probably won't need it anymore.) And finally, (5), after you clear a board's tiles, a special gem drops that you must guide to the bottom of the board to finish it. At that point it's time to make sure you gathered all resources, and then use the Column power-up that will save you a lot of time.\n\nI've just finished the main game after about 10 hours, and I'd estimate the latter half of the game has levels that would take more than 10 minutes to finish without power-ups, and you never have that time if you're playing in normal mode, so you'll have to use power-ups on a regular basis (thankfully, some of them like the slime monster recharge very quickly). I made a break of a few weeks between my first and second session, and totally forgot the game had power-ups, so... just don't, really, or your self-esteem will suffer. Early levels can be completed without them, but the latter half will systematically give you a shorter time than needed, and you'll have to rely on some of them regularly.\n\nI need to mention achievements. Many Steam users enjoy trying to perfect their game, and this one isn't going to be easy. You can easily get two thirds of the achievements by the time you finish the game casually, but some of them are a bit unfair. For instance, there's an achievement you can only get when you finish it in normal mode *and* do not fail a single board. If you do fail one (and it will happen if you don't use power-ups regularly and watch their recharge status), you need to restart the current wonder from the start to ensure you get the achievement. Given that there are a minimum of 7 boards to complete before you can finish building a wonder, it means failing a board might actually force you to spend the next hour or two redoing what you previously completed successfully. This is a game that is best played in Zen mode, I imagine, and let's consider 'Normal' mode to be targeted to hardcore casuals; yes that category exists, that is, regular gamers who haven't come out of the casual closet yet. Ask your aunt what she does at night on the computer, she can give you advice.\n\nThere are also a few mini-games, some of which are fun (I like the lab one and the map parts one), but they're tied to achievements that require you to finish them all. Completing levels in 'Diamond Domino Mine' is very luck-based (you depend on a draw of items, and you have a limited number of redraws), and if you make a wrong move, there's no 'undo' button, you have to restart the level from scratch. Since that game itself isn't particularly exciting, after a while you just give up on it and the idea of perfecting your game achievements.\n\nOther aspects of the game are pleasing, but I think the other reviews mention it enough. I would like to mention the spelling, though. I'm not an English native so I'd be the last person to be a grammar Nazi, and yes I'm aware that this was developed in Russia, and yes story is just a pretext, but there are typos here and there, and if they didn't caught by the US producers, then what can I say... Shows some lack of quality control.","January 21","false","12.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

If you've had a stressful day, this can help you to unwind.\n\nIt has varying puzzles on top of the match three or more main one just to keep you that little bit more interested, and extra power ups that do cool things. You complete a “normal” game by clearing the background tiles, which creates a cornerstone which you need to drop to the bottom of the screen. You can collect “blueprints” and bonuses along the way.\n\nYou progress with your successes by constructing wonders and buildings to colonise your planet, along with some decorations. Because why not.\n\nYou get different difficulty settings which you can adjust to your play-style. Great if you want more or less of a challenge.\n\nThe graphics in the background are nice and not sore to your eye as the colours are muted but still catching.\nThe only con really, (though for some it's not,) is that you'll need to do a fair amount of grinding to complete it.

Match-three with non-square boards and special square-clearing goals. This is not a bad thing. Candy Crush is a good game. It's fun and interesting. Nothing wrong with using those ideas in a new game.\n\nThe problem is, Mumbo Jumbo just couldn't let it be fun on its own. Instead of letting the gameplay stand on its own, a good, quality casual game like most of their others are, they completely overdid the extra stuff on this one. There are several minigames (not optional) with totally different gameplay than the game you want to play when you open 7 Wonders. Each of them might be good on their own, but they're not what I want to play right now. They literally interrupt gameplay right in the middle of a level and force you to play a different game.\n\nAnd then they skinner-boxed it into oblivion. It's not enough to give you a level and challenge you to beat it. You also have to gather resources during play to complete the Wonders you are trying to build. Missed one of the special blocks? Then your level of ACHIEVEMENT will be lower. You have to collect ALL THE THINGS, and try to complete each wonder in the minimum number of levels. If you mess one up, there's no going back and trying again until you've completed the entire wonder.\n\nIn addition to collecting materials, you also have to meet other goals to get the maximum star rating for each wonder. No timeouts, get all the special boxes, etc. On top of that, you have to earn special buildings to put in your little village. AND you have to unlock all the achievements. AND you have to earn all the gold coins to buy all the decorations. AND on top of all of this, there are Steam achievements.\n\nIt's just ridiculous. The gameplay itself could be fun, but I found myself feeling like I *had* to beat X levels, I *had* to finish building this wonder, I *had* to unlock all the visual upgrades. This is no accident. It's using skinner box techniques, which is dispicable and a sign of poor and lazy design, and it's frustrating because even though I was aware of how they were tricking me into continuing to play, I still couldn't bring myself to delete the game until I had beaten it. When it was finally done, I wasn't proud, happy, excited... I was just relieved that it was finally over. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend that sort of experience to anyone.\n\nIn general, I have found Mumjo Jumbo's casual games to be enjoyable and high quality, but this one is a BIG exception. I shouldn't have to feel like I can't stop playing when I'm ready to stop. I shouldn't feel like I have to continue just because of the psychological addictiveness of earning achievements and other shiny, but useless, things. Mumjo Jumbo should be ashamed of themselves for ruining what could have been a great game with this crap, and I hope they don't try this again, or they will lose a loyal customer.","May 24, 2014","false","6.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","2"

I've never been a fan of Bejeweled...I've always found the game to be boring, but this game adds a bunch of elements to the formula, and for me, this game succeeds where Bejeweled fails; in providing clear goals as you play. This apparently is the fifth game in the series, but it's the first I've played.\n\nAs you play, you have several goals you have to keep in mind. You need to make a match of a certain colour of the colored cells, you may have to get as many resources as possible by making matches with the resources tiles and you have to breakaway the background and make a piece fall to the bottom to complete the level. It was much easier for me to stay engaged with this game as I tried to fulfill every goal on the level.\n\nThere's sort of a meta-game where you use the puzzles to build things, but it doesn't do much for me. The story is incredibly stupid, but it's un-intrusive. This is definitely a game build for touch screens, and the keyboard and mouse controls suffer for it. but the only reason you get a game like this is for the puzzles, and I found them fun.

It's been awhile since I've played this, but I think the Strategy tag on it is a little bit of a stretch. I wouldn't say there's much strategy involved at all, certainly a lot of logic and matching puzzles, and certainly a great casual game - but strategy?\n\nMaybe my problem with that tag is that I feel it shouldn't be thrown onto anything and everything that isn't an RPG, shooter, action, or sandbox game. But I digress, if you're looking for your typical puzzler with some fun music and gameplay, that can be mildly addicting for a few hours and it's easy enough to help you relax - you can't go wrong with this one. I noticed that one of the other games under the franchise carries a Beatles album reference, as well, which makes the title of the series instantly become a reference to a Beatles lyric, as well. Cute, and clever.\n\nCertainly fun, but I don't see any reason to have more than one game like this, because they're almost bound to be the exact same game over and over in a different historical context or with some light silliness thrown in. I'm tempted to say look at the various games in the series, pick one, purchase it, and call it a day - lets face it, if you've played one game like this, you've pretty much played them all. new technology and graphics can only go so far with this type of game because they've got their shtick down pretty tight.\n\nBy no means is any of that an insult.\n\nI'm almost positive I picked this up when it was on a sale or featured in a bundle of some sort, and I would probably purchase it on its own merrit if it was around half the normal asking price. If you're into games like this, a worthy buy. If you're not, then you're not reading this review, anyway.\n\nNot stellar, but not shabby either. Average, but a fun diversion for a few hours. Thanks, Mumbo.\n\n6.5/10 - Bumped from 6.0 because they made a Beatles reference and I friggin' love the Beatles. <3","October 3, 2014","true","3.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The 7 Wonders series has never been known for complex storylines and extraordinary gameplay variety, but this series continues to be one that’s easy to start playing, yet incredibly hard to put down.\n\nThe storyline in 7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover sees humans and aliens working together for the betterment of both species. Humans are providing aliens with gemstones and minerals to power their devices, while the aliens teach humans about their advanced sciences. This is a pretty peachy setup, but the story isn’t really referenced again throughout your 3-4 hours of possible play here. Instead, you’ll be thrown into the process of building a variety of Wonders all around the globe, from South America to Europe, via a fairly standard, but also incredibly fun match-three gameplay setup.\n\nEach level asks you to make matches of three or more similar symbols either vertically or horizontally in order to clear the tiles underneath. Once all of the level’s tiles have been removed, a cornerstone will appear on the board that must reach the bottom (by clearing the symbols underneath it) to actually complete the level. Depending on your choice of difficulty, your progress could be timed, but the average player should have no real challenge in finishing each level on Normal. This is especially true when taking into account the game’s many power-ups, which can appear both automatically and manually.\n\nThe most common power-ups are earned by making matches of four or five symbols at once, and they see you eliminating an entire row or column of gems from the board with a single click. Other power-ups may see you eliminating just a single tile that’s causing trouble, throwing an x symbol on the board to clear a selection of tiles and so on. You’ll be able to choose which power-ups to use by simply activating them from a menu on the left-hand side of the screen, but depending on the size of your computer monitor, these can be placed a bit too far away from the action.\n\nAs you complete stages, you’ll earn building blocks, gold bricks and more, which can be used as construction materials on the world’s many Wonders. These construction materials can be earned by making matches with special kinds of symbols while playing, so there’s more incentive to playing each level than simply dropping the cornerstone to the bottom of the screen. That being said, if you don’t collect all of the resources before activating this cornerstone, you might miss out on valuable building materials and will have to play extra match-three levels as a result. Either way, each Wonder will take anywhere from 6-10 levels to complete, depending on your skill level and patience, and you must complete these Wonders before unlocking further groups of levels to play back at the World Map. You’ll also be able to build a small town for your human and alien friends, with trees, flowers, businesses, homes, statues and more being placed on your choice of highlighted circles as you progress.\n\nThis city-building section of the game is incredibly light, but it serves as a nice change of pace from the rest of the game that could benefit from some added variety. It would be nice to see more challenges thrown into each level, other than their time limits, and the option to change the method of making matches would also be appreciated (say, by allowing us to simply click on groups of matching symbols, rather than swapping two of their locations as normal).\n\nEven so, 7 Wonders: Ancient Alien Makeover is simply an awesome match-three game that contains incredibly fluid, polished gameplay that screams of an attention to detail which so many other games lack. It may not come with all of the bells and whistles that one might expect from a modern game in the match-three genre, but it still contains everything you need for a fun afternoon (or two, or ten), which is really all we can ask for.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 4, 2014","true","5.2"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"

I've never been a fan of Bejeweled... I've always found the game to be really boring, but this game adds a bunch of elements to the formula, and for me, this game succeeds where Bejeweled fails: in providing clear goals as you play. This is apparently the fifth game in this series, but it's the first I've played.\n\nAs you play, you have several goals you have to keep in mind. You need to make a match of a certain color over the colored cells (optional), you have to get as many resources as possible by making matches with the resource tiles (optional), and you have to break away the background and make a piece fall to the bottom to complete the level. It was much easier for me to stay engaged with this game as I tried to fulfill every goal on the level.\n\nThere's sort of a meta-game where you use the puzzles to build things, but it doesn't do much for me. The story is incredibly stupid, but it's unintrusive. This is definitely a game built for touch screens, and the keyboard/mouse controls suffer a little for it. But, the only reason you get a game like this is for the puzzles, and I found them fun. The game's tutorial is complete garbage, unfortunately, and it almost prevented me from playing at all. You must read the help screens to play.\n\nI'd pick up this game if you see it cheap. There's no shortage of good casual puzzle games, and I'd buy up games like Plants vs. Zombies or Zuma's Revenge first. If you enjoy match-three games, I'd recommend this one. If you don't, you might still find something you like here.","November 4, 2013","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has nice graphics and sound that are always nice, but  what makes it stands out is the game play. They have add a lot of elements into the mach three mechanic that make the game very fun to play. During stages you have to mach blocks to clear all the ruble, then mach blocks to gather resources you can build wonders with, then bring one special piece to the bottom of the screen. Also, you have a lot a different power ups that affect the board in various ways. All this adds to the game play, you're always trying to go after an objective. The game doesn't get repetitive. There's a macro game of building the wonders, witch is nice, but not the focus. Beside all that you get some mini games too. The mini game to unlock the special powers is the most fun to do, but the orders are nice too. Overall this one of the best match three games on steam and I would recommend it to anyone.","December 2, 2013","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite having no specific resolution options it actually looks really good in fullscreen.\n\nThe game itself is pretty fun.. but can be considered somewhat easy if you just make proper use of your skills. There are higher difficulty settings but I think it's fair to say you could get by through mindlessly matching colors to fuel your most powerful skills and use those to clear the levels. Nevertheless, it doesn't get in the way of the fun.. because if anything, along with the soothing music in the background it quickly turns into a relaxing game. The game does try to fresh things up by introducing mini-games and the option to 'build' and customize your village and even though they feel fairly irrelevant, it's still nice to look at and adds to it's relaxing nature.\n\nOne minor downside that I can think of is that it doesn't have an option to view your total stats like in Bejeweled. This can be considered an unnecessary luxury, but it makes going for the achievements a bit of a guessing or counting game. However.. if you're a true achievement hunter, that should not hold you back whatsoever, derp.\n\nIf you're looking for a relaxing casual game, this game is a good match. I wouldn't buy it at full price because if it weren't for the achievements, it's longevity would be rather short.. but on a sale / discounted price, I'd say it's definitely worth it.","May 11, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
