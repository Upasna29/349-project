"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/298560/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4903 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYou've not truly felt panic until you've played Captain Forever Remix.\n\nThe radar blips as an enemy craft approaches, you recognise the colour of the pulse as that of a ship higher-leveled than your own. It's fine though, your last fight left parts of the defeated nearby, waiting to be cannibalised. You're desperately attaching lasers to fend them off and engines to propel your increasingly cumbersome frame when you spot a weakened structural piece on your broadside. You grab a section of framework undamaged by the conflict and detach the fragile piece to swap it out and everything falls to pieces. Quite literally. That lone segment was the glue keeping half your arsenal fixed to your central core and without it, most of your defenses are now spinning slowly away as the enemy gets ever closer. You have three seconds to reattach as many blocks as you can before they're upon you.\n\nYou'll have many of these moments while playing this updated version of the browser classic. Sometimes you'll die from lack of familiarity with the mechanics like the scenario described above, other times you'll underestimate an enemy and maneuver into a heavily-defended port side. Of course, there's also the chance you'll meet your end at the hand of the greatest enemy; sheer bad luck. Captain Forever expects you to love this though, as it's another in the growing trend of punishing arcade experiences played in short, frenetic bursts where you cling to life at all times. Fortunately, it works well and these roguelike elements are exactly what drives you to succeed while the permanent features keep you motivated at the times when you're less successful.\n\nFor those not familiar with Captain Forever or its ilk, this is a procedurally-generated space shooter with a heavy focus on strategic customisation mechanics. Your vessel is made of several single cells such as weapons, engines and core building blocks which can be combined in near infinite ways to produce some of the most bizarre and ill-advised spaceships. Every enemy is constructed in a similar fashion so, once defeated, they can be harvested for upgrades or replacements to damaged pieces. Very quickly you become something of a Frankenstein's monster, with arms branching off in several directions launching super-heated death rays in every which way. There's so much room for experimentation and failure as well, like inertia-affected missiles that often hit yourself as much as your foes if poorly placed. That's absolutely part of the beauty of the game though; it's like being a child again with a Lego space set totally unbound by the limits of your pocket money.\n\nThe imagery is heavily influenced by Saturday morning cartoons, with the storyline following two bored children playing pretend with a cosmic battle between them. Everything is bright neon and primary colours whilst the explosions are cartoon-like and overstated, it really suits a game that is all about exaggeration and craziness. It also serves as a visual indicator of the stats for each attachable object with graded colours displaying a rarity tier and the speed of which it flashes roughly showing how much health it has left. The blinking effect coursing through a heavily damaged spaceship can be quite distracting and panicking, but that's an intentional side effect of knowing how quickly your end could be approaching.\n\nVery recently, the developer added in a Sandbox mode which has increased the potential of the game massively. The ability to save recent spaceship setups for use in this mode rather than restarting entirely really exemplifies how Captain Forever is a fantastic game that can only improve with every update made. There's already plenty to justify buying into one more Early Access title and I would have said the same had I reviewed this before last month's update (April 2015). I don't particularly like reviewing EA games while they're still being developed, especially if doing so relies on speculating over something as intangible as potential but in this case, it's so easy to recommend Captain Forever exactly as it stands now. Any future content coming is purely icing on a very delicious cake.","May 4, 2015","true","2.9"," 58 of 64 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","58","64","8","5"

It feels just as good to destroy as it does to narrowly win.\n+Graphics: Loving those neon blocks and creative color palettes!\n+Audio: The music is good and blowing things up is satisfying.\n+UI: Beautifully minimal and efficient.\n+Roguelite: Embrace death, and do better next time. It's fun to die!\n+Genius: Why has there never been a game where you have to build in real time while fighting?\n+Charm: It's cute, and knowing it is a made up game between two kids makes it a little easier to take deaths less seriously.\n\nCons-Progression: Sometimes the balance is a bit off on kits, potentially even just because you won't get enemy parts due to blowing them all up.\n-Story: Could be slightly more engaging/structured.\n\nNeutral+/-There needs to be more! This concept could be pushed SO far!\n\n======================================\nIntroduction:Captain Forever Remix is a game that makes no pretense; it is all about the gameplay. If you like games where you get to custom build your ships, salvage enemy parts, and experiment with various designs to wreak havoc in creative ways, it is the game for you.\n\nGameplay:The most distinct feature of Captain Forever Remix is the modular ship building, much like legos, you pop on blocks and parts with various purposes. Unlike everything else, however, you do it in realtime, while any enemy could walk up and attack you. You may be fighting two enemies, kill one, and then quickly pop on the weapons or armor gained from it to kill the other.\n\nThis is a really fun, engaging, and original concept, and I'd love to see it go above and beyond this game to potential future titles or projects from the developer. It is one of those pieces that amounts to more than its individual worth in tandem with other parts, and it increases the worth of other parts, too.\n\nAt any rate, you will be kept on your toes, at times enraged, and at times filled with adrenaline while trying to hastily add to or rebuild your ship in the middle of chaos. The mechanics for momentum are quite nice, as you can use various types of boosters to propel yourself forward, turn more efficiently, or brake yourself or your turns. You could also put boosters on all sides of your ship and it can be omnidirectional.\n\nThere are a good mix of weapons present, each of them satisfying in their own way, and encounters are most of the time quick and fun. There are just a few problems, though. If you don't keep your ship very fast at turning, you can end up in perpetual spinfights, sometimes destroying all of everyone's pieces (but there being a couple left) they will eternally run away from you becasue they have 3 strong boosters sitting around. Another issue is that you can at times get ships two levels above you, that will completely wreck you, or say, when you use mines, at first it spawns in all ships that use mostly mines, and you just end up blowing each other up. Little things like that, usually easy to work around, or can be avoided if you get good, but present and slightly annoying nonetheless. All in all, it's very fun, though!\n\nGraphics:So to start with, the backgrounds used in Captain Forever Remix are beautiful, and I love the brightly colored neon blocks. The character designs are also cute and colorful, although a bit simplistic. The weapon effects are distinguishable and satisfying. The particle effects are also quite colorful and lovely. Everything is very bright, colorful, kid friendly, and looks good...and that's about all there is to say about that, really.\n\nAudio:I really like the music in Captain Forever Remix. It reminds me of Birdy Nam Nam a bit. Some more tracks definitely wouldn't hurt, though, and some of the weapon sounds are a bit loud, and can drown out other sounds.\n\nThe audio present in CFR is pretty sparse, though, so that's all I can think of to mention!\n\nConclusion:Your kids will love this. The kid in you will love this. It's happy, colorful, bright, and fun. You can't go wrong with purchasing this title. The story should take you anywhere from 5-10 hours to complete and unlock all kits. I'd like to see additional gamemodes in the future to add to the longevity, but either way, you will get your money's worth!\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 30, 2015","true","6.0"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","34","39","0","5"

Very pleasant to look at. The ships and weapons are fun to look at as well, especially considering the fact that you can build them yourself. The character portraits are nice, as well. The whole game just very, very charming.\n_Sounds great: The lasers all have the pew-pew sounds that somehow never manage to sound annoying even though you hear it all the time. The music is deffinitely a highlight as well, it's quirky and fun and really fits the rest of the game's style.\n_Is great: The game controls well with an Asteroid-like control scheme. Ships feels appropriately floaty while drifting in space and fast while zooming around at full speed. A nice variety of weapons to tailor to different playstyle. The Lego-like ship building system allows you to assemble, disassemble, and reassemble your ship at any given time. It's gratifying to salvage parts from enemies to make your ship bigger. Also, very skill-intensive as you try to destroy the enemies without damaging their parts too much (so you can claim those parts for yourself). It's can also be heart wracking to frantically replace destroyed parts of your ship while under enemy fire. Did I mention the variety of things you can unlock overtime? Like new starter kits of ships with different upgrades? It's great.\n\nCons:\n_Can take a bit to get used to: While the game controls nice and tight, the Asteroid control scheme took me a minute or two to get used to.\n_Lacks a sandbox mode: As far as I know, there's no free-build mode here. It would be nice to just infinitely build the most ridiculous ship in relative peace.\n\nIs it worth 15 bucks? Abso-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing-lutely, John. It's fun, deep, charming, and pretty.

As a matter of fact, I have yet to see any "bugs" per say, although I am sure some exist. It has a campaign that is fully functional, however I have not yet reached the higher levels of difficulty, and, of course, have not seen if the end game is yet available.\n\nThe game itself is a top down space shooter where you can (and must) destroy and loot parts from your enemies in order to keep moving up the levels toward your final destination, Pluto. The enemies are procedurally generated and therefore differ every time you start a game. I know it sounds very simple, but the real depth of this lies in your ability to attach modules to your ship on the fly and build well.... pretty much anything you can imagine. Every part you put on your ship and where you put it affects everything about it.\n\nYou will start games, win fights, and eventually lose. (most likely losing far from your goal) That's where you can make upgrades to your ship, beyond even your modules by spending "money" you earn from destroying enemies. So, even in losing you are able to earn a new beginning with "perks" for your efforts. Thus making the game hard to put down, even when it's beating you down pretty hard.\n\nThe only thing that I might criticize, and this is subjective, of course; The music and the theme can feel a bit childish. Something I easily overcame, by trying to appreciate the characters in the cartoons from my youth, and well...  the music can be turned down.\n\nThis is one of those titles that is not only extremely enjoyable to play, but I also know that these types of games have an evolutionary significance on the future of the block building games of the future. I hope to see some multiplayer versions of this someday.\n\nAs with all of my YouTube Featured games, I did purchase this title and was not provided anything by the developer for the promotion of Captain Forever Remix.\n\nPlay hard Guys and Gals!\n\nRob @DeluksGaming","March 27, 2015","true","18.7"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","28","38","4","0"

You get Captain Forever Remix! Things get hectic quickly as you construct your first ship and begin battling an onslaught of enemy ships. You must turn the tide of battle and use your enemies technology against them. Attaching the remains of your defeated foes to your own vessel. This leads to dynamic gameplay that is guaranteed to be unique each time you play. Your first ship will look nothing like your last ship. With multiple parts and new strategies developed on the fly.\nWith randomly generated enemies and permadeath. Captain Forever is a punishing game as it is fast paced. Picking and choosing your battles becomes very important. One bad move and its start over.\nWith little bugs to speak of and obvious love and attention being put into all the details of the game. The art and music are unique and fun. Captain Forever Remix is a solid title. Especially for an Early Access title.\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/p6DqbQRY3dM\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","March 28, 2015","true","2.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

An interesting hybrid, one that I feel worked out!\n\nWhen you first jump into the game you'll be able to do a quick build of your ship from an assortment of different starting kits. Each kit will have their own type of blocks, and already in it's early access form, there is a large variety of blocks and gizmos to discover and build out of. Once the ship is ready to go, you'll head out into space to do battle with other ships. If you managed to destroy the enemy, what parts they had left over you'll be able to scavenge and use for your own ship to grow it in power and performance. But be aware, this game is all real time, so you'll have to quickly attach parts, often while under enemy fire. This help keep the game feeling frantic, and multitasking skills will be tested.\n\nThe controls of the game will take some getting used to. The game has a physics system that takes into account your ship's weight, balance, and inertia. Because of this, depending on how you build your ship, it can move very sluggish, and can feel floaty. But once you get adjusted and can factor it's physics you'll be sailing the 7 galaxies in no time!\n\nThe visuals and audio is just fantastic in this game. I love the cartoon style, and the audio is great as well. Wonderful music with all the appropriate beeps and boops that you would expect.\n\nI don't have too much negatives to point out about the game so far (this is a good thing of course), but I do have a couple of suggestions. Though the game works perfectly fine as a single player game, I can also envision this game as multiplayer and imagine it to be a lot of fun! Shooting each other's parts off, building from your enemy's ships. I think the game would be well suited for it. Of course, at this time it is only single player, and I don't think there is any plans for multiplayer, but it is something I would love to see in Captain Forever Remix.\n\nOverall, Captain Forever Remix is an interesting blend of genres that looks great, plays great, and really taps into the player's creativity when constructing a ship. For an early access, the game feels very complete and polished.\n\nPros:\n- Great visual and audio design\n- Fun, creative, and challenging\n-  Accessible and easy to learn\n- Feels very complete and polished for an early access\n\nCons:\n- Could use a better options menu\n- Lacks extra features","April 6, 2015","true","4.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

All you do is use WASD to control you ship thrusters, space or RMB to shoot all lasers connected to your ship. To destroy an enemy ship you must destroy the core and this also applies to you so make sure you keep it protected, all parts that aren't destroyed when the core is destoryed is then sent into space for you to collect and apply to your ship.\n\n---Story---\nWell this game has a story but it isn't anything you'd expect nor does it seem needed at all but it's there and gives some sort of reason to play, it has some funny comments on the stages that the characters talk about but nothing more.\n\n---Building---\nThe building in this game is great! It truly matters what pieces you place and where with having to balance weight and making sure the thrusters aren't different powers otherwise it won't fly straight. A lot of detail and attention even if it is simplistic.\n\n---Conclusion---\nThe game runs well, it looks great, it plays great and in all is great fun with a lot of kits to unlock to make you keep coming back for more! I give it a 9.5/10 for being fun, unique, and just a great experience!\n\n---YouTube Video---\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0Ji8142jjc","March 27, 2015","true","1.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

However, as the stage level up anyway you transfer to higher-level parts so early parts kit will eventually be discarded later. Really it is just "early" part one ... Instead of, a module upgrade does not require the use of an initial kit and maintains at playing, I like this point.\n\nThe remix version has new parts that does not exits in the original version.\n(beam, shield, medi kit, uni booster, etc.)\nMost of them are taken from the successor version. You can operate more colorfully games thanks to the various parts.\n\n\nHowever, there are what should be improved.\n\n1. Difficult\nThe difficulty is quite high.\nIt is almost impossible to breaking through the front since Level 7 Starting.\nAlso I want to one-to-one fight with one enemy but several enemies appear around me when fight;; The real sneaky things. The more despicable thing is that they flee in all haste when they almost die...!! I don't know whether hard difficulty is planned by the developers or miss balanced.\n\n2. Ending\nIn case of the original version, as the enemy in level 11 is depeated a story of the game is over and "endless" mode continues, but the remix version don't have endless mode. I wish they update this point later.\n\n3. Additional parts\nThe remix took the additional parts from Captain Successor, but did not get the "all" part of Successor.

Just like the browser version, the game has a sandbox mode where you can slowly progress, and you can save your previous ships. In this version, There are starter kits and other features. Another huge difference is the story element. While it's not long, it adds alot of character to the game. The story is simply a brother and sister, Rollplaying together, and you get to battle through levels of opponents as they throw banter back and forth at eachother. Overall i would say that i do reccomed this game, and would give it a 8/10 due to how unique it is and the replayability to it.","October 9, 2015","true","1.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Right before this game came out on steam I heard about it- A REMAKE OF THE OLD CAPTAIN FOREVER BROWSER GAME! This caught my eye, as I played the original captain forever and I loved it. I got this game when it came out and let me tell you this, it. Is. Hard. If you thought that the original was hard then wait until you play this! Sure it is sort of cheap with a huge difficulty spike from orange to red but it is challenging, it wants to make you cry, and it makes you want to play more. If you liked the browser game (which is free and you can try right now at captainforever.com) and you want more, play this.

Even though there isn't a lot to offer, it's the kind of game you lose hours to, even just from the basic kit. The extra kits add more depth and give you even more options to play with, which are all fun and interesting.

Buy this game!\n\nEarly access stability:\n\nA few minor bugs will still pop up (but this review was written in early-early access). Some collision issues and some minor crashes but other than that totally playable and fun as s**t!\n\nStory:\n\nA very neat premise in which you play the older sister to a younger brother who went and messed up the universe. It's extremely charming and heartwarmingly 90's\n\nMechanics:\n\nThe original Captain Forever took an approach to space combat that was utterly original and dynamic. As every space-craft is centered around a fairly weak control module which, when destroyed, allows the player to remod their ship with salvage from fallen enemy ships. This means you will want to attack as much of the creamy center as possible, without doing too much damage to your enemy's hull, weapons, shields and thrusters, so that you may use these parts to become the greatest creamy center chocolate space muffin surgeon known in the solar system.\n\nIn spite of the cute child-like presentation, this game is nothing short of "Dark Souls level" hard-core. Nothing comes easy and you'll end up fighting for every piece of salvage like it's a bread-crumb in a 1930's Polish trainstation. Trying to remod your ship while frantically dodging three, if you're lucky, incoming enemies is nerverackingly fun.\n\nThe best part:\n\nThe way you choose to design your ship is as dynamic as you'll find in games like Space Engineers, and doing so is a lot less dull. Every "block (hull modules, shields, weapons, CHAINSAWS!!!!!!!!, laser beams etc) has a "mass" value which influences your ship's balance. Putting a truster or weapon slightly off center will spin your ship into fatal inertia, but after a bit of practise you will build the most bad mofo of swiss army space crafts fully equiped with lasers, sniper shots, missles, AND MODDERFORKING SPACE-CHAIN-SAWS!!!! It's rediculously fun!\n\nYou can build big and sluggish, small and agile, small and sluggish, bulky and fast like a Coventry girl trying to get a council house. Build a lopsided flying missle â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, a triangular spinning sniper craft, or a tiny little ship that can fly its way straight the middle while dodgin torpedoes, or a fat ship that can take a million punches: it's all viable, it's all fun and you'll die anyway so why even bother.\n\nLong story short:\n\nIf MineCraft scoodilypooped Asteroids (while Surgeon Simulator was ball-gagged and made to watch) you'd get a horrible game that nobody should ever play and your money would be much better spent on buying "Captain Forever Remix" twice. It's that good.","April 6, 2015","true","17.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

And that's what keeps me coming back, that adrenaline rush from carefully plotting my attack and pillaging those shields I so desperately need for the next level.\n\nA series well worth making a remix of as I fell in love with the original from the get go.  The customization just gives you such a great sense of agency in your progress.  It's all upto you and making the most of the resources available.  If you fail, it's probably your fault.\n\nIn the future I dream of features that are found in the dawn star betas, such as scrap farming and buying new loot.  More of an open world that you can discover and conquer.  But for now, this is more than sufficient to keep me procrastinating.  Go and play the original for free and if you like what you find, this is more than worth the purchase.","April 2","true","62.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Controls are great and rely heavily on how you build your ship. Your ship's destructibility also has a lot to do with how you want to build your ship. For example; if you're having issues with your thursters getting shot off by enemies, learn to place them in better spots.\n\nLots of replay value as every playthrough will be different.\n\nLots of parts, so you can many hundreds, if not thousands, of different ships.\n\nThe only qualm I have is that $16.99[Canadian dollar] is a bit steep of a price. I'm not saying this game isn't worth the money, but I think somewhere between $10 and $15 would be more reasonable.","October 6, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is incredibly well executed, from the starting kits (loadouts) to the detailed physics.\n\nYou will probably find yourself wanting to make a nice symmetrical craft that flies in a straight line. This won't happen. Just bolt everything together and make sure you're not shooting off parts of your own ship!\n\nFlying wonky? Pull off an engine and put it somewhere else. Being chased?

I get that it still is in early access, but the general concept of this game wont make it work out any better. It's barely any fun replaying this game after having seen every weapon once. There aren't many, and even if there were a lot more, they don't motivate to build any real ship. Simple designs triumph rly badly over the more complex ones, since you have to rebuild your ship every minute and you don't have a lot of time to do so.

The combat isn't very exciting. It's just "Shoot until the enemy's defenses target you, then move a bit to the side" Some might think that the combat has some hidden depth in it, but I have not found such a thing.\n\nEvery time an enemy approaches you, they will say something, such as "Your ship is junk" and "Stop hitting yourself." I get that it was designed to be simplistic and stupid because of how the game is two kids playing a made up game, but even then, I feel they could've tried to make the enemies a bit more interesting.\n\nWhen you destroy an enemy ship, they will drop their parts, BUT however much damage you did to that part during the fight, is how much damage it took when you equip it. Sometimes, all of the good parts of a ship are on the outside, so those better parts will be horribly damaged, or broken when acquired.\n\n\nYes, I understand that the game is in early access, and that many things will change in the future, but for now, I have lost intrest.\n\nI AM NOT SAYING THIS IS A BAD GAME. NO. Other people might love the parts that I dislike, as they might enjoy these types of games. I think the game might have some potential, so if you disagree, please, buy the game. If you agree with the things I dislike, I would reccommend waiting for the game to become more complete (Not in Early Access)","July 7, 2015","false","0.3"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","21","44","0","1"

Building your own space ship, blowing up other spaceships and then using their parts to add onto your own ship sounds like a really cool idea to me, but I struggled to get into the actual game play mechanics.\n\nThere is next to no tutorial to explain what all the different building blocks of ship you get actually do, although most can be quiet self explanatory, it was hard at first to actually be able to build a ship that would move correctly. I found myself a times not being able to move around at all because I couldn't work out how to place the boosters on my ship to get enough power, but maybe that is just me being stupid.\n\nI did like the feature where you can unlock differen "starter packs", which are essentialy the first set of space ship parts you get at the start of each game, obviously as you progress, the better these starter packs are.  I also enjoyed the art style here, some really nicely drawn 2d characters too.\n\nI have to say, building the ships and making them look awesome is a really satisfying aspect, sadly though for me the gameplay didn't quite hit the marker I was expecting.  Thankfully the game is still in Early Access so I expect alot of these issues to be ironed out before the full release, I'll definately be keeping an eye on CFR, but for right now, I can't really recommend this title.\n\nCheck out more reviews on http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/","April 21, 2015","false","1.9"," 16 of 54 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","16","54","2","9"

All the LPs I watched and just the buzz around it was phenominal.  When I actually purchased the game, I didn't regret it at all.  After playing it for a few hours, however, I've noticed that the game has a very weird spike in difficulty around the 3rd and 4th world.  Every time I reach these stages I'm always out classed in terms of hardware. Either that, or, when I finnaly find an enemy I can kill to upgrade my ship to match the objective, one or two ships 1-2 levels higher than me suddenly appear and wreck my â¥â¥â¥.  I acknowledge that most of this is probably poor play, and I greatly enjoy the difficulty, but it has begun to become monotonous farming forever trying to match the ship level I need to proceed.\n\nStill love the game, and I really look forward to playing it some more.","April 7, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Which is funny, cause I donÂ´t even like space shooters in general. However, Captain ForeverÂ´s charm is undeniable and it conquered me by making each and every encounter an strategic bout of very different ships trying to outmanouver and corner each other. There are a lot of different weapons and ways to customize your ship. Really, I give this game my wholehearted reccomendation.

Nope. Literally, I mean you just build your ship, get destroyed and start all over again. It's just not fun. It get's boring after 3-4 tries. I understand this game is in development, but I'd also understood if it was like 3-5euros. If the game could have many more features, then it would be worth the money.
