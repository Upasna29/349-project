By adding very helpful information around the airport, being entertainning with the animations, and having at least a chuckle with Buzzy the Knowledge Bug, this is a great game!  The "Time to Play" section is always giving children a little fun espically "Lost Luggage" which is a fun game where you have to get all of the luggage to drop into it's matching bin.  Each level introduces something new like red convayer belts that can't be changed by clicking on them, teleporters that drop the luggage to a random bin, or chutes that make the luggage go really fast!  Though the first levels are simple and easy to beat, just wait until you get to level 99!","November 26, 2015","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
