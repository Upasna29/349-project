This is similar to a lot of the Big Fish games.  I bought it hoping there would be some puzzles to work with, but there are very few puzzles, if they can be called that.\n\nI finished the first of 5 treasures within an hour, so I imagine the whole game will only take a few hours.  Some of the things that make the objects difficult are the scenes/colors of the object and knowing what their definition of the object is.  The trailer shows two of the "puzzles," so if you do not want to get the answers spoiled, don't watch it!! Hopefully you read the comment before watching the video.\n\nThe voice acting could be much better.  Unfortunately, there are weird pauses and it seems like the voice actors were just reading off the page and not so much acting.\n\nIf you like the hidden object genre and don't care too much for the puzzles, this is a pretty good buy currently at $1.25.\n\nNote: I was playing on a touch screen, I didn't realize that if you hover the mouse around the scene, some objects will show a cog that you need to interact with and make this a lot easier.","May 13, 2014","true","1.8"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dronak/recommended/281240/","dronak","Dronak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dronak/","2192 products in account","This is a generally fun adventure game, where you have to find hidden objects in various scenes to progress through the story.  It's about a treasure hunt for five different treasures, and each has about 5 or 6 locations you visit.  The game doesn't involve much more than finding the hidden objects, but often some objects requiring additional actions to be performed before you can locate them.  This can mean brushing away dust, breaking things open, or lighting things on fire to clear them.  There are also at least a few puzzles to solve along the way, and a special unnamed geocahce item in each location.  If you get stuck, there's more of a cheat system than a hint system -- an object finder will locate things for you (with a cool-down period after each use) as long as they're visible and don't require additional actions before you can access them, and I don't think it works on geocaches.  I would have liked a hint system I could use first, that would, for example, show an outline of the object so I knew what I was looking for, because some objects are ambiguous (e.g., "fan" -- is that a folding paper one or an electric one?).  The overall difficulty of finding the hidden objects isn't too high, so you shouldn't get stuck for too long, and there's always the item finder.  In terms of replay value, there is some but not a lot.  After initially clearing each scene, they game will hide another set of objects in it for you to find.  So you can go back to clear the locations 100%, either as a second run from start to finish or in each scene as you go along.  But once you finish the story, there isn't much left.  The geocaches you find are all put into a room where you can see them, like a trophy case.  Unfortunately, that's all it is.  I was hoping for more information about the items or history or something once the geocaches were found and stored, but that's not the case.  The story is nice and develops as you find each treasure, so it helps keep the game moving along.  Overall, it was an enjoyable way to spend ~5 hours (and I did all locations twice, to 100% clear them), and I'd recommend the game to those who like these types of point-and-click find-the-hidden-object games.","November 30, 2014","true","5.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Here, Susan is contacted by a mysterious man that will trigger a trip all around the world.\n\nAdventure Chronicles is belonging to what I call the early era of hidden objects games, in other words, where you're cleaning scenes by finding items on a list. So don't expect a game where you're roaming around and solving puzzles. However, the game adds some elements like items you need to dust/find in broken containers/behind burnable stuff. In other words, you'll have a lighter, an hammer and a brush to help you. Other items will need specific ones that will be used only in the scene. There is also a "geocache" object to discover, with a riddle describing it.\n\nWhile the game can be finished quickly, if you want a 100%, you're free to come back a second time in the scenes to find another list. It's a nice way to invite you to play it completely.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that some objects are little in size or so well hidden that you can't see them without a proper orientation of your screen. This is the main problem with these games from the first era and Adventure Chronicles doesn't escape from that.\n\nThe backgrounds are correct and the soundtrack is also nice.\n\nThat said, Adventure Chronicles, while I love it as I've played a retail version of it years ago, right now, in 2015, should mainly enjoy the hardcore fans - as the genre headed towards an adventure oriented mechanics and that new fans will be probably disappointed and be bored quickly.","December 24, 2015","true","4.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

I like the overall concept -- an Indiana Jones style trek across the globe in search of historic lost treasures. The music is nice, and the nerdy middle-aged female protaganist is an interesting character. Unfortunately there isn't much to the gameplay besides the hidden object scenes, and they are poorly done. Many of the scenes are low-res, dark, and muddy, and I could not see half of the hidden objects even when the item finder was hovering right on top of them. In fact without frequent use of the finder I would not have been able to complete the game at all, and to me it is a mark of a bad game when its core mechanic (in this case finding hidden objects) is broken. So although I appreciate what this game was trying to do, I must regretfully give it thumbs down.","July 15, 2015","false","4.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It actually is ruining the good standing of Hidden Object Games and Casual Games in general.\n\nValue for Money: LOW 4,99  The game is too expensive, given the age and the style of the game there are a lot more Hidden Object Games that offer a lot more and are not as expensive.\n\nNot Recommended\nThis game actually isn't recommendable in it's given state. Outdated Graphics, a superficial and anticlimatic Story, crunchy Sounds and the clickfest feel of the game make it a bad investment, avoided at all cost. I like old games, if they are good, there are a lot of older classics like 7thGuest and Phantasmagoria that are still actually worth playing, although the graphics are... clunky. But with this game?

Mostly recommended for those who like treasure hunt stories.\n\nLong version:Adventure Chronicles– the sequel of Escape the Museum– is the type of game that is almost pure atmosphere; the whole thing is pretty much a Saturday morning treasure hunt adventure cartoon in the form of a hidden object game.\n\nA pretty mediocre hidden object game. Just like the previous title, it has a really nice variety (30 scenes) and a much better picture quality (but still low resolution) with the cost of level design: a lot of items are hidden by blending them in instead of clever placement.\n\nOn the other hand the story is pretty good (think of it as the kid-friendly version of the movie National Treasure), the voice acting is excellent, the music is catchy– but repeats a lot– and it’s just a good fun from start to finish. The game even has a nice incentive system to replay the already visited levels… bust just like Escape the Museum, it never follows it up with an additional reward for 100% completion.","December 2, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The addition of tools to help find certain items (an archaeology brush, a hammer, etc.) and some very minor inventory management added some variety.
