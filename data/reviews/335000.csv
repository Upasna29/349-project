Will you give in to your new existence of demonic incarceration, or will you find the will to journey into the pits of hell itself and find your freedom?\n\nTormentum is not a tale for the queasy, with brutal depictions of death, despair, and torture the imagery within is enough to make the average modern horror fan ♥♥♥♥ their pants in terror. The game comes from a seriously engaging and tasteful angle despite this, and everything is done in a fictionally compelling way that serves the narrative and not just for the sake of shock. The core element in Tormentum is atmosphere, and its surreal influences show to the very root.\n\nThe bleak path ahead is riddled with puzzles, mini-games and secrets keeping you just out of reach of your next step to freedom, the next diabolical room of traps and tricks and all forms of unholy devices. Each solution requires a keen eye and generally has the player glossing carefully over each hand-painted environment, which is already a real treat to behold on its own. Paying close attention to small details left across the harrowing stages leads you to discovering artifacts and symbols usually arranged in specific ways to clue you in on how to solve that specific area's solution, and take form as anything from candles being lit in specific order to create a pentagram of light across carefully arranged mirror surfaces to crudely decorated skulls that must be brought back to their rightful tortured remains.\n\nThe puzzles here are genuinely fun, as someone who generally hates them I didn't find anything in Tormentum to be tedious or long-winded. They reward those with an appreciation for the remarkable art and encourages enthusiastic exploration of the visuals surrounding the player. With many obstacles come moral choices, and many of the solutions face the player with painful decisions that weigh on your mind throughout, the betrayal of friends and murders of the seemingly innocent bringing you closer to your goal but further from humanity. The spirit of classic point and click adventure gaming is present, and you'll be completing plenty of satisfyingly simple and rewarding tasks and pushing for that next gruesome screen of beautifully detailed scenery though never without consequence.\n\nThe artwork itself is absolutely breathtaking not because it is pretty, gorgeous, or inspiring but because it is fantastically grotesque in detail. Every organic curve, every sickeningly moist surface of glistening quality and every rusted jag of blackened metal stand out with each transition of a scene, each one more jaw-dropping than the last. A brutal assault of rapid images portraying ruthlessly grim imagery, making escape the one bright glimmer of hope in our protagonist's peril. There's an unmistakable similarity to some of the most macabre and surreal artists from the organically twisted curves of Giger to the grand hellscapes of Bosch, combined with the likes of what could be straight out of a Dimmu Borgir album cover just for extra measure. And it isn't just the art; I've already caught several references to works of the surreal including the phrase "Fire Walk with Me", showing that these brilliantly demented creators have their influences set in the right place.\n\nIt's not just from these decadent and long renown artists that Tormentum draws its artistic influences from however, there are plenty of modern day touches that gamers and horror enthusiasts of every ilk will reminisce on from darkened knights dressed in twisted sets of armor akin to the foes in the Dark Souls series, to the natural feeling animations of Odin Sphere that move fluidly with every rising breath of a character or rusted movement of the cold metal environment around you. Tormentum has the makings of a classic, and if you aren't turned away by it's cruel imagery this is one ♥♥♥♥ed up trip worth taking.","March 4, 2015","true","9.4"," 85 of 91 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","85","91","2","8"

What defines human ethics? Is reason the source of morality? You should know by now that Tormentum neither answers this questions solely nor tries to do so, but stimulating the player’s mind with radical issues presented in gruesome but hand-painted actions and pictures instead of reading Kant’s essay might work better, at least for gamers. Your actions and decisions will affect your story, always leaving you behind with one question left. Did I make the right choice?\n\nIntroduction done. Don’t worry, this is not about philosophy, it is about Tormentum, a game that looks like our worst nightmares got caught and painted by H.R.Giger. Some of those bad dreams might even haunt you after the game is over but even then you just can’t stop looking at every small detail, whether it looks amusing, terrifying or violent. Speaking of terror and violence, we should take a look at Tormentum’s story. You are...well. Who are you? You are somebody,  yet no one. A poor creature wearing a capuchin, that gets imprisoned in an old, horrendous looking castle, threatened with torture and punishment for sins you cannot remember. Survival is your only thought and thus keeps your motivation alive even after having seen the suffering your new home has to offer. Prepare for morale choices that will not only affect yourself and keep that one thing in mind: Nobody is what they claims to be.\n\nWhile Tormentum does look like a classic point-and-click at first sight, it uses some hidden object influences, mixes it up and combines them with classical puzzles and riddles. These are not unbeatable since you will find many clues but expect to be fairly challenged. May it be the right time on a watch, a certain melody that needs to be played or a man-eating worm that blocks your path, you will love the variety. There is no button for highlighting things, some objects have a unique glow instead whilst others can be hard to find sometimes. Additionally, objects can neither be combined in your inventory nor used for multiple actions. This may sounds simple but it fits the idea Tormentum wants to convey. The only time this really bothered me was early on after the start where you get confronted with many different scenes and tasks. If one link is missing in the chain you get stuck forever, running through the same backgrounds multiple times. These are eyecatchers even after passing them again and again, so do not lose  your confidence, there is a clue or hint for everything.\n\nBefore listing major points, I want to take a second look at the atmosphere Tormentum creates. I can’t talk enough about the graphics, or better, art OhNoo Studio created here. There won’t be many scenes you may find peaceful or cheering though, but would you really expect that to happen when a game is called Tormentum? You will witness pain, torture and suffering, everywhere. One can only imagine how a world would look like where evil lurks everywhere and redemption seems to be the only escape, but if this world really exists I fear it would look like Tormentum. Creepy People and Creatures, a dying land, epic but disgusting monuments, fire that rains from the sky, everything brought to life or death with hand-drawn masterpieces. Whoever created the soundtrack and effects should be awarded, too. My first impression was a bit monotonous but it quickly became the perfect skin for its cadaverous body. Emotions can be heard without even knowing what happens in the current scene.\n\nBig Text, Quick Facts:\nPro:\nOustanding artwork, inspired by H.R.Giger and Others - brutal and otherworldly\nEmotional Plot with moral choices and multiple endings - mature and philosophical\nA soundtrack that captures the essence of pain and sorrow\nVarious Puzzles and Riddles offer good challenges - without interrupting the plot too much\nInteresting side stories to learn - Nobody is what he claims to be\nCon:\nEvery riddle has a hint - but finding those gets annoying sometimes since objects cannot be highlighted and some puzzles simply can’t be solved without the matching clue\nSome things will happen - no matter which choice you made\nSmall bug - using steam overlay lowers the fps while writing. Chatting and Tormentum shouldn’t be combined anyway.\nSummary:\nSeeing this game getting Greenlit made me proud and happy since I backed it on Kickstarter myself, but when it got released the two of us couldn’t match. I am not a fan of Hidden Object games and playing the first couple of minutes I felt that this was not the game I expected. My opinion changed as you might have already guessed.\n\nOnce the story gets its hands on you, luring you with choices, challenging with puzzles, playing with morality and disturbing with violence, Tormentum starts to become more than just a piece of unforgettable sound, visuals and artwork. Staring at the screen for more than 5 minutes, pondering your next decision, you will ask yourself again: What is the right choice? Whether you know Kant or not, this will affect you.\n\nVerdict: 8,5 / 10\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews","June 6, 2015","true","9.2"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","49","52","0","11"

An example ? Click here\nSCREENSHOT\n\nThere is only (Fullscreen) Option in menu, That you can toggle off and on, Even while off the game is not really windowed, Just scales lower on the screen thats all.\n\nThe Frame drop issues, This is the 2nd game on my library that I know of, That uses Adobe air.... And they're both are horrible when it comes to Fps, Note that I ran the game on both a laptop and a pc, A corei5 4gb ram gt635m nvidia 2gbvram laptop that should be more than enough to run the game, AND also a corei7 gtx 780ti Pc, And on both machines the frames drops to 20-15 most of the time, While it should be capped on 30, Was really frustrating but after playing it I KINDA got used and passed over it, But at first it will frustrate you as hell.\n\nAn issue with steam-overlay causing the game to crash. Devs fixed this already, Its nice to see them on their toes and working on it.\n\nGame Length, I wont dare say I'm disappointed in it, Just was kinda sad that I was not able to continue the story any further, I finished the game in 3 hours in the first attempt, And 1 hour and 15 minutes in the 2nd one to get the other ending.\n\nThe choices you choose are good and effects stuff, But it is not that different, Like you'd choose to give this thing to that guy, And it will lead make something else happen that will create a minor effect later, But the character will give you the same item the other character would'v given to you if you chose it.\nI just feel like they should'v made it more in-depth, Such as it gives you something else that forces you to go to another place to get the item you're looking for, and other characters that just gives you the main item ... get what i'm saying ? :|\nSo there you go, This is all I can say about this game without spoiling much, I tried to be as non-biased as possible in this game and taking it from another person's Perspective.\n\nTL:DR This game is great, It really is a wonderful adventure, A masterpiece in artwork, A Symphony in music And great excitement in gameplay, It is also about 3 hours long, But with replay-value to get other choices/achievements, And sadly has frame drops every now and then.\n\nI completely recommend this game, If you read the review and still ok with the game's length and the frame issues ( That might not happen to you if for some reason adobe air likes your pc ) Then you might want to keep this game on your list because it is definitely worth it.","March 28, 2015","true","5.6"," 61 of 71 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","61","71","0","1"

No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nInspired by HR Giger's unique biomechanical style and games such as Dark Souls and Dark Seed, Tormentum: Dark Sorrow is an extremely dark point and click adventure, diving deep into themes such as damnation, sin, and redemption. While somewhat short, Tormentum is a nearly unforgettable adventure spanning across 3 different realms. Fans of this genre may find something here that rivals other titles' quality! Let's take a closer look at what Tormentum has to offer.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nAs a point and click adventure, the game plays out entirely at your pace. Progression is limited by your ability to find hidden secrets and solve puzzles. This is done by clicking objects and areas on-screen to uncover them. Hidden objects are able to be picked up, stored on your bag, and used in other areas, typically assisting in solving puzzles presented to the player.\n\nAs you solve puzzles, you slowly gain access to more areas of the dark castle your character is being held prisoner in. Each area is it's own puzzle, so to speak, and by carefully examining each area will you piece together each puzzle. Some rooms have NPCs, which will help or hinder you, depending on certain factors. Usually they will give you an item needed to progress, in exchange for solving another, smaller puzzle or task. One NPC is a guard who gives you a shovel to dug up a piece of gold, and rewards you with a necklace that is actually a key to a door nearby--just as an example. There are many areas to explore, and many puzzles to solve!\n\nAn important aspect of the game is the Journal. It automatically keep notes on important bits of imformation you find, such as a diagram of a point of interest you find somewhere, or a crude drawing providing a clue left behind by another prisoner of the castle. This can be checked at anytime, as well as your bag where your items are kept.\n\nLastly, at certain points of the game you are presented with some moral choices, literally good or evil. Depending on your choices, you may get the good or bad ending...which is basically how your character is judged at the very end of the story. If you are aiming for a particular ending, make sure you hit all the right choices, a single mistake can change your ending entirely.\n\nGraphics\n==========\nAs mentioned before, Tormentum's unique art style is heavily inspired by games such as Dark Souls and Dark Deeds, and by famous painter and sculptor HR Giger.  Giger is credited with designing the monster simply known as the 'Alien' or Xenomorph from the classic 1979 film of the same name. Giger has a very unique style, blending biological and mechanical components together to create a unique blend of flesh and machine. This is prominently seen and featured in nearly every scene of Tormentum, and in most NPC designs. This style works very well for the setting.\n\nHand-painted stages help to blend everything together, and are a wonder to behold. Half the fun of the game is pushing onwards just to see the next area and it's art. Everything is incredibly dark and very detailed.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nFeaturing over 40 spine-tingling tracks, Tormentum has quite the soundtrack to help immerse you into the story and setting. Slow, yet hopeful tunes for the more docile scenes, with darker more evil tracks for the hellish scenes you will encounter. Nothing is amiss here, and it all comes together to create a memorable experience.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nFor this type of game, a high framerate isn't needed, which is good because Tormentum ran at an acceptable 30FPS at all times. I did not run into any bugs, random crashes, or stuttering at any point. There are very few video/audio options, but honestly they are hardly needed.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nTormentum: Dark Sorrow is an excellent point and click adventure, one you are bound to remember long after you finish it. Although short, it's filled with clever puzzles and hidden secrets. It's dark style, artwork, and soundtrack are the best features. Fans of the genre will find a very enjoyable experience with Tormentum, and anyone who isn't a fan may just be converted into one!\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjqSD2YhPOA\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","August 17, 2015","true","5.3"," 60 of 77 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","60","77","4","7"

The art is easily the linchpin of this release, those richly hellish and tortuous scenes are so morbidly captivating and visceral that one has to question the mental health of the artist. It’s not just those wide panoramic vistas that give off a sense of infernal grandeur, it’s also the attention to detail in small objects, items obscured and a wealth of visually suggestive scenery and object placement that make the art direction and presentation so incredible. Feed into that the bleak and austere soundtrack and you have an audio visual phenomenon.\nGameplay is your standard point and click adventure types, you are to find items that they may resolve other problems that hinder your progress in the game, rinse and repeat. To this end the game employs a great number of puzzles which are fairly enjoyable and not too taxing, oftentimes clues given to you on how to solve them are found in other locations. Overall the gameplay is simple and for the most part is secondary to the experience, not so much in the sense it has been neglected, but more so that it is a means to an end rather than the core of the experience.\nThe lore and story are slowly bled out to you, never providing you with too much detail, but just enough dark particulars to provide a minimalist context allowing your imagination to run wild and give a few grains of morality in weighing up your actions. NPC’s are often times minimalist in interaction, but are quite capable of reinforcing the central themes to the game and giving it greater depth. This overall vagueness reinforces the crushing sense of despair and disorientation that accompanies you in the game throughout.\nAt certain points you are presented with choices and whilst at face value they are your standard black and white good or bad dichotomy, the lack of guidance or understanding of your role in this world brings your own philosophical dilemmas into the fray. Can one kill for freedom? Is it a crime to punish the wicked? Is it my place to judge them so? Am I being lied to? Etc.\nGameplay is short, I would guess perhaps around 5 hours in total, but what an intense and rewarding 5 hours they are! Not forgetting that there is some replayability in making alternate choices in the game. However playtime is irrelevant, playing Tormentum is an experience more than a game, a quasi-philosophical interactive grotesquery of redemption and punishment set in the most horrific and stunning abysses.\n","March 4, 2015","true","6.0"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","37","41","0","0"

Consider it a story about one man's road to redemption. Whether or not he succeeds is entirely up to the player.\nI really like how choices really do matter in this game. What you decide now changes who appears later in the story, and definitely affects the end as well.\nGame length short - about 2-3 hours from start to finish, but definitely has replayability value.\n\nArtwork:\nNot sure how to classify the graphics in my opinion, but I'd say that they're unique, gorgeous, grotesque, well-detailed, imaginative and basically amazing all rolled into one.\nI like how they separated the foreground and background in a lot of scenes and has a "slide" effect when you move your mouse towards the left or right.\n\nMusic:\nMost of the game's background music is made up of atmospheric tracks and sound effects.\nThe ending song is really good. Got distracted while listening the song for both endings, so I can't say for sure if they are different songs.\n\nPuzzles:\nEvery single puzzle is solvable without needing to refer anywhere out of the game.\nUnlike most Daedalic point and click games, there is no guesswork needed as clues are provided appropriately where there's no way you can figure out a puzzle with simply logic (although clues are still provided for logic puzzles as well since there is no skip button). Never had to look for a walkthrough at any time at all.\n\nRandom non-gamebreaking bugs:\n-> the "x" move sign/option disappearing if you go through the zoomed-in scenes too quickly. Easily fixed by exiting to the main menu or game and then continuing the game.\n-> the matching mini-game becomes unresponsive if you happened to match the last pair at the same time the timer resets. Easily fixed by exiting the mini-game, although you'll end up having to restart the mini-game.\n\nOverall a fantastic, well-made game.

If you are more interested in the gameplay, I think the game is overpriced.\n\nThis game is ridiculously short. My first game took me around two hours (probably a bit less, but I kept AFKing so I can't say for certain); my second game only took me an hour (I made the opposite choices as the first game and skipped all previously read dialogue). If you're an achievement hunter, three runs is the most you'll need to get them all.\n\nAs for the puzzles, they're extremely basic. The only puzzles that can't be immediately solved happen to have a hint on a scrap of paper nearby. None of them require much thinking.\n\nI found the story to be underwhelming. I expected much more because of the high quality of the art. At the end of my first game, I honestly cared very little for the main character. The dialog is fine, and there are some notes and journal/book pages that give you some background, but it never felt like there was enough.\n\nAs a game, I feel like it didn't deliver. It was short, easy, and had a basic story that seemed to only be there as an excuse to show off the artwork. As interactive artwork, it's quite creepy and grotesque and beautiful. Honestly, I think they could've just sold this as a digital artbook and charged quite a bit more.\n\nAs stated at the beginning of this review, if you're interested in the artwork, then it's definitely worth the price.

Which adds replay value.\n\nGraphics  7.5 out of 10\nThe graphics are really something. Like stated above, like a H.R. Giger painting.\n\nStory 7 out of 10\nI liked the story, but somehow (maybe I've been playing too much videogames) I thought at some point it was quite predictable. But maybe I'm wrong. Just find out for yourself.\n\nFinal Verdict\nDefinitely recommended for point-and-click gamers and casual gamers. Although I don't know if I would recommend it to minors, as the graphics do contain blood and gore.\n","April 12, 2015","true","4.4"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","38","45","0","0"

In addition, there are nine languages to choose from.\n\nIf you play the demo, you'll find that the game seems to be more of a puzzle game than an adventure, with just a few screens and puzzles before moving on to the next area. This does NOT hold true for the rest of the game. You'll be locked out of some areas once you leave them, but there are plenty of locations to move about, puzzles to solve, and story to discover as you progress.\n\nThere are no hints, no skips, and no map. I did not have any trouble completing the game, nonetheless. Nothing I came across was frustratingly hard, and the only real problem I had was missing obvious things on the screen, like something I needed to interact with or an exit I simply didn't see. :p\n\nEvery screen scrolls left and right a bit, depending on where your cursor is. Although it would have been nice to just see the full scenes, some of the puzzles involve this scrolling mechanism, so I can't complain.\n\nSpeaking of the puzzles, be VERY CAREFUL when you are solving them, and really pay attention to what you're doing! Sometimes there is more than one way to solve a puzzle, and your actions really matter in this game. Your decisions count, so choose wisely.\n\nThe art style is dark and disturbing, but also beautifully done and very evocative. Combine this with the well-chosen music tracks, and you have a deeply environmental experience that will question your morals and life choices.\n\nFor the achievement hunters like myself, there are 34 achievements to obtain, which will require you to play through the game at least twice. I'm pretty sure most people won't mind going through a second time, as there are two endings!\n\nThere is a lot of bonus content to look at, which is not necessary to complete the game, but will enhance the experience. Some of these things will earn your achievements (such as reading all of the books,) so be aware of that.\n\nWhile Tormentum: Dark Sorrow is on the short side (around four hours for my first play-through,) the multiple endings and fascinating world which the devs have created make it absolutely worth owning. Definitely recommended, and I'm looking forward to OhNoo Studio's next game~! :D","June 14, 2015","true","4.8"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","2"

I loved every minute of it and was a bit sad when it was over.\n\nGame Summary\nIn Tormentum, you play as a hooded figure that has lost all his memories, save the memory of a dream of a strange statue on a hill. He awakens in captivity and is told he is to be punished for crimes he doesn't remember commiting. The game follows his escape and journey to the the hill from his dreams, in the hopes of restoring his memory. Along the way, he meets many strange characters, visits terrifying landscapes, and is presented with moral choices that shape his jouney, and eventually, his destiny.\n\nBreakdown\nGraphics: The art style was what caught my attention initally and is arguably the strongest asset the game. The characters, set pieces, and landscapes are all so alien, yet disturbingly beautiful. Unlocking a door or opening a new area was exciting, not just because I was progressing through the game, but because I would be rewarded with new and beautiful art that would leave me staring with a sense or wonder and horror rolled into one.\n\nMusic/Sound: The music is haunting and when combined with the art made for a really good atmosphere. The sound effects are well done, from opening of chests to the squelching of blood to the soft growl of a monstrous creature, each one felt solid and immersive.\n\nGameplay/Mechanics: The moral choices, while interesting, is probably where my biggest complaint with the game comes from. It was obvious in most cases which choice was good and which was evil, which I did like, because I never worried that I would make a choice that would result in an outcome I hadn't intended. However, there is no grey area: one wrong choice automatically gets you the bad ending, even if all the other choices you made were considered good. Because of this, there was almost no motivation for you to make the evil choices(except one of them where the evil choice saves you time). Not to mention the fact that (minor spoiler) you steal objects from people that call you "friend" and kill several creatures.\n\nUI/Controls: The UI is simple and minimalistic: you have an inventory bag in the lower right corner for items you find and a notepad in the lower left that copies any puzzle hints and intsructions you come across. Arrows on the sides of screens and door icons clearly highlight where you can go, so you never feel at a loss as to where you can explore. Your cursor changes to a skeletal hand when you can interact with something and occasionally a soft glow emanates from interactive objects as well. All these elements did little to interfere with the art, which is good, as the art is one of the strongest points of the game.\n\nControls are simple and easy to pick up: you click things. That's it. I didn't have any trouble clicking exactly what I wanted to click,\n\nOverall, the UI annd controls, while not innovative or particularly engrossing, was well excuted and functioned adequately.\n\nStory: I felt story to be the weakest part of the game; not bad, but it could have been better.\n\nThe characters, while beautiful and interesting, aren't deep and left me wanting to find out more about them, but with no recourse to do so. Other than the moral choices, your own character's personality and story doesn't develop at all either. You're trying to reach that statue from your dream. That's it for the whole game. There isn't any way for the protaginst to express himself, short of deciding if he should senselessly murder someone or not.\n\n\nDispite the few points I didn't like, I still highly recommend this game. The wording of the title, to me, suggests the possibility of a sequel, One that I would absolutely play if it comes out.","May 28","true","9.2"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

A point and click not so adventurous "adventure" game.  (Adventure because it does fall into any other catergory, not really, other then maybe supernatural.  But even that would be a stretch.)  Has a moralistic tone of more right vs wrong, then good vs evil.\n\nStory: The condemned arrives with a fellow prisoner at a castle specifically designed for torture, torment, and purging souls of their evil through pain, suffering, and grief.  (Dark, very dark, in tone.)  The condemned man is told this in his jail cell by the horned guard, who also informs the condemned man he (the guard) will back to torture him.  Of course, the condemned man does not wait around for that.  This begins the journey through the Hell-bound castle, and meeting its various denizans.  After that it is a trip though the wastelands, dealing with the inhabitants, and eventually to the condemned man's goal, a structure of uprised arms with a shrouded female statue inside.  Ethical choices are made throughout, in the simply question kill or not kill.\n\nI could get into a huge philosophical discussion right about now (especially after reading other reviews, in particular the negative ones) but I will spare everyone this.  But the game and that simple life-death question does have a thought poking quality that can not be denied.  (Oh by the way I considered every entity in this game to be "evil", some just less "evil" then others, even before I finished reading the Immanuel Kant introduction.)\n\nThe game is short (I suppose).  Some say they finished in about 2 hours.  I took much longer enjoying the amazing, stunning, awe-inspiring artwork.  I am not one to talk much artwork or graphics but words like astonishing, stupefying, shocking and startling could all be used to describe this game's artwork.  This game brings to mind the paintings of Hell and Judgement done by Hieronymus Bosch (Netherland).  Now add to that the H.R. Giger (Switzerland) influence (best known for the creature 'Alien') and the Zdzislaw Beksinski (Polish) influence the developers and designers used as inspiration and Dante's Inferno (many reviewers refer to) seems like Heaven.  The art work alone is worth the game price.  (Art museum admissions cost more for this much art viewing, and one can keep this.)\n\nGameplay: This is a point and click game with puzzles, and plays in a linear fashion with goals that need to be accomplished.  It is played in 3D so the scene moves back and forth, and along the edges arrows appear if the gamer can go in that direction.  There are basically 4 segments to this game, castle, wastelands, town, conclusion.  The castle, wastelands, and town can also be broken in 2 subsections each.\n\nPuzzles: Many think the puzzles are too easy.  I think hard puzzles would simply distract from the overall ambience of the entire game.  For me, this is a story about the journey, the encounters that occur on that journey, and the decisions made on that journey, not the puzzles.  Though I must say for me the highlight puzzle was a 'slider/make the gears spin' puzzle.  I could almost hear groans and sighs from those who simply detest both types of those puzzles because they were in the same puzzle. Puzzle types include logic, sliders, and codes in various forms.\n\nOverall I think the game is worth the price and the play.  It is a journey game, not an adventure game, however, so that should be kept in mind in the gamer's decision making.","October 8, 2015","true","9.5"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

The themes of the story are ones people find timelessly fascinating and I like to think of the cost of the game as comparable to the cost of entry to an art gallery with the bonus that you now have your very own set of art installations to interact with at your leisure.\n\nThe only misbehaviour of the game was in dealing with my multi-monitor setup - where Tormentum ran happily but was not centred properly across the monitors. People with Eyefinity setups may have to revert to single monitor use. Other than that the game ran without a hitch on my Win 8 (not 8.1) system.\n\nI think some games become precious and illogical in an effort to make their puzzles 'hard'. I am satisfied with the difficulty in Tormentum, and making the puzzles more lateral and obscure would detract from the flow and experience of this game.\n\nThere are a number of decisions the player makes in the game which affect the story and ending, and so the game will require at least 2 to 3 playthroughs to experience all the outcomes.","March 4, 2015","true","8.0"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","0"

And at first glance, it's easy to see why: not only did OhNoo Studio create a hellishly beautiful game, they lowered the puzzle difficulty so as to appeal to a larger audience.\n\nSpeaking of puzzles, let's talk about game design. In Tormentum, players do not control their avatar directly; instead, they click left, right, up or down in order to progress through a series of moderately interactive screens. As to the puzzles themselves, they appear in two forms. The first requires players search for a particular object, such as a bone to appease a hungry animal or a key to unlock a prison cell. Secondly, Tormentum is filled with mini-games. These mini games often possess puzzle elements—for example, adjusting a set of gears to open a door—but not always.\n\nExperienced point and click adventure fans may have noticed that I didn't mention item combinations. That's because there aren't any. OhNoo Studio ditches item combinations in order to lower their game's difficulty while providing a minimalistic inventory system. Does this decision pay off? In the end, I have to say no. The puzzle design in Tormentum never strays too far from easy, and genre veterans will breeze through this game.\n\nThat said, easy puzzles shouldn't distract from the game's biggest triumph: tone. All of the art in Tormentum is hand-drawn and disturbingly ghoulish, with many monsters seemingly torn from the pages of a H.P. Lovecraft novel. The world alternates between horrible, bleak, and ravaged. No one finds goodness in Tormentum, a sentiment echoed by the game's ominous and occasionally plaintive soundtrack.\n\nWith decent gameplay and strong art, I'd consider recommending Tormentum were it not for the game's terrible story. OhNoo Studio bundles two video game clichés with a vague plot and obvious morality system. Amnesiac protagonist? Check. Absolving murderers good and killing innocents bad? Check. The nail in the coffin is the game's English translation: though Tormentum is more or less devoid of blatant errors, several awkward phrases took me out of the story.\n\nWhen I think of Tormentum, I think of missed opportunity. What if this game had put a price on being good, encouraging the player to make the evil choice instead? What if the developers had fleshed out the plot? While Tormentum: Dark Sorrow could have left me contemplating life, OhNoo Studio settled for style over substance. This point and click adventure will have its fans, but don't count me among them.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 5.8/10\n\nThis review was written for Literary Video Games.

Middle-age fanatism ?\nThe real problem is that the words spoken by the "bad guys" (the one killing, torturing and judging everybody, like some freaky paladins) are the exact same words that the game tells you.

I know kids are more desensitised these days but don't let your 5YO play this.\n\nAgreeing with the general consensus on Steam, the artwork is absolutely amazing and the 2.5D effect works well.

However let me tell you as you seen in the screen shots this game is beautiful. It is easy to manuever through out much like in Shadowgate (2014) the difference being that in a lot of screens you can see the main character in a third person perspective. The game starts off as your typical "your a prisoner headed to some remote, and unknown destination. You can't remember anything, so you need to recover your memory." Now by no means am I saying the story line is dull. No quite the contrary I played my entire (2) playthrough(s) consecutively, and loved every minute of the storyline. There are roughly 6 different choices to make thoughout which is a good or evil choice to direct you towards one of two endings. The puzzles in the game are well thought out, and well placed. I found myself trying to refrain from taking too many screenshots because every slide is screenshot worthy. I can't say enough just how gorgeous I thought the atmosphere was. The music, and ambient noise sets the theme perfectly. I believe I purchases this on sale for around $10, and it is easily worth the full asking price. It is not often (almost never) I will take time to review a game, but this one deserves that recognition. If I can answer any questions you might have that you haven't had answered in my review (or a different one) then by all means comment here, or add me, and I'll try to answer as best as I can. If you are a fan of games like Shadowgate (2014), Whispered Worlds, or Chains of Satinav you should do yourself a favor, and pick this game up the next time you have some extra money burning a hole in your pocket. I don't think you will be disappointed.","June 28, 2015","true","7.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

Giger meets 80's Metal Covers - Rad! It's not really a "normal" Adventure but rather a puzzler. Your character doesn't walk around and there's not too much to interact with and there isn't really any dialogue choice. Instead you move the mouse around seeing whats there in the scenes and hunt for the items to solve puzzles at every corner to advance while looking at the insanely pretty scenery. Usually I'm not into that type of game, but the quality and way how the world was drawn and the resulting atmosphere hit a nerve that made it very interesting to me and I welcomed the change in gameplay. The puzzles start easy and get progressively harder, but you probably don't need a walkthrough unless you get impatient at one or two confusing spots. It does have two endings, but despite that replayability for me is not very high since it's pretty linear with not much to do. I enjoyed my time in this dark and twisted world nevertheless and all my desktop wallpapers are from this game right now :D\n\nIf I do want to play it again though, notes to myself: Don't become a serial killer again, as much as you hate it let people live.

This review is spoiler-free.\n\nTormentum is a point & click game set in a dark world with soundtracks and art style that make it unique in its genre. The story is fairly simple and revealed slowly bit by bit, with a great twist at the end. There are no combat mechanics or even player-controlled movement, and yet at no point have I felt these things missing. You navigate the world room by room, relying on your perception to interact with your surroundings, picking up items and using objects. Collectables have a slight shine to them, which makes it a bit easier to spot them and you won't spent much time hunting down items. The game involves a lot of puzzle solving but most of them are easy enough, with only a few that can make you stuck on them (especially if you missed the hints). The graphics in this game are pure works of art, and the eerie soundtracks complete the depressing, grim feel of the world you are traversing. Every now and then you will have to make a moral choice, and these choices will essentially decide your ultimate ending. Wish the game was a bit longer, but it's not too short as it is. It would also be great if there was voice acting instead of just plain text. Overall, Tormentum has enough replayability value for at least 2 playthroughs and a total of 5-6 hours of entertainment and is in my opinion definitely worth the price.\n\nPros+ A well told, easy to follow story with a great twist\n+ Awesome graphic style\n+ Excellent soundtracks\n+ Simple but powerful moral choices\n+ Striking, interesting characters\n+ The atmosphere is very well set and realistic\n\nCons- A bit short\n- Most puzzles very easy\n- No voice acting (except intro)\n\nFinal verdict: 8/10","March 29, 2015","true","9.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Tormentum boasts striking visuals, is very reminescent of the art of Zdzisław Beksiński, and H.R. Giger, and has an atmosphere similar to that found in FROM Software's "Souls" games.\n\nThe puzzles are never too complicated as to keep you stuck for hours. Highlighting effects ensure that you will never spend too much time pixel-hunting down the items needed to progress. The story is cryptic enough to keep you guessing, until the end (no spoilers here). Multiple choices with consequences not immediately obvious also ensure you will want to do more than one playthrough.\n\nI heartily recommend this game to adventure game fans.

The most metal game I have played.\n\nThe art alone is enough to make playing this game a worthwhile experience. Amazing atmosphere, world, story, characters, themes, music, and engaging but not frustrating gameplay. I would love to see more of this universe. This game combines the decision making elements of games like the walking dead with classic point & click elements. But the puzzles are easier than classic point & click games and there are no dialogue trees.\n\nThis was the perfect game for me because I love mini puzzles and I HATE dialogue trees. There is dialogue, but it's concise, relevant, and interesting. The mini puzzles were cool, but not so difficult that you have to spends hours trying to solve each one. This was the first game I have played without using a walkthrough at some point. Most of the time I knew what I needed to do, and could rely on the in-game hints.\n\nThe main reason to play this game, though, is for the story. The only downside is, like most games of this type, I wish it were longer. I have 9 hours on record but most of that was from the game running in the background while I was doing other things, or asleep. Ideally I would like an adventure game to last 20 hours, but given the level of detail of the artwork, that would be unrealistic.\n\nEdited to add: this game has no voice acting which I think is perfect. I hate voice acting unless it's really really good quality. The silence is eery and fits the atmosphere. Basically, everything about this game is perfect. I am now really sad that I've finished the game. Anyone who likes point & click games should really just buy this right away.","March 8, 2015","true","11.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

There are many games inspired by Giger already, I mainly got it for Beksinski.\nThe graphics being the main feature, I found them to be somewhat cartoony or comic book like, instead of the dark dreamlike art of the original artists. I'd rather feel like exploring a dark dream as opposed to reading a comic book. Another down point is that they are in a low resolution. Anyway, they are still well made and it is worth solving the puzzles just to see what comes next.\nThat brings me to the puzzles, they seem for the most part to be overly simple and easy, which is fine with me, I don't play games looking for a challenge, just entertainment, but I can imagine this might put some people off who take things too seriously.\nThe game also has moral choices, but just like the puzzles they seem to be rendered down to the bare minimum, and almost infant-like black and white choice.\nIn short, I'm enjoying it, but regardless I feel it has some flaws I wanted to point out, get it at a good sale.\nTormentum: Dark Sorrow, my first impression video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMTw7V9E458","June 5","true","4.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

There are very few games that convey this kind of horrific, monstrous atmosphere in a compelling way and at first, I was utterly intrigued by the mystery of the setting and the characters. The artwork, in combination with the absolutely chilling soundtrack, makes for an incredibly singular experience. The game is also quite good at keeping up the momentum of its intrigue and disgustingly horrific atmosphere all the way through to the end, though the ending itself falls prey to numerous video game clichés which, disappointingly, almost completely soured my experience. It's strange that a game with such a unique style felt the need to fall back on such trite game tropes.

The themes of Tormentum are something like Hellraiser mixed with Lord of the Rings. Massive dark castles and monsters are everywhere. The game itself is a grand example of how to do a point and click, adventure style game. Story is interwoven beautifully as you make your way through the dark corners and blood splattered hallways. All the scenes are visually striking but never aim to needlessly shock. Nonetheless you feel a bit off guard when roaming from room to room. Not knowing what lies in store for you. The music matches perfectly with the game as well. Along the way there is the usual amount of puzzles and item interaction one could expect. With obvious cues and signs of where items go usually. However the game does flow at a good pace. Never letting you rest or linger in an area for too long. Getting stuck or lost is rare but can occur. The game also throws many decisions your way. Some of the dark denizens either need your help or want to harm others. How you approach these tasks can alter the ending of your game. Adding a decent amount of replay. In all I had a really great fun time with Tormentum. The genre of Point & Click games is a little over-saturated. Making it difficult to capture my attention. Tormentum not only captured my attention but tortured my eyeballs! I couldn't look away and wanted to see more!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/e6j4gnTzVjU\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","June 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/335000/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1598 products in account","Oozing with gore and morbidity, Tormentum - Dark Sorrow is an engrossing point and click adventure that you're sure to remember for years to come. The game itself is seething with hellish nightmarescapes, and venomously dripping with macabre dialogue; a far more tortured choice compared to many of the point and clicks available on the market today. Make no mistake, this title is not for those who may get depressed easily, as it deals with some heavy subject matter and it confronts those dark, ghastly thoughts that linger in the back of our minds; forcing us to think about our life choices, and what may be waiting for us in the afterlife.\n\nHands down, the main focus of Tormentum is its eerily captivating artwork. The artists did one hell of an amazing job merging the soft pastels and hazy dream-like features of Zdzislaw Beksinski's work with the harsh, alien architecture of H.R. Giger. If it weren't completely impossible, I'd go as far to say that both of these renowned surrealist artists collaborated and contributed the art straight to the game. The massive amounts of detail that has been put into the artwork alone more than makes Tormentum worth the full selling price, artists as talented as the ones who worked on this title deserve high recognition and I firmly believe that true art should never be undersold. The screenshots that you will see on the store page are just a faint few of the 70+ cadaverous hand-painted expanses that you will wander across, and there are numerous devils to encounter. The entire world that has been created for Tormentum feels overwhelmingly larger than you are.\n\nCoupling the awe inspiring artwork is a dark, brooding soundtrack. I sincerely wish that it was for sale on Steam, as I would purchase it in a heartbeat. There was actually one part of the game, near this giant tower, that I enjoyed the music so much that I cranked my speakers, left my computer and proceeded to do housework while just listening to the audio. It's rare for me to enjoy a game soundtrack this deeply, but I would actually put Tormentum's score on a regular playlist; right along side some Bethlehem, Velvet Acid Christ and Burzum. The ominous, ambient hymns bring an entire new dimension to the art style that is displayed within the game, and they really suck the gamer in while refusing to let go.\n\nSo, what is this game actually about? Sadly, I can't delve far into the story without spoiling it completely; I will say that you are a man, wandering the huge realm of Tormentum in search of a way out. Along the way you must face tough choices, all of which will ultimately matter in the end. The character that you are playing has no more knowledge than you do, and vica versa; this is much akin to plots like that of Stasis and Sanitarium. You will learn more about the hellish world that you're traversing through by reading notes and speaking with the many interactive beings within the game. Many of these fiends are quite forlorn and profound with their dialogue, which is reminiscent of The Divine Comedy by Dante. As usual, it will all make the most sense once the game has reached completion.\n\nTormentum - Dark Sorrow is a completely stunning macabre point and click game that will appeal to a niche audience. Art enthusiasts will absolutely love this game for its stunning in-depth visuals, audiophiles will love it for the superbly creepy soundtrack, and fans of both will completely fall in morbid love. While the story isn't anything to rave about, it will strike a chord with fans of literature along the lines of The Divine Comedy (Dante's Inferno). The only real fault that I could possibly find with Tormentum is how short it is. I finished 3 full playthroughs in roughly 6 hours, with my initial run clocking in at about 3 and a half hours. That being said, I just can't gush and go on about this title enough. It's absolutely the best point and click experience I've ever had, but then again I love H.R. Giger, Zdzislaw Beksinski, Dante's Inferno and dark ambient music. If you're a fan of any of the aforementioned things, do not hesitate to throw your money down on this twisted nightmare.\n\nRating: 5.0/5.0 - An amazing achievement, this game must be played.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","February 9","true","5.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

When I started the game and  it got clear that it was about moral, I was interested since I thought "for once a game about a serious subject".\n3 hours later (yes it really is that short) I was satisfied by the drawing, music and atmosphere BUT the moral concept this game provides is that of an naive 5 year old. I don't want to sploiler anything here so I don't go into detail, but if you hope for some fresh thoughts on the subject or any serious thought, you will be disappointed to say the least. Its very mediocre good/bad decision based with no grey zone what so ever. For other games this would even be ok(if a game is more about mechanics, strategy, charackter development...), but since it is an point and click adventure the subject it centers around really shouldnt be as plain simple and boring.","May 8","false","3.5"," 28 of 50 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","28","50","0","0"

Thrown into a prison for reasons unbeknownst to you, you are supposed to escape your cell and find your way out of whatever location you are in.\n\nFor all the imagination that was put on the world design, there is never really any motivation for you to do anything other than to just finish the game. You will encounter multiple characters, each with their own plea and moral standing, and depending on who you assist, the game will generate one of two different endings.\n\nEach new location presents a puzzle or an element that you will need to solve one, and their designs are absolutely striking. So much work has been put on each set-piece and all for good reason. Simple in its approach as it is, Tormentum is a beautiful game that justifies its asking price just for its aesthetic, and at $11, coupled with some interesting puzzles, it’s a bargain.\n\nPros:\n\n– Beautiful landscapes and art direction specially if you are an H.R Giger fan.\n\n– Balanced difficulty curve that has the game starting ♥♥♥♥-easy and ending mind-numbingly challenging.\n\n– Great use of sound and ambient\n\n– Multiple paths that will lead to one of two different endings.\n\nCons\n\n– The story is too simplistic and almost laid out for you from the outset\n\n– Some puzzles are obtuse and others are too simplistic.\n\n– What ending you get, evil or good, is dependent on your decisions, themselves dependent on visual cues that are not clear at times.","March 12, 2015","true","3.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I am normally pretty cynical about digital art but every screen is a beautiful work of art in this game, the sound department is great too with a mixture of gothic and dark ambient tones that are right up my street anyway and certainly fitting music for this game.\n\nThe story and setting is well-written, just nightmarish, unreal and really, really grim. It's refreshing to get mutliple outcomes in a point and click as well, and I think they handled that and the central issue of moral choices very well in this game, and it gives it more replay value (which it has a lot of anyway because it's just fun to get lost in the world of this game).\n\nThe gameplay is not terribly hard, I am OK with this but I don't know if it's because I am finally a fairly well-seasoned point and click player or if the puzzles could be harder....Is fun anyway and the choice part of the gameplay make up for there not being loads of very difficult puzzles. Sometimes it does spoonfeed you the hints a bit too obviously though.\n\nOverall I really rate this and would say it's the best point and click game I have plaid since Primordia, and similarly unique in both its visual and audio direction.

I would say it's more of a five dollar game and I got it on sale for ten.  If I was sent a bunch of the original art work with signatures of the artist from the game I would gladly give out ten dollars.  The art is just amazing.  I would love to see this be turned into a movie somehow.  I won't give spoilers, but holy ♥♥♥♥ there are some great twists in the game.  Although I had a feeling about some of it and I was right. Doesn't mean anything.  I wasn't focused on it because I was too busy playing and getting swept up into the game.  Most characters you meet you remember.  Although dialgoue is short (thank god) it keeps a healthy balance.  All the puzzles in the game are fun.  None make me want to punch my computer and some had me scratching my head for a little bit.  The worst part was the backtracking I did to try and find stuff, but that was my own fault.  Everything can be found with a little logic.  If you get to a point and can't figure it out well go to the next room.  I know that sounds stupid, but there were a few times I thought I had reached the last room, but there was another one to the left or right that I just didn't see the stupid arrow pointing that way to show me to go in that direction.  I was in aw most of the game.  I had no idea what to expect on the next room over and over.  I wanted to keep going just to see what was next.  I was never dissapointed in that area and in fact I was finding myself saying holy ♥♥♥♥ quite a few times.  If you can't do something in the game and you think you figured it out weither its a puzzle or a lever or something.  Look again at things.  You put it in wrong or something.  I found this seriously true at one part near the begining when I though I had put in the right symbols, but was wrong and couldn't figure out why I couldn't move forward with the object.

Despite this the choices through the game kept me motivated to help out this victim or get revenge on another character. Throughout the game are choices where you decide the fate of other characters around you, each choice minorly alters the world around you and plays into what ending you get at the end of the same.

They where not very good games, but the art direction was by H.R Giger himself!\nI would say that this game in many ways is the spiritual successor to that game.\n\nThe art in Tormentum is not made by H.R Giger but you really notice where the inspiration comes from!\n\nIt's a great adventure game, with lots of puzzles (maybe a bit easy ones atleast for me) great story, moral choices and different endings.\n\nSome puzzles are really original while others are a bit cliché like slider puzzles, but it doesn't bring the game down, not at all. All the puzzles fitt really we because the setting allows them to do so. The setting is really sureal and nightmarish (and I love it!) so not even slider puzzles or memory puzzles feels out of place!\n\nI think its an awesome game, I just played it three times (in one sitting) in a row to get all the achievements and different endings. I wish it wasn't over, but for that price Im not disapointed, it was a great treat and I hope they make Tormentum 2!\n\nI would recommend this to anyone!\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that the game has no voiceovers what so ever!

In fact, I sat down and didn't get up before the credits were rolling, which does say a lot about the phasing of this game. It took me about 4 hours to get through, which for me is well worth the asking price. (Might have to check out some of the other endings as well)\n\nWhat really kept me engaged in this game was the fantastic setting, wonderfully rendered, incredibly creative environments and characters are scattered around. And even with very little dialogue per character you still get a great sense of who they might be by just looking around and taking in their surroundings. Presentation really sells this experience.\n\nThe only thing I could possibly comment on is the difficulty of the puzzles. This is rather difficult to predict as a game designer when using somewhat pre-used puzzle designs, how much their audience has already experienced those types of puzzles. For me having played quite a few of these games, none of the puzzles felt very challenging, so they ended up feeling a bit routine like. There is a good variety however, so at least you're not doing the same ones multiple times.\n\nOverall, fantastic experience, one I'll be keeping with me for a while to come.\nThanks to the developers for providing something very interesting and pleasing to the mind.","March 7, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Recommend a buy only if discounted or if you really like the aesthetic.\n\nNOTE: I actually played the game for about three hours, I have less on record because I was not online when playing.\n\nTHE GOOD:\nThe game is, simply put, beautiful. Each area, character and object is very well designed and every scene would not look out of place as the cover of a metal album.\n\nTHE BAD:\nThe game is very short. I have managed two full playthroughs in three hours, the first one carried out at an extremely leisurely pace, especially consider I am not at all good at adventure/puzzle games. Most puzzles are fairly simple and with a relatively obvious solution. In the entire playthrough there was only one point where I found myself stumped (and even then it turned out I already had the item I needed and I had simply missed a detail in its description earlier). The game also has a heavy moral choice element, which is not everyone’s cup of tea.\n\nWARNING – HEAVY ENDGAME SPOILERS FOLLOW[/b]\n\n\n\nTHE UGLY:\nWhile the game has a marked black/white moral choice element, the “good” choice (i.e. the morally upright choice) is not always clear. Examples are the fact that it is moral to spare prison guards (even though their main/only activity is the torture of prisoners) and it is correct to give the powerful artefact to the mysterious mage that basically tells you “I will not abuse its power, like pinky swear” (he is telling the truth, but when making the choice you only have his word to go by). In several instances the choice comes down to who you believe over others, which can be fine, but i.m.o. not when a single wrong choice can lock you into the bad ending and there is no way to reload without starting a new game.\n\nBy far however my main gripe with this game is the ending: after starting the story in medias res and raising a huge amount of questions regarding the setting (who are the knights who captured you? Where do they come from? Why are they so obsessed with purging evil from others through torture?....) the endgame cops out by telling you the entire experience was a dreamlike “second chance” your character had to see if he could be worthy of redemption after his suicide. Nothing needs explanation, because everything was symbolic. From this, I am disappoint.","December 26, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I just loved the art and knew I had to have it. The puzzles seem to make sense, which allows you to progress at a reasonable rate, I've only had to take to the internet to progress once so far. If I had a criticism, the dialogue isn't anything special. But it is at least functional. The characters get the necessary information across, but that's all. I suspect the game wasn't originally written in English, so perhaps a little something was lost in translation. Nevetheless, it remains perfectly functional.\nI came to this game, not being a fan of of the genre but loving the art and I'm getting what I expected out of it, a pretty standard point and click with a backdrop that I liked enough to purchase the game and give it a thumbs up.\n\nUPDATE\nAfter having completed the game, I feel it deserves a shade more enthusiasm than I feel my initial review reflected. It's still a thumbs up, just a bigger one. As point and clicks go, this is more than 'pretty standard'.\n\nMILD SPOILERS\nYour choices matter, I've not come across that in a point and click before. It's not always clear what the moral choice is either. I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. I made well intentioned choices that didn't always turn out the way I'd hoped.

The art style is very grim and gritty, and the biomechanical structures of Giger's environments and the death, decay and despair prominent in Beksinski's paintings permeate every scene in this game. Skeletal beings and dark, cold machinery fuse with throbbing flesh and monstrous monuments, in a tribute to these great surreal, fantasy-horror artists.\n\nThe music in this game helps to bring the art to life and add to the atmosphere and tension that immerse the player. The sounds and ambience are foreboding and full of lonely desolation; the chanting whispers in the background combined with the loud clanking of alien machinery, or the strange rumbling and pulsating throbs barely audible; they all help the player visualize the otherworldly scenes both visible and just out of reach of the camera.\n\nThe puzzles are logical and vary greatly, and bring depth to the gameplay, which mostly consists of searching for items and matching them with other interactables in the environment, and moving from scene to scene in a classic point-and-click style.\n\nOverall, this game is definitely worth its price and your time, especially if you are a fan of Giger and/or Beksinski. Even if you aren't, but are just wanting to explore an adventure game that truly immerses you into its atmosphere and environment through gorgeously-drawn yet disturbing artwork and darkly-beautiful music, then you should get this game too.","March 9, 2015","true","4.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

There is no ridiculous logic like "combine the frog with the book and use it on the bucket to open the chest" that so many other titles are guilty of to create the illusion of complexity. Puzzles here are straightforward yet challenging enough to make you think. In terms of the environment, as long as you are paying attention you won't often find yourself resorting to having to click on everything everywhere to progress.\n\n2) Unlike many other titles in this genre, there are multiple endings depending on your choices (of which there are many) in game. Replayability!\n\n3) This game is beautiful. The art direction is both moving and disturbing at the same time.  H.R. Geiger comes strongly to mind.\n\nThe only drawback to this title is that it will take about 3-4 hours to run through the story once.

Giger inspired art than a game.\n\nThe visuals are heavily inspired by their source material, but also stand on their own with their own unique touch.  Many of the images in the game would serve well as a poster or portrait in the home of one so inclined towards the style.  The music does a great job of enhancing the somber, alien landscape and its equally alien inhabitants.\n\nThe writing is passable, serving to push the events of the story and game along, but nothing that will stick in your head when you're done playing.  The story, likewise, exists but is not worthy of remark.\n\nIt's a shame that while the art and style of the game are clearly inspired, gameplay is less so.  Puzzles in the game rely heavily on generic puzzle tropes (slider puzzles, circuit puzzles) and commonly repeat themselves.  I personally would have preferred puzzles that interacted more directly with the fascinating world this game strove so hard to create.  The game is also heavily dependent on alignment based decisions, but these choices are so black/white in nature they engender no internal discourse, save for which achievement you are aiming to unlock.\n\nFor the price, those inclined towards Giger's style will find enjoyment in this game, and I'm glad I got to experience it despite its flaws.  Those looking for a creepy game that better incorporates puzzles into its mythos may want to look towards a title like Fran Bow.","February 21","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The obscure story is mature as it confronts you with haunting moral questions/decisions as they not only affect your life but also the lives of others. So think good what you want to do - finally you have to take the consequences of your decisions (as in real life ...) And in the end you will look in a mirror ... And be surprised who you are … Or even shocked ? ... Are you ready to meet yourself ?\n\nThe catching atmospherical tension is created by the outstanding graphical artwork, that was inspired by the paintings of H.R. Giger and Zdzisław Beksiński. It’s even intensified by the dark melancholic soundtrack, that let's your heart sink in the groundless ocean of sorrow you will find in this world. The impressive text passages complete the atmospherical immersion. A very unique experience I never had before playing a video game !\n\nCritics could say, that the dialogues are not synchronized (text only), that the use of animations is quite limited, that the graphics have to be more realistic and that the puzzles are not challenging enough as you get too many hints (by blinking items, a memo-book, character- and text comments). In relation to the offer this game makes to you, complaining about these blemishes is like a cheesy joke. „Tormentum – Dark Sorrow“ impresses because of it's deep atmosphere, it's unique story-desgin and line and its matureness – it has something to tell !","April 2","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Giger - it is much less phallic for that.) The illustrations are top-notch, contributing greatly to the bleak setting of the game. However, there are barely any animations and the game cuts the scenes to a 3:4 format (leaving you with a black borders on the left and right of your display if it is widescreen.)\n\nAs dark as the illustrations is the setting. The corrupted landscape is full of twisted creatures and inhuman machines. It is foul, rotten, broken and crazy. It tries to explain itself in the finale, but even after that I was under the impression that it was grimdark for the sake of trying to be darker and edgier alone. The writing didn't help - you might be able to swallow it straight, but for me the dialogues sounded as written by a goth wannabe.\n\nThe game promises moral choices, and the bleak setting gives plenty of opportunities for that. You will be dealing with subjects like imprisonment, torture, murder, deceit and redemption. Unfortunately often the choices fall flat - since everything around you seems like an irrational nightmare there doesn't seem to be much incentive to care either way. However, your choices do influence the development of the story and do carry consequence for that twisted world.\n\nSince you are constantly lost in the mad landscapes I was afraid that I would be similarly lost if the game's puzzles would follow a similar dream logic. However the game makes some effort to explain whys and hows of the crazy inhabitants and the machines littering the environs. It might not exactly make sense, but you should always know what to do. Why is the red ruby, that you snatched from the painting, used in a mechanism opening a door, and why is that mechanism located three floors below said door... that is a completely different question.\n\nThe game is rather easy. No puzzles are challenging to begin with, and for most of them there are solutions to be found nearby. There is however a good variety of those tiny logical puzzles, so you are constantly treated to something new. In the end, the game is rather short. The first playthrough took me 3 hours. However, I intend to give it another go to see the results of the other decisions. Replaying it will bring me closer to the advertised 4-6 hours of gameplay.\n\nA solid casual adventure game with dark themes and great illustrations.","March 5, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The interface is clean and streamlined, and the game itself is fairly simplistic. You start off as a prisoner that goes on a journey of discovery through wastelands, purgatory, and redemption. It is evident that you have some sort of amnesia, but I found overall that the progression or motivation was hampered by too much missing story, information/lore along the way. It felt as if half the game went by when I blinked, as you are left not really knowing the deeper meanings of what was going on. Some of these questions in the end were answered, but not all. There was little if any lore or backstory, and it felt empty and slightly frustrating to want to know more about the world or my character, but was unable to.\n\nThe unique art style and atmosphere made this game enjoyable. It was original and intriguing, but didn't overdo the sense of horror or the bizarre. The atmosphere of the world synergized very well together.\n\nOne unique element to the game was that choices you make throughout the game will impact how it ends. Nothing huge or game changing,  but it was spread out and implemented well. Some of the choices might not have the impact you expected, which was misleading to say the least. You are presented with a truly evil man, for example, and your choice to kill him or let him live might not be judged as guilty or innocent as you think it would.\n\nThe gameplay is heavy on puzzles, with some scavenging quests thrown in. I would say about 75% of the items needed for scavenging come from previous quests. I find this refreshing, as it relies more on puzzles and mini-games, instead of "find the safety deposit box in a room of 500 safety deposit boxes". The puzzles were smooth and continuous, with a good sense of fluidity that kept me enthralled in the gameplay.\n\nThe artistic beauty, fluid game play, and overall synergy of the game make this an easy recommend. The story leaves a bit to be desired, but overall an enjoyable game.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho","December 4, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The artist wears H.R. Giger's influence on his tattered sleeve.  Each screen is amazingly painted and animated, making this game a sheer joy to look at.\n\nAs for gameplay, if you're a fan of point-and-click adventures, this doesn't really add anything new to the genre, but it's a solid entry.  The interface is streamlined, with just a single skeletal hand to interact with the environment.  No "look," "use," "speak," etc icons to deal with like in Shadowgate or older Sierra titles.  This is more like the FMV Sierra adventures, like Phantasmagoria.\n\nThe puzzles are not particularly difficult.  The few times I found myself stuck, I just left the game for a bit, came back, and found that I had just missed another room or an object on the ground.  A lot of the answers are pretty well spelled out for you.\n\nThe story is pretty simplistic, but allows you to make a few choices along the way.  The decisions you make have negligible effects on the gameplay, but will affect the story.\n\nFinally, the game is not very long.  I managed to wrap it up in under 3 hours on my first playthrough, and my second took me about 1 hour.\n\nTormentum - Dark Sorrow is a beautiful game, and one that is truly worth experiencing, but be warned that it's not particularly difficult, and it's over pretty quickly.\n","March 4, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I think it does everything right, and more. This happens very seldom in games, but here I feel that the creators had a vision and made it from the depths of their, to a relative extent wicked, hearts. They pay no attention to what a general public of gamers prefer. This game is dark, sometimes utterly depressing, if you care to delve into surroundings, atmosphere, and what you see and read. But it is done in a purposeful fashion, and I enjoyed every single minute of this game.\n\nThe game has a great artistic style that alone sets the mood. On top of that there is a fantastic dark ambient soundtrack that fits the setting very well. It may sound strange, but this game made me think and dwell on things in life I wouldn't have otherwise. It has a certain amount of philosphy and psychology in it, and is to some extent intellectually challenging.\n\nAnd a few words about the gameplay itself: it is a standard point and click game with puzzles on easy/medium difficulty. It takes around 5 hours to complete, but is interesting to replay to see what consequences different choices have. Second playthrough also takes much much shorter time. The story is great. Go play.","October 4, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's like I was walking through the nightmare of some metalhead, and it was pretty gruesome. You're surrounded by the twisted souls of people being punished for some vauge sins they supposedly committed, and the wardens of this place are even more warped. Suffering seems to be the fetish of the day as you wander through this decrepit world, and no one is who they say they are.\n\nYou're given moral choices to make throughout the game, and while some seem rather obvious, others are not so clear.\n\nThere are two endings depending on the moral choices you make. Good, and Evil. On my first playthrough, I committed two evil choices, and the rest were good. Didn't matter, as I got the evil ending. YOU CAN'T MAKE -ANY- EVIL CHOICES IF YOU'RE GOING FOR THE GOOD ENDING. One evil choice is all it takes to get the evil ending, it seems. There isn't a balanced system for measuring the moral choices at the end, so keep in mind what ending you want to pursue before beginning a playthrough.\n\nA lot of the puzzles in this game remind me of those brain-tester minigames you'd find on the Nintendo DS or some online flash game, and those are the only ones that present any kind of challenge. The rest of the game is finding objects hidden in the environment, and giving them to NPCs or completing mechanism & puzzles. Nothing in this game is really difficult at all, as some of the NPCs will outright tell you how to solve the puzzle, or make it entirely obvious. So, the puzzles and minigames felt really tedious. Only some felt necessary to the story, but even then, not at all challenging.\n\nThe story was ok. Can't really give anything away to those who are adament in playing the game themselves, but it was ok. No real character development, as your interactions with various people are brief. The first words out of 90% of the characters you encounter will either be "Fetch me this" or "Here's info on the next objective". The only character that made me feel -anything- was the rat-man you encounter in the beginning of the game...but even then. Nothing deep or impactful, just a bit of...surprise.\n\nThere are a few bugs in the game that make it feel a bit like a buggy flash game. Sometimes I'd get stuck on a close-up of an environment when picking up an object, and I'd have to restart. The credits for the Good Ending also have a bug; where one image will get stuck and the credits won't even start to roll. When that happens, you don't even get the achievement for the ending (for all those looking for total completion).\n\n\nThe Ending itself is also abrupt and lacking, as it was just -over- after you count up your moral choices.\n\n\n\nMy verdict:\nThe gameplay & story are very lacking, but the art is pretty cool. Get it when it's on sale, and it'd be worth it. However, as it is right now, I don't really recommend it.","March 12, 2015","false","4.0"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","16","32","0","0"

All the puzzles are mostly linear and very easy to solve to be honest. You won't be wandering around for hours in this game. Decision making is more of an importance and things can be solved in multiple ways all having an effect on your ending. Although I do think this is a great game my first playthough was done in about 2 hours so that was a little disappointing. It's geared for multiple playthroughs, but with the content being exactly the same with only minor differences it leaves something to be desired.

Not bad, not great, but okay. It's got great artwork reminiscent of H. R. Giger, and practically every screen looks like it could be the cover of a metal album. There are a few puzzles here and there, but they're pretty simple unless you're just really bad at puzzles.\n\nHowever, the things that really make this game fall flat are that it's far too short (easily beatable in under an hour), it's too linear (in that there is a set path, and there are a few puzzles that you can do in any order you choose, but you'll always wind up going to the same limited places within the game, not to mention there's no actual risk of failure), and that any choices you make are kind of pointless.\n\nDespite having multiple choices to make throughout the game, there are only two possible endings, and if you make even one bad choice, it doesn't matter how many good choices you make, you're automatically locked into the bad ending. Based on the endings, this tells me the writer intended for the game to have a very black and white view of morality, no gray area whatsoever, no justification for why you did an action that you did, just "if you did even one bad thing, that makes you a horrible person who doesn't deserve a good ending".\n\nOverall, it has the potential to be really great, but the linearity and illusion of choice that results in one of two lackluster endings rather than having various possibilities, in addition to the incredibly short playtime and basic puzzles results in an experience that's cool at first glance, but kind of disappointing when you actually go through with it.","February 10","false","5.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

And now almost three hours later, I have come to an uneasy conclusion.\n\nThat I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n\nThe reason behind my conclusion is actually very simple and can be summarized into a single sentence:\n\nBeautiful artworks doth not a good game make.\n\nYes, the artwork was absolutely exquisite, and each scene is breath-taking in own its way. The atmosphere was very nice and the unique design of monsters and characters kept my fingers hovering around F12 while secretly hoping for even more interesting ones to come.  But this doesn't hide the fact the game is simply lacking in so many features that it cannot be called a "good game" but rather "a good set of illustrations", and this is very frustrating as this game could have been so much more.\n\nThe game, having excelled in the artwork department, unfortunately falls flat on story, character design and puzzles, and here is why.\n\nStory :\n\nI dont want to spoil the story here so i'm just going to say this:\n\nThe game's moral choice system is so bland that at times it really just feels like picking between a lettuce and a cabbage  , as you really wouldn't care less about "that character whom i have zero knowledge of". There are no tear-jerking moments and heart-torn decisions, just "here is this character do you want to kill him? oh what you do? well you're just plain evil ain't you?" Or "here's this action that will kill that character over there, wanna do it?

Had this not been a game but just a artwork set i would have gladly paid just as much and recommended it to all my friends.\n\nBut it's a game, and interactive pictures are not games, no matter how beautiful they are :)","May 24","false","2.7"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","15","33","2","1"

So instead I'll just cut to the chase.\n\nVISUALS:\n-If you enjoy dark fantasy and surreal art- the gothic, the baroque, the grotesque- GET THIS GAME.\n- If you like art in games, hope to make art for games, or just like creativity in games and want inspiration- GET THIS.\n- If you're a fan of Giger or Beksinski, DEFINITELY GET THIS GAME.\n\nI don't really have to go into detail on this. The screenshots speak for themselves.\n\nLENGTH:\nThe game is very short. This is a 3 to 4 hour game, sans any mucking about in confusion. Not really a detriment in its own right, but definitely a factor to consider.\n\nGAMEPLAY/PUZZLES:\nThe game isn't challenging. I can't remember the last time I played a point and click game, but I still breezed through this. This could be seen as a blessing for casual players just looking to experience the art firsthand, but I'm certain it would be underwhelming for any seasoned point-and-click fan.\n\nWRITING:\nIt's lackluster. It's not awful, but considering what the game was trying to do it needed to do much better here. I'll avoid spoilers but it’s important to know that the writing in the game is inseparable from moral choice. The story, the theme and the visuals of the game ultimately revolve around death, sins, punishment and things not being what they seem. This could have been incredible, but for a game so trenched in morality, it is portrayed as very black and white.\n\nThere are two endings to this game and around 7 moral choices you must make. They're fairly rudimentary , and even doing two perceived 'bad' choices will give you the bad ending. Morality is very complicated and needs to be handled as such if your whole story hinges on exploring these themes. Games like Silent Hill 2, Spec Ops: The Line and The Walking Dead all accomplished this with flying colors, and had that quality of writing gone into a game like this the end result would have been haunting. Of this I have no doubt.\n\nAs it stands however, the end result is this world of beautiful visuals and unsettling atmosphere that winds up being in the service of a lot of nothing. If you're looking for a great story, interesting characters or strong worldbuilding (particularly revolving around morality and the darkness in the human heart), you will be disappointed.\n\nOVERALL:\nI bought the game on impulse and my choice to buy it was exclusively rooted in the artwork. I didn't go in with any other expectations so personally, I'm happy with what I got out of it and do no regret anything. But I cannot say with confidence that this would be the case with somebody else so I leave it at this:\n\nIf you came here for the art- go for it. An art book or ticket to a gallery show or museum often cost way more than 12$, and here the art is interactive. That's just awesome. You can't do much better than that.\n\nJust don't expect much else from it.","November 29, 2015","false","3.8"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

The story is rubbish, the gameplay is your basic bare-bones adventure game nonsense with no interesting features that you can't find in better adventure games, and the whole experience start to finish lasts only just over 2 hours if you don't get stuck. The moral choice system in the game is also really insubstantial as it always is, but it's especially damnable here because the game starts itself off with a quote from Immanuel Kant. Don't let that quote fool you, anyone who knows anything about Kant will be able to see that the game carries no inspiration or influence from even his most basic ideas.\n\nThe game might be worth it for the artstyle if it was like $5, but at $12, you'd expect something a little more substantial.

It's an unoriginal adventure game (pick up everything, put the button in the button-shaped slot, repeat fifty times.) The art often looks like an attempt at early D&D monster manuals. There are no developed characters or story; in the last ten seconds of the game you finally learn something about the guy you were playing, which is totally unrelated to anything else you have seen, discussed, or built out of cart wheels and dead horses. (If the dead horses bit sounds fun, play Fran Bow instead.)\n\nEasy but tedious puzzles, anything simple for the developers to code - think tile-sliding and card matching. I repeatedly got stuck and had to check a walkthrough, but only because it's hard to figure out which way you're allowed to walk. I kept having no clue rooms existed, because I'd have to hover my mouse over a certain one of the identical doorways to give me a faint arrow.\n\nThe one non-standard addition for an adventure game, the "moral choices", are terrible. It's the worst implementation of a moral system I've ever seen in a game. Half the time you don't even know the outcome of the vaguely labeled options - I was clearly evil because I pushed the wrong button once.\n\nOh well.

Puzzles tend to be on the easy side, and making the "right" choice during moral decision time can require a little pondering - but usually fairly clear. Plot and particularly, character development are on the "light" side. I've read many short stories where I feel more invested in the struggles of the main protagonist. Dialogue is passable.\n\nSo, what it boils down to is that Tormentum is a visually stunning and atmospheric work of gaming art, let down somewhat by weak character development, an undercooked plot, and puzzles that may not be challenging enough for the average point and click gamer. This said, it would not be fair to say Tormentum is a case of style over substance, because so much of the game's substance lives in its visual and atmospheric qualities.\n\nWith pros and cons weighed I would recommend this to anyone looking for a dark fantasy fix.\n","April 2, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Speaking of ends, there are multiple endings to this game, so if you are looking to maybe correct some of the actions you did in the game, you might be able to change your ending.\n\nWith all this being said, I have to say get this game. It might not be for everyone, but those looking for something polished that has just the right about of twists and turns, and difficult decisions, this is a game that you can't afford NOT to have in your collection. This game gets a 9.4 out of 10.","March 12, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as an unnamed character in dark robes, who has been captured by the dark guardians of the tower for some treason that your soul has committed. The lore and story are slowly explained to the player, that never really gives the player too much detail, creating a minimalist effect that really made the gameplay experience enjoyable. I feel like some point and click games today flood the player with story, so playing this was a sigh of relief.\n\nThe gameplay in Tormentum follows the basic structure of point and click adventure type games. Items are found that you can pick up and put in your backpack, that might solve some of the puzzles later on in the game. This process is repeated throughout the entire game, but is kept interesting with the great number of interesting and enjoyable puzzles. Most of the time, there are cheat sheets in other locations that provide the player with graphical representations of how to complete a puzzle in a different area. This keeps the games difficulty balanced and gameplay enjoyable.\n\nThe artstyle is unique and breathtaking when first seen, because it doesn't follow the conventional scheme of pretty games today, because Tormentum is incredibly grotesque in its detail. Every point of detail in the game has something amazing on it. The tables with blood dripping of them, to the human remains being electrocuted in the death chambers, each scene is as amazing as the last.\n\nThe player enters a throne room with a rather wicked looking court jester sitting by the castle throne. You approach him and he tells you to kill a certain prisoner with this special knife he provides you, whilst offering the player a hefty reward. At this point in the game, the story hadn’t been described to me that much, and so I had to make the choice that my guy told me too. These choices are dark, and usually represent a good/evil decision the player needs to make.\n\nThe games length is around 5 hours for a single playthrough. These 5 hours weren’t just a 5 hour grind of ‘gotta go here’ and ‘gotta do this’ but instead was an intense and rewarding diegetic experience. This game has plenty of  replayability with the choice system inbedded in the game, giving each playthrough a different experience. Tormentum is less a video game you play for enjoyment and more an experience that people of dark adventure would love. I would recommend Tormentum to anybody who sounds like this would be their style of game, and when it’s selling for a price point of less than $15 AUD, it’s a steal.","March 17, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess that could be your opinion, but I think Tormentum - Dark Sorrow looks amazing. Every area looks like a classic heavy metal album cover coming to life! I'm a metal fan so this is right up my alley, but what's interesting is that the game's main soundtrack I wouldn't say is metal. It still fit perfectly as an eerie melody that made the life of the game intense.\n\nAlright so you know how much I like the look, but what is the actual game. At its core it's a point and click game with smaller puzzles blended in to keep things interesting. The puzzles were exactly how I like them in a point and click game. Challenging, but not to the point where you feel the guilt to check a guide.\n\nThe smaller puzzles I mentioned are pretty straightforward. Like moving some cogs around to connect two ends, or figuring out a jig saw type puzzle. They were a nice change up from going from place to place. There's also times you'll come across patterns mentioned on signs, and other places. This is where the notebook you carry comes in handy. Your character will automatically sketch out the details. Now you can look at this pattern at anytime while looking at a puzzle that requires notes.\n\nI want to mention this, but not going to spend too much time on it for worry of possibly taking some mystery out of the game from you. Tormentum features some choices throughout the game, and let's just say there is more than one ending. I loved the ending I got to this game, and that's all I'm going to say.\n\nYou can probably tell that I enjoyed Tormentum - Dark Sorrow a lot, but I have some issues I want to bring up. The main one is that I feel like there isn't enough options in the game. There's a couple like volume control, language selection, and a full screen mode. One option for a monitor resolution would be nice. I would have liked the game to take up more of my monitor. As you can see it there's black around the square of gameplay. I would have liked to have the option to do some sort of zoom in to take up more monitor space.\n\nThe other option I would have liked is the ability to control the camera, and make it stay still for the most part. Whenever you move your mouse the screen moves a little. It's not a big complaint, but took me a little time to get used to it. Then the last thing is more of a small annoyance. Everytime you pick up an item it zooms into it. While most of the time this feels right because it goes into more detail, it's not always necessary. When someone would give me an item it'd just be easier to just pick it up off the ground, than have to zoom in to do it. Also once you zoom out you can't zoom back into that area the item was in so I think it's a little unnecessary. These complaints in no way ruined the game. I just want to make this clear. There just things I'd would have liked to see in the game.\n\nFinal Say: I'm positive about Tormentum - Dark Sorrow. I gotta recommend it to you if you're a fan of point and click games. I do wish it was longer as it took me three hours to beat it, but there is more than one ending. So the replay value is there if you want it. Still with the artwork, music, puzzles, and story, Tormentum - Dark Sorrow gets my approval.","March 18, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Take your average point-and-click game, add some captivating narrative and mystery, then throw in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of top-notch aesthetics taken straight out of the LSD-fuelled nightmares of Giger and Beksinski. What you get in result is probably one of the most ♥♥♥♥ing metal adventure games to grace Steam with their presence. The puzzles are just tough enough to feel satisfying, and so are the moral choices, which, while simple, still feel meaningful. Basically the only legitimate gripe I may have with Tormentum is that it's fairly short for its price (three "acts" to be precise), but I guess all this awesome background art must have cost a fortune already.\n\nSo, here's a drink of vodka, bile and liquidized bone, to OhNoo and their future games.

Tormentum does not follow this rule. In fact, Tormentum altogether drops combining items. Most of the puzzles are logic and sequence puzzles, and most have accompanying notes laid around the area giving hints. As you may imagine, this makes a lot of the puzzles easy. There are a few puzzles that you are given and instructions for (or that I did not find hints for) that relied solely on guess and check; and I was stuck on these for no small amount of time.\nOther than the above mentioned puzzles, I only have one complaint for this game: It’s short. I finished it in a little over 3 hours and in one sitting. Otherwise, this game is fantastic. The art is incredible. The music is good. The story is sparse in all the right ways, and more than simply interesting enough to keep me engaged. There is a good and bad ending (decided using a simple moral system; kill or don’t kill etc…), and of course I got the bad ending but this has little impact on the story outside of the ending.\n","March 22, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It might not be for everyone, but those looking for something polished that has just the right about of twists and turns, and difficult decisions, this is a game that you can't afford NOT to have in your collection. This game gets a 9.4 out of 10.","March 12, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Take your average point-and-click game, add some captivating narrative and mystery, then throw in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of top-notch aesthetics taken straight out of the LSD-fuelled nightmares of Giger and Beksinski. What you get in result is probably one of the most ♥♥♥♥ing metal adventure games to grace Steam with their presence. The puzzles are just tough enough to feel satisfying, and so are the moral choices, which, while simple, still feel meaningful. Basically the only legitimate gripe I may have with Tormentum is that it's fairly short for its price (three "acts" to be precise), but I guess all this awesome background art must have cost a fortune already.\n\nSo, here's a drink of vodka, bile and liquidized bone, to OhNoo and their future games.

Really, every single scene and character in the game is painted beautifully and with so much detail. Every screen is a feast for the eyes in some way, with its own dark, twisted world. Imagine someone like Geiger doing a video game. This game is proof that we do not need to be stuck in pixellated art for adventure games.\n+ Atmosphere: the feeling of oppression, mortal frailty and fatality of the world comes across well. Everything attaches itself well thematically to what is going on and almost every little thing has some dark twist about it.\n+ If you are afraid of the incredibly obtuse puzzles, you have nothing to fear in this game. Despite the twisted nature of the world, the puzzles are logical and the game isn't afraid to give you open hints as to what you need to do.\n+ Different environments: again, every screen looks and feels different. Are are unlikely to see the same wall twice and the game does everything to vary the nature of the environment. The environments are actively part of the story rather than lazily copy-pasted all over.\n+ The story had a surprising twist-ending (well, it surprised me).\n\nBad things about the game:\n- The puzzles will not be challanging to a veteran adventure gamer. There are one or two puzzles where you can figure things out without the game giving you a solution but that's about it. However, the game still holds interest to them for its art and atmosphere.\n- Not enough oppressing/depressing music! I recall only one instance in the game where the music actively contributed to the scene. Otherwise it is fairly muted or I don't recall it at all.\n- The story does have you start with amnesia but for one driving memory. However, the character's identity is not imporant to the plot (until the end) and the story actively works with this rather than just use it out of laziness.\n- The game has a moral choice system but it is rather transparent and predictable where it goes. It falls into the trap of "doing evil for evil's sake" and rarely really tempted to do evil. Evil needs to be something that the player would chose from something other than sadism (or amoral selfishness) and good needs to be the hard, unrewarding thing to do or even something you wouldn't think to do.\n- I don't really call it a negative but the game has no hint system or even a point-of-interest highlighter. The game is design well enough that you don't need them.","March 8, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yet, somehow, this game struck my interest. I had heard it discussed and a few clicks through Steam and I was checking out the amazing artwork. Next thing I knew I was clicking "Add to Cart" and haven't looked back.\n\nEDIT: I wanted to make sure I noted that this game DOES have a demo! This is an excellent feature to have that is lacking in many games these days. If you want a true test of how this game is, skip the review and play the game yourself!\n\nLet me get a few things straight:\n\nThis game is short. As an avid gamer but inexperienced in this genre, it took me about three hours to complete. Unlike other games of this type, I never found the puzzles to be too hard or too easy. Only once did I have to look up a hint which turned out to just be me not paying close enough attention. If you're looking for a serious mental struggle, you may not find it here. But, for someone who approaches this game more casually, I loved it.\n\nNormally I try to look at how many hours I get out of a game compared to what I pay for it to find some balance. This game gets a bit of an exception just since I enjoyed myself so much. Normally I'd say a game this short would not be worth the price (and that may factor into your decision) but for me I am happy to support this developer and hope they make more in this vein.\n\nThere are moral choices in the game, which is hardly a new idea, but it's interesting to see how the game has subtle changes based on the decisions you make. The end result is more or less the same, but still, it's fun and gives it a level of replayability just to see the other options.\n\nTo me the story was interesting to follow and gives you just enough answers to understand what is going on but just enough mystery to make you wonder more about the world and what it may hold. I'd personally love to get to see more like it. Is it completely original? No, but it does what it does well.\n\nThe art alone is no reason to buy a game, but this game has some of the coolest I've seen in a while. It is detailed and interesting but not too cluttered, which is important for a point-and-click if you ask me. Gives me serious H. R. Giger vibes and as a huge Alien(s) fan, keep it coming.","April 6, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Simple enough for any point-and-click adventurer, and can be completed in a matter of days. Puzzles can be challenging, but for the most part are easy enough to solve. The most challenging thing in the game is gathering the correct (sometimes hidden) items needed to solve puzzles.\n\nThe dialogue is short and to the point. Leaves a lot to the imagination of what's going on.\n\nReplay value is there, if you enjoyed it the first time you will enjoy it the second time by choosing different critical decisions that balance life/death for some non-playable characters.\n\nOverall, I give the game a 7/10.

This game. The art style is beautiful and creepy, with a great story to go along with it. It's a simple point and click that makes you do a lot of running around your first playthrough (since you have no clue where everything is at) but upon a second playthrough didn't take very long at all since I knew all the puzzles and item locations. Another feature, (which is larger than you may think) is good/evil decisions. Some of these choices are a little hard to decide which is the good or evil choice, and this has a HUGE consequence at the end of the game. The story is great, artwork is great, spooky atmosphere yet not scary, good puzzles that stay on the same-ish level of difficulty throughout the entire game, and I only got stuck once and required a guide, but you can definitely do it without one.\n\nI will spoil the end so avoid the next line if you do not wish for it to be partially spoiled. I REPEAT: SKIP THE NEXT LINE IF YOU DON'T WANT A SPOILER!\n\nSPOILER ALERT: If you make ONE bad decision, you are damned. You MUST make all good decisions in order to be saved. I made a bad decision at the beginning my first playthrough and all the rest good, and was damned at the end anyway, so you MUST make every single good decision or be damned, no getting out of it.\n\nIf at the end you don't get the ending you want, you can speedrun the game (like I did) which doesn't take any time at all compared to your first run through of the game, and get the ending you desire. Most (almost all) of my time played was from my first run through, with what was probably half an hour or something like that just going balls to the wall to run through again (not sure exactly, just an estimate) but it is an enjoyable game, and is definitely worth it in my opinion.","March 11, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or, well, at least it did for me. The premise of the game has heavy religious backstory that is based around how sin affects your life. The land that your character enters has a purgatorial concept where people who are taken there have to atone for their sins and attempt to get out by enduring suffering that cleans their soul. The choices that you make with your character ultimately lead you either to heaven or hell.\n\nThe graphics in the game is what originally lured me in. The game has amazingly detailed artwork, is easy to use, and has a lot of both easy and difficult puzzles scattered throughout. The music is fantastic as well.

This point&click quest has breathtaking art resembling Vallejo and Giger. At first, I thought, that that's it, at the beginning dialogs of this game seemed to be very simple and predictable, as if It was an instruction, not the real speech. I also thought, that the game would be short. I could not imagine how many work was put into those art and animation, because I later had a feeling that the game would never end :) The story itself is nice, it has some sufficient choices for gamer to make, which influence the ending. The riddles were a bit simple for my taste. I liked the idea of the final judging of your own behaviour during the game. However the reason, which lead the main hero to hell seemed to be a bit out of place and a bit boring. But if that's how the developers see it, then let it be so.\nAs for game play, everything seems fine, as any point&click quest.

Or, well, at least it did for me. The premise of the game has heavy religious backstory that is based around how sin affects your life.

The choices that you make with your character ultimately lead you either to heaven or hell.\n\nThe graphics in the game is what originally lured me in.

It's lavishly detailed, dripping with atmosphere, and full of the sort of weird, imaginative, borderline nightmarish imagery that I'm always on the lookout for. Mature point-and-click adventures are coming back, and I couldn't be happier.\n\nP&Cs have a (deserved) reputation as being full of obtuse puzzles that are more about reading the designer's mind than using a realistic problem solving approach. I'm happy to report that isn't the case here. Each puzzle (and there are quite a lot of them) has a well-conveyed goal and comes together logically. For every minigame you've seen before -- slide the blocks, connect the wires, or match the tiles -- there's another that's new and interesting, and even the familiar ones often come with a twist.\n\nFor me, games are first and formost about offering the player a new world to explore, and Tormentum delivers beautifully on that end. I'll admit I groaned when my character played the amnesia card at the very beginning, but it works out surprisingly well -- this world is as alien to him as it was to me. It's a bizarre setting full of creatures and locales both otherworldly and twistedly familiar, yet everything is presented in such an unassuming, matter-of-fact way that it never stops feeling believable. It's a world you're dropped into without any explanation - because you don't need one. No lore-heavy monologues or lists of invented names to be found here. It's about as earnest and unpretentious a fantasy setting as I've ever seen.\n\nI like the inclusion of moral choices, though they can be a little too obvious -- I don't personally subscribe to the belief that there is no right and wrong, only "shades of grey", but I do appreciate it when I'm forced to make a decision without having all the answers. With a few exceptions, the choices you'll be making are pretty clear-cut between right and wrong, and given the surreal setting, I would have hoped for a bit more ambiguity. Still, they add a nice layer of reactivity to the story and offer welcome motivation to play through more than once.\n\nThe one real complaint I have is about the controls. Moving the mouse simultaneously pans the scene in parallax while also moving the cursor, meaning that objects on screen move as you move the cursor towards them. You have to actively guide the cursor instead of allowing your muscle memory to do the heavy lifting. It also (for me) caused some amount of light motion sickness early on. Your milage may vary of course.\n\nUltimately I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this game. It's a refreshing surprise that ticks all the boxes I care about. Check out the demo if you're still on the fence, but personally, this is one impulse buy I don't regret in the slightest.","July 20, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Giger.\nIf this art  interests you, and you don't already know, google (or bing, whatever) "Zdzislaw Beksinski" and "Utopian Realism". I could name other names, but that's arguably the guy that started a minor movement in Polish art communities to make some of the weirdest, most balls-out fantastical art I have ever seen, and the latter is the name of said movement.\n\nas to the game, It's mostly an escuse for the designers to have an art portfolio. That being said, it's worth whatever you pay, just to give the dudes who put stupid amounts of detail into some of this work a few bucks.\n\nThe puzzles are relatively simple, though since it's a point and click, there's bound to be some ♥♥♥♥ that doesn't align with your sense of coherency.\n\nSet up is, you've been captured, have no memory of your past, and are being shipped to a torture dungeon to have the sins in your heart purified with a good amount of stabbings and flaying. the game is you interacting with the world to get out and figure out what happened to take you into this rotting world.\n\nSimple story, colorful characters. the world will keep you wanting to see more of it.\nhas a kind of moral choice aspect that might make a decision or two ambiguous.","January 4","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I dont have to tell you how pretty the graphics are, and music is very atmospheric as well. If thats what you need, buy it and be very pleased!\n\nYet, when it comes to the game itself... The puzzles in the game are way too easy. I suppose the developers wanted every player to be able to finish the game and see all of it instead of getting stuck. The puzzles still should be a bit harder to make the gameplay more rewarding, as for now, it is pretty much picking up an object from the ground and attaching it to the obvious spot few meters away and then solving a basic gear/block/memory puzzle any 6 year old could solve. That said, the game is never boring either.\n\nBiggest problem for me though was the dialogue. I felt that the game would be so much better with no dialogue, no text at all. There is very little dialogue to begin with and it is not very well written, so they should have just trusted more in their art and find other ways for characters to express themselves than poorishly written english. The atmosphere and art are all about unknown, -you are not even supposed to understand about where you are and what the creatures are-. So why does the dialogue have to be simple "I lost my egg, go get me my egg back!"  Some other adventure games such as called "Dropsy", "Machinarium" and "Botanicula" did this part marvellously (as well as surrealistic films made by Jan Svankmajer) , and I think that approach would have been more than suited for this game. Its a huge wasted oppurtinity that the developers didnt just put 100% on the shoulders of the art, but instead relied on old fashioned and unfitting text bubbles.\n\nStill, for the fans of such art and atmosphere this is a must buy.

I think the difficulty is perfect for an enjoyable, frustration free, experience that requires just enough thought to keep you engaged. Everything is very well designed and readable.\n\nThe art is great with big nods to Giger and Beksiński. But the artwork mostly avoids simply being derivative of the inspiration and manages to stand on its own. The sound design is also quite good, with atmospheric music that never outstays its welcome.\n\nThis game is the school example of short game length not necessarily being bad. I enjoyed every second of it and by the end it felt like a complete experience (and there's reason to play it again). There's no unnecessary filler and the game is paced almost perfectly.

I dont have to tell you how pretty the graphics are, and music is very atmospheric as well. If thats what you need, buy it and be very pleased!\n\nYet, when it comes to the game itself... The puzzles in the game are way too easy. I suppose the developers wanted every player to be able to finish the game and see all of it instead of getting stuck. The puzzles still should be a bit harder to make the gameplay more rewarding, as for now, it is pretty much picking up an object from the ground and attaching it to the obvious spot few meters away and then solving a basic gear/block/memory puzzle any 6 year old could solve. That said, the game is never boring either.\n\nBiggest problem for me though was the dialogue. I felt that the game would be so much better with no dialogue, no text at all. There is very little dialogue to begin with and it is not very well written, so they should have just trusted more in their art and find other ways for characters to express themselves than poorishly written english. The atmosphere and art are all about unknown, -you are not even supposed to understand about where you are and what the creatures are-. So why does the dialogue have to be simple "I lost my egg, go get me my egg back!"  Some other adventure games such as called "Dropsy", "Machinarium" and "Botanicula" did this part marvellously (as well as surrealistic films made by Jan Svankmajer) , and I think that approach would have been more than suited for this game. Its a huge wasted oppurtinity that the developers didnt just put 100% on the shoulders of the art, but instead relied on old fashioned and unfitting text bubbles.\n\nStill, for the fans of such art and atmosphere this is a must buy. Reminds me of the old  adventure game Dark Seed.","January 7","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It tells the story of an unknown, unseen character robed in a tattered, hooded cloak. He/she/it is captured by some militia and left in a castle to be tortured. From there you need to escape and find out who you are, all the time meeting the most bizarre characters and creatures I have seen in fantasy.\n\nFirstly, this is a Point & Click game. I found the idea of these dull BEFORE I picked this game up during the Steam sale (whatever the price it is now it is probably worth it). It makes up for the lack of normal gameplay (i.e. moving a character around, regular animation, etc) by having some of the most macabre, horrific, gruesome yet beautiful and astounding scenes I have ever seen, accompanied each time with unique atmospheric music which at times makes me think of latter day Burzum. They are inspired by the painter Zdzisław Beksiński, H.R. Giger and I find the atmosphere remeniscent of a Lovecraftian nightmare at times.\n\nGameplay is somewhat typical of P&C games: each scene presents you with various things to interact with, items to collect and puzzles to solve. Solving puzzles is the key to moving from various areas and the puzzles are not too challenging or frustrating. You won't need a walkthrough if you just stop, sit back and think. Some are even remeniscent of the games you'd find on a smartphone game.\n\nThere are also a few moral choices. They are not all black and white either. Your choices decide the ending and the ending does have a twist that admittedly made me go, "wow ok, this didn't occur to me".\n\nReplay value is not especially the highest BUT this isn't a game made for gameplay. It's for storytelling and immersion. I will play it regularly just to immerse myself again in this eldritch realm. In this respect it is perfect.\nYeah, really this game is 10/10. I see no fault at all.\n\nIf you choose to buy this game please also consider buying it directly from the developers website. They sell it but also include other options such as a high quality book of all the artwork and some other articles. The art is really beautiful and I think worthy of having in a book.\n\n10/10, worth your time if you enjoy dark fantasy, morbid imagery and Lovecraft style fantasy.","January 9","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had a lot of fun clicking on many things just to see what the main character had to say about them!  it is fairly easy to see when you can click, has the arrow change to a cute little bone hand pointing it\n\n-----\n\nThe only bad thing to say about this game is that sometimes the arrow showing the other areas was a bit hard to see when the background had lighter clolor since the little arrow was a shade of white, but this is clearly not a big problem!\n\n-----------\n\nit was a wild ride from start to finish, not too long nor short, just perfect.  I recommend it to everyone who like dark fantasy and point and clicks, especially those looking for a little break of those other games with their hard as hell puzzles!\n\n10/10","December 30, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a fan of the style, the artwork is gorgeous and it sets a great tone as you navigate the world. The puzzles provide some obstacles but are not so difficult as to lead to frustration which might pull you out of the experience. It definitely encourages poking around at bits of the background to find things tucked away in buckets and barrels but everything makes sense and doesn't fall prey to"adventure game logic" much. The first play through took me about 3 hours which was just enough time to wrap up the journey and keep things from feeling like they were overstaying their welcome. There are choices to make, and it may be worth a 2nd playthrough if you want to see the other options you could have taken and their results. All in all, if you like adventure games, and you are at all drawn by the art style, it's very much worth taking the time to experience it.

Only once in the game did I think I was stuck without knowing the solution, but it all came in time. Some of the choices, involving switches that either doom a character or saves them aren't clearly depicted, so on more than one occasion I ended up doing the opposite of what I intended. But the game is meant to be played multiple times with different choices -- at least if you want to get all achievements -- so I didn't get hung up on these things. However, the ending where you are evaluated based on your decisions comes off as unexpectedly sanctimonious and not at all consistent with the rest of the game. If morality is a grey scale, as this game seems to suggest (there are no-win situations), then what business does it have telling me whether I'm worthy of redemption?\n\nThe art style and sound are what define the mood of this game. Personally I wasn't depressed by the visuals and the implied despair. But it is definitely sombre. The Giger-esque artwork is equisite and if for nothing else this game should be seen just for that. The sounscapes are dark and remind me of David Lynch films. I'm satisfied with a single  playthrough and uncertain whether I want to put in the time for a second.\n","April 24, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art is beautifully disturbing and the mood and atmosphere are pleasantly creepy.  While the game is moderately short, it is definitely worth taking the time to find and appreciate the details, both in the art and the information about the world & characters.\n\nThe puzzles are simple and amusing (not what I would consider challenging or frustrating), but add an extra layer that tends to augment the story and world.  This is a positive aspect in my opinion since the game is a work emphasizing morality and consequence of choice.  While the choice tree is binary in nature, the end results are less so, and choices cause the story to 'ripple' in different ways as you progress.\n\nI would certainly describe this as a casual game, and this is supported by its well-considered design that a) does not require the player to manually save the game and b) does not allow the player to get 'stuck' and have to restart.\n\nThe story was interesting and, to my surprise, actually managed to keep a few tidbits hidden from me until the very end.  Speaking of which, the ending (at least to me) was above average and included an interesting slant.\n\nAll Steam achievements are able to be obtained within two or three playthroughs, each of which get progressively faster since the player knows what choices they intend to make ahead of time.  This is why I would recommend focusing on playing the game 'naturally' on the first playthrough, instead of immediately focusing on achievement farming.  You will likely get more enjoyment out of it that way.\n\nFor some (primarily those intrigued with the art and atmosphere), the game will be worth the full price.  For others who are still interested but edgy about its short duration, pick it up during a sale.  You will still enjoy it.\n\nOverall, Tormentum is definitely a recommended game for casual play.","January 24","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You won't fault yourself for playing the game just to view the art. A lot of work when into it and its dark, gothic style, inspired by two of the darkest artists (in my opinion).\n\nAs for the gameplay, it runs just like any other point and click, so there isn't much more to expect. However, each puzzle is fresh and some are unlike ones you'd see in other games. Some can be solved on the spot, some are puzzles that require a found item and some you may need a hint given to you in another location. It is sad the the game is a short one, though, but you may find yourself replaying it just to reimerse yourself in the art.\n\nThematically it matches the visuals: very dark. Some of the themes are quite thought provoking if you are at all philosophic.\n\nThere is a unique musical track to set the mood for each "scene". Some are beautiful, some do there job in setting a creepy background abience to better the experience. The only gripe I have is that the quality may be a bit rough on some tracks (similar to if a track was slowed down too much [a minor clipping effect]), but that is really knitpicking.\n\nTo conclude, this is a game that you definitely want to play slow and let it envelope you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacobalbano/recommended/335000/","jacobalbano","Jake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacobalbano/","285 products in account","The fact that I'd never heard of this game before yesterday is proof that I'm following the wrong kinds of game news outlets. It's lavishly detailed, dripping with atmosphere, and full of the sort of weird, imaginative, borderline nightmarish imagery that I'm always on the lookout for. Mature point-and-click adventures are coming back, and I couldn't be happier.\n\nP&Cs have a (deserved) reputation as being full of obtuse puzzles that are more about reading the designer's mind than using a realistic problem solving approach. I'm happy to report that isn't the case here. Each puzzle (and there are quite a lot of them) has a well-conveyed goal and comes together logically. For every minigame you've seen before -- slide the blocks, connect the wires, or match the tiles -- there's another that's new and interesting, and even the familiar ones often come with a twist.\n\nFor me, games are first and formost about offering the player a new world to explore, and Tormentum delivers beautifully on that end. I'll admit I groaned when my character played the amnesia card at the very beginning, but it works out surprisingly well -- this world is as alien to him as it was to me. It's a bizarre setting full of creatures and locales both otherworldly and twistedly familiar, yet everything is presented in such an unassuming, matter-of-fact way that it never stops feeling believable. It's a world you're dropped into without any explanation - because you don't need one. No lore-heavy monologues or lists of invented names to be found here. It's about as earnest and unpretentious a fantasy setting as I've ever seen.\n\nI like the inclusion of moral choices, though they can be a little too obvious -- I don't personally subscribe to the belief that there is no right and wrong, only "shades of grey", but I do appreciate it when I'm forced to make a decision without having all the answers. With a few exceptions, the choices you'll be making are pretty clear-cut between right and wrong, and given the surreal setting, I would have hoped for a bit more ambiguity. Still, they add a nice layer of reactivity to the story and offer welcome motivation to play through more than once.\n\nThe one real complaint I have is about the controls. Moving the mouse simultaneously pans the scene in parallax while also moving the cursor, meaning that objects on screen move as you move the cursor towards them. You have to actively guide the cursor instead of allowing your muscle memory to do the heavy lifting. It also (for me) caused some amount of light motion sickness early on. Your milage may vary of course.\n\nUltimately I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this game. It's a refreshing surprise that ticks all the boxes I care about. Check out the demo if you're still on the fence, but personally, this is one impulse buy I don't regret in the slightest.","July 20, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun puzzles, epic music and art design,  epic story, extremely dense atmosphere... I just finished it, and as I'm writing this I'm still blown away... wow...!! I'm just really sad now since I know this game is one of a kind, and there aren't many similar games... :'(\n\n10/10\n\nPS: If you like this game I also recommend "I have no mouth and I must scream" to you.","April 21, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
