Single player is always fun to pass the time and release stress by pummelling several opponents into dust. BUT for maximum enjoyment definitely has to be multi-player.\nOnce my friends and I hooked this up through a network (internet also) say goodbye to a decent nights sleep. The battles were epic, the scale was huge and most games started out as build a HUGE army and just slaughter your friends.\nThis does get a little overpowered at times but with the options to ban certain units/grades, etc. Then the battles became more interesting.\nA friend would attack, you'd figure out a good line of defence, they go back and try work around that defence, you attack your way, they figure out another defence, etc... it was ♥♥♥ for tat battle that kept your ideas and strategies rotating and constantly developing.\n\nIn the years I've owned this game, it's never lost it's appeal. The graphics are nice & finely detailed, controls are very easy and bulk unit commands are simple, way points & patrols are easy to set. All in all a great strategy game BUT I'd highly recommend multi-player for a long lasting experience.\n\n(After SupCom, I'd purchase C&C 4 and was very disappointed. Thinking about it, I've not played C&C since but instead gone with the SupCom expansion and SupCom2)","November 27, 2013","true","43.2"," 149 of 154 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","149","154","0","0"

I bought it on release for full price, lost the disk, rebought the game on disc a few years later, thats been lost forever, and i bought it a THIRD time and i still feel that i havent spent enough money to justify all the entertainment i've gotten from this game over the years. That tells you all you need to know, this is one of the best RTS games of all time. I've always thought Total Annihilation was the most underrated RTS ever made, and this spiritual successor does it even better. I will play this game in 20 years just like how i still play Total Annihilation even to this day.\n\nYou didnt come here to find out how the game plays, you want to know if its worth it or not. Well, this game has been out for a long time. All the info is already there for you. If you are a casual RTS fan, love giant robots and armies, enjoy building gigantic sprawling bases and high level strategy, all mixed with a decent to solid single player campaign, and great balance, you should definitely get this game, especially on sale.\n\nForged Alliance, the expansion, is also great and has the most players playing multiplayer. But to me the original will always hold a special place in my heart. Plus it seems more stable and the 4th race never quite felt as fluid or fun as the original three.\n\nMy third favorite RTS ever after SC:BW and DoW: Dark Crusade / Soulstorm.\n\nUEF for life\n\n10/10","November 6, 2015","true","150.1"," 80 of 88 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","80","88","6","8"

The problem with many other games is that making a sizable army can take forever, and it never really feels like a true large scale battle (the only exception I can name that I've enjoyed being Battle for Middle Earth 2, when you can have 5+ barracks sending wave after wave into a battle zone).\n\nThis game takes large scale strategy warfare to a whole new level, even introducing artillery that can fire for seemingly kilometers right into the enemy base, bringing a hint of objective gameplay into multiplayer matches, where you may be forced to take out the enemy artillery to protect the integrity of your base.\n\nI have encountered issues launching this game on Windows 7, however, but that was solved by launching the game in Windows XP Compatibility mode, so it's not a major issue.\n\nTo keep it short, hell yes, I recommend this game.","December 3, 2013","true","10.6"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","45","48","0","0"

For an old game it still runs well and was one of the few games (even today) to be optimized for four cores.  It needs that power to run because you will have awesome battles of an epic proportion. Each player can have up to a thousand units on the field at any one time.  Even for an RTS game with thousands of units being rendered at the same time the units are well detailed and animated.  Sup com is also the only game I have that supports multiple monitors, which is nice.  It is too bad that there is no longer any supported multiplayer, but Sup Com Forged alliance does have multiplayer with Forged Alliance Forever, which is run by fans of the game around the world.  The fans of Sup Com have even added support for mods and up to 12 player games, which is astounding with the fact that each player can have a thousand units.\n\nGreat Game, I recommend getting both Sup Com and Sup Com Forged Alliance. For $3.74 it is a steal and even for full price, it is worth it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI do not suggest getting Sup Com 2, which was developed by a different company and the multiplayer is truely dead.\n","March 4, 2014","true","5.7"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","31","32","0","0"

I like to take my time, fortify my base, build up my forces before i take on the enemy. Something i find this game encourages. You do not want to rush things, because once the map shifts you could be facing a new enemy from a new direction.\n\nAnd if you just lost most of your fleet or aircraft taking that earlier objective in a rush, the enemy will whittle you down. They might not get you on the first wave, but by the 5th they'll be through your defenses lighting your factories on fire, taking away your ability to rebuild the army you had. But if you took your time, that first army can hold the line, while you build a second to tear the enemy a new hole.\n\nIt's not a visually pleasing powerhouse, but it renders the units and explosions nicely. The story is fairly standard, as such games go. Pick a side and fight the other sides, who are evil. (off course pick an other side and you're old side is just as evil to them) Eventually leading to a climactic battle.","April 19, 2015","true","12.3"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","1"

What I found is that this game is what you would get if you mixed the two.\n\nSupreme Commander has the Epic scale and resource management of Sins, but the Micromanagement and the strategy of C&C.\n\nGameplay - Able to run at Full graphical quality on even today's entry level cards, this game is set for the future, as it was one of the 1st games to boast Multi-core support. The attention to detail n this game is amazing, being able to zoom in to your smallest units and then out to see an entire army, then to the entire battlefield is a concept only seen in Sins.\n\nGraphics - The Graphics are okay for a game from 2008, which is probably why it runs so smoothly.\n\nSoundtrack - The soundtrack is only really noticeable on the menu and in battles, as every other time you are concentrating on building a massive army\n\nIf this game is  on sale, it's a good offer, so if you have nothing else to buy, this could be a good choice.","June 20, 2014","true","17.4"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","0"

Where games like Age of Empires and War Craft 3 added more "Emersion" and games got smaller scale, SupCom blew the boundaries off zooming in/out on large scale warfare. Command up to 1000 land/air/sea units AND buildings in 4 tech tiers. Massive base building (no limit on individual unit types other than 1000 max cap) zoom in to near 1st person and hold space bar for a rotating close up higher detail cam view of battles, or zoom out past the clouds to see the entire MASSIVE map shrunk down to minimap scale and watch a sea of little enemy lights blink out. Even in 2014 it's a beautiful game, does not look out dated. Not quite as pretty as Tiberium Wars maxed out settings, but plenty of eye candy. Very replayable, different strategies, different races. If you've played and liked any of the other games mentioned above and the like, your collection is not complete without SupCom 1 and Forged Alliance, I've dusted off both many times.\n\nGames include the entry: Supreme Commander, a standalone expansion pack: SupCom- Forged Alliance, and Supcom 2 - which is a Square Enix takeover and is a dramatic change to the game. Highly recommend Buying Supcom 1 and Forged Alliance as a package deal.","September 29, 2014","true","27.7"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

With that being said, if you want this game for the campaign then you should get it. If you want the game just for multiplayer and skirmish matches, then get "Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance," as it outshines the original in that regard. It isn't a matter of this game being bad or unlikable, it is just that Forged Alliance offers more skirmish and multiplayer content for your money. If you're looking to play both then just get "Supreme Commander Gold Edition," as it includes both Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.\n\n(edit): People seem to be confused by this, so I'll say some more about this below:\nForged Alliance is a standalone expansion. You don't need the original to play it. Forged Alliance offers a new story and a new faction. It has all of the original maps and units, as well as some new stuff on the side. Forged Alliance also has a somewhat active modding community. If you want to play skirmish and/or multiplayer, Forged Alliance is a better buy. If you want the original story, Supreme Commander (the original) is a better buy. If you want both, get the "Gold Edition". I've seen it for as low as $5 on Steam.

The campaign is full of well executed missions and the cutscenes are well done too. It is the kind of commitment I see in every detail that most games nowadays are lacking.\n\nI can hardly comment on the multiplayer in steam version. I own the original release and activated the game in steam. The olden game had this gas powered games hosted multiplayer lobby system that worked excellently. As I've gathered the service has been ran down.  Leaving the steam version with only direct ip multiplayer. Which as consept sounds oh so very crippled when compared to the excellency that was the old multiplayer.\n\nOnly thing I could think to complain of ( in steam version ) is the lack of manual. Proper one existed for the non steam version of the game, however it has not been added to the steam version of the game. Not so terrible I suppose. I found it problematic because the game has well mapped hotkey controls.  It is much easier to control  your air units if you know that ctrl+a selects all air units.  The key mapping was only present in the game manual. So the steam owners might find it bit more difficult to organize their army than people who have the manual.","May 27, 2015","true","42.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

It is more like the big hairy uncle of yours that think bare knuckle boxing teaches character. Supreme Commander takes everything you'll find it in your standard RTS and supersizes it.\n\nFrom the very first mission onwards you will be overcome with a strange new feeling as you get thrown into a game with an almost unprecedented scale. The maps are not simply bigger than what you are used to, they blow everything previous to oblivion and the maps are not where this massive scale stops. Not only do you control massive armies and giant bases with humongous defensive networks but the units and buildings themselves are beyond what you usually find in an RTS game. Giant robots, massive spaceships and artillery pieces that can throw shells from Monday to Friday. If this game was a car I'd say the owner was compensating for something.\n\nVarious design mechanics are hard at work to keep it all from overwhelming you. The zoom function allows to you go right down to group level and all the way out to where you can see the entire map. Instead of having to build new tech every so often everything has an upgrade function allowing old factories to produce the latest and greatest in units, your defenses to stay effective and your resource gathers to not fall behind. The entire game and the buildup of power and technology that happens throughout a game is a very fluid process and only rarely do you find yourself having nothing to do.\n\nSomething that shouldn't be ignored either is that Supreme Commander, despite it's scale and the massive amount of units that can appear in a game manages to not only run really well, it also looks good.\n\nSupreme Commander is an RTS on steroids. It's like nothing we've seen for a very long time and it does everything it tries so very well.","December 13, 2012","true","54.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

There are 3 factions, each with a fairly large pool of different units to choose from (land, air, and water). The music and sound is decent.\n\nThe controls are typical of an RTS-game - lots of hotkeying and keystrokes if you are familiar with this type of gameplay. The learning curve is moderate to challenging - especially if you are unfamiliar with the RTS genre. The tutorials are very helpful and recommended if you want to get a quick grasp of the game. There are a number of difficulty settings when playing agains the AI (I always start of with a skirmish against the AI whenever I first try a new RTS).\n\nThere are two types of resources, energy and mass, and managing/balancing your upkeep of both is critical to being successful in this game. You can actually hit a standstill if you try to build/produce too many things at once and run out of resources. I still have not been able to find a way to cancel/delete buildings in progress, however, you are able to pass construction to free up resources.\n\nThe feedback in the game is very good - health bars over each unit, a +/- number indicating how much of either resource you are gaining/losing per second (you can switch this with an efficiency %). There are tabs for each research level when you are trying to build structures or train units. There isn't much detail on each unit type (I am used to seeing things like attack damage, defense, etc). From what I've seen, you are only provided with the unit/building health, type (ex: attack submarine, spy plane), and amount of time to train/build.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting, there is a nice cutscene in the beginning of the game that paints the setting for you.\n\nYou have a commander unit who can attack, build, and reclaim resources. This unit must survive, and you lose if he is defeated. To give a quick boost to resources, you can use your commander (or any engineer/construction units) to reclaim/absorb materials from things like buildings, forests, and destroyed structures/units. The commander unit can also upgrade his components (chest piece, left/right arm piece, back). For example, you can either give the commander a resource boosting arm (for when you use him to relaim material) or a weapons boost on his left arm (you can remove pieces if you wish; upgrading your commander is very expensive and usually done later in the game).\n\nGameplay is similar to many RTS-games I've played like Red Alert and Tiberian Sun series - there is a faction with cloaked units (radar sensor building to counter). A lot of the battles are decided by rock-paper-scissors mechanics (bombers to destroy buildings and/or slow-moving artillery, fighters to destroy bombers, anti-air to destroy both, tanks to destroy gun emplacements, etc). I do like the versatility of your commander - you can upgrade him to be more of a combat specialist or a building expert.\n\nOverall, I think you should give this game a try if you are interested in the theme or RTS-genre in general, however, the sequel is out, and for a cheaper price too. That being said, I would still give this game a playthrough - especially if you are an RTS-buff/junkie.\n\nRecommend!","July 28, 2014","true","2.0"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

I booted up the game from the disc and played campaign, after the first mission I fell in love with it instantly. I learned the controls and fucntions pretty easily and played for hours on end; making planetfall, constructing a base and an army, and took down the opposing commander(s). Although games can be pretty long and tedious to complete, it is still fun trying to protect yourself from onslaughts of planes, ships, and tanks while trying to create your own army. Multiplayer is just like campaign/skirmish: great gameplay, great fun, and with real people to play with or against.

Buying it on Steam gave me a trip down memory lane and a nostalgic feeling that was intensified by the fact that I could actually finish the game for once! The game itself is amazing. It has a resource system based on positive and negative income, the story and plot were immersive and rich for each different campaign, and the gameplay was and still is incredible. A friend of mine complained about the pathfinding for the units and they were mildly correct. Moving large amounts of troops is frustrating and a pain, but that frustration can be swept away as you watch your T3 units plow through enemy defenses.

The game could of been improved in many ways. The campaign was fun......in a few cases. Most missions took a long time, were frustrating at points and were just plain boring. The only massive point that makes this game fun, is the strategy needed in some missions, and in Skirmish.\n\nFor example. A horde of enemy units are incoming to your base. What do you do? Build a load of bombers and send them to those units? Quickly build some extra turrets and a bit of artillery? Nuke them!?!?\n\nAnother example. The enemy is amassing a massive group of High Tech Bombers, that could EASILY wreck your defences and base, and leave you open to an attack or re-run from the bombers. What do you do this time? Build more Anti-Air, attack the Bombers? Nuke them (Like before)? Be all "Come at meh, bro!"?\n\nEither way, Strategy and Thinking is needed to have the most fun in this.\n\nSo if you just want a game that you could just have a game of Strategy with enemy AI's that you can choose the difficulty of, this is the game for you.","February 21, 2014","true","52.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Normally you're limited to around 24 units due to food cap and stuff. This game however, is about having a MASSIVE army. Furthermore, the story is AMAZING, and I mean REALLY amazing. The controls and playstyle is a bit different from normal RTS, and it takes a bit to get truly comfortable with, but when you get it, it's even better than normal RTS! An example would be that you control a primary unit called the ACU, which is your primary builder. This unit can be upgraded in many ways, either to be the ultimate fighter, or the ultimate builder. It represents you on the battlefield. There's smaller builders such as engineers, support ACUs, etc. All in all a truly epic RTS game with more ways to play than there's brilliant units to build (and there are A LOT of units!).","December 1, 2011","true",""," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Supreme Commander is a good game.  When it came out it was known for being a resource hog, but computers have caught up to it now.  The successor SC 2 actually runs much better than this game.  Anyways, it is a fun game that allows you to create hundreds of units for massive battles.  My favorite thing is to cover my base in shields and build tons of long range artillery installations, then build a giant mass of aircraft to take out any stragglers.  The multiplayer is fun, but it is implemented better in 2.

You can make a crap load of troops and just have a massive battle. It feels like a real war, and it isn't like AoE where you can only have about 200 troops total.\n\nUnit diversity is key here. Unlike AoE 3, you cannot win by having a massive spam of the same few units.\n( AoE 3: 50 Skirmishers, 50 Uhlans, 20 Falconets and the rest musketeers )\nThis does make early combat VERY boring though, as several base turrets will mow down hundreds of your troops, which take about 7 seconds each.\nThere's LAND, AIR, and NAVAL combat, all in one. ( Some maps don't have water )\n\nThe actual involvement in combat is very little though, there isn't much to do, formations don't really matter, and it's hard to get a proper battle formation, because of the way the formations work. There aren't any abilities or anything either, and you can't really do much micro-ing, because everyone can just turn around and shoot while running, so there isn't really any point. Units die extremely quick anyways, so having a small army is meaningless unless they're high tier.\n\nThe 3 factions in the game don't really add any diversity whatsoever.\nI think it's to balance the game, but it kinda makes it dull. The only difference is the way the look.\n\nThe game is buggy on every OS that isn't Windows XP, so make sure you use a service pack or something.\n\nThere's a LOT of building required in this game. You have to probably build bases that are 1/10th of the map (By the Tier 3) I feel like there's too much focused on construction. I think I'm just building stuff 80% of the time.\n\nI can't find anyone to play multiplayer with, but when I look at it there were some pretty cool things. You can switch sides, and ally with people and stuff, just like AoE 2. You can also share resources if needed.\n\nOverall, I think it's a worth while game, but only for people who really want to play strategy, otherwise, it can be hard to get into.","October 30, 2013","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/9350/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Supreme Commander is one of the granddaddy Real Time Strategy games from the era of Starcraft 1 and the Command & Conquer games. Like its predecessor Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander is all about huge battlefields and hordes of units running around. No need to worry about building pylons or supply depots to increase your build limit, just mass produce your favorite units from your half dozen factories and overrun your enemies.\n\nAccording to the game’s opening cinematic, the Earth Empire spread out over the galaxy and eventually fractured into 3 factions. The UEF is the “old guard” faction that is probably closest to modern day United States. The Cybran Nation / Symbionts were born from a fusion of human brains with computers to create enhanced artificial intelligence. And the final faction Aeon Illuminate is kind of an enlightened (or cultish) group who follow an alien religion called The Way (even though the aliens themselves were wiped out long ago). Each faction has their own single player campaign to conquer the galaxy, and even though they cross over each other, they have mutually exclusive endings like Command & Conquer. They don’t all form a single story, like Starcraft.\n\nAt first glance, Supreme Commander seems to be built around the ACU (Armored Command Unit) which is a giant human shaped robot that strides across the battlefield blasting enemies and building structures. In reality though, the ACU is more like a mobile command center. Other than being a really tough builder unit, the ACU doesn’t have too much going for it. It can’t build the more advanced structures and it’s not such a great fighter. However, if you lose the ACU, you lose the game. If you’ve played the Command & Conquer games, you should be pretty comfortable starting up with Supreme Commander. For one thing, fixed defensive buildings (turrets) are extremely hard to kill, so turtling in is a really effective tactic in the single player campaign.\n\nIf you’re used to playing real time strategy games, Supreme Commander’s build system may seem counter-intuitive. You don’t need to have the money up front to buy units or buildings since everything is paid for “over time.” As soon as you start building something, the mass supply (your money) starts being drained a certain amount per second. If you run out of mass, the build pauses, but since your mass is also gained over time (not in little clusters like Starcraft), the actual effect is that your build just gets slowed down (as soon as your mass goes up +1, it gets drained for the building). This means you can start building your entire base at the start of every level, but you should probably let some of the buildings finish first, like power plants and mass extractors (money makers). It sounds weird when I try to explain it, but it makes sense when you play.\n\nProbably the biggest difference between Supreme Commander and a lot of other real time strategy games though, is the size of the level maps. The maps are so large that you need to use your mouse scroll wheel to constantly zoom in and out at different locations to see what’s going on. There’s no mini-map in the corner of your screen. The “tech levels” for Supreme Commander are also unlike many other real time strategy games. Your engineer (builder unit) can only build structures up to its current level, and the engineer cannot be upgraded. For example, a level 1 engineer can only build level 1 buildings. If you want to build level 3 buildings, you need to build a level 3 engineer. Every production building also upgrades tech levels independently. So if you have 2 land factories and one of them is level 2, only that factory can create level 2 buildings until you upgrade the second land factory. Honestly it seems like a waste of time to me, especially if you like to build large numbers of factories at once to really pump out the units.\n\nPros:\n+Huge maps with room for massive battles between armies of units. The Air, Land, and Sea are your battlefield, and along with the expansive area, there’s a huge variety of units to choose from. There is a unit cap, but it doesn’t seem to be explicitly stated anywhere. If you just set all your factories to autobuild units, you’ll reach the cap eventually.\n+Artillery! Long range bombardment is probably my favorite weapon in real time strategy games. You can have mobile missile launchers and even fixed artillery launcher buildings pounding your enemies. There are also strategic missile launchers (nukes) but the enemy can build strategic missile defense structures that automatically counter your nukes, so I don’t really see the point.\n+The game is quite long, so if you are enjoying yourself, you can kill over 30 hours just playing through the 3 single player campaigns. There only seem to be 6 levels each, but they’re not straightforward “kill everything” missions. They usually expand the map several times each level (complete an objective, boom the map doubles in size and you’re now surrounded). Fortunately, Supreme Commander has a “speed up time” option that increases the rate the game plays. You can play at up to 10x normal speed, but you should really only do this if you’re waiting for your buildings/units to finish construction.\n\nCons:\n-The game can be hard to get used to, especially the formations of troops when you have a large army. The naval units especially take multiple commands to get them to form up how you want them. The game’s tutorial is not in an obvious place in the main menu. It really should have been either part of the “campaign menu” or right above “campaign” at the start. Instead, it’s kind of in the middle of options.\n-Since you’re constantly zoomed out on the battlefield to get an overview of the map, you really don’t get to see much in the way of graphics. You mostly just see dots firing more dots at enemy dots. Granted, the game is pretty old so you shouldn’t be expecting top notch graphics as the main draw.\n\nOverall, the game is fun for people who enjoy real time strategy games. There are no steam achievements, so if you just want to see the story you can set the game to easy and slog your way through. Yes, even on easy mode it will take quite a while to beat the game because of just how massive the levels are. Remember to build up your base defenses, and the computer will crack its head open on your turrets.\n","April 6, 2015","true","30.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Both games have pros and cons, but I honestly prefer the original SC over Forged Alliance, and here's why:\n\nYeah, FA has all the DLC and everything, but it's not the same.  AI seems to be worse, and from my experience I can't stockpile resources nearly as well in FA, as from about 2 minutes into the game, even on easy bots, you begin undertaking a lot of strategic bombings by the bots and if you don't stack AA then you get screwed early game.\n\nThe hud, I must admit, is much better in FA however you can get used to the bigger, more blocky HUD in Supreme Commander 1 very easily.\n\nIGN rating: 10/10, Horrible.\n\nPROS OF SC ORIGINAL:\n-Easier stockpiling\n-Campaign Mode\n-Seems to run a bit smoother\n-Better AI (opinion)\n-More 'splosions\n\nCONS:\n-Big hud that takes up some portion of the screen\n-Graphics fall behind the polished FA edition\n-Doesn't have all DLC\n\nI say try out Supreme Commander, if you like it, then buy Forged Alliance.\n\nThat is all :D","September 22, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love Total Annihilation, Planetary Annihilation is a ♥♥♥♥ing abomination, and I wanted a TA-like RTS.  This is how you do it, a gem by Gas Powered Games and THQ (now replaced with Nordic, who moved the game to Steamworks servers).  It's got a great artstyle, three exceptional campaigns with intriguing and well-executed stories, and a small but dedicated and polite online community.\n\nThere's literally nothing I can say against this game.  Total Annihilation, Age of Empires II, and Red Alert II remain my all-time favorite RTS games, but this game has completely replaced TA on that list.  It crushed my nostalgic love for the game with full 3D visuals and fantastic gameplay, an accomplishment that should never be overlooked.\n\nWhereas most RTS's fall apart in the singleplayer department, this game's campaigns stand the test of time with quality writing and great missions.  While some lack proper multiplayer-ing, this game's netcode gets the job done well, now under the eternal watch of Gaben and the Steamworks serverlist\nin the clouds.  It's also very compatible with modern hardware and runs well on a variety of systems.  There's plenty of lasting value with three campaigns and factions who all play differently from each other and an active multiplayer scene.\n\nI seriously can't recommend this game enough, it's one of the best RTS's I've ever had the pleasure of trying.  Ever.  Simply put, you need to buy this and Forged Alliances as soon as you can.  You're doing a disservice to yourself by not giving it a chance.","October 17, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Forged Alliance is better in every respect and it's a stand-alone expansion, so just play that.\n\n-----ORIGINAL REVIEW-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI would recommend playing Supreme Commander - at the end of the day it's a really fun game, and it has its incredible moments.  However, this game did not live up to its legendary reputation for me.  Granted, I don't like playing RTS multiplayer because I don't find it fun spending hours optimizing every mouse click, so this is based on my experience with singleplayer.\n\nThis game puzzles me because some aspects are mind-blowingly cool, and others are absolutely moronic.  Examples of the mind-blowingly cool stuff:\n\n- Battleships that grow legs and walk on land AKA the most radical amphibian assaults you can imagine.\n- Giant artillery guns that can fire on enemy bases continents away.\n- An incredibly deep economy based on "Mass" which is used to produce things, and "Energy" which is consumed while you produce things.\n- Experimental units AKA GIANT LASER SPIDER ROBOTS WTF!!!\n- Tactical nuclear missle launches.\n\n...and the list goes on.  But then you get to the moronic crap:\n\n- Units and Buildings share a unit limit - if you build too many units, you can't build anymore buildings.  HUH?!?!?!?\n- Tutorial is basically "Welcome to the tutorial!  Here is a button that opens the in-game 20-page manual.  Thanks for playing the tutorial!"\n- Units have no sense of self-preservation and make no attempts to escape enemy fire - if a unit cannot fire back at the attacking enemy, it will just sit there like an idiot and let itself die.\n- No unit formations (that's kind of basic for an RTS).\n\nand also (and this is absolutely infurianting), all your land units act like distracted people at a stoplight.  When you give them a move order, the ones at the front will wait a second, then start moving, and the remaining units will not move until the ones in front of them have moved.  Imagine giving a square formation of tanks an order to move into an enemy base - that nice tight formation will spread itself out into vulnerable line, and instead of a wall of firepower overwhelming the enemy, your tanks will end up entering the enemy base one at a time politely letting the enemy defenses individually pick them off.\n\nThis is unacceptable.  I don't know if it's intentional, or if there's some way to prevent this I don't know about - but in a game that's all about large scale conflict, it's unacceptable to give a large group of units a move order and end up with some of them still at your base waiting for their turn to move while the front of the column is already at the enemy base getting killed because they have no back up.\n\nBut like I said, at the end of the day, it was fun to play and the cool moments this game provides are worth it.  I just don't think this is the RTS masterpiece that everyone claims it is.","May 8, 2015","false","26.1"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

It has good ideas, but they are poorly implemented.  Painfully slow build times on units and structures, mass fabricators destroying any need to control the map and the resources scattered across it, and incredibly powerful defenses turn this into a painful slog.  The ability to control and upgrade the commander who represents you in the game is neat at first, but they quickly become the big can which sits in the middle of its defense riddled, mass fabricator clogged base and never leaves.  Because if the commander does leave, it runs a good chance of dying and losing the match.\n\nWhat the game offers:  The Basics\n\nYou play as a commander aligned with one of three factions which can build basic structures.  The factories let you get fabricators which build even better structures.  Upgrade the factories to get better fabricators for better structures and units.  You also need to balance production with your resource income, so make sure you're building mass pumps, power generators, and mass fabricators to meet your base's growing needs.\n\nWhen it comes to crushing the opposition, you are given many options, and your three starting ones are land units, naval units, and air units.  At higher fabricator tiers, you can get long range artillery, stealth, experimental units, and strategic missle launchers (nukes).  Of course, all of this can be countered easily at lower cost by defenses.  In order to defeat an enemy, you need to either catch their commander while it's exposed or have an overwhelming advantage to push through their defenses.\n\nMass pumps provide the most mass at the lowest energy cost, but they can only be built atop mass deposits scattered across the map.  Ideally, the game would become a battle to control and defend mass pumps for a production edge over the opponent.  Sadly, mass fabricators destroy this by allowing a player to acquire all of the mass they will ever need from the comfort and safety of their own base, often at a faster pace and at less expense.\n\nThe factions are almost entirely aesthetics, with their only major differences being what experimental units they can build.  They all have the same unit classes and structures which do the same jobs.  There are small bits of fluff like "Aeon bomber does damage over (a very short) time, cybran bomber does slightly less damage over a slightly larger area, and UEF is a typical bomber with a large explosion and good damage."  But ultimately the differences are minimal.\n\nThree Campaigns\n\nThe story is decent in each of the three races' campaigns, but the basics makes them a slow mess.  Even the first map in the campaign takes at least forty minutes to finish simply because of how long it takes to build everything and amass enough firepower to win.  And it only goes down hill from there.  Expect one to two hours for each campaign map.\n\nSkirmishes with AI's\n\nThese often take just as long as the campaign maps, although tech rushing (spending all of your resources on obtaining max tech units and structures as quickly as possible) can end an AI opponent quickly.  It is impossible to beat the AI at spamming mass fabricators, so be prepared for a long slog if the battle isn't ended quickly.  The AI skirmishes also seem to be buggy and occasionally crash to desktop for me, so beware.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nAs other reviews have stated, look at Forged Alliances if you want an active online community.  I haven't tried it, but from what I have read online, expect cheese.\n\n\nThis game may be worth buying on sale.  If you're really liking some of these ideas, I'd recommend Planetary Annihilation when it is on sale instead if you don't mind its lack of a story filled campaign.  It uses a large number of the same ideas in Supreme Commander, but is a better tuned experience overall.","October 28, 2015","false","22.6"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","2","14","0","0"

All you had to do was build some defense so their small attack forces couldn't touch your base. And then build a small force of artillery and a little bit of front line tanks and destroy their whole base from the distance while they did nothing about it. The good part about the story is that the missions were pretty long in length so each battle felt like there was more to it. The multi player seems to be LAN and then you can join people hosting if you had their IP? I'm not actually sure, but this is pretty bad unless you find some community who host regularly but I personnaly don't like fighting the same people over and over in an RTS.","March 17, 2014","false","14.8"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"

This makes it easy for the enemy to pick off your units one by one. I feel this game comes no where close to the Command & Conquer games.

Despite claims to the contrary, SupCom is a 100% remake of TA. Really - it is the same game. No innovation whatsoever, unless you count the pointless super-zoom-out as innovative. The game is about extreme amounts of tiny units clashing on huge battlefields, as it always has been. But I find it rather surprising how badly this is done here. With so many units doing different jobs, it is completely impossible to micromanage all of them in a meaningful way. And yet, that is what the game expects you to do. No AI scripts you can employ (Warlords Battlecry and Dark Reign had those more than 15 years ago), no platoons or even the most basic combat formations (like Earth 2150 had back in the 90s). Without any kind of aid, managing your army is a tedious chore. Once you get into actual battle, it is an exercise in frustration. I fail to understand how seasoned developers could ♥♥♥♥ up so badly.

Issuing orders to them after they all line up is useless they wont move or attack or do anything and if you cant move your units then its impossible to play the game. All that being said I do not recommend this game.","May 7, 2015","false","6.4"," 3 of 18 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","3","18","2","0"

Yes, you can navigate around the menu and figure it out, but while you do this your units are being destroyed on the main front. Another sever defect is when you attempt to select masses of units and instruct them to move. Some do, most do not.  The result is an overwhelming number of your units move in a slow column of a few units directly into the jaws if a numerically inferior enemy and are killed one by one.

I also must be missing some feature that allows you to speed up the game to get through the mind-numbingly slog of time wasted on building ships.

At first i thought i was going to end up with a very chugging along slow grand scale war situation like the old gargantuan wargame from the early 1990s UMS (UNIVERSAL MILITARY SIMULATOR). Instead i found something that played with the massive variety of units of TOTAL ANNIHILATION and depth of such old time classics like BATTLE ISLE and THE PERFECT GENERAL done in real time with stunning movie like battle visuals. It was a eerie scary sight to see a huge enemy frigate when destroyed actually roll over on its side and sink like something out of a old time war reel. Plenty of time will be spent on building bases and units but you are free to acttack or do recon missions etc at any time. Building bases is alot of fun with plenty of upgrades which one has to invest heavy resources of mass and or energy to make possible.\n\nGraphics- Very immersive with plenty of visual detail when it comes to things like air units going into and dive and crashing with 3d depth not to mention the consequences as the explosion from the crash can damage any nearby structures and or units. Everything is done in layers of depth and mass so all that wreckage on the field will actually get in your way the cool thing is you can get it out of your way by salvaging as resources or in the case of one of your own buildings being wrecked you can rebuild the same building over the wrecked one taking half the time it normally would to build it. There are plenty of video popups of the other commanders friendly and enemy reminding you your not alone on the battlefield and you have objectives to complete. The enemy on the other hand is sending plenty of threats and taunts your way which enrich the war mood of battles.\n\nSound- Excellent use of sfx making everything seem like you on another world in some futuristic time with sci-fi weapons designed to deliever devastation to your enemies and your own units if your too close when they explode in a raging fire storm of nuclear death.\n\nSum Total- A must buy sci-fi wargame which really delievers. If you have not played it yet now is the time with the beefy computer systems of today and the past year that can easily handle its beefy overhead.\n\nThank you Chris Taylor and company for the fantastic satisfying work :D\n","June 5, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At times the pace feels slow, particularly when setting up your initial base on a large map, however, when you find yourself being hammered by endless hordes of your opponents forces, almost in a panic trying to grind out a force good enough to repel the attacks, all the while desperately defending your resource production line, you will at times miss the slower pace of the base building phase.\n\nThe story is somewhat shallow and is really just a hook to guide you from world to world, ultimately leading to that all important end-game battle, but you didn’t come here for the story, did you?\n\nMultiplayer is the most fun aspect of this game. It is even more enjoyable when you play locally and can hear your opponent scream and curse you when you expertly execute a fast air attack, taking out metal production and temporary shutting down his unit production. The matches can be long arduous events and occasionally the victor might be determined by someone giving in, rather than a skilful victory, but still there is much fun to be had, just choose the map according to the intended game time.\n\nWith all that said Supreme commander is a lot of fun and well worth your invested time and energy.","April 2, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, it's hard to balance properly - you've got 3 unit factories building units, and then you run out, so all of them stall, wasting more time than if you had built one at a time right.\n\nWhat Supreme Commander does is sort out those balance issues, and expand on the progressive economy aspect.\nUnits, buildings, upgrades, super weapon use... all of these things are linked into the economy almost 100%, with time being the only real drain on that percentage (super weapons take a proportionate amount of time to build etc).\n\nBuilding thirty different buildings including factories, defences and superweapons as well as running 12 different factories and existing artillery/superweapons and out of resources?\nSimple! Pause production on a few of the factories and some of the superweapons production.\nNot enough? Stop the artillery from firing, maybe even turn off some shield generators or resource converters.\nSounds simple, but it's on such a large scale that it feels like running a proper future war economy.\n\nNow, maybe you've decided that you REALLY need to get some of those buildings built. Ok then, convert dead units into resources. Not enough? Convert functional units into resources, or maybe one of the buildings you don't really need?\n\nHaven't got the time to convert things into resources? Ok then, build your buildings over the destroyed remains of the same kind, that'll cut the time and resource cost by up to half!\n\nOr hell, you could go full city planning mode and arrange your resource-consuming buildings next to your resource-producing buildings.\nWhy do that? "Does the electricity not have to go as far, so therefore it's more efficient?" you might smirk and say, but yes actually.\n\nBuilding like this puts in place what are basically powerlines between the buildings. This synergistic effect is incredibly noticeable almost immediately - a building produces 20 of a resource, or produces 20 of a resource and reduces the cost of the same in another building by 1%, and you can fit 20 along the sides of the building?\n\nThis actually adds another element of risk though, big resource producers take a lot of synergised buildings with them, and those that survive take pretty hefty damage, which is what you'd expect - energy substation just got blown up, it's going to take some appliances down with it.\n\nAnd on top of all of the above, on top of all the super weapons you'd expect in an RTS, there is the commander unit.\nA core engineer unit isn't anything new to RTS games, but have the same potential for hilarity.\n\nEver rushed an enemy with SCVs in StarCraft just to mess with their heads?\nWhat about rushing them with a veritable super weapon that unleashes a thermonuclear explosion when it dies?\nNot even Michael Baysplosion could hope to top that.","April 3, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whether it be a 2 on 2match with AI or friends, with tons of maps to choose from with some beautiful scenery and modifiers if wanted. only downside which there arent many, is the lack in fation variation. its not awful persay, but choosing  a team makes no strategic difference other than the aesthetic look between the Cybran, UEF, or Aeons as they all have almost identical classes, structures, and units. Maps also play asymmetrical which leaves every round balanced and challenging. Again I have to back up to the first thing i said, its sucks that this game was passed up by alot of ppl so multiplayer is nearly impoissble especially now a days but if you have a buddy with the game and/or up for a good hour long battle then look no further.

At first i thought i was going to end up with a very chugging along slow grand scale war situation like the old gargantuan wargame from the early 1990s UMS (UNIVERSAL MILITARY SIMULATOR). Instead i found something that played with the massive variety of units of TOTAL ANNIHILATION and depth of such old time classics like BATTLE ISLE and THE PERFECT GENERAL done in real time with stunning movie like battle visuals. It was a eerie scary sight to see a huge enemy frigate when destroyed actually roll over on its side and sink like something out of a old time war reel. Plenty of time will be spent on building bases and units but you are free to acttack or do recon missions etc at any time. Building bases is alot of fun with plenty of upgrades which one has to invest heavy resources of mass and or energy to make possible.\n\nGraphics- Very immersive with plenty of visual detail when it comes to things like air units going into and dive and crashing with 3d depth not to mention the consequences as the explosion from the crash can damage any nearby structures and or units. Everything is done in layers of depth and mass so all that wreckage on the field will actually get in your way the cool thing is you can get it out of your way by salvaging as resources or in the case of one of your own buildings being wrecked you can rebuild the same building over the wrecked one taking half the time it normally would to build it. There are plenty of video popups of the other commanders friendly and enemy reminding you your not alone on the battlefield and you have objectives to complete. The enemy on the other hand is sending plenty of threats and taunts your way which enrich the war mood of battles.\n\nSound- Excellent use of sfx making everything seem like you on another world in some futuristic time with sci-fi weapons designed to deliever devastation to your enemies and your own units if your too close when they explode in a raging fire storm of nuclear death.\n\nSum Total- A must buy sci-fi wargame which really delievers. If you have not played it yet now is the time with the beefy computer systems of today and the past year that can easily handle its beefy overhead.\n\nThank you Chris Taylor and company for the fantastic satisfying work :D\n","June 5, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though this game disapeared off the shelves before I could snag it on Console, and since I prefer RTS on PC (Obvious reasons). For years he would Nag and I would always say: "I still can't find this game in stores, nor on the Xbox Live Marketplace" and then I found it on Steam. All I have to say is this is a beast of a game and is definitely worth every penny you pay for it, and if you don't like the Classic RTS then you can get the Second one which favors rushing tactics were this game makes that difficult or if not completely impossible.\n-Debate:\nNow I am aware of the HUGE debate on which is better the first or second, let me just settle that here: The First game(s) are more for RTS with emphsis on the S (Strategy). The second one is more for the newer people to RTS it is less complex and is much more fast paced. You can say this is better in which you are right as a RTS but for people who want to start or try a RTS the second one if for you.\n-!WARNING!-\nMy friends used to play this game ALL DAY LONG and I wondered why and I found out it was a huge time consumer. If you buy this and play it expect to spend atleast 30+ minutes in a game, as I am writing this review I was up till 4 AM Playing the second I think campaign level it lasted 4 hours legit. However those four hours were the most intense four hours I've ever had in a game.\n-Gamemodes:\nIf you are anything like me, you won't buy a single RTS unless it has a Skirmish mode or some sort of Scenario mode were you fight AI as this mode is were this game shines\n- Skirmish - 1-8 Players/AI 1,000 Unit Cap for all on massive maps as one of the three factions and is highly customizeable\n- Campaign - Restricted version of Skirmish where you only get certain units (I'll go in depth later) with objectives thrown in from time to time and smaller unit cap\n- Multiplayer - Same as Skirmish but with Players/AI (Haven't touched multiplayer yet)\n- Sandbox - It allows you to test out units as you want to test them for all factions all at once\n-Graphics:\n(N/A) Lol, really? You shouldn't really care about this since it is a RTS game but graphically it looks like a HD RTS, it doesn't look dated at all to me and it can be set to look equivalent to the sequel. Some of the models however look really ridiculous in my opinion compared to the newer looks in the second.\n-Sound:\n(10/10) Excellent sound track it fits so perfectly and it changes depending on your Status, the sounds of units are typical of RTS with some older RTS annoyances absent.\n-Gameplay:\n(9/10) In comparison to both the first and second they play identically, other then progression were this game utilizes the Tech system while the Second utilizes the Research system. The amount of units you deal with is truely massive and it is kind of required to use atleast 100 units to do most of the campaign missions. This game is brutal to strategies as you have to execute them perfectly in order to achieve victory and that is due to the double edged sword that is how forgiving this game is. You can easily fix a mistake in this game but it will make the game last longer and the AI aswell as other players benefit from this. However when you play this game they make it feel underwhelming dealing with the mass (Pun intended) of units you deal with, which is actually very beneficial. The big issue this game suffers is the polished Strategic view in the second game and requires more micromanagement then the second, but the AI for this are not stupid and won't blindly follow orders like they do on the second.\nYou win by Killing the Enemies ACU (Armed Command Unit) who then explodes into the most rewarding nuclear fireworks show ever nothing is more satisfying then this and even the campaign does a slow mo Zoomed in view during this. However most of the game units feel more like cannon fodder in comparison to the second where all units can be made effective via researching. Building and researching is a slow process it litterally tells you how long it takes to research something or build something and they usually range in the 3 minute section (You can speed this up with engineers).\n-AI:\n(7/10) The AI are no push overs, and WILL AND DEFINITELY WILL ADAPT TO YOUR STRATEGY and counter it (This is why games take so long). They will rebuild, make defenses and play EXACTLY like a player would difficulty does nothing but give them abilities to cheat. Teammate AI however is a Joke and they will almost never assisst you and will always try to expand even into your Territories regardless of your needs and take what they want.\nNow the Unit AI is a big problem in this game even more so then the second one: Units can be stuck in the most stupid situations and they usually cannot be recovered or they will not follow your orders at all.\n-Balance:\n(9/10) In terms of Balance all factions are literally EQUAL and no faction is better then the other unlike the second were they favored certain playstyles (However those Aeon Morter anti unit cannons kill wayyyyy too quickly in my opinion). Until you get to the endgame (Experimentals).\nStrategies are equally difficult including Rushing.\n-Economy:\nResources are infinite but runs on a resources system absent in most newer RTS's, in which economy management has to be done such as: Shutting down factories, Supply and Demand, and Constant expense of resource. If you play smart you will never run into this problem unless you need to do a 180 on your strategy.\n-Strategy:\nThis is were the first shines in its many ways to win:\n- Cold War -\n- Weapons Race -\n- Nuclear War -\n- Ground war -\n- Turtling -\n- Rushing -\n- Sabotage -\n- Economy Crashing - Unique to the first game\n- Assassination -\nJust a few different ways/strategies that can happen in game\n-Tutorial:\n(9/10) The tutorial is pretty good at covering everything, but doesn't teach you anything, and I did NOT notice any learning curve that people been complaining about.\n\n-TL:DR-\n(10/10) If you played RTS games that are old, you'll like this game (Your anti-virus won't however). If you are new, you should still give it a try it is not as difficult as people say it is or try the Second then return here young one. Even if you aren't interested in this game it is definitely a must own for any Hardcore RTS player like myself.\n\n- Troubleshooting -\nOh you are reading through the reviews and you cannot get the game to run? Well I had a few issues and I will clear up a few here.\n- Compatability: This game is Compatable with Windows 8.1 unlike what most people say, however it isn't with anti-virus software.\n- Trojan Virus: This game is Not a virus despite your dumb as hell Anti-Virus program would like to say, and your anti-virus will cause it to bug out and crash and corrupt its files\n^ How to fix ^\n1.) Go to your anti-virus software's Fire Wall settings;\n2.) Go to Allowed/Ignored/Whitelist\n3.) Click add\n4.) Click browse or find the program listed then click allowed\nYou'll find it in C:\ProgramFiles(86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common\SupremeCommander\Bin it will be the Supreme Commander.Exe make sure you also add the other executables in the bin too as I found that makes it not happen a lot less\nPro Tips:\n-Never Launch this game at start up as your Anti virus may freak out as it is still "Waking up" and will cause it to delete the executeable\n- Executed Executable: Missing your Executable? Heres how to get it back\n1.) Go to Library on Steam\n2.) Click the Game go to options on it until the options submenu opens\n3.) Now find the option that says Verify Cache and run it\n4.) Wait about 10-30 minutes for it to fix deleted files\n*5.) Re-add Supreme Commander.exe to your whitelist on anti-virus software","July 23, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, it's hard to balance properly - you've got 3 unit factories building units, and then you run out, so all of them stall, wasting more time than if you had built one at a time right.\n\nWhat Supreme Commander does is sort out those balance issues, and expand on the progressive economy aspect.\nUnits, buildings, upgrades, super weapon use... all of these things are linked into the economy almost 100%, with time being the only real drain on that percentage (super weapons take a proportionate amount of time to build etc).\n\nBuilding thirty different buildings including factories, defences and superweapons as well as running 12 different factories and existing artillery/superweapons and out of resources?\nSimple! Pause production on a few of the factories and some of the superweapons production.\nNot enough? Stop the artillery from firing, maybe even turn off some shield generators or resource converters.\nSounds simple, but it's on such a large scale that it feels like running a proper future war economy.\n\nNow, maybe you've decided that you REALLY need to get some of those buildings built. Ok then, convert dead units into resources. Not enough? Convert functional units into resources, or maybe one of the buildings you don't really need?\n\nHaven't got the time to convert things into resources? Ok then, build your buildings over the destroyed remains of the same kind, that'll cut the time and resource cost by up to half!\n\nOr hell, you could go full city planning mode and arrange your resource-consuming buildings next to your resource-producing buildings.\nWhy do that? "Does the electricity not have to go as far, so therefore it's more efficient?" you might smirk and say, but yes actually.\n\nBuilding like this puts in place what are basically powerlines between the buildings. This synergistic effect is incredibly noticeable almost immediately - a building produces 20 of a resource, or produces 20 of a resource and reduces the cost of the same in another building by 1%, and you can fit 20 along the sides of the building?\n\nThis actually adds another element of risk though, big resource producers take a lot of synergised buildings with them, and those that survive take pretty hefty damage, which is what you'd expect - energy substation just got blown up, it's going to take some appliances down with it.\n\nAnd on top of all of the above, on top of all the super weapons you'd expect in an RTS, there is the commander unit.\nA core engineer unit isn't anything new to RTS games, but have the same potential for hilarity.\n\nEver rushed an enemy with SCVs in StarCraft just to mess with their heads?\nWhat about rushing them with a veritable super weapon that unleashes a thermonuclear explosion when it dies?\nNot even Michael Baysplosion could hope to top that.","April 3, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A 1/2 hour at most to grasp on its core gameplay and a variety of customization to play how u like. Whether it be a 2 on 2match with AI or friends, with tons of maps to choose from with some beautiful scenery and modifiers if wanted. only downside which there arent many, is the lack in fation variation. its not awful persay, but choosing  a team makes no strategic difference other than the aesthetic look between the Cybran, UEF, or Aeons as they all have almost identical classes, structures, and units. Maps also play asymmetrical which leaves every round balanced and challenging. Again I have to back up to the first thing i said, its sucks that this game was passed up by alot of ppl so multiplayer is nearly impoissble especially now a days but if you have a buddy with the game and/or up for a good hour long battle then look no further.

The unit/building limit is another way to stay focused on what's important and not. In addition to the variety and levels of units and structures, the game builds up and evolves very naturally, make you switch between tactics as you get new units, tech levels or scenario modifiers.\n\nThe story flows in parallel for each faction, this means that the first faction you play will give you insight of the perspective of the scenario, making the next faction you play a little more predictible (as you now know where the enemy is, and from where it will come). Not a bad thing (if you like to take advantage of this) nor a good thing (if you wanted a linear story, one episode after the other).\n\nIn a nutshell: you must think out of the box, it's a new and better kind of strategy!","February 4, 2015","true","50.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want upgraded units, you simply have to build the level 2 factories. Real simple but the trick is mastering your empire. It's great fun and should run on midrange computers.

At first i thought i was going to end up with a very chugging along slow grand scale war situation like the old gargantuan wargame from the early 1990s UMS (UNIVERSAL MILITARY SIMULATOR). Instead i found something that played with the massive variety of units of TOTAL ANNIHILATION and depth of such old time classics like BATTLE ISLE and THE PERFECT GENERAL done in real time with stunning movie like battle visuals. It was a eerie scary sight to see a huge enemy frigate when destroyed actually roll over on its side and sink like something out of a old time war reel. Plenty of time will be spent on building bases and units but you are free to acttack or do recon missions etc at any time. Building bases is alot of fun with plenty of upgrades which one has to invest heavy resources of mass and or energy to make possible.\n\nGraphics- Very immersive with plenty of visual detail when it comes to things like air units going into and dive and crashing with 3d depth not to mention the consequences as the explosion from the crash can damage any nearby structures and or units. Everything is done in layers of depth and mass so all that wreckage on the field will actually get in your way the cool thing is you can get it out of your way by salvaging as resources or in the case of one of your own buildings being wrecked you can rebuild the same building over the wrecked one taking half the time it normally would to build it. There are plenty of video popups of the other commanders friendly and enemy reminding you your not alone on the battlefield and you have objectives to complete. The enemy on the other hand is sending plenty of threats and taunts your way which enrich the war mood of battles.\n\nSound- Excellent use of sfx making everything seem like you on another world in some futuristic time with sci-fi weapons designed to deliever devastation to your enemies and your own units if your too close when they explode in a raging fire storm of nuclear death.\n\nSum Total- A must buy sci-fi wargame which really delievers. If you have not played it yet now is the time with the beefy computer systems of today and the past year that can easily handle its beefy overhead.\n\nThank you Chris Taylor and company for the fantastic satisfying work :D\n","June 5, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And yet, this spiritual successor improves upon its unique RTS formula in almost every way possible. The price was worth it just for the single player campaigns, and I haven't even touched multiplayer yet.\nThere's a simple hierarchy of 4 tiers and gives you so many options in combat. Unlimited resources (in a manner of speaking) lets you do more than other RTS games would. Even though Starcraft 1 and 2 are my favourite RTS games ever, this game is very refreshing in comparison with the freedom you have. You can turtle effectively with an impenetrable base and use long range nuclear missiles or artillery battery to destroy your opponent. You can send a swarm of 200 gunships to take them out. Or use an army of Tier 3 siege bots and AA bots. And you can use aircraft, land units and naval units. Then there's the unique, experimental units which take a lot of effort to build but are very fun to watch wrecking things. And let's not forget the ability to zoom out or in to almost any degree you feel like.\nThe main campaigns are good and fun, even though the pacing could be a little better. I'd like to use the tier 3 siege bots, battleships and gunships a bit earlier. And you don't get to use the experimental units until halfway through the last mission- which is a little disappointing.\nThere are only a few things I would say are bad about the game. Compared to Starcraft, it feels a lot slower. You need air transport to get your engineers anywhere other than your main base in an acceptable time fashion. Queing orders when selecting multiple units sometimes results in them repeating builds that have already been done, wasting precious time. The campaign also has an annoying unit limit that applies to buildings as well, and there's no quick way to delete units if need be. A simple "delete" command would have been nice. Commanding armies has advanced controls but the units themselves still bump into each other and not attack as a clumped group (like Starcraft 2 handles very well). Projectiles operate in an immersive way, with bullets or missiles homing or not depending on the unit, but some units are nearly impossible to kill efficiently without transporting engineers and building defenses (tier 3 air superiority, ugh).\nThe graphics are very impressive considering how old the game is, and I still like zooming in to inspect all the high tech lights and power networks I construct.\nMy life for the Aeon Illuminate!","February 11","true","37.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played it for years prior to getting it on Steam.  Anyway, just here to let people know that if you're a die hard fan like me, you should get the BlackOps Mods.  You can always just turn them off in game if you don't like them, but I doubt that will be the case.  They are:\n\nBlackOpsACUs, BlackOpsEXUnits, BlackOpsNavalBalance, BlackOpsUnleashed.  - These Mods are extrmemely well done, to the extent of not even being able to tell where the original game ends, and these Mods begin.  Highlights include new units in every tech level which alter play strategies, and new experimentals which balance the races.  About half of the new experientals are superior to the orginal games experimentals.  My favorite addition though is what they did to the ACUs.  Through a massive restructure, you can upgrade commanders through each tech level up to experimental level.  Ever want your ACU to stand toe to toe with a colossus? Well, now you can.\n\nI would also recommend getting Sorian_AI_Mod_2.1.2. - This almost doubles the amount of AI to choose from when selecting which AI to fight against in skirmish or multiplayer missions, and at its peak, adds a level of difficulty far superior to the original game, guaranteed to challenge even the most veteran players.","October 11, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played it for years prior to getting it on Steam.  Anyway, just here to let people know that if you're a die hard fan like me, you should get the BlackOps Mods.  You can always just turn them off in game if you don't like them, but I doubt that will be the case.  They are:\n\nBlackOpsACUs, BlackOpsEXUnits, BlackOpsNavalBalance, BlackOpsUnleashed.  - These Mods are extrmemely well done, to the extent of not even being able to tell where the original game ends, and these Mods begin.  Highlights include new units in every tech level which alter play strategies, and new experimentals which balance the races.  About half of the new experientals are superior to the orginal games experimentals.  My favorite addition though is what they did to the ACUs.  Through a massive restructure, you can upgrade commanders through each tech level up to experimental level.  Ever want your ACU to stand toe to toe with a colossus? Well, now you can.\n\nI would also recommend getting Sorian_AI_Mod_2.1.2. - This almost doubles the amount of AI to choose from when selecting which AI to fight against in skirmish or multiplayer missions, and at its peak, adds a level of difficulty far superior to the original game, guaranteed to challenge even the most veteran players.","October 11, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The war has gone on for I believe over 1,000 years, making the World Wars look like small skirmishes.\n\nSupreme Commander has a wide variety of units, and is more complicated than its sequal, Supreme Commander 2.\n\nAlthough the down part is that the matches can be SUPER HUGE and possibly super long, and with the addition of possibly 200-1000 units for each player, the game can get Pretty Sl-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ow-w-w-w...\n\nDespite that, the game is great and fun.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\n1. If you are going to get this game alone, I recommend getting it on-sale. It's usually 80% off. (3 bucks)\n2. If you get the game AND the expansion, go for it. But I also recommend getting on-sale. It's usually 5 bucks for both.\n3. If you get the expansion, Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, let me repeat...\nHIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting Forged Alliance Forever (FAF).\n*NOTE: FAF is not compatible with the vanilla game, Supreme Commander, only Forged Alliance*\n\nFAF is a community made for Forged Alliance so you can play matches with others online.\n\nTL;DR I recommend this game if your an RTS fan, but get it on-sale, it's more worth it.\nBut I HIGHLY Recommend you get this and the expansion for the story mode and get FAF for multiplayer.","February 18","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And yet, this spiritual successor improves upon its unique RTS formula in almost every way possible. The price was worth it just for the single player campaigns, and I haven't even touched multiplayer yet.\nThere's a simple hierarchy of 4 tiers and gives you so many options in combat. Unlimited resources (in a manner of speaking) lets you do more than other RTS games would. Even though Starcraft 1 and 2 are my favourite RTS games ever, this game is very refreshing in comparison with the freedom you have. You can turtle effectively with an impenetrable base and use long range nuclear missiles or artillery battery to destroy your opponent. You can send a swarm of 200 gunships to take them out. Or use an army of Tier 3 siege bots and AA bots. And you can use aircraft, land units and naval units. Then there's the unique, experimental units which take a lot of effort to build but are very fun to watch wrecking things. And let's not forget the ability to zoom out or in to almost any degree you feel like.\nThe main campaigns are good and fun, even though the pacing could be a little better. I'd like to use the tier 3 siege bots, battleships and gunships a bit earlier. And you don't get to use the experimental units until halfway through the last mission- which is a little disappointing.\nThere are only a few things I would say are bad about the game. Compared to Starcraft, it feels a lot slower. You need air transport to get your engineers anywhere other than your main base in an acceptable time fashion. Queing orders when selecting multiple units sometimes results in them repeating builds that have already been done, wasting precious time. The campaign also has an annoying unit limit that applies to buildings as well, and there's no quick way to delete units if need be. A simple "delete" command would have been nice. Commanding armies has advanced controls but the units themselves still bump into each other and not attack as a clumped group (like Starcraft 2 handles very well). Projectiles operate in an immersive way, with bullets or missiles homing or not depending on the unit, but some units are nearly impossible to kill efficiently without transporting engineers and building defenses (tier 3 air superiority, ugh).\nThe graphics are very impressive considering how old the game is, and I still like zooming in to inspect all the high tech lights and power networks I construct.\nMy life for the Aeon Illuminate!","February 11","true","37.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The war has gone on for I believe over 1,000 years, making the World Wars look like small skirmishes.\n\nSupreme Commander has a wide variety of units, and is more complicated than its sequal, Supreme Commander 2.\n\nAlthough the down part is that the matches can be SUPER HUGE and possibly super long, and with the addition of possibly 200-1000 units for each player, the game can get Pretty Sl-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ow-w-w-w...\n\nDespite that, the game is great and fun.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\n1. If you are going to get this game alone, I recommend getting it on-sale. It's usually 80% off. (3 bucks)\n2. If you get the game AND the expansion, go for it. But I also recommend getting on-sale. It's usually 5 bucks for both.\n3. If you get the expansion, Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, let me repeat...\nHIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting Forged Alliance Forever (FAF).\n*NOTE: FAF is not compatible with the vanilla game, Supreme Commander, only Forged Alliance*\n\nFAF is a community made for Forged Alliance so you can play matches with others online.\n\nTL;DR I recommend this game if your an RTS fan, but get it on-sale, it's more worth it.\nBut I HIGHLY Recommend you get this and the expansion for the story mode and get FAF for multiplayer.","February 18","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
