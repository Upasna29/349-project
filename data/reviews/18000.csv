It takes about 6-7 hours to complete on normal difficulty and the game progression is pretty linear. The story is very penny-arcade in fashion so don't expect anything logical happening at all. That's actually where half the fun is.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but you need to press buttons in right sequences or pump them up in order to deal heavy special attack damage. It's a pretty fun albeit shallow combat system to be honest for the amount of game we have here. You can also use simple buff items and traps.\n\nOther than that, not much else to experience here. You can beat the game on a harder difficulty or try to hunt all the achievements but a short, sweet game nonetheless for PA fans.","June 23, 2014","true","7.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

Then Penny Arcade Adventure is the game for you.\nThis game it's just great from the beginning: you can create you own character that will actually appear in the comic-cutscenes, and for most of the game you have do deal with fruit-♥♥♥♥ing robots, mimes and clowns. And your only weapon is a rake. Yea.\n\nThe story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing and fun, the drawings and the art-style it's really good looking, and each character haves his own personality, expecially the ones that will escort you.\n\nThe animations are nice looking, sadly they didn't really made a lot of them, same for NPC civilians moving around the city, so some npc might look like duplicated dools staying here doing nothing.\n\nThe combat sisteam is kinda unique: it's a classic RPG combat like MarioRPG or Final Fantasy, but with some sort of quicktime event that you'll have to do to block incoming attack or to make your special move way more powerful. The items sistem is unique too: did you know that slot balm make you more slow? Me neither.\n\nFinal Score: 8/10\n\nIt's fun, it's cheap, it's amazing.

You visit only 3 meaningful locales multiple times, and those locales are uninteresting.\nCombat is QTE-reaction based for the most part.  It works okay, but some QTEs are very easy and some are not so enemies are trivialized or a nuissance based purely on this.  Thematics for enemies work fine though, they were creative for the most part (aside from fruit ♥♥♥♥er who is more or less just a meme).  You find items and upgrades but they aren't very rewarding because the scale of the game is too short.  The formula of the mechanics just doesn't appeal here.\nThe world has lots of text descriptions attached to objects in it, but they're all meaningless nonsense weirdness.  Sort of a mix of Hitchhiker's Guide with Jerry Holkins normal melancholy / grandiose style.  It doesn't grate on me, but its still meaningless.  Personally I just don't find his style all that appealing.\nThe thematic of the game... its just Penny Arcade memes with a game as a shell.  I don't mind it, its just not going to be enjoyable if you aren't really into Holkin's writing or a PA fan.  I bought this and the other games quite a few years ago, maybe back then I would have felt the appeal more.","August 2, 2015","false","5.3"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

As a PA fan, I am fail... oh well, better late than never. I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but it ended up being pretty good - not perfect, but satisfying enough for the price and length (5-6 hours). OtRSPoD is an interactive story wearing the clothes of a real-time turn-based RPG. What I mean is that there are never really any choices to make or side quests to take on, like you'd find in a typical RPG. From beginning to end, everything you do is part of a linear path (including a finite number of battles that leave your characters at their max level with full upgrades when completed). That said, I still found it fun, as the battle system was pretty cool. And if you are a fan if PA, you will also love the humorous story/interactions with Gabe & Tycho.

It boasts solidly designed and enjoyable RPG elements, with a light and hilarious story.  This is a good pick-up for any casual RPG fans out there looking for some lighthearted fun.\n\nTechnically, this is a parody game— but to be honest it plays better than many modern “real” RPGs that are emerging from the indie realm.  It plays like an old-school, turnbased-combat RPG, complete with leveling-up elements and a mild form of gear upgrading.  The gameplay is definitely fun and the RPG elements will keep you addicted to the progression.  You will find yourself striving to reach that next milestone of development as you play through the hilarious campaign.\n\nOn the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, Episode One is a Penny Arcade game. The story is fun and funny; it doesn’t take itself too seriously.  It is very lighthearted and the game is packed with hilarious and immature humor.  The characters are likeable, and cartoonish.  The art style is charming and fits the atmosphere of the game perfectly.  It all comes together as a very comic-like production.\n\nIt is the perfect game for a casual RPG fan that wants to play something light and easy, and may not be in the mood for one of the more in-depth, immersive, and incredibly long RPGs out there.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 26, 2013","true","6.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

I never thought I'd hear myself give such high praise to a turn-based RPG(of which, I'm not too fond with turn based combat systems.) The writting alone makes these two games worth playing. It brings the humor of the Penny Arcade comics and the fun of an RPG and mashes them together, upgrades feel rewarding, the character customization feature is a really nice touch.(No matter what, your character looks like someone out of a Penny Arcade comic) and the enemies range from strange to down right bizarre. I was never a huge fan of the Penny Arcade comics, but these games are really fun. I've found myself laughing pretty hard at the comedic vulgarity which has a quite prominent existince throughout both of these games. There is a consistant atmosphere spanning each episode with each location being unique and fresh. These gems are a steal at retail price!","June 28, 2012","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is similar to that of the classic Final Fantasy games, but with a modern touch along with quick-time events (QTE) that relate attacks.

Please, don't rate it down just because you loved the game =)\n\nShort Verdict: An okay humorous short RPG that has all my sympathy, but ultimately falls short. Although not entirely bad, mainly saved by its atmosphere, I can't really recommend it as a game. But I have to say that choosing between recommending it or not was a tough decision. By the way, I played it only because I got it in a bundle, but even so I almost couldn't get through the first hour. Still, I intend to play Episode Two in the future.\n\nPros:\nBuilds an awesome atmosphere, kinda reminded of me Sam & Max\nPacked with quality humor (I'm not the right audience for it, unfortunately)\nFunny, interesting characters\nNice headquarters with a lot of info, like game stats, dossiers, bestiary, collectibles, missions etc.\nThe artwork is awesome and I loved the comic-strip scenes\nThe BGM is also very good\nBeing able to customize your character is a cool feature\nCons:\nFights are boring and very repetitive and the mechanic is poor, making them a slower process than it should be\nMouse controls are bad, both in battle and moving your character around\nDifficulty is a roller coaster--sometimes really easy, then suddenly unforgiving, then back to a walk in the park\nLevelling up and upgrading your weapons were really not well implemented\nCollecting items is way too random and tedious (you have to break items that constantly respawn in the maps)\nAn RPG with limited encounters? Check =( Really, it was an awkward feeling coming close to finish the game and not knowing if I'd be able to do all I had to do in battles.\nMost cases (missions) consist simply in fighting enemies, which is a bit lame\nBasically, it's a bad RPG game...I wish it were a point-and-click adventure--I would probably love it!\nThe main story (if you can say this game has one) is pretty shallow and was poorly scripted, like someone was making it all up as they were writing\nBought on / for: Vancouver Edition by Humble Weekly Bundle for an average of US$ 0.25 (R$ 0,62). Great price for what you get, but I don't think it's worth its full price.","November 2, 2014","false","8.0"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","3"

Precipice of Darkness plays out like a western made JRPG centered around Super Mario RPG style combat with some light (classic) adventure game elements. The story stays on track for the most part and has enough side quests to flesh out characters and keep you interested in the few areas available for exploration. Inventory and equipment management are kept to a minimum with weapons being upgraded through point-and-click adventure mechanics. Just don't expect much of the comic's humor; I guess 4 pane webcomic humor doesn't translate well to a game so the devs just make everything wacky and so randumb.\n\nClocking in at around 7 hours this is a healthy "episode" and worth picking up if you like JRPGs.

Verdict, a very satifying start.\nStory- you create the lead character and go on a quest for vengence on a giant robot that steps on your house. On the way, you join Gabe and Tycho, two paranormal investigators, in investigating strange phenomenon around town and ultimatly stop a strange cult of mimes from resurrecting an ancient god. The story combines a mix of Lovecraftian mythos with off-color humor and memorable characters (including your own) in a darkly funny story. Though the begining of a saga, the story is quite short and can be beaten in a few hours. A-\nGraphics- This is state of the art graphics... as of early release PS2 era. There is really nothing to boast about visually as the whole project was a low buget indie game. Its not ugly to look at but just nothing to write home about. The cinimatics though are in the style of the web-comics and were entertaining enough to look at but all in all, below standard. C-\nSound- Music is nicely done but does not really stand out and the game sound effects work well but are fairly standard. Though I will give props to the only voice actor in the game as performs his role exceptionally well, even making me crack up several times in the game. B-\nGameplay- This game works on a P.O.C. format that works well enough, but feels kinda clunky. The game would benefit well with controller but unfortunatly doesn't come with that option. Also I find that if I click on a spot with some objects in the way, the characters will run into the object and continue to do so for a couple of seconds before giving up, it was kinda annoing. The battle sequences, though, are very fun and provide a fair amount of challenge as you are forced to multi-task between several characters at once. It does take a little getting used to but it provides a less static battle format compared to other popular RPG's. C+\nOverall- The game does suffer several flaws such as control issues and short play time among other issues. I found it to be a very enjoyable and entertaining experience worth recommendation.

You play a average joe (whom you name and create their appearance, which is somehow succesfully included in the Comic Book Cinematics) who has to join Detectives Tycho Brahe and Johnathan Gabriel on their Current Investigation. This is a game that's main focus is creating an insane, yet hilarious storyline, if your like me you will be grinning the entire game. The gameplay is no slouch either, going to for JRPG like Turn based combat (no random encounters for those wondering).\n\nIf you love JRPGs, love Penny Arcade, and/or Just want to laugh, this game will be great fun for you, and if you want more, there are 3 more games to play! (though sadly the guys who made the first 2 stopped making them, though Zeboyd Games made the last 2, and did a Fantastic Job, you will miss the comic book art style and even the combat system, and personally i miss my Created Character)","October 22, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game sets the stage for a grand tale of corky, funny, weird and outright erratic and bizzare storyline which unfolds quite precariously; one case at the time. It is very comical in its humor and tone, and obviously meant to be taken as a comedic experience, not as a serious story. The art and animation, while slightly outdated, remain very appealing, and maintain a constant vibe of a comic experience - really, as if you're venturing into a comic book.\n\nThe game is a third person, turn-based RPG - but its mechanics differ from the "standard" turn based games, by adding a component of time and timing to the attacks, special attacks and the blocking mechanism, as well as a very flexible "enemy-weakness" system which encourages you to be more flexible in your item use, and not just use the bandages and speed buffs exclusively. There is also a weapon upgrading system, which encourages you to complete the map and not avoid fights, and also includes an "overkill" component to the combat which, among other things, encourage you to be a little more... creative, in your comabt, and not rush to victory in a matter of seconds.\n\n\nIf you want a funny and enjoyable RPG experience, this game is definitely for you. Be wary, though - the replayability of this game is not superb. It's probably only meant for you to complete the achievements.","August 4, 2014","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you’re not familiar with Penny Arcade, you can get a good idea by just reading the last few comics. The art is a 3D, cartoony, steampunk style which I was also very into and again is what I expected from Penny Arcade.\n\nThe gameplay reminded me of Super Mario RPG. You explore until you run into an enemy and then jump into combat mode, where your party lines up against the enemies. Your main characters can perform their basic attack, special attack, or team up with other characters for 2- or 3-member team attacks. Instead of being turn-based, there’s a warm-up meter on each character that resets on each action.\n\nIf you’re looking for an RPG this game may disappoint you, but if you’re a fellow Penny Arcade fan looking for some RPG mixed in with a great story you’ll likely enjoy playing through this once and then letting it sit.","November 18, 2011","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, in those four hours, I had a great time with this game. Plus, it's cheap alongside its successor during Steam Sales, so the length-to-price ratio is justified if you pick it up then. It's an RPG that's not completely turn based, where attacks recharge (it's not as stressful as it seemed). You can't play the game with mouse lag, but it was fixed by making the resolution lower. The game has the humor you'd expect, and I found myself holding back from taking screenshots of funny lines. The soundtrack is great and fits the dark but nice visuals. Items and super moves didn't see much use by me; I didn't really need them most of the time. I'm also assuming that most of the game's exploration takes place in the completionist route, since there wasn't much of it for something that LOOKS like a Point-n-Click.\nOverall, I'd definitely pick up this game during a Steam Sale.","January 27, 2013","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the general quality is obviously on a shoe string budget, the lack of any voice acting makes it hard to truely appreciate those few really funny jokes.

Set in New Arcadia, 1922, you go about the city killing robots, hobo's, mimes, and clowns to find the truth behind the giant robot. The gameplay is identical to many RPG games, but adds a blocking system that shakes up the difficulty at times. The story is very tongue-in-cheek and can make you laugh at times. The game is very short, lasting only a few hours, but the game keeps up. Even if you've never read the webcomic it's based off (Penny Arcade), the game is easy to get into and is lots a fun.","November 29, 2013","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

In the game you gotta annoyingly restock on items a lot since enemies do not drop as much and you only get 1x item per object you smash to get a item from.\n\nThis goes on in higher lvls as well except enemies drop more items. With the bad stuff outta the way lemme get to the good stuff.\n\nThe combat for this turned based game is very well done,you rely on both strategy of using ur items and your characters to properly take down enemies.Enemies have different weakness's and strengths that you have to account for when you attack,This is where the bread and butter comes in the game.\n\nGraphic wise the game looks charming,love the comic style they used for the npc interactions and the variety of enemies and they abilites are fun and funny yet challenging.\n\nIf you want a fresh look on turned based rpgs outside the fantasy genre, I say get the episodes in and the packs instead of seperate.","July 12, 2012","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thankfully (or unfortunately), you, along with Penny Arcade's Tycho and Gabe, are just the guys to save it from the hordes of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ robots, mimes, hobos and barbershop quartets that lurk on every street and pathway.\n\nAll in all, it's a good combination of point-and-click adventure and RPG-based leveling and combat, with animation, graphics and humor that stays true to the Penny Arcade webcomic.\n\nHowever, there is a bug that occasionally pops up during combat where animation is skipped. In most games, this wouldn't really be an issue, but since your method of defending requires proper timing, this could lead to a few instances of attacks getting through without you having a chance to react.

In the game you gotta annoyingly restock on items a lot since enemies do not drop as much and you only get 1x item per object you smash to get a item from.\n\nThis goes on in higher lvls as well except enemies drop more items. With the bad stuff outta the way lemme get to the good stuff.\n\nThe combat for this turned based game is very well done,you rely on both strategy of using ur items and your characters to properly take down enemies.Enemies have different weakness's and strengths that you have to account for when you attack,This is where the bread and butter comes in the game.\n\nGraphic wise the game looks charming,love the comic style they used for the npc interactions and the variety of enemies and they abilites are fun and funny yet challenging.\n\nIf you want a fresh look on turned based rpgs outside the fantasy genre, I say get the episodes in and the packs instead of seperate.","July 12, 2012","true","23.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, in those four hours, I had a great time with this game. Plus, it's cheap alongside its successor during Steam Sales, so the length-to-price ratio is justified if you pick it up then. It's an RPG that's not completely turn based, where attacks recharge (it's not as stressful as it seemed). You can't play the game with mouse lag, but it was fixed by making the resolution lower. The game has the humor you'd expect, and I found myself holding back from taking screenshots of funny lines. The soundtrack is great and fits the dark but nice visuals. Items and super moves didn't see much use by me; I didn't really need them most of the time. I'm also assuming that most of the game's exploration takes place in the completionist route, since there wasn't much of it for something that LOOKS like a Point-n-Click.\nOverall, I'd definitely pick up this game during a Steam Sale.","January 27, 2013","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is no award-winning game, nor does it try to be. This is simply a slightly humorous romp through a zany adventure. To be clear, you don't have to like Penny Arcade to enjoy this game; I personally hate the web comics and found myself chuckling every once in a while. Although the general quality is obviously on a shoe string budget, the lack of any voice acting makes it hard to truely appreciate those few really funny jokes. The gameplay is solid, but takes zero risks and I can't remember a single song from the game which means one of two things:\n1). The music is mediocre.\n2). The music is horrendous.\nThe graphics are pretty subpar, but one cool addition is that the character you make is shown in every cutscene and doesn't feel like a silent protagonist at all.

Because what little I did play I loved, the humor, the ridiculous story and enemies/npcs, and so on. I was just turned off on the sudden difficulty spike coming from the tutorial and going into your first official battle. It made me think long and hard about how much I am not a fan of either turn-based combat, nor Penny Arcade.\n\nActually, given enough time with PA, I would probably become a fan, I loved the irreverent humor and ridiculousness of it, but the QTE/turn-based combat, while good if you are a fan of that kind of combat, is not my cup of tea. The huge difficulty spike going into the first battle did not help sell the game to me either. But if you are a fan of PA, or turn based combat, or both, and can handle a hard game, pick this one up. If you are not a huge fan of either PA, or TBC, or the ridiculous difficulty spike, then this is not your game.","August 12, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmosphere is odd, but pleasing to look at, and the writing is well done.  The combat is surprisingly engaging, with benefits for paying attention (and lots of button pushing).  It's a nice game to play while relaxing.\n\nMy only gripe is that the game is not well optimized.  I enabled the "high" graphics settings, and I have a system that grossly overpowers what was available in 2008.  Regrettably, the graphics were still stuttery and jerky at times.\n\nI wouldn't pay full price for this game, since it's old (by videogame standards) and it only lasts few hours.  If you can pick it up for a few bucks and if you're a fan of Penny Arcade, then go for it.\n","February 15","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/folffairport/recommended/18000/","folffairport","Each Dawn I Die","http://steamcommunity.com/id/folffairport/","536 products in account","I've never really been a fan of MOST RPGs, generally because I don't have an interest in things revolving around knights, magic, princesses, etc. However, RPGs that deal with other subjects and fantasy settings than the standard D&D-esque fare are generally to my liking. This game falls into that category. While I admit I am about 10 years behind in reading the Penny Arcade webcomic, back when I followed it fairly religiously it was great and I enjoyed it. This game is pretty much what you'd expect as far as Penny Arcade humor, personalities, etc. The gameplay is great and the story parodies HP Lovecraft themes as well as has it's own style in that it merges the early teens to thirties Lovecraftian times with a just right pinch of steampunk; pulled off so well that I, as someone who gags at having steampunk genre things forced at me constantly, actually enjoyed the elements of the genre in this game. It just seemed to fit. Overall the game isn't very long, if you didn't take a break you could win it in a day or faster, but it does of course have three other sequels and was meant to be released in 'episodes' so it makes sense and is to be expected. There are plenty of upgrades to attacks as well as weapons for characters, and there are plenty of interesting areas and situations to get into to keep you entertained through your journey. I will say though that I have owned this game for a long time and was not able to actually finish it until yesterday completely because my old desktop's videcard had some sort of critical error glitch at the final boss that prevented me from beating him because not long after starting the battle the game would simply crash. I wish I remembered what videocard I had so that I could warn other users that had it about the glitch, so sorry for that. I of course since I beat it, have had no issues with any glitches or crashes on my newer desktop. Anyways, all in all it's a fun and fairly casual RPG with a good story and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for an RPG that isn't necessarily all swords and scorcerers. Though, there is a bit of dark magic in the game, it all goes along perfectly with the Lovecraftian theme and associated cultists. So no worries there. :P","July 11, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game uses Final Fantasy like mechanics for the battle system and it works well. The humor in the story is what you would expect of Penny Arcade. Though the robots are very funny and lewd; and the end credits are a hoot. Oh the cat support character is adorable. Wish there was more for episode one but eh. On to episode 2.\n\nThings that bugged me was when clicking on an object, if there is another object in your path then your character will get blocked though that is easily fixed by just clicking away and then back to your object of desire. Also I wish there was controller support though I was able to eventually get use to the keyboard and mouse controls, and that was on a laptop.","May 9","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hold this up as a textbook example of loving satire.  No particular Lovecraftian tales are spoofed, but this is a world of dark magic (Evil Mimes, admittedly), forbidden science (Horny Robots), and sinister things lurking beyond the shadows of reality,\nGive it a look","November 24, 2010","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
