There truly is something for every play style here.\nThe tech system limits the player in a good way, giving weight to your choice of tech upgrades without shutting you off from other options permanently.\nPresentation: Animations, sound FX, voice acting and cutscenes are all superbly polished. While it's not the most high-fidelity game ever made it does look very nice as a whole. Even on the lowest graphical settings the game doesn't look muddy or outdated.\nThe map editor ships with the game at launch, opening up a potentially infinite amount of map variation for the future.\nThe eight maps that ship with the game are, for the most part, asymmetrical, well designed and feel balanced. It feels great playing on non-mirrored maps for once.\nThe campaign and story are above average for an RTS game. The story is supremely compelling with fantastically animated cutscenes (the best I've ever seen) and the campaign offers subtle, interesting variations on the skirmish gameplay through fifteen lengthy missions. It will likely take you a couple of days to complete the campaign and some of the later mission are quite challenging indeed.\n\nConsPerformance: The frame-rate drops with large amounts of units and structures on screen and towards the end of longer matches. Adjusting the graphics options does very little to alleviate this.\nOnly eight maps are available at launch, five 1v1 and three 2v2. I imagine they'll be adding more in the future, but I can't be sure of that at this point.\n\nWhat you need to knowThe game doesn't ship with replay or observer mode features, but they have been confirmed for a post-launch update.\nGrey Goo doesn't play like StarCraft and thus you shouldn't play it as such. Understand and accept this and you'll be happier for it.\nIf you enjoyed Command & Conquer 3 you'll likely find something to enjoy in Grey Goo.\nThe game supports competitive play with ranked 1v1 and 2v2 matches along with a leaderboard for each.\nCustom 1v3, 1v1v2 and Free For All games are also supported. The max number of players on a map is currently four.\n\nConclusionGrey Goo is a solid old school style RTS. It has some interesting new ideas and brings back much missed old ones too. It seems that Petroglyph Games has tried to cater to the single and multiplayer communities with Grey Goo; this perhaps coupled with a shorter development time has led the game to feel as if it lacks content in certain areas. That being said, the game doesn't feel unfinished by any stretch of the imagination, though it could use an expansion or a few updates here and there to fatten it up a bit (this is almost guaranteed considering the cliffhanger at the end of the campaign). Grey Goo is a solid and polished foundation for a potentially great RTS.\n\nFor more Grey Goo and other exciting content check out my YouTube channel, The Roleplay Gamer.","January 23, 2015","true","194.1"," 1,089 of 1,160 people (94%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","94","089","1","44","27"

I am so sick of idiots trying to "fix" the core components of RTSes that make them fun in the first place and producing horrid games like CC4. Grey Goo intelligently keeps all the core elements of a truly fun RTS experience but still expands on them in completely unique ways such as with the Goo faction and the mechanics of the Beta and human basebuilding systems. Basically, I've been a hardcore CC fan all my life until EA gutted it and murdered my dreams.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomeaboardmate/recommended/290790/","welcomeaboardmate","BlackEagle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomeaboardmate/","501 products in account","TL;DR: It's an RTS with walls. In a gaming world where walls are apparently considered "so last century".\n\n10/10 walls are love, walls are life. In this game, literally.\n\n\nA spectacular macro-management, not micro-management, RTS based on skill rather than actions per minute, much like petroglyph's older Command & Conquer series when they were Westwood...an exception to this skill-over-APM thing perhaps being the namesake "Grey Goo" faction, which is spectacularly original and...strange to play. I won't spoil. It's a fascinating experience to have.\n\nAlso, uncanny-valley quality (really damn good) cutscenes for the campaign.\n\nOutside of that, you have 2 classic RTS styled factions, the humans and the beta. Beta are the easiest to get into and as a result the first ones you play as in the campaign whether you like it or not, as they control much like every other conventional RTS - get resources, build and expand base and outposts, train troops, and fight.\nThe humans, on the other hand, have a big central HQ building and can only sprawl from that using flimsy little connecting wire-like "conduits". Hence, they're generally constricted to their main spawning area, leaving harvesters vulnerable when resources have to be gathered from afar. Everything they build MUST be on these conduits, even turrets, so stuff gets cramped fast.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game lies somewhere between C&C and starcraft. It's not as APM or micromanagement happy as starcraft, but also not quite as rock-paper-scissors as C&C was, as all units can, to an extent, engage all others somewhat effectively. Some just do it better than others. There is also a population cap, but that population cap is, well, 200 units in size, so you'll have a difficult time reaching it, if at all. You will also notice a lack of unit abilities, as they...have none. Again, no micromanagement here. There are, however, technologies you can research, with 3 choices for 5 seperate catagories totalling 15 research options - but you can only choose 1 per catagory, so what you pick is how you play. Literally.\n\nWhat also makes this game good is simply the number of options of play style you can have. A lot of games these days encourage you to get out on the field and wreck ♥♥♥♥ to get ahead, and while this DOES have advantages to doing that, this is one of the few newer RTS games where you can throw up a wall, plant some turrets, and just build a big army in safety to later watch as the enemy gets steamrolled under the boot of your troops.\n\nMaps are expertly designed to be balanced yet asymmetrical, which became very obvious upon downloading some custom workshop maps and seeing the vast difference in quality. I'm not saying workshop maps are bad, and having WS support is a VERY good thing, but the devs know how to map and my god it shows.\n\nThe soundtrack is composed by Frank Klepacki.\n...you don't need to know anything more.\nIf you don't get anything else, get the soundtrack.\n\n\nLong story short, this is a game where you build a base and send out harvesters from refineries to get a mysterious resources that gives you credits. You use credits to build more buildings and begin training various units. You defend your base with turrets and then proceed with hangars to house your aircraft so you can harass the enemy from afar. Finally, you send your massive army of units to crush the enemy.\n\nSounds familiar, eh?\n\n(Unless you're the goo. Then, everything changes...)\n\nThis is a damn good RTS and you should put it high on your list of games to buy.\nHigh recommendation from me.","May 22, 2015","true","23.1"," 290 of 314 people (92%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","92","290","314","40","5"

It's apparent the developers have spent a lot of time polishing Grey Goo, it feels polished and robust and very pretty to look at! The optimization is fairly okay-ish, I've encountered a few FPS hitches and notable slow down when reaching the unit cap in skirmish but it doesn't hinder play at all. I use a half decent PC so I can imagine it being a monster on a lesser machine.\n\nAs for the gameplay, to me it feels like a twist of starcraft and C&C, but more so C&C with a similar awesome soundtrack. Many have said that the unit roster and buildings are fairly shallow but it feels just right in my opinion. You have tech upgrades of which there is 3 in each category with the ability to switch them out on the fly at a price giving one an edge in a certain area when one needs it. It feels like CoH/CoH2's in game level-up-n-choose-a perk feature but useful. I have already found myself needing to use it. The cinematics are very well done, really good to watch and follow the story, even if it is very Starcraft inspired. The balance between the Beta and the Humans feel pretty spot on, can't say anything for the Goo yet as I have yet to tinker with them.\n\nI'm a few missions in, playing on hard, it feels about as hard as it should be. I had to replay a mission or two to figure out the correct build order and way to get stuff done. It's a lot of fun. The tutorial is excellent, teaching the player how to use stuff as you play the game and describing most things with detail. Not so many maps for skirmish/MP but the devs have said to be supporting the title for a while to come so will have to wait and see, in the mean time there is a map editor and steam workshop support to get on with. Definitely the finest and most well built RTS we've had for years!","January 23, 2015","true","46.8"," 225 of 251 people (90%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","90","225","251","11","6"

The only issue I did have was a bit of frame drop during the animated cutscenes but it's nothing game breaking and can be fixed with a few updates. The maps look impressive with nice visual effects here and there but nothing mind blowing new.\n\nGameplay - There is 3 factions, Humans which have their bases connected through a powerline system, Beta who are your alien/human type race which their bases are connected through hubs (think of Starcraft terran but with all their buildings stuck to command centers) and then there is the goo....the goo is the one faction that stands out as there isn't any faction like it from any RTS that I can think of.\n\nThe goo operates as a living base, it starts off as a big blob and from there collects resources as it moves around, once it has enough resources you can divide the goo into units or another big blob. The cool thing is the goo can climb over mountains and also attacks by grabbing and eating the enemy forces (really neat watching infranty get sucked in), it's really good for players that aren't big on base building and are pure offensive types as this moving,  defensive organism is the best for those player types.\n\nThe combat is very basic, units are nothing mind blowing and most seem familiar, however the epic units which each faction has is awesome, think Supreme Commander 2 super units. Controls are nicely done and easy to use, however there isn't much micro managing when it comes down to forces, they have no special abilities only upgrades made at main base and that is it. Overall the gameplay is your standard RTS, however there is a 200 unit cap...which is kind of sad coming from the Westwood guys (come on you guys are the ones who started the no unit cap...massive army RTS games...bring back that feel..I love having massive airforces and infantry against another player going all out in the middle of the map and once the battle is over...looking at the wreckage , holes and fires from our epic massive assault)\n\nMusic - AWESOME , I love the music as it's from the original Command and Conquer Artist. Some songs are kind of strange but overall they give you that nice tone to listen to...also you can pick your song track which I miss...like come on RTS games this feature was made back in 1998 why is there no option to pick your track during missions.\n\nStory/Missions- the story is interesting at the moment (currently at level 3), I will update this when I finish all faction stories. However the missions are straight forward, protect this , kill that and do optional objectives.\n\nIssues - So far only a few frame issues during cutscenes but other then that had no issue with missions/optional objectives , graphics and combat. Everything checks out. I haven't tried online but did play a bit of skirmish with no issues and the A.I seems to be working properly with default settings.\n\n\nShould you buy this?: the answer is rather difficult as there isn't anything really fresh and new that hasn't been done before besides the one new faction goo. The price is fair (if your complaining about $50 or $60... then wait for a sale.. you can't have everygame $10 or .99, what is even fun is these same individuals don't have issues buying $5 to $10 dlc weapons or map packs for PayDay 2 or COD) for what it is.\n\nIf your a command and conquer fan , Empire at war or Universe at War then you will feel comfortable with this. I played all 3 games/series and this one is another one I'm enjoying and glad to add to the collection.\n\nIf your a starcraft player, you might feel upset over the lack of micro-management and special abilities. The game seems more designed for basic RTS players of throwing your force against the enemy lines in hopes to break through.\n\nAnd if your unsure either way or feel scared over the $50 or $60 price tag, wait for a sale. I do recommend giving it a try one way or another.\n\n\nAlso...for your classic Command and Conquer fans....this game allows you to build walls!!!!

Not much, to be frank but there are a few things that could've been made better. First off the differences between the two humanoid factions are mostly cosmetic even though there are subtle differences in how units work, unit stats and general playstyle. Particularly base building is vastly different. I just feel they could've been diversified a little bit more.\n\nNo replay. EDIT: Replay is now in the game (2016-02-15 edit)\nThe lack of a proper replay function hurts ranked play and stymies people who want to improve by watching their games from an outside perspective. This is one thing I believe should be prioritized.\n\nPerformance.\nThe game runs like crap on a lot of people's hardware. There's been a lot of performance patches lately that have dealt with most of those cases. I personally still have a wildly fluctuating framerate in menues and videos, but gameplay is mostly buttery smooth.\n\nLack of content.\nWhile I liked the shorter campaign (16-ish missions) some people don't and the lack of multiplayer maps is also somewhat hurting the game, even though I personally find them to be enough. Learning a few maps and finding ways to use the maps to your advantage is a lot more fun than having yet another bloody map every time you play. But it's a con, so I'll list it. Also see map editor.\n\nNot intuitive balance.\nWhile this is hardly unique for Grey Goo, it's still a thing that drives people up the wall. At first glance, Goo's artillery can seem overpowered as hell with their HUGE range and potential healing. In addition Goo's splash-tank upgrade turns enemy armies into paste (no pun intended) against an unprepared opponent. Human's artillery also works as mines? OP! Etc etc. Grey Goo is fairly balanced, but it takes a lot of playing before you actually realize this. Early on it just seems broken.\n\nDifficulty.\nI dunno why I'm listing this as I've beaten the campaign on hard on the first try. But I've seen billions of threads about this. Grey Goo is apparently hard.\n\nAI.\nThe AI is, for the most part, good and will put up a decent fight against a middling level player. It has some issues though and can sometimes break down completely and just "sit there".\n\nPrice.\nGrey Goo is overpriced in todays market. It's quite worth the price, but it's not going to sell well with such a high price tag.\n\nOkay, now for the good stuff:Soundtrack\nThe soundtrack is really, really good. Even I, who normally shun everything remotely dubstep-y, can appreciate the Goo soundtrack even though the Humans have the soundtrack that I personally like the most. It's also written and performed by legendary Frank Klepacki of the C&C games.\n\nGraphics.\nGrey Goo looks gorgeous, not just in gameplay but in the cutscenes and menues. Top notch quality all around.\n\nGameplay.\nI personally love the anti-micro pro-macro style of RTS that Grey Goo is. I detest micro-heavy RTSs with a passion and am so sick of Starcraft Clone #451 coming out. Grey Goo makes a return to the strategic part of RTS. Army composition, economy and positioning plays a big role here and you'll rarely be "caught out" by lacking twitch skills.\n\nOnline capability.\nThe maps are great to play on, the factions seem fairly balanced (although I'd argue that Goo can be somewhat underpowered) and the connectivity is rock solid. I've never had a single disconnect or even lag in a single match so far which is impressive seeing as I play almost exclusively with people "across the pond".\n\nGoo.\nThe faction as a whole. It's unique, yet recognizable. Anyone who has played Zerg or Tyranids will recognize the frantic "zerging" style of gameplay, but at the same time the lack of bases, or rather mobile bases make the Goo a very unique faction.\n\nStory.\nSome may call the story basic, but I personally enjoyed the story and how it was told very much. A lot of likable characters as well so this gets my thumbs up.\n\nAI.\nI list this in pros as well, because the times when the AI does play well, it plays really well. It's solid enough to give me a bit of a challenge on Hard, but it's of course nothing compared to a human player.\n\nSupport.\nThe developers have been releasing regular performance patches, and as of time for this review to be posted, they're also working on their first big balance patch. The ongoing support means this game has a lot of lifetime ahead of itself.\n\nSo do I recommend Grey Goo?\nHell yes, I do. Grey Goo is the best RTS to be released in recent years. That doesn't mean that Grey Goo is the next coming of Messiah in RTS gaming. No. It's a pretty iterative continuation of the C&C style of games. But it does it well and it's a solid enough game for me to recommend it. I still have tons of fun playing it and I expect you will too. If you are hesitant, wait for a sale. It's a pretty hefty price tag after all.","March 8, 2015","true","67.0"," 105 of 110 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","105","110","3","3"

A modern spin of of the classic C&C franchise, this game brings RTS back to its base building roots with an easy to comprehend UI. The helpful UI and gameplay design, reduces the micro intensive gameplay found in modern RTS such as starcraft 2. This leaves a focus for strategy without babysitting your base or units, however, a certain degree of speed is required to excel this game. That being said, it is a simple game but hard to master. (edited) The game's AI on hard (even on normal) provide certain degree of challenge in the campaign, while it suffer in skirmish.\n\nThe 3 factions are uniquely different, this gives an asymmetery to the game. I would not provide a detail description about the factions, but rest assured, they are fun to play and all have a unique twist to them (for example, humans are the most technological advanced race with teleportation and drones to do their fighting for them).\n\nThe campaign and skirmish maps are well crafted. (edited) Although the map pool for skirmishes are small, a map editor was included to allow the community to develop more exciting maps, the devs themselves mentioned they will include community crafted maps in the future (if they are good). The graphics are well up to standard for modern times, even the cutscenes inbetween missions have almost realistic CG potrayal of the main cast of the game.\n\nThe soundtrack of this game deserved to be mentioned, it is fantastic as it is written by composer Frank Klepacki (his original work contribute to the soundtrack of command & conquer and even the infamous Blade runner). With that being said, the scores found in this game are well-crafted, and you can even customise what soundtrack to play during your skirmishes with the in-game jukebox.\n\nIn summary, this is a game worth getting for the price. I only hope that this game doesn't underperform in terms of sales as it wasn't being advertised well. This is because we deserve more well-made RTS in the market with a return to games which focus on base building and strategy.","January 26, 2015","true","25.0"," 123 of 139 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","123","139","2","5"

If you expect everything to be exactly as in C&C then you will be heavily dissapointed.\n\nThis is a real throwback to what RTS games once were about and I hope that will be again.\n\nThe UI in this game is one of the most non intrusive I have seen in any RTS game to date. The campaign is challenging on hard but passable. The missions are designed very good and provide a very long singleplayer experience. I would say that you can get easily 15-20 hours out of it. Skirmish offers quite a good AI that really knows how to counter players moves. The ressource in this game the so called Catalyst is mined on Catalyst/Veins fields by Extractors which are replenishible like Tiberium fields in C&C games.\n\nThe three faction are really distinctive. The Humans although a full turtling faction are capable of carrying out early rushes to disturb enemy eco production. What you need to realise is that base buildings in this game are hard to destroy so you have ample time to rebuild some of your forces that get destroyed. This game is not like SC2 just about how you Micro. Its about how secure your supply lines are and how secure your production is. So it does not matter if you loose your army since you can field another one in do time. Basically its a macro game. Humans are very adaptible when it comes to base defenses since they can teleport any building to any place on the conduit lines.\n\nBetas as a faction are quite adaptive and offer a nice mix between a turtling and offense faction. They may look similar in playstle to Humans but they do offer faster counterattack options. And the Hand of Ruk rocks.\n\nGoos really are a faction that is made for the fans of Micro management. It is important to note that Goos need some time before they can produce enough force but when they do then you will surely get a nice fight.\n\nAlso just to point out that the Map Editor is already included in the game since some people think that its not there. Its in the games Steam folder (PgPublicTerrainEditor).\n\nAnyway I recommend the game to any UaW, C&C and Earth series fans but as said this is a new game that includes a lot of different concepts so you need to be open minded to it.","January 27, 2015","true","37.3"," 129 of 150 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","129","150","9","0"

It looks gorgeous. It runs relatively well (aside from that weird framerate I have in menus and occasional drops when there are too many units, but devs are already aware of the problem).\n\nPick one of three factions and destroy your enemy. Each of the factions has almost completely different playstyle.\nHumans (or Alpha) are tied to their base. They have to build conduits that carry power to their buildings. But conduits are pretty fragile. That forces you to be very careful about extending your base - you'll need to guard every building and conduit you have. To do that, you can use a variety of turrets that work from conduit (that's a unique Human feature).\nBeta (aliens) are slightly more mobile than humans. They construct all the buildings as attachments to either the HQ or hubs. The hubs can be built pretty much anywhere in the world, thus making it pretty easy to expand your influence. You still have to guard your satellite hubs, but it's pretty easy to do with units mounted on walls (that's a unique Beta feature).\nAnd then there Goo. It does not have bases, it's not tied to anything. It's just a Mother Goo and her children. You only way to survive is to replicate and capture each and every resource pool on the map. And then replicate again, morph into an army and kill everyone.\nOh, and every faction has it's own unique Epic Unit, which is, well, pretty epic, but slow.\nIt's a bit sad that Humans and Beta have such a little number of differences. But they are different enough to keep the gameplay fun and varied.\n\nThere are as well a lot of modern age takes and improvements in the game.\nThere's quite much less micro than say in Starcraft 2 - the games wants to do a lot of things for you (of course, you can pick to do most of them yourself, but it's not necessary, AI does a pretty good job at it).\nFor example, there are no workers - buildings are constructed by either spaceships or they just warp in.\nThe harvesters are as well managed automatically by the refinery, you don't have to worry about building optimal number of them - just about defending them from enemy.\nAnd QWERT-shortcuts that was most likely inspired by DOTA-like games allow you to quickly build new units or building even when you are away from you base. It's quite much easier than microing in SC2.\n\nThe AI in game is pretty good (or maybe it's me who's terrible) - I was able to play against it without terribly losing only on easy. So, if you are skirmisher - you will probably love to play against it.\nNetcode seems to be working OK too - tried a couple of MP games (but lost terribly, once again :D).\nAnd, really, aside from that framerate bug that my machine experiences for some reason, I don't really have anything else to complain about. Game is rock solid RTS.\n\nWatch the detailed overview in the video below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unK7gz3ZpMk","January 25, 2015","true","11.6"," 84 of 96 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","84","96","5","0"

They are also the only faction capable of teleporting 6 units at once to any spot on the map where you have visibility allowing you to quickly reinforce troops if needed. Their elite unit sends a laser beem straight forward in a line, damaging any enemy ground unit (imho. this is the weakest elite unit, but they have air-superiority anyways thanks to their airplanes and how small their storages for the airplanes are).\n\nOn the completely opposite side this this is the Goo, the playstyle of the goo focuses on aggressive hit-and-run tactics, their elite unit can cause serious havoc and is also able to climb any obstacle and destroy enemy buildings and units by simply being around them. They are very strong if coming in a pack and when lacking form they can devour an entire base by simply being there. That said, their forms (units) do have a lot of advantages such as range, ability to target airplanes and pure damage.\nThe goo has no structures, they are a fluid faction in every meaning of the word.\n\nThe Beta are most normal of the factions, specifically said by the Devs to be intentionally so for new players to get used to the game, but they are still very strong and definitively a force to be reckoned with. Their elite unit is a walking production facility that sends out miniature nuclear bombs and is able to attack any close-range enemies by having units mounted ontop of it. This is one of the big strengths of the Beta, some of your units can mount walls and the elite unit, allowing you to create a strong permimiter that is very hard to break through.\nIf you then decide to go on the offensive, the elite unit will help you take down most resistance, having what is probably the strongest of the elite units in the game.\n\nAs for the campaign, it is very well made, although, it is a bit short, allowing you to get used to each of the factions while also deliviring a great story that they have confirmed will be expanded.\nNote: It will come through DLC.\n\nNow, on a more negative note, while humans are strong, they often feel unflexible as you might not be able to expand anywhere due to it not always going so well building uphil and some areas are just blocked off for building. For the Beta, that just means you place it somewhere else, for humans, it means stop.\n\nAlso, the game, at least so far, allows for only up to 4 players, meaning you can't even have a 3v3 with one of each faction on each side.","August 7, 2015","true","14.0"," 88 of 103 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","88","103","4","0"

Matchs online are not as manic as perhaps games like Starcraft 2 were every second is precious which allows for more casual longer matchs like the RTS times of old.\n\nIn conclusion every old school rts fan who enjoyed Command and Conquer and its clones should definately invest in this title.

It was only competitive, made people want just to win (Excluding Starcraft).\n\nNow, If we talk about EA Games, well, ♥♥♥♥ EA Games. It doesn't even worth talking. I hate EA.

Those familiar with Westwood would be aware of their impressive track record.  As you may have already read, Grey Goo feels like an early RTS, however it introduces many new ideas differentiating itself from its predecessors. There are three distinct factions to play as (the standard number for RTS titles today), the versatile Beta, the defensive Humans and the aggressive Goo. I'll take you through my rundown of the game assuming you're an RTS fan; I'll be making a few comparisons throughout.\n\nFeatures\n\nWhat's that? You're not familiar with RTS games? Don't worry, Grey Goo more than explains itself with many tutorial videos before jumping into one of the game's two main modes, Campaign and Skirmish. Campaign is the single player narrative featuring multiple customised scenarios whilst Skirmish allows you to play against either human or AI opponents in free-for-all or team battles. Replay and Observer modes were added several months after the game's launch, a staple for the competitive multiplayer types. It's good to see the developers were not too preoccupied with competitive multiplayer, offering a lot of single player content. Plot-wise, Grey Goo does not follow standard sci-fi stereotypes creating an identity of its own (for example: the Humans are the most technologically advanced faction). The campaign is set on a tropical planet known as Ecosystem 9 and its compelling, 15 missions long and legitimately challenging (not merely an elaborate tutorial). Be prepared to click the restart mission button a few times. Whilst the campaign is challenging, not too many missions overstay their welcome, they'll hold your interest. The campaign takes you through each faction, the Beta (the most conventional one for RTS veterans), Humans (defensive) and Goo (aggressive). There have been suggestions that the Beta and Humans are too alike. They are somewhat similar, but have enough differences to distinguish themselves. For instance, the Beta have more offensive options and are far more mobile than the Humans whom must use power conduits to power their structures and stationary defenses as well as expand. The Goo is the stand out faction solely for its originality. Instead of constructing a base; resource gathering and unit construction are left to the Mother, a large Goo that essentially acts as a mobile all-in-one base that consumes everything in its path (including enemy structures). Each unit has a purpose and remains useful throughout the whole game, even early game ones. The factions each have their own equivalent of the scout, tank and artillery. Other more exotic units include the Goo's Bastion (a moving wall) and Dweller (a subterranean unit that explodes when enemies are nearby).\n\nThere are no super weapons such as Nukes or Ion Cannons here, instead replaced with "Epic Units" similar to those in Command and Conquer 3 encouraging the construction of large armies to back them up. The horizontal user interface is well designed, taking cues from more recent RTS/MOBA titles including hotkey layout. Another idea borrowed from MOBAs is the ability for units to hide in brush. Units may also be auto-queued in order to keep battles big and interesting. Resource collection, construction and unit creation have been beautifully streamlined. Resource collection in particular has gone from babysitting harvesters with iffy path finding to a "set and forget" sort of thing. The developers also opted to go with Supreme Commander's income system which translates well into this title. There are numerous technological upgrades each faction may choose from, they are divided into different categories, however you may only select one in each which gives more weight and responsibility for your choices allowing for some army tweaking depending on which strategy you wish to employ. Grey Goo may not be as fast-paced as Starcraft 2 but is still fast enough to keep players on their toes. Combat isn't too deep, more so emphasising unit composition over micromanaging a handful of units like in more recent RTS games. Another trend in recent RTS titles was their encouragement of aggressive tactics and punished anyone who did not expand quickly enough. Defensive strategies are, at the very least, viable in Grey Goo.\n\nPresentation\n\nThe visuals are impressive, you may max the game out even on a modest PC. There are notifications and detailed tooltip text boxes for everything keeping you in the loop throughout the battle. Each faction is well designed, from the Beta's mechanical, animalistic walkers to the Humans hovering, highly advanced drone arsenal. The campaign cinematics look great too, so great that Petroglyph may have even outdone Blizzard in that regard.\n\nSound Design\n\nEverything either has a sound cue or announcement. There are no issues with the announcer or units trying to talk over each other (the announcer usually takes precedence) although you may hear them repeat themselves over and over ("Wall under attack..."). Units become irritated when constantly selected (a throwback to Starcraft) and let you know when they're in combat or have defeated an enemy. It's small details like these that demonstrate how much the developers cared for their product. The game's score was composed by Frank Klepacki (Command and Conquer/Dune). It's great. Longtime RTS fans may hear echoes of his past work in this game, in particular Command and Conquer: Tiberian Sun and Universe at War: Earth Assault. Each faction has a unique, dynamic soundtrack that changes depending on what's happening on screen.\n\nIssues\n\nBefore describing the existing issues Grey Goo has, I should note that Petroglyph have since addressed a couple of problems it had upon it's release. Multiplayer disconnections are now, at the very least, less frequent and additional graphics options have been added. The game has also been properly optimised meaning the title screen no longer stutters and the game simply runs smoother in general, even on a PC that does not quite meet the recommended system specifications. True to their word, Petroglyph also added more units, multiplayer maps and another faction in subsequent updates. On to the issues...\n\nCurrently, there is no option to play an eight player skirmish match. Multiplayer is region locked, meaning you may only play with others within your part of the world. In order to play with other countries, you must change your download region in Steam, however this may result in a lot of lag depending on where you live. Unit pathfinding is wonky (particularly epic units), each one requires a bit of micromanagement to do what you actually want it to. Satisfying audio feedback from past RTS games, such as Command and Conquer, are not present here (no big chunky explosions when laying waste to an enemy army or base). Unit selection quotes are forgettable, nor do said units gain any visual indicators of particular upgrades unlike other games in the genre. I was also hoping to play with some campaign specific units only to be left wanting (there is one campaign specific unit in the Emergence Campaign downloadable content).\n\nSummary\n\nUsually, I would have waited for a sale before picking this up (this is Steam after all). But I've been waiting for a real RTS on PC for a long time. I couldn't wait, I wanted in from the ground up and wasn't disappointed. In my opinion, Grey Goo delivered. It's a creative, polished and genuine RTS title that fans of the genre will enjoy. Another reviewer noted most of Grey Goo's negative reviews were linked to it's weak launch. Petroglyph have since proven their dedication to their product by giving it the support it needed. Now it just needs more players...","January 29, 2015","true","58.4"," 89 of 108 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","89","108","7","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherasfox/recommended/290790/","etherasfox","Etheras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherasfox/","325 products in account","WOW. Just like... wow!!\n\nThis game really snuck up on me. I hadn't even heard of it until I saw it in the "New Releases" in the strategy section here on Steam. At first I thought it was an Indie game, but its not. Its a monumental game, with a long rich single player campaign.\n\nThis game harkens back to the glory days of RTS, when every other PC game was RTS, and before cross-platform console games became the fad... and virtually spelled the end of the RTS genre. You see: its very hard to play RTS with one of those archaic gamepads, but rather than establish better peripherals for console (like mouse and keyboard), game companies simply dropped titles that didn't play well on console, so that they could release on Xbox and Playstation and PC with one giant game and get the largest userbase. Greed trumped making good and interesting games, and so everybody started making FPS.\n\nI've gone off on a tangent, and I apologize... but there is a reason. Before the consoles became a serious gaming platform, RTS got a AAA+ treatment from publishers and development studios. They were graphically amazing, with fully rendered cutscenes, long rich campaigns around interesting stories, great dialog presented by great voice actors, well-balanced but with challenging AI (etc). And then it all went away (except for Starcraft 2 and some Space RTS's), leaving the RTS genre primarily being advanced by nostalgic Indie developers.\n\n... at least: until now. This game is amazing. Its basically the game that I would expect to see from all major publishers if the Console fad hadn't taken off. Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n---- THE GOOD ----\n\n* GRAPHICS : Beautiful game. Awesome scenery filled with lush alien forests and swamps interspersed with strange alien machinery. The architecture of the buildings is imaginative and interesting, including the base buildings. Unit design is also interesting, with the human drones looking more like works of art than military machines. And of course there's the goo creatures: which are amazing to look at and scary. Explosions and laser bolts are quite beautiful too.\n\n* FULLY RENDERED CUTSCENES AND BRIEFINGS : I feel like I'm playing Starcraft! Only... Starcraft had mostly in-engine cutscenes, not full renders. So Grey-Goo takes it one step further! After each mission the player is rewarded with a 30-second (or so) cutscene made with love. Its film-quality (no exaggeration). Then the next level briefing is also fully rendered. It all looks like full-performance capture (with very good actors). The detail is such that you can see the pores in the alien's skin. The races have distinct looks and styles of dress, and even change their clothes from mission to mission. Really big kudos. It helps draw the player in big-time.\n\n* AI : The AI is challenging. Some levels can be very difficult, but usually this means you're missing some trick to circumvent a defense. While the AI is not quite human-quality, that is mitigated by the AI starting the level with established bases. So its not really a factor. Additonally, a difficulty setting allows you, if you do get stuck, to drop down to an easier level AI and not punish you too much.\n\n* ASYMMETRICAL STRATEGY : Especially around base-building, each race has a different build style and strategy, which adds variety between the races and gives some insight into their culture.\n\n* STORY : The story is really great so-far (I haven't completed the game), with interesting sci-fi concepts that are very believable (in fact: based on real theories). The dialog is great, and the voice acting delivering that dialog is great. Its all very immersive. Such that I played 11 hours straight today.\n\n* EPIC UNITS : Epic units are always fun. Its hard to get them (as it should be), but once you have them, they're very impressive and fun, soaking a lot of damage while independently targeting numerous enemies and blasting them away. In one mission you get to have 2 at once... twice the slaughter... twice the fun!\n\n* OPTIONAL OBJECTIVES : It adds a lot of replayability, especially for us full-completionists.\n\n* THE HUMANS ARE SUPER-ADVANCED : This is more of my personal preference, but the humans in this game are a bit like the Protoss in Starcraft. Lots of super-clean lines, strange alien architecture and glowy bits... and I like that. Its a nice departure from the old trope of "OMG advanced aliens coming to kick our butts". But also, for the humans to have a bit of an alien feel as we become super-advanced... is really quite an interesting idea.\n\n\n\n---- THE BAD ----\n\n* No VETERANCY SYSTEM : While I am sure the developers intended this as a throwback to old RTS, veterancy was eventually added to most games in that genre, and for good reason: otherwise the strategy tends to be to make waves of units and send them on suicide missions. Because there is no veterancy in this game, that tactic has been reborn (with some variation). It would be nice if there were a reason to keep your units alive, and perhaps make healing them easier.\n\n* THE CONTROLS : The controls are generally pretty good, but there are some weirdnesses like... if you select a unit and then the repair wrench, the unit is still selected. So you think you're controlling the unit but you aren't. Also like... the aliens have these great big battleships that you can assign soldiers to hop into and man gun-turrets... which is awesome! The problem is: there are 6 turrets, so they mostly cover the entirety of the top of the ship. But clicking on them selects the _unit_, not the _ship_ that they are riding in. This makes selecting the ship frustrating because you need to make sure you're clicking the back of it, or else it will select one of your gunners. Generally I learned just to assign the dreadnaught ship to a hotkey. But it was a minor annoyance.\n\n* THE SOUND : While the sound is really good, including the music, it fluctuates wildly. If I have the cutscenes at normal volume, ingame is very loud.\n\n* NO "DO YOU WANT TO EXIT" : Minor annoyance, but in a level with optional objectives, if you complete the primary objective, uncompleted optional objectives come up as _failed_. I'd prefer that the game tell me something like "Primary objective complete: are you ready to exit?" Or at least a "Complete primary objective? (Some optional objectives are still active!)"\n\n* UNITS AREN'T SUPER-INTERESTING : While this contradicts what I said above a bit, I do have one qualm... there's not a lot of variance in the units. There are quite a few that, at first glance, I can't really tell apart. Also there are LOT of hovertanks. I think they should have considered a little more variety.\n\n* UNITS ARE FAIRLY SYMMETRICAL : What I mean by this is... the aliens have regular soldiers, artillery, anti-vehicle, anti-infantry, bombers, fighters (etc), and so do the humans. The unit types between human and alien are virtually identical. While their base-building strategies are quite different, after the base is up, they're almost the same... with some variation for unique units and epic units. Its not like Starcraft where one species has great guns, the other has great armor and spells, and the other has enormous numbers. I do understand somewhat, why they cose not to do this though; because balancing asymmetrical RTS units is hard, and prone to exploitable failure. So its a minor disappointment, but an understandable one.\n\n---- IN CLOSING ----\n\nAll of the plusses are big plusses for me, and all the minuses are minor. I highly recommend this game 9/10 , and I hope they DLC and sequel the hell out of it. Its very interesting, and I want more!  :)\n\n\nEDIT: Just finished the single player campaign (with all optional objectives) and its GREAT right up through the end. I did notice a few bugs towards the end... got 1 crash, Goo units tend to get stuck, and 1 trigger on final map wouldn't activate. Had to move over it like 20 times)","January 24, 2015","true","19.9"," 70 of 81 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","70","81","6","0"

At the end of the campaign, you find out this game, which is billed as a full game, is only a precursor to an actual storyline. The Emergence mini-campaign only adds three more missions (total; not per race) which take place during the regular game's campaign from a different perspective, giving no additional story.\n\nUnit types are mostly what you'd expect (light units, scouts, medium units, artillery, air and anti-air). Note the distinct lack of heavy units. Instead, you get epic units, which are extremely overpowered monstrosities. Putting aside the controversial epic units, the basic units are limited and poorly balanced. Artillery and aircraft, for instance, do very little damage. Artillery can hardly even dent walls and structures; medium units do a much better job. Medium units, while doing decent damage, can't take much, and so are easily destroyed by static defenses.\n\nDespite all this, the game manages to be pretty fun for a limited time. Until the bugs and crashes strike. For instance, on the final campaign mission, if you save at all during the mission, the win conditions are negated. No matter what you do, you can't win. The bug was acknowledged and had a supposed fix in a patch, but the latest patch still contains the bug. And while I had no crashes during the campaign, nearly half of the skirmish matches I have played have experienced game crashes.\n\nAs for multiplayer, there are so few official maps available and the unofficial maps are mostly unbalanced, with none of them offering much more variety than amount and placement of resources, that it's really not worth playing for more than a few rounds.\n\nOverall, the incompleteness of the game makes it a disapointment.","November 23, 2015","false","33.0"," 334 of 493 people (68%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","68","334","493","16","7"

It is well made, great cinematics, high quality graphics (although the scenes a bit on the dark side) - yes worth the $49 release price IMO.\nI have now spent about 9 hrs playing and still working things out.  It is not complicated,  just an initiial learning curve of where and how to build structures, do upgrades, keep resources flowing etc.  There is ingame help but I found it to be  hints rather than a hand holding guide which I needed when i started playing.\n\nThere are 3 factions to learn to play- each quite different,\nLike other RTS games the idea is to build up a base/bases and pump out fighting units and destroy the enemy.\nYou only need to collect one type of resource.   You can have up to 200 units.\n\nTechnically the game plays very smooth and well on the main, i have had the game crash once when I was right clicking madly.\n\nIs it fun?  Well yes,  I am enjoying the campaign I have played so far.   The campaign consists of 15 missions-\n5 for each of the 3 factions so plenty of opportunnity to learn all aspects of the game.\n\nThe skirmish mode seems a bit limited as there are only 8 options of maps which include number of players each map.\n\nI have not played the MulitPlayyer as yet, due to none of my friends having this game, so cannot comment there.\n\nNothing can beat my AoM/AoE games but  I did enjoy the slightly different style of game here and glad I bought it.\nIf you enjoy space RTS games this is a nice one.  8/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 4, 2015","true","25.5"," 59 of 70 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","59","70","5","5"

This game deserves much higher than a 77. High 80s is more reasonable.\n\nThings to note:\n+The game is gorgeous. That's pretty damn rare in the RTS market.\n+Grey Goo implemented a race that turns traditional base-building strategy on its head and didn't break game balance.\n+It plays and feels like an old RTS, but updated and streamlined for the modern era of competitive gaming.\n+The multiplayer is freaking fun. Like seriously fun.\n+Grey Goo has added the ability to control every aspect of building/unit production via the Q,W,E,R keys. Making a Refinery is as easy as QQ and click where you want it. This frees you up for even more micro.\n\n-The campaign isn't very good. Petroglyph relied too heavily on artificial difficulty (poof! The enemy player suddenly has two epic units just because you broke down a certain section of wall!). They delighted in taking the glaring weakness of whatever race you are playing and make you do that thing over and over again. The turtle race doesn't get a level where they get to turtle. The "I have no turrets" race has to defend against endless tiny raids. Etc. And it's short with like 5-6 missions per faction.\n\n-Either this attracted some really skilled people, or all of the players have no life outside of Grey Goo.

The story is intersting to see unfold, and the cutscenese and voice acting are superb. The soundtrack is done by Frank Klepacki, who did the soundtrack for C&C games and Universe at War, another Petroglyph game. The three factions are the Beta, a race of 4 armed humanoids with walking tanks and conventional weapons, the Human, whose units are dominated by hovering drones with plasma guns, and the Goo, a "race" of Von Neuman machines who don't build bases, as thier "base" is a giant goo blob called a Mother Goo than can spawn factories on resource nodeds and can split once it harvests enough resources. Each faction plays differently than the others. The Beta can build base nodes anywhere, but base expansion is limited by the size of the node. Humans are locked to one base, but the base is expandable by power conduits, and the Goo simply use mobile Mother Goos as HQs.\n\nSecond, this game comes equipped with an offline skirmish mode where you can practice against the AI.\n\nThird, Grey Goo's PvP online allows you to go 1v1 or 2v2, and allows for AI vs. Human matches.\n\nRanked matches are matched via skill, whichhelps to avoid newbies getting constantly annahilated by more experinced players. No Replay mode ATM, but it is on the way.\nThis game comes with a map editor, so the 8 maps that are included in the game are not the end.\n\nOverall, Grey Goo is well worth the asking price if you are any kind of RTS fan. If you are unsure, check out some Youtube videos and Steam reviews, as no demo is currently out.","January 26, 2015","true","16.5"," 62 of 77 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","62","77","3","0"

If you can suffer through reading my review, the game has pros and cons that can be interpreted differently by different players.\n\n>Played during development stages, got to top 30 in 1v1 by playing goo.\n>Felt bad for playing an overpowered race (2 minute rage quit wins, or massive map expansion)\n>Took a break to see if they would adjust the races.\n>A big patch finally nerfs goo early game, commandos, and gladiuses (gladi?)\n>Goo is still OP (imho), can still end the game in very early stages, but beta have a chance at stopping them (not sure on humans b/c I don't play them much)\n\nThe biggest problem I have- The resource areas deplete after a while (usually a long time at least), forcing expansion, but also expansion is very helpful in the game overall. Humans have never discovered how to counter the enigma of the sloped plane, so if there is a hill they can't expand out of their initial area. Beta have easy expansion, but they are vulnerable during it. These are well-balanced. However, the goo can expand easily without being vulnerable early game, and they can dominate the map. Unless the goo player has poor micro skills, it is rare that they lose.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend people to give the game a try while it is on sale, NOT for full price. The campaign is fun, and sometimes challenging. I'd also recommend to play with friends, rather than getting frustrated in ranked against different exploits.\n\nPros:\n-great campaign, great cutscenes (haven't bought the dlc)\n-cool units, well designed, good graphics\n-units effectively counter each other (ex: AP versus tanks, tanks versus infantry)\n-satisfying wins (competitive)\n-high skill cap (heavy micro management)\n-A LOT like Universe at War (one of their older games, played it when I was younger)\n-good servers as far as I've seen\n-development team that tries to balance the game, listens to the community\n-despite my hate on goo, it does require some degree of micro skill\n-spamming one unit doesn't (usually) win the game\n\nCons:\n-obnoxious exploits\n-goo is still a bit off-balance\n-somewhat repetitive\n-lacks any kind of memorable "punch" (does it's job but does not excel in it's genre)\n-very small active community\n-restricting unit cap (maybe just to me b/c I love massive battles) (200, epic units count as 60 if I remember correctly)\n-people like me who write massive reviews","December 29, 2015","false","28.0"," 112 of 164 people (68%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","68","112","164","15","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/garrickwinter/recommended/290790/","garrickwinter","GarrickWinter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/garrickwinter/","508 products in account","This is a tricky game to review because, personally, I came to Grey Goo with high hopes but willing to forgive a lot just to have a new fun entry in my favourite genre that isn't Starcraft. I love RTS games and want to see more of them, so take that into account while reading this review.\n\nFirst, some technical problems. I'm running on a PC that was mid-ranged in 2012, and while the game itself mostly performs fine, the menu system has horrifically bad performance, stuttering at almost every opportunity. The in-game HUD is pretty large, and it's not always easy to tell what's going on at a glance since there's a lot of swapping similar panels out for one another. Unit pathfinding can get pretty bad, units push each other around (including into enemy fire!) and sometimes units seem downright unresponsive.\n\nThe three different factions are quite interesting. I like the mobile, sneaky approach to the Goo's design, which goes against the swarms-of-units that you expect given the marketing; actual unit production with the Goo (you produce  sneaky, weak units that turn into more specialized units) is really innovative, but it's also tedious and difficult to manage, and easy to lose track of a Protean here or there. Playing against the Goo can become painful, though, because it's so hard to track down their ever-moving Mother Goos. The other two factions are fairly standard in RTS terms, though the Humans have a more lone-fortress approach to base building while the Beta are more about sprawling and forward expansions.\n\nIn terms of moment-to-moment gameplay, I'd say that it's overall good solid fun, with a nice feel of ebb-and-flow once things really get going. A few caveats: units die extremely quickly and are completely disposable; area-of-effect attacks are, given how fragile units are, ludicrously effective; and the "epic" units are too slow and, yes, fragile to feel truly epic (though they do have massive AOE attacks that can wipe out dozens of units at a time, especially the insane Hand of Ruk). On the other hand, the brush cover mechanic that lets you hide units in forests is brilliant, and the developers aren't stingy with that cover either. Combine that with the Goo's mobility and the way that terrain height affects visibility, and you get an RTS where terrain actually matters significantly in combat, which is great.\n\nAs for the campaign, I've just played through the entire thing, and it's a mixed bag. The developers saw fit to make the AI in the campaign extremely aggressive, even on "normal"; by the third mission in, the AI was rushing my base with a dozen or more units 90 seconds into the game (a point at which it's almost impossible to have built more than a handful of units). In many cases it pays to avoid and skirt around mission objectives until you can amass a large force, since progresssing through objectives usually triggers even more aggressive AI behavior. There are other missions, though, where it's fairly easy to smash some key bases and wait around to build epics that will destroy everything else. Overall, the difficulty varies wildly, though at least the challenge gives you a sense of accomplishment.\n\nIn terms of the story components, the cutscenes are gorgeous (best CGI faces I think I've ever seen in a video game), and the narrative itself is original and interesting, with some pertinent themes about science, exploration, and responsibility towards life. Unfortunately, the game itself doesn't let the story shine through; there are story elements mentioned in marketing materials or on official websites (or even on the Steam trading cards!) that never actually get dealt with in-game, which seems silly. Much of the narrative feels rushed, like they had more they wanted to say and do than they actually had the money/time to implement. The narrative has a solid core, but it needs some fleshing out to be truly great.\n\nOverall, I would say that Grey Goo is a promising, if flawed, RTS; a pretty good game, but not a great one. It's good enough that I hope they get to make a sequel, and that they get the opportunity to iron out the kinks from this initial offering. With a lot more attention to user-friendliness across the board, and a more fleshed-out and confident approach to the narrative, this game could really be something special.\n\nUgh, given how rare new RTS games are as of 2015, I feel like I just said "Pandas are pretty good mammals, but they're not great."

While Grey Goo isn't going to make the top-10 of all-time, it is a wonderfully solid and smart game, and a very welcome addition to the greatest genre in gaming.\n\nWhat Grey Goo does better than most, from my perspective, is variation in faction/race type. One of them, anyway. There are three races, the Beta, the Humans, and the Goo. While the Humans and Beta are rather similar -- nicely done but somewhat generic military sci-fi type units -- the Goo are downright freaky! There are giant grey goobly globs called Mother Goo that slither and slime around the map like year old Jell-o, and from their (yuck) loins spring forth all manner of other oddball units, from thick-legged spiders with headlights, to giant, tank-like creatures that look like a cross between a sting ray and a rhino. Just weird, and thrilling. One of the most intriguing and original faction designs I can think of.\n\nThe single player campaign consists of fifteen missions ranging from 45 minutes to an hour and a half a piece. And that's not counting retries, as this game is hard. Once you get the hang of a certain level you'll see a clear but challenging path to the end (hint: that clear path often involves building epic units), but until then, certain levels will leave you frustrated to tears as you throw all manner of units and strategies up against the proverbial wall and wonder what you're doing wrong.\n\nWhen I finished the game and finally overcame the the epic length and difficulty of the story campaign, it really did feel like an accomplishment. You know that feeling when you plug away at a tough game for a while, curses screamed and pets scared, and you feel wired up and full of energy? I was bouncing around my house for a good 10 minutes after finishing the last level; smiling, laughing, pumping my fist.

There are no special unit abilities which in my opinion adds more to the charm, each unit is strong and weak against another. The units themselve are very interesting in both design and how they move and for once we get to see the Humans as the more tech savvy fellows.\n\nThe tech tree is simplistic, you get to choose 1 out of 3 upgrades for each type of unit (light, heavy, air, economy) and each upgrade caters to your overall playstyle.\n\nBase building and management is interesting and not hard to understand if you have played RTS games before (this apply's to the Human and Beta faction only).\n\nThe campaign is lengthy, fully voiced and interesting to boot. The missions for each faction can be easy or hard, some are quite challenging taking up to 1 or 2 hours to beat and even some restarts. Some of them are trial and error and that's the charm of them. I was never angry with loosing a mission and having to restart again, I learned the AI's tactics each time I restarted and adapted.\n\nAnd of course, the soundtrack is amazing. But what else could you expect from Frank Klepacki.\n\nHowever, for those that love to play multiplayer in RTS, the game currently has a max of 4 players on maps (ie 4 FFA or 2v2).

Many patches do exist, and technical and performance issues may have been resolved. I hope those were successful, but the integral weaknesses of the game's design cause it to be unsuccessful in providing a truly AAA RTS experience. The hotkey system is still brilliant however.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGrey Goo is an RTS offering from a studio many would consider one of the masters of the craft - Petroglyph. Responsible for the origins of franchises such as Command and Conquer (as well as a personal favourite of mine, Star Wars: Empire at War - though the quality of this particular entry could certainly be debated).\n\nGrey goo wanders in to the Sci-Fi realm of the asymmetrical RTS, making it directly comparable to the likes of Starcraft 2. A comparison which it would rather avoid given how poorly it ends up matching up.\n\nYou can certainly make the argument that two races are indeed asymmetrical (the namesake grey goo offer a significantly different play style), the differentiation between the two humanoid species is - dubious at best. The superficial construction mechanics offer a little variety but the underlying units and strategies are not nearly as diverse as one might hope.\n\nThe game does do a few things excellently however.\n\nThe hotkey system is one that should be ripped off by any future RTS game developer. The design is elegant in its simplicity and intuitive in a way I would not have necessarily believed had I not experienced it myself.\n\nThe game is slower paced than contemporary RTS - Starcraft 2 - requiring less micro control from the gamer and a more efficient and considered macro game. You learn quickly that economy is king, and you will - even when facing easier AI competition - find yourself overwhelmed if you don't nail down some early game builds. This leads to some concern over the balance of different strategies in the multiplayer version of the game.\n\nThe campaign is perfectly serviceable if unspectacular. The missions are diverse, and the game itself looks quite beautiful - but that beauty comes at a cost.\n\nThe performance issues of this game are the major hampering factor to truly enjoying the experience. This machine is no slouch and the "real time" rendering is pretty atrociously laggy. The game also slows, stutters and downright chokes once a certain number of units are on the field. It's worth noting that I did not see any of that in the mission maps, only multiplayer.\n\nThe menus cruise along at an impressive *cough* 12-15 FPS. The system shows no sign of strain (GPU temps remain a cool 48 degrees for example).\n\nSo, all this said, is this a recommend or not?\n\nSadly, for the cost, it's hard to justify the expense. I suspect the player base will make multiplayer a relatively modest affair, but once the cost gets low enough, it's certainly a very enjoyable campaign and the grey goo are a joy to play with should you desire to skirmish a little.\n\nSo, it is with sadness that I do NOT recommend this game outside of a nice aggressively priced sale. I was hoping to find a new RTS in to which I could sink dozens if not hundreds of hours. This game ended up falling short - but in the long run, I don't believe I will regret having it in my library, only that I paid so much to get it there.","May 14, 2015","false","6.1"," 288 of 474 people (61%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","61","288","474","16","4"

Its not a game you should buy hoping for a lasting multiplayer experience, at least not with what the game offers currently.\n\nSingle player: The campaign itself is decent with cool cutscenes and a nice lore surrounding the factions, however i wouldnt recommend you buying this game solely on the single player experience, as the campaign itself is not long enough or that interesting compared to the price your paying.\n\nFinal opinion; So why do i recommend this game, its a decent game with a cool art and functional gameplay that has the potencial to get better if the developers put their dedication back into the game. But as things stands the game is sort of in limbo waiting for the developers get their act together. I will still recommend it because it has potential that`s the main thing to look for in this game.\n\nSo buy it if you wanna support the developers or just want to play a short singleplayer campaign if you are bored.\nDont buy it if you want a solid and competitive multiplayer experience.","May 29, 2015","true","494.7"," 35 of 45 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","35","45","3","0"

Its premise is a return to the traditional RTS design philosophy, discarding new trends (many of them result of the search for e-sport status) such as weak defenses, ultra-fast pace, death-balls, and micro-intensiveness, trends that reward fast twitch reflexes and perfect build orders instead of strategic acumen.\n\nI believe they have succeeded: if you are tired of these trends (and you can bet I am - Starcraft II was a huge disappointment for me) and fondly recall old RTS games with epic, long yet relaxed matches over LAN, you'll probably find something to love in Grey Goo. As it somehow always happens to me with Westwood Games, it took me a bit of time to get used to the game flow and interface (boy I sucked at the beginning), but once I did I had a blast.\n\nFurthermore, Grey Goo offers an appealing setting, supported by rock-solid audiovisual design (Weta Workshop had part in conceptual design, for starters). For me, this is one of its greatest strengths. The game offers a more proper "science fiction" background than your typical PC-game fare (more given to the "science fantasy" genre), with a nice touch of wackiness. I enjoyed it for its interesting concepts (microscopic wormhole travel via nanotech, Von Neumann probes gone awry, an original but not quite apocalyptic "grey goo" scenario, humans that are more technologically advanced, aloof and "alien" than the aliens proper, etc.), for its general "vibe" (an grounded yet optimistic outlook reminiscent of 70s space fantasy, instead of the typical cynical and nihilistic take of most games), and for its honest story (featuring relatable characters that don't randomly act like psychopaths for artificial dramatic effect).\n\nThe other key strength of the game is the "Goo" faction itself. While Humans and Beta (the other playable factions) have different mechanics as typical in modern RTS, this creepy faction offers a truly unique experience. For starters, they have no buildings - as Goo, you have mother masses of formless goo moving around the map eating resources, and growing to perform mitosis. The formless goo masses that result can be used as units in their own right, or morph into specific forms that fulfill a more specialized role. It sounds very strange, but once experienced it becomes second nature and a nice respite from the usual RTS gameflow.\n\nThose were the highlights for me - but for an important general outlook of the game, I'll use a pros vs. cons list:\n\nPros:\n- Three different and interesting factions, including the titular, creepy and original Grey Goo.\n- Rock-solid gameplay with traditional design of the Westwood school.\n- Excellent graphics and visual design.\n- Excellent sound design (background sounds, voice acting, unit sounds and ambiance are all very well done).\n- Superb soundtrack courtesy of Frank Klepacki himself (author of dozens of classic game soundtracks - maybe you know him from Red Alert, Emperor: Battle for Dune, Universe at War or others - if not, you should!).\n- An interesting science fiction setting that makes you like the factions.\n- A solid campaign with good difficulty, an interesting story, and a lot of well directed, top-notch cutscenes (from now on I'll keep track of their maker, Axis Animation).\n- A terrain editor ships with the game.\n\nCons:\n- The campaign, while satisfying, is a bit short and its mission design could have been more varied (for me Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, an otherwise forgettable game, is the gold-standard in this regard).\n- The Skirmish and Multiplayer modes are fun but bare bones - it would be nice to have more options, game types and maps to play around.\n- Some users report lower FPS than expected. I cannot verify nor comment since my 8 year old, technically unsupported PC logically struggles with the game but still manages to have a pretty  playable experience (which I'm pretty happy about).\n\nTo close, I loved the game as it hit a lot of right stylistic and game design notes for me, so I admit I'm an enthusiastic and biased (who isn't) reviewer. Nevertheless, I would sincerely recommend it for any RTS fans that enjoy the aforementioned design philosophy or had their interest piqued by the setting.","February 5, 2015","true","179.3"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","27","33","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aurunz/recommended/290790/","Aurunz","Auron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aurunz/","719 products in account","Grey Goo is a well rounded old style RTS with a macro focus, not as macro focused as Supreme Commander but something more alike to Westwood's original RTS concepts with Dune and C&C. It's only logical since Petroglyph is a studio formed from what was left of Westwood after the EA debacle years ago.\n\nThe game's reasonably well balanced with no major complaints or at least an equal amount of complaints about every faction being op and there's an active online community right now. The micromanagement heavy style that you see in high level SC2 games doesn't seem possible since units have no active abilities, the game is also a tad slower than most modern RTS players(if there's any left) would be used to. It makes up for that with great faction design, it reminds me a bit of Universe at War in that field since they all play pretty differently. Humans and Beta are a bit more alike with relatively standard base building that differs greatly in execution and building but the Goo is as different as the Hierarchy was in UaW. The Goo has mobile bases that replicate themselves into other "bases" or smaller clumps of goo that turn into units and it's surely one of the more interesting factions in RTS in a long time, also the owner of the silliest name.\n\nOverall I recommend this game very much so, it's like the return of Westwood, hopefully it'll do well enough that they can keep doing their thing in the years to come. As an addendum there's the AWESOME soundtrack by Frank Klepacki himself, the man still makes incredible music and it shall not disappoint both fans and new listeners.","January 26, 2015","true","62.0"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","31","44","2","2"

The CGI in the campaign is literally un-matched and has a fantastic short story. A very entertaining RTS that gives you 4 unique factions that play quite differently from one another. I am glad to see the developers are active and keeping the user experience at the highest level.\n\n[CAMPAIGN]\n\nThe story is golden and gives you adequate information on each faction -Shroud, To provide you with confidence when playing the factions in skirmish. Unfortunately the campaign is not very long and leaves me wanting more! This is not exactly bad news simply because it is amazing, just that it leaves you with a desire for more. I recommend everyone that owns this game play the entire Campaign.\n\n[SKIRMISH]\n\n//Beta -\nIronically, The Beta are a Human-like alien race with lesser technology and primitive weapons when compared to the other factions. (ie. [Ballistics; missiles, rockets, bullets, cannons]  Heavy armor, rugged metal designs, simple looking structures.) Nonetheless an extremely fun faction to play as. The Epic is a great utility on the battlefield and can easily sway the odds in your favor. Simple expansion, good variety of units with good stats. Beta IMO are the easiest to play as with their layout of bases, which can be placed anywhere you have vision and space to do so. Overall Beta provides you with a great variety of units and structures to give you a high winning % with a low learning curve!\n\n//Humans -\nSci Fi-like units and tech, Drones are the primary make-up of vehicles. Teleportation gives you the ability to teleport units to a certain "visible" location. Also, teleporting structures across the conduits gives flexibility and many strategic options. Units deal decent damage and the Epic is all-around quite powerful and can quickly shut down the opposition when played correctly. HQ is the central point of your expansion in which you can only extend so far with, sadly. Great defensive capabilities but expanding is rather difficult. Overall Humans give you a slightly harder yet satisfying experience. The diversity of the Humans makes them deadly when you learn the curve.\n\n//Goo -\nA complex algorithm which evolved into a deadly consolidation of nanites that are extremely adaptive. Unlike the other 3 factions the Goo do not have a set HQ, instead an exceptionally mobile "Mother Goo" in which can split itself (Meiosis) into smaller proteins in which form units. The Mother Goo is also able to countlessly split and form into additional Mother Goo's that give you easy expansion over the entire map. The Goo are easy to play but hard to master. Goo are primarily illusive and are extremely hard to pin down which give them versatility. The unit make-up is interesting and can leave you favoring only a few for mulit role functions. No air units! Damage and health are not quite as good as the Human and Beta faction, Instead utilize quantity of quality. Having only the need for "Spigots" (appear as steam from resource pools) the Goo can indefinately produce units and over time wean down the other factions when they become resource drained. The Goo are dangerous when using "Zerg-like" tactics to overwhelm the enemy. The Epic can be had quickly and is deadly in more than one way, able to heal Mother Goo and consume targets (not for health) as well as pulverize from a distance. Overall The Goo are IMO the most fun yet challenging of the 4 factions which require a decent amount of awareness.\n\n//Shroud "Silent Ones" -\nAncient race that coincidentally resemble the Protoss from Starcraft and are equally as powerful! The Shroud is the newest playable faction and shake up the roster a great deal. Able to evolve, overcharge, mimic etc.. The Shroud can easily overcome an opposition's tactics. Unique characteristics for their units which can give them high damage and armor if upgraded properly. The base units can seem a bit underpowered early game. The Shroud has amplifiers which obviously amplify and can evolve into spikes which give you great adaptivity. Unfortunately you can not go back once evolving amplifiers. While not able to set base anywhere from the start like the Beta, The Shroud can however expand when placing structures and exctractors down to provide a larger radius in which to place structures. The Shroud has the most devastating air units IMO and can easily change the tides of a battle especially against the Goo. The Epic is by far the strongest of the 4 factions and as a result needs to be evolved to stage 3 which can take a great deal of time after building. Overall The Shroud are not easy to learn but once understood IMO are the strongest of the 4. (My favorite race)\n\nI know it was not a long review but it is worth describing how great of a game Grey Goo is.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone that enjoys RTS of any form. The gameplay is entertaining, the graphics are tasty, the audio is crisp, and the CGI is un-matched.\n\nP.S. The Shroud aka Silent One's Epic, The Dirge at Stage 3 drops black holes.\n\nWould Black Hole an entire race into extinction again 10/ Divide by 0","February 9","true","72.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","1"

Obviously, there will be endless comparisons with other big franchises such as Starcraft and Command and Conquer.  While it does share some qualities with the previously mentioned games, Grey Goo successfully presents its own fresh take on the genre while still staying close to the roots of classic RTS games.\n\nThe Goo faction is what probably catches most people's eyes.  They are a unique faction which relies on taking over the map with self replicating nanobots.  They are unique in that they technically don't have base, and all of the units are produced by breaking off "Proteans" from the "Mother Goo."  These Proteans can be morphed instantly into whatever unit you feel is suited for a given moment.  The Goo faction plays very reactionary, and requires a lot of multi-tasking during the late game.\n\nThe other two factions are slightly more traditional.  They are the Humans and the Betas.  The Humans are very good at playing defensively.  Often, it is very difficult to break into their main base due to the wide array of defenses and powerful units they have.  Betas, on the other hand, have weaker yet more mobile units which encourages aggressive play that rewards good micro skills.\n\nThis game is slower paced than a game such as Starcraft, but that does not take away from the skill required to play the game.  Micromanaging your forces is important as fights generally last longer than they would, again, in Starcraft.  Having a high APM (Actions Per Minute) is useful, but does not present as many benefits as it would in other games.\n\nMechanics aside, the game also features modest-sized campaign.  There are five missions for each faction (15 total).  The campaign is garnished with very impressive cutscenes, and a killer soundtrack.  The story is alright, but the gameplay was fun enough to supplement the mulitplayer.  I would not recommend the game if you were just going to play the campaign and then drop it.\n\nOverall, the game is very fun.  In an industry dominated by MOBAs and FPS, Grey Goo has satisfied an itch which has been long overdue.  I highly recommend this game if you are into competitive matchmaking, and hope the game grows to have a modest playerbase.\n\nPros:\n+Stylish graphics\n+Great Soundtrack\n+Decent campaign\n+Fun, unique factions\n+Competitive multiplayer\n\nCons:\n-Lack of replays (Devs say it will come shortly after launch)\n-Menu lag\n-Somewhat lack of diversity in distinguishing Goo units\n-AI could be better\n-Maps could be bigger and allow for more than 4 players at once","January 24, 2015","true","10.5"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Given the small developer, it's amazingly close to Starcraft2 level quality. Visuals are awesome once you get contrast/gamma tuned up. Multiplayer ladder is very engaging. Cheese exists, as do cheese counters. As a novice, gameplay seems a bit slower and more positionally strategic compared to SC2, though there is certainly room for micro APM to make a huge difference. There are a few "first release" bugs, but pretty minimal and as-expected. Windowed-Fullscreen works well.

If they keep releasing content, it'll be an instant classic.\n\nMechanics:\n\nWalls have made a return and with them come units that receive defensive bonuses for mounting them. The cutscenes and music are great. The unit trees are great and the tech attachments include upgrades for units you might not expect. Resources are acquired via refineries, extractors (1:1) and pools. There's an optimal spot to place the extractors on the pools where you get +25% minerals per second, but if there's no other pools close by you may want to forego that bonus in favor of building two refineries and offsetting two extractors on a single pool.\n\nDifficulty:\n\nI've had to walk away from some missions on the campaign and reapproach with a different strategy with the difficulty just set to 'Normal'. To echo what another reviewer said, it seems the AI will scout you and if you don't have at least two factories cranking out units from the time you establish your first refinery, they're going to hit you with everything they've got.\n\nVideo:\n\nWhat you see is what you get. It's a great looking game.\n\nAudio:\n\nI don't keep up with who composed which game, etc. I'm usually the guy who gets annoyed by the background music and turns it off so I can hear other things while I'm playing the game.

There is a single player campaign that involves cut scenes and voice acting which has a high production quality.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/obidankenobi/recommended/290790/","obidankenobi","TR-8R","http://steamcommunity.com/id/obidankenobi/","549 products in account","A game that both old and new fans of RTS can get into and enjoy equally. The campaign alone is quality and is well worth checking out. An epic military science-fiction setting and story with well made CGI cutscenes and briefing sections from characters inbetween the actual missions to flash out the story more. Besides the campaign, the game offers a Skirmish, LAN and online multiplayer modes with about about a dozen (I forgot how many maps were there exactly at the time I was typing this review) or so maps although the developers have confirmed that there will be more to come in the future, but fret not as this is covered by the awesome and competent custom map editor which, I hope, to see it grow with innovation from the community!\n\nThe game is as traditional RTS as it gets but there is definitely a significant and unique take on its gameplay. There are three factions in the game and each faction is unique in its base building, unit variation, aesthetic, design, lore and its playstyle. As the name of the game suggests, the Goo faction is the main highlight as it's significantly different over the other two factions in the game (the Human & the Beta) but this does not mean that the other factions don't have any awesome tricks up their sleeves. All 3 factions are nicely balanced and worth trying out, which one is the best is entirely up to you, and that's the beauty of it.\n\nOn the technical side of things, the performances does need a tiny bit more optimization as frame rates on a few occasions can plunge down by good bit when many units are battling it out on screen but for the most part the game runs smoothly and it isn't that demanding of your hardware to enjoy the sheer beauty of Grey Goo's battles and the lush world of Ecosystem 9.\n\nOverall, Grey Goo is a greatly polished and epic science-fiction RTS game well worth its selling price as it offers a good and quality campaign, a competent online multiplayer and a nice offline skirmish mode with a smart AI that can satisfy both casual and hardcore RTS fans. Petroglyh understands what made RTS games so fun and why it was superbly popular back then, but they also don't fear from bringing out something new! A familiar but unique RTS game that can be enjoyed by fans yet also pushes forward and oozes with innovation... ALL THIS plus Frank Klepacki's awesome, AWESOME music.\n\nI am looking forward to seeing Petroglyph expand on its new IP with new and gripping campaigns which will flash out the story and lore  evenmore in the future, I hope for the community and mulitplayer to grow and signifies its success as a really good RTS.\n\nMy final score for Grey Goo is a superb 9/10 from me. One of the funnest and best RTS games that I've played in years! :)","January 23, 2015","true","16.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

While I have had some issues with the gamma (screen a bit dark for my liking) the game has so far ran smooth and I have only ran into one bug that was not game breaking.\n\nThe game follows the tried and true formula of 3 factions.  The Beta here play like Humans do in most other games. Then you have the humans which play with a bit more advanced looking technology than the Beta and finally you have the truely alien race that plays by overwhelming your forces the Grey Goo.  Think Zerg if the Zerg were a machine like fluid race.\n\nThe game itself plays a lot like the classical Command and Conquer series than Starcraft though.  Personally I like it's slower pace.  Well at least when playing Beta against Human.  The Goo is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ personally.  Between it being overwhelming and having bases that can move around the map, sometimes they will have you yelling at your screen as you try to track down that last bit of Goo.\n\nAll in all though I have at the time of this posting just under seven and a half hours play time with Grey Goo and they have been very fun.  I highly recommend the game.","January 25, 2015","true","11.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The interface is one of the best I've ever seen for an RTS.  And while after playing about 50 online PvP matches I still am not 100% decided on how much meat there is on the bone.  I don't think this is a game of endless strategic discovery.  That might no be a bad thing, it depends on your preference in this regard.\n\nAs of now I am still having fun, after all the game looks fantastic and it plays smoothly and is responsive.\n\nMy biggest concern is the design of the factions.  You have to play each faction differently and because of that there are built-in advantages given to each faction and to be successful you must explore those, and in the end it can feel a bit like "I was forced to play this way" - because, to be honest playing another way just won't work.\n\nTake the Humans for example, you simply have no option to expand.  You have to turtle up in your base.\n\nThe Beta have to expand, but are much weaker in unit power and composition\n\nthe Goo has to be constantly on the move and making short term, quick decisions since they spawn units right on the battlefield.  You must have a pretty healthy apm to play them well.\n\nIf you don't mind that sort of paint by number approach to your options then you may end up enjoying this game greatly.\n\nAfter about 30 hours of play time in I do recommend this game for people who are looking for a responsive, fun, old-school RTS game but don't necessarily need a ton of new discovery to be baked in to their game play.\n\nsingle player is fairly short with some cool missions, overall it was fun to romp through them\nskirmish is there and it's good\n\nbiggest complaint is that multiplayer is limited to 4 players max.  That seems like a big mistake and step backwards in the genre.  This fact alone will assuredly hurt sales and RTS + MOBA games have baked in play groups already established and playing with 3 other friends in a game makes it easier to expand sales and entice new players and expand the community size, which right now seems small.","February 6, 2015","true","108.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

Alot of games these days feel like theres no COMPELLING story anymore, But the story for GG is very well done and at the end of the game you just want more.

Even though there isn't alot of levels prepare yourself....they can last an hour without you even knowing, The skirmish levels are just as good with the AI. There not just getting resources and rarely attacks you. They bring EVERYTHING at you. Which is fun and hectic.

It does everything it can to make your life easier (what with the QWERT keybind controls and auto-harvesters for the Humans and Beta) but falls short on the skirmish/multiplayer side of things.  It really would have been awesome to have the ability to set up and see a "4 vs 4" or "2 vs 3" or something along those lines.  I also found the AI to be a bit too aggressive and difficult, even on "easy".  I lost many matches against the "easy" AI and I consider myself to be a moderately experienced RTS player (though I admittedly love to turtle, which this game seems to discourage).  This ruthlessness will most certainly frustrate newcomers to no end and at times, I honestly wished that I could tell the AI to tone it down a bit and expand more slowly.  With the above issues in mind, those short on money may want to wait for a price drop (like I would have done had I not received a press key)."\n\nFull Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/grey-goo/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3cUiZWIjw4","February 12, 2015","true","5.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waywardRTS/recommended/290790/","waywardRTS","wayward","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waywardRTS/","95 products in account","I unreservedly recommend this game to RTS fans everywhere. Grey Goo is a completely new RTS universe with a distinctly Command and Conquer vibe.\n\nI consider myself a long time fan of Petroglyph games. I put possibly upwards of 100 hours into Universe at War, and was perhaps one of the only people who signed up for Games for Windows Live solely to play ranked multiplayer in the game. I was in the beta for aborted games Mytheon and End of Nations and was in fact one of the most outspoken proponents of this latter game. But the bitter taste left in my mouth by End of Nations’ demise left me jaded at best when it comes to supporting games and, sadly, especially those by Petroglyph.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nI always like to start with the low hanging fruit – typically, the graphics. The game is pretty good looking for what it is, though certainly not in the way that Company of Heroes is. Units and structures in Grey Goo are detailed, but look almost intentionally modeled after plastic or pewter game pieces – Human units in particular evoke the minimalism of white plastic chessmen. In contrast, the scenery is verdant and wild, with industrialized set pieces in particular looking pretty darn nifty.\n\nThe game’s color palette, especially that of the terrain, tends to be a little muddy, with most guides out there recommending that Gamma be set to 125% to get better visualization, particularly on twilight maps where the sunsets oranges and purples serve to further muddy things up visually. Visually, my only real complaint is the look of large outcroppings of rock or catalyst veins. The jungle scenery and mechanized terrain doodads are quite well done, but large aggregations of rock or ‘hardened Goo’ textures just don’t do it for me in this game. Easily my favorite visuals in Grey Goo are the Goo factions “formless” units – that is, Mother Goos and Proteans, and the Human Core.\n\nThe Core pulses, throws out holograms, and has awesome little shimmery lines all throughout. To me, it’s one of the most visually striking command centers in a game, and feels very much like the beating heart of the Human faction. Proteans contain some neat fluid dynamics and despite their near featurelessness are pretty iconic in their own right. I do wish, however, that there was some additional distinction between Small, Large and Mother proteans. Mama Goos have a little glowing cluster crowning their blob to set themselves apart, but Large Proteans in particular seem to lack a defining characteristic.\n\nCAMPAIGN\n\nThis article is already tediously long, but single player is very important to many RTS gamers so I feel I cannot again leave this out. I can unreservedly recommend Grey Goo to RTS gamers who are looking for a decent story. Grey Goo’s story is not a hackneyed yarn about contesting some magical resource – catalyst is just a thing. It’s important, but not Spice Melange or Tiberium important. It’s not a space opera, comic bookish yarn about prophecies or magical space crystals – it’s much more Asimov than Lucas in its presentation. It’s a story of confusion and loss, of protecting populaces and understanding foes. It’s incredibly well presented in terms of production and actually fairly challenging – I had to change the game difficulty after the 4th campaign mission. Like the rest of the game, Grey Goo’s campaign isn’t pretentious or over the top, just well crafted and remarkably solid. I say bravo here...\n\nC&C\n\nGrey Goo is assuredly a game in the lineage of Command and Conquer. Many of the design choices have taken nods from the classic Westwood experience – the semi-automated nature of resource harvesting, the renewable (and single) resource, the necessity of player to watch their expenditures so as to not stall out their production, the soul of this game is the soul of Command and Conquer games in many ways.\n\nBut its heart is its own. Those who are nostalgic about Command and Conquer are more likely to enjoy it than others, but the combat model is not what they’d expect from C&C games. StarCraft gamers may find the game shallow or slow, though perhaps they might find the pace refreshing and the combat interesting, as I do. Those interested in single player are likely to be satisfied with the well composed story and interesting faction variation. There’s a lot here to love, if what was left out of the game (relative to whatever you’re comparing it with) isn’t a deal-breaker for you.","February 1, 2015","true","132.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Decent. The CGI scenes? Excellent. The missions themselves? Challenging. The rest of the game? Underwhelming. Low amount of content for a game claiming to be AAA. Universe at War and Empire at War has way more content than GG. Even the graphics settings are underwhelming, like there is no settings for AA, shadows, etc. There very few maps and the game can only go up to 4 players. The lack of map scrolling by holding down one of the mouse buttons is disappointing.\n\nThere is a population cap which is a no for me. The upgrades are quite bland, doesn't really change the units. The railgun upgrade for the mammoth tanks in Tiberium Wars, now that's an upgrade. As for the units, they're just units. They don't have the same amount of character as the units in C&C. Crazy Ivan anyone?\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty nice but the sound quality is kind of crap. The sound quality for the songs I have is way better than the games soundtrack. Don't buy the DLC soundtrack because it only has 10 out of the 31 tracks.\n\nDo not be fooled by those who said this game is like C&C, it's not. If you're going to get this game, wait until the price drops. >>>I'll only recommend this game if you're in it for the story and the soundtrack. But I will be looking forward to the continuation of the story.<<<\n\nBest RTS game? Not even close. Starcraft, Supreme Commander (not including the second one), and Command & Conquer (from Tiberian Dawn to Red Alert 3 Uprising) will remain at the top. Honorable mentions: Warhammer, Universe at War, Empire at War, and Sins of a Solar Empire.\n\nWestwood =/= Petroglyph\n\nWestwood is not back nor will they ever. When will you silly Westwood fanboys realize that? Such a shame that Petroglyph abandoned End of Nations, it had potential before the dreadful change.

Each with their own base building, units and epic unit.\n- A very traditional RTS with a healthy balance between micro and macro. You will need strategy and tactics to be the best.\n- Amazing detail to individual units, both in animation and sound design.\n- A competent single player campaign with pretty CGI cutscenes.\n- An AI that, after lots of tweaking, is fun in Skirmish with lots of dynamic responses.\n- Astounding soundtrack by Frank Klepacki with an in-game jukebox! (The OST DLC now includes all songs as well)\n- THEY JUST RELEASED A FREE EXPANSION-UPDATE! The publisher Greybox have been nothing but amazing with supporting the customers with patches and content.\n\nCons:\n\n- A somewhat unoptimised engine can tax systems on ultra settings.\n- Aforementioned engine means that 4 players is the max limit. Personally I like a minimum of 6 players in my RTS games.\n- Not many people playing anymore so don't expect an active multiplayer community. Grab a friend or three for PVE and PVP.\n- Balance for PVP is an issue.

In Grey Goo much stuff is semi-automated (ressource collection/unit production) though there are differences between races, this gives more time to watch over your units, scouts and what not, plus it plays a little bit slower and the camera is further up. I really like how the game plays and you can still get some serious skills in it (just check the grey goo youtube channel for pro games). The Campaign is allright and I managed to finish all except the last mission on hard and I'm not really a good player, took me around 20 hours. Story is also ok, not a blast but ok. Haven't played multiplayer yet but I shouldn't expect too many opponents from what I've heard, but maybe the community will grow ;). About the three... ahem, four races I can say the same as everyone, Goo is unique(only time I saw something similiar was in "Earth 2150 or 2160"), Human and Beta aren't too different but its ok imo and then there's the Shroud, needs some more testing but definetly feels different from the other races. All in all a very solid game with nice developers (just got a new race yesterday for free!). And then there is the price drop, I think the "high" price of ~45€ was a reason for many people not to buy. 28€ is absolutely fair and you'll definetly get a game worth the money (if not worth more).","February 2","true","37.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Yeah, maybe it can be seen as "similar" to Starcraft, but I enjoyed the slower gameplay and the different storyline.

I love it that the Silence was never defined in this, the mystery made it more impactful, more of a deadly and malicious enemy.

I have to give the game something and I'm not willing to vote it down but neither am I comfortable with the vote up.

The game comes packed with features including Steam workshop support, single & multiplayer modes, ranked/unranked matchmaking, custom game support and player profiles. Grey Goo’s main campaign features high quality cutscenes and a reasonable story arc for each race. So, there’s the Beta who are considered the “balanced” race in terms of offense and defense with their bullet and missile weapons. Their unique features include being able to deploy buildings anywhere on the map without directly tied to the main mother base and walls that can be manned by units. The Humans are the technologically advanced race and are generally more defense oriented. Everything about them is tied into one core base, with any of their buildings requiring power coming directly from said base. Finally, there’s the Goo, the most unique race both in presentation and playstyle. This race of nanorobots is a collective intelligence that use large formless units that can split off to create other types of units. They generally tend to be more aggressive than the other two races as their formless units can do significant damage to enemy units if in close proximity. Some of their strengths are offset but their complete lack of air units. All three have their own unique attributes while sticking largely to the core of Grey Goo’s mechanics.\n\nStrategy Mechanics Conversation\nThe Beta and Human races play out very similarly to each other. Both have a single base they are tied to, build generally the same buildings and have the same type of units. Each builds resource collectors that have harvesters transport resources from the collector back to the harvester. Both races then use these resources to carefully build more resource harvesters, tech buildings or factories. Technology buildings grant access to more advanced units and tech upgrades that can further enhance certain units. However, these tech upgrades are restricted to one change per type of unit. They tend to be helpful in certain situations but are otherwise not going to massively change how you play. When a player has lost all of their production buildings and main base, it’s game over. The Goo race on the other hand is unique though they ultimately have the same types of units and win/loss conditions as well. Instead of constructing buildings, they use Mother Goos to build up their forces. These giant formless masses can attack units, go to resource points and split off other Mother Goos or Proteans. They must stay on resource points as long as possible in order to build up mass which leaves them vulnerable to harassment. Proteans are smaller formless units that have a higher speed than Mothers, enabling them to attack or create light/heavy units depending on which protean they are. which can then be transformed to light or heavy units depending on the player. Once all Mother Goos are destroyed, they lose.\n\nPC Settings, Performance Problems & Audio/Video\nPerformance in Grey Goo is disastrous despite months of patching and promises from the developers that it would be fixed. The entire main menu has severe lag, only managing to get somewhere in the realm of 20-40FPS. Why it’s so poor is unclear but it seems to be an engine issue. Cutscenes also have the same framerate problems and it’s really too bad because they are quite well done. It’s quite irritating to see this too when my CPU is only 45-50% consumed when Grey Goo is running. My GTX 970 should be able to easily handle this title but the framerate counter seems to indicate otherwise. The in-game situation isn’t much better as the framerate will go from a solid 60 to a mere 30-45 when a base is under construction. Turning every graphics option down to minimum helps things but it doesn’t fix the menu framerate lag and games can still bring the framerate down. It’s unclear why Grey Goo continues to suffer performance problems despite months of work but it’s definitely a problem worth considering if you’re interested in the title. It’s certainly frustrating enough for me to now want to play it. I could be much more understanding if the CPU/GPU was near max while playing Grey Goo. But it’s not. I did consult with their tech support over the course of several weeks in order to identify the issue but they didn’t have any suggestions on fixing it. Instead, they insisted that that my computer wasn’t up to the task. A computer that meets or exceeds the minimum required specs stated on the Steam store page.\n\nNarrative Discussion\nDuring the campaign, you’ll be able to experience the three races in the following order. Beta, Human and last but not least, Goo. Each race is given five missions each for a total of 15. All three races have the same gameplay arc. You’re first given a very small army and no access to the race’s tech tree. The next three missions gradually unlock units and upgrades as you go along. The missions getting gradually more difficult as well. The fifth mission is the big event of the campaign, allowing the player to use the race’s Epic unit and all technology available. Overall, the campaign feels short even though it’s about 10 hours long. I’ll admit, I didn’t particularly enjoy the campaign either. Mostly because I did the same things to win mission after mission and the three race buildup starts creating a very samey feeling. It also doesn’t help that it feels like content has been cut from the game.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI think Grey Goo is a reasonable modern take on the C&C formula established so long ago. There’s a decent amount of strategy involved and each race feels uniquely its own and fairly well balanced. Unfortunately, the multiplayer has been falling apart since release and doesn’t seem to be showing signs of returning any time soon. The 20min+ long queues at this point make it even more of an anti-recommendation at this point. The story narrative also has multiple problems and I don’t really think the game is worth getting for it alone. At the very least, it’s questionable value for money, especially the DLC. Credit to the devs though, they have supported Grey Goo pretty well over the past year with multiple balance updates, new features and minor content additions. I think they’re pinning a little too much hope on it becoming a e-sport though. It’s just a pity that the engine problems and the expensive price haven’t been shored up during the course of this year, as I have no doubt that’s what has kept the multiplayer community from growing. Ultimately, while Grey Goo as an RTS is possible to enjoy at times, I have trouble recommending it due to the performance problems, shrinking multiplayer community and multiple story issues.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","December 29, 2015","true","38.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It also features  an incredibly interesting take on faction infrastructure and upgrading technology.\n\nTo start, as of now there are four factions, the Beta, Humans, Goo, and Shroud.  The Beta use 'hubs' to create structures anywhere that they have vision, and can set up forward bases pretty much anywhere with relative ease.  Their units can also mount on wall pillars providing an additional defensive bonus.  The Humans on the other hand have a single massive base built using 'conduits' (think of roads) and can teleport any structure along the conduits for easier defence and more efficient use of the space that they have.  The Goo dont have any structures at all! Instead they have 'goo mothers' that roam around the map and use health as a means of production, splitting off pieces of themselves to create units.  The Shroud are relatively new to the game, and use amplifiers to increase the effectiveness of their buildings.  They also can 'evolve' their buildings for different purposes as the situation dictates.\n\nThe story of GG is pretty well done and has an interesting twist at the end.  Mission Types are pretty diverse and let you understand the fundamentals of the major races before you set fourth in the multiplayer.  Also, the cinematics are GORGEOUS, honestly they beat out blizzard's own department in realism and quality.   Additionally, there is the 'emergence' mini-campeign that tells the story of one of the more significant characters after a certain event had happened.\n\nThe way technology works in GG is actually very novel.  Whenever you meet the requirements for an upgrade you can pick only one tech out of three.  Each upgrade is unique and you never really feel like you are losing when you do an upgrade, which in my mind is a pretty good achievement considering you are spurning other possibilities for the match.\n\nDespite the factional diversity each faction is pretty well balanced, and the team does a good job of putting out balance changes on the regular whenever an issue pops up.  The game had kind of a rocky release as well, but since that point and through the effort of Petroglyph the game keeps getting better and better with each content release and balance update.  The last update featured an ENTIRE FACTION FOR FREE.  That NEVER HAPPENS (at least what I've played) in RTS.  I have nothing but praise for Petroglyph.\n\nHonestly, if you like the "90's style" of RTS then you are doing yourself a disservice by not getting this game.  Personally its one of the best games I've played in a long time, and even with the release of XCOM 2 I can't seem to get away from this game.  It just has a special charm that will keep pulling you back in if you give it a try.\n\nTL:DR, If you like RTS in the "90's style", balanced gameplay (with diverse factions), great cinematics and rediculously committed developers, then buy this game.","March 8","true","67.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

While Universe At War (Petroglyph's last RTS) was innovative and interesting, it suffered from GFWL and the baggage of a controller-based setup scheme (someone somehwere thought peasants should have an RTS). This isn't burdened by any such limitations, and is very obviously a PC game from the ground up.\n\nSo - this is more macro strategy than micro management, and I think it's better for it. Don't for a minute assume there's no build orders, counters or clever tactics to be had here - there are plenty - you just don't need to (in fact, you can't) micromanage your resource collectors etc. for a 5% advantage over the other player.\n\n8/10, 9/10 with rice.","January 25, 2015","true","18.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","10","14","3","0"

Game is not optimized and has huge frame drops. You start with 120+ FPS and drop down to <25FPS in mid game, and below 20FPS in the late game. I have a more then decent machine that easily plays FarCry 4 and other similar games on Ultra. Therefore it is easy to conclude it is not my machine but a poor optimized game that ruins the game experience.\n\nMultiplayer is terrible. Very little players play online. Only very few maps and tons of them are not designed for competitive matches. Next to that, they are copy/pasted from the Single Player campaign. Unit design is flat and boring. There are no cool moves you can do. Epic units look and sound cool, but are a total MP killer. Simply no fun in operating them and/or killing them.\n\nAfter 3 months the game still does not have replays, observer mode or a ladder you can view in your browser. On top of that, disconnecting happens all the time and gives the DCing player no loss or ban. You simply get away with it and they dev's do absolutely nothing about it.\n\nWorst part is the developers though. They hate to communicate clearly and all the say is 'we are working on it'. They don't listen to the community and blatant balance issues lingered around for months and flaws in map design haven't even been touched yet. Each patch brakes another thing and they fail to acknowledge or fix it. Last patch fixed nothing the community wanted. On top of that the game lags even more due to their 'fixes'. The developers act like they know what they do, but they clearly have no clue.\n\nA quote from the Grey Goo game designer on Twitter:\n"I'm done with this game"- the rallying cry of a forum poster that if was truly done would have just quit quietly without a 1000 word essay. - Jeffrey Gamsky\n\nSays enough about the developers doesn't it?\n\nI honestly wanted this game to be a success. Yet the clear lack of honest communication and 'we know it way better then the community' attitude killed this game beyond repair. The game itself is mediocre currently. Might turn decent if they manage to fix the fps/lag issues.\n\nI do not recommend you to buy this this game.

So an "impulse buy".\n\nSo far, the story is great and I've had zero issues with multiplayer. The AI is pretty much a zerg rusher. While some people hate that, like myself, it also forces me to stop using typical tactics and adjust my tactics to counter. I have to plan a bit ahead and watch my resources and the map. You can't just turtle behind walls and wait.\n\nIt is a bit refreshing and aggrivating.\n\nBeta - My favorite race. Fun to play, easy to expand bases(not as easy as the goo) and good units.\n\nHuman - My least favorite race. I do not like their style at all. Some base expansions are almost impossible to do with this race(or I haven't figured out how to do an expansion without the conduit).\n\nGoo - Forget walls if you are playing against these guys. They go up and over anything(the goo form does, the unit form does not.) Do not let them get control of too many resources nodes or you will be dying fast.\n\nIt's great that all three races are so different and require differing tactics. The campaign is a bit brutal, even on easy. So if you are looking for a piece of cake game then don't bother here.\n\nThree stories in one game.

I'm by no means a good RTS player but I do enjoy them and Grey Goo has seriously captured my love at the moment. I have not been able to put as much time into this game as I'd like but the time I've been able to spend with it so far has been a pleasure. The campaign is great with beautiful cutscenes and animated briefing before each mission really sell the world and fight to you. The gameplay and design is simply perfect to me. Easy to understand but difficult to truly master I've found. A great pick up for any RTS fan or someone looking to get into RTS games.","February 14, 2015","true","10.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Its cinematic attributes are pretty stellar, something unseen elsewise outside of C&C full studio acting. (AWESOME)\n\nGood RTSs have ben pretty rare for a long time but (in my opinion...) GG does a real good job upsetting said trend.\n\nAlot of people bash this as being dull and lacking a unique unit set but I have say that's BS. Rarely does any game have super unique structures between units like C&C, AoE, etc, the base structure in any game is going to be tediously similar but GG still has some good unique attributes between its FOUR races.\n\nIt does feel kinda like starcraft 2 but that's just a good thing for SC fans.

It takes many of the best elements from the C&C series and incorporates some progressive new ideas of it's own!\n\n- Single player is incredibly well polished, with great cutscenes, although the story itself leaves something to be desired.\n\n- The QWERTY hotkey-bar setup takes a little while to get used to but is generally much more user friendly than other RTS hotkey configurations like SC and AoE.\n\n- The foliage cover mechanic is a fun twist to traditional cloaking.\n\n- So far balancing between the three factions looks solid, but I haven't played that many multiplayer games yet so we'll have to wait and see if it still feels right after that.\n\n- I enjoy having the resource rate meter on the top right, like Supereme Commander and other games in that vein vs. just a straight up resource count.\n\n- The multiplayer games I've played with my friends so far have been action packed from the get-go. Even with 2 factions having walls, turtling doesn't seem to work as a valid strategy for too long.\n\n- The unit upgrades in the game are more strategic than, "This just makes my units beefier," like SC2 where you pretty much have to get some upgrades without thinking too hard about them.\n\n- The Goo is probably the most unique faction I have EVER played in any RTS game. It will be a lot of fun to master!\n\nMy only major gripe with this game is that the multiplayer scene looks a little scant so far.

Because it's really sublime. Good soundtrack, good gameplay, all the modern conveniences of a modern RTS (which I appreciate).\n\nOrdering your units around just feels smooth. Unlike some other games, Grey Goo just feels uncluttered and simplistic. I love it. The shortcut keys to quick select units and buildings makes one feel like a pianist, and I love that too. I also like that, it seems to me, the tips on the loading screens are actually useful for once. And that's awesome.\n\nThe Grey Goo faction is also pretty neat.\n\nAlso, I can't stop saying Grey Goo for some reason. It's a name that really rolls off the tongue. Bonus points for that.\n\nIn short, it's an RTS. You like RTS? Get this game. If not? Don't bother. I mean, obviously don't bother, you'll never have fun if it's not your thing. But yeah.

On one hand, this is the most traditional RTS Petroglyph has released to date. This definitely makes it seem like Grey Goo has fewer defining qualities than its predecessors: Empire at War and Universe at War. At their repsective glances, Empire at War had its Galactic Conquest structure, and Universe at War had a focus on Faction differentation arguably exceeding the likes of Starcraft (Whether it did so successfully is highly up to debate).\n\nGrey Goo has neither of these defining traits- its structure is completely traditional in both its campaign and skirmish gameplay (It doesn't even have a light version of Galactic Conquest like Universe at War tried to), and its factions are nowhere near as differentiated as Universe at War's were.\n\nNow this level of traditionalism is indeed a selling point for many, since outside of Grey Goo (and a few other isolated games like Starcraft 2, arguably Homeworld Remastered, and some indie titles here and there) there aren't really many RTSes coming out that do this structure anymore. So in theory some people will appreciate Grey Goo for that alone.\n\nBut in brutal honesty, considering just the purely traditional RTS stuffings within Grey Goo- there are plenty of older RTS titles that fare better. Its not that Grey Goo does anything horribly, its traditional elements are solid overall. But everything it does traditionally has been done better and made more interesting by other RTS titles. Whether it be better optimization, better balance, more interesting traditional faction AI, more varied units, or more interesting campaigns, you're definitely better off with older RTS titles in that regard.\n\nBut this isn't really fair to Grey Goo- because that's not considering the few truly unique things it does actually do underneath its traditional surface.\n\nAnd its all because of how much focus Petroglyph clearly put into the Goo's skirmish AI. Being a completely mobile faction, the Goo are able to use elevation to hide their unit-producing mother goos. The Goo AI knows how to do this. and is NOT predictable when doing it, It won't just leave the Mother Goo on the hill for a random amount of time- it will ACTIVELY wait if you have it surrounded. Or the AI will figure out where the gap in your LOS is and try to use it. Or if you get too close to its hill trying to surround it, the AI might just come down and absorb those units. The Goo's AI feels like some of the most dynamic AI we've gotten in an RTS for quite some time. Its certainly not perfect as it will make questionable movement and attack decisions in plenty of situations- but it remains a joy to play against.\n\nIts just a pity that most everything around the Goo AI is lackluster in comparison. Unlike the Goo's AI, the AI for the Beta and Human factions is a complete bore. They don't do anything you haven't seen done better by other traditional RTS AIs.\n\nIt might not be much of a definiing trait to clasp onto- but overall the Goo Skirmish AI alone is arguably worth the price of admission to what would have otherwise been a competent, but rather stale RTS.","March 15, 2015","true","25.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

However, I was extremely disappointed with the poor level design in the game's campaign mode.\n\nThe most fun levels aren't interesting or innovative - they merely allow you to explore your units' and structures' various abilities and tactics. Half of the levels have a time limit of some type for some objective that you have to find and protect (rule of thumb for almost any game in any genre - protection missions SUCK by default and need some serious effort put into them to make them fun for players). For me, half the fun of a campaign level in an RTS is getting access to new units to control and to revise your tactics to incorporate them against an enemy (which might also get new units that you need to counter).\n\nAlso, every single unit in the game feels like cannon fodder, except for the epic units and structures. Every faction feels like the Zerg in this regard, except with much less interesting units. I can see some semblance of a rock-paper-scissors type balance between units, but they all die so quickly that it seems to have a negligible effect on gameplay.\n\nTL;DR: Poor level design, boring units, nostalgia-boner status = killed.

At times the game will blissfully ignore a click or two at a critical juncture - whether this is because its cycling through a unit animation and can you please just wait a minute for me to finish, or whether at other times its just a fug of having to click something twice, overall the control can at times feel a little sloppy and sluggish. For an RTS that wants to turn the clock back this is something of a killer problem - good control feedback is a must for this kind of game.\n\nFrustrating / Unimaginative campaign play. Endless hordes of hordes. Again. And Again. And Again. Whilst the campaign cut scenes are absolutely top notch and the story is interesting, the actual level design is abysmal with the same idea spammed out endlessly. Not to mention a difficulty level that staggers wildly from tricky to insane, and some questionable tactical choices can make some levels a real turn off.\n\nDodgy unit capabilities. The Flying hand of Ruk. Which has to navigate through doors. Because it can't fly over a wall. Or cliff. Or anything. On its own this is a trivial point. But when added to the sloppy control and poor level design just ends up making you want to repeatedly smash your head into a wall.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the tactical genius of the forest cover which hides units within. This is a great idea in theory. In practice against a spamming level design its a chore fest of sniffing units out, wiping them out, only 5 seconds later to have your scouts wiped out and the enemy grief sniping you all over again. Wise tactical decision ? Yes. Enjoyable gameplay ? Hell no.\n\nAll of these problems pretty much sum up the game - love and effort has obviously gone into crafting this, but along the way they have made mistakes, cut a few clunky corners or made some just plain bad decisions which turns the final result into something of a flawed experience.\n\nIf you can see past the flaws then this is a solid old school RTS game.\n\nIf you can't then this game is a frustrating piece of meh - albeit with lovely production values.","February 4, 2015","false","9.6"," 73 of 138 people (53%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","53","73","138","14","5"

It is good, but yet still bad at the same time. It's an okay game, i enjoy playing it. But I feel as if there's something missing or unfinished about it. Maybe its the limited units or there's no powers, etc. like other RTS games, such as Command and Conquer. The cinematics of this game was very beautiful though and what made me play the campaign. It can get boring playing only skirmish, but i can see having friends that own this too, it would be good for something like a LAN. With the right updates or DLC this could be my new RTS to play.\n\nPro's:\n- Great soundtrack and cinematics\n- Pretty decent balanced on each faction\n- Map and sizes aren't too small or too big\n- Each factions has an Epic unit (similar to C&C3: Kane's Wrath)\n\nCon's:\n- Feels limited on units and upgrades\n- No factions powers\n\nIf you enjoy RTS games, this is a definite buy for your library!","January 3","true","9.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes. On one condition: when it is on sale.\n\nWhy the condition? Well I'll get to that...\n\nThe good:\n- The title faction, the Grey Goo, is the most interesting faction I've played for years in an RTS. The unit designs are simple but appealing and the faction's overall design philosophy is as far as I know unique. It has several units that are truly distinct, there are no counterparts in the other faction's armies.\n- The presentation in this game is lovely. The Goo, as mentioned above, are stellar standouts but the rest is still very competant.\n- The cutscenes are beautiful. I really wasn't expecting them. Iirc there is a cutscene in between every mission, all of them quality CG (as opposed to in-engine) ((Not that there is anything wrong with in-engine, but this is damn good CG work))\n- Music is pretty competant, I believe Frank Klepacki (of C&C fame, among others) is involved. Nothing as stand out as Hell March but there are a few tracks that caught in my mind.\n\nThe grey:\n- The game does not have a long campaign. There are 3 factions, 15 missions overall meaning 5 missions apiece. You'll play your first 5 missions as the Beta, an unremarkable faction whose only saving grace is awesome accents. The second 5 as the Humans who use drones built by Apple. The third 5 as the Goo, who are awesome. Your mileage may vary depending on your buying price, interest and patience. I'll get back to this one...\n- Most units from all factions fall into specific roles with little deviation. For the most part each faction will have 3 light units and 3 heavy units. 2 factions also have 3 aircraft, scouts, fighters and bombers. The Goo outshines the other factions here because of it's different approach but still has the light/heavy formula weighing it down somewhat.\n- Some of the unit designs are so generic as to be boring to look at and boring to use.\n- I'm not particularly versed in balancing, I don't know all of what goes into balancing decisions. Bearing that in mind, I found one or two of the Goo's units underpowered. Actually all of their heavy units, as cool as they are, seemed to be flawed. The heavy tank seemed fragile and the artillery seemed weak even in massed groups.\n\nThe bad:\n- The Goo has a unique unit with no attack whose sole purposes are to block line of sight and taunt enemies. It's a great concept. The trouble is they are slow and when moving a mass of units they are not always in the front line when needed and unit pathing/collision would not allow them to move. Good, predictive micro helps this somewhat.\n- Let me phrase that last point another way, units of the faction whose army is made up of puddles of nanobots grouped in certain formations cannot move past each other. Conceptually they should be able to flow around each other. Gameplay wise, there is an upgrade to let the above unit start a rampage when critically damaged. A far better upgrade would be to have them charge enemy units. A missed opportunity.\n- The AI is not the best. This works both for and against you. Enemy units will sometimes not retaliate to your attacks. Your units will not retaliate while a nearby enemy attacks them. This is unrelated to the gameplay of stealth units and units in bushes.\n- Unique to the Goo, every once in a while you will find your Mother Goos (the mobile HQ/factory/so much more of the faction) randomly moving. You will not have told them to do so, will not have had them even selected. But they will move. And you will curse.\n\nNow the crux of the matter, why the condition? If you've looked this far, you know why you want to play 'Grey Goo'. You want to play the Grey Goo. The other factions aren't anything remarkable. You've seen the Goo and thought you'd like to get your hands on them. You're also probably not new to RTS games, you know that you only get the good stuff, the 'cool faction' at the end. You're right: the Goo is the third campaign. You're going to have to sit through 2/3rds of the game to get to the part you actually want to play. The positive is that each faction has only 5 missions so it won't take that long to reach the 'Good' bit. The conditional 'Yes' recommendation hinges on the fact that on sale, this isn't too big of a pill to swallow. But at full price? You're paying £30 or the equivalent in the knowledge that £20 is a chore you have to get over to get to the fun.\n\nNow this is all subjective, my opinion only. I didn't even mind playing as the Humans as much as I thought I would. The Beta are terrible in their blandness though. But I can only think back to my thought process as I played through: 'Get this first bit over and done with and then the fun starts'.","January 3","true","11.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Other reviews have already covered the main ones - similar factions, lack of unit abilities, odd and univesting story, balance issues here and there. With the price drop, however and with the deal you get out of the Definitive Edition, it is actually quite worth it. It is far from bad, but it was nowhere near the price asked - the drop was already enough to justify a recommendation.\n\nHowever, another bit of good news to consider is the Shroud, the fourth faction. In short, they are an example of Petroglyph finally realizing the issues their game has. Having a fourth faction already fixes a significant amount of issues with the game, having two rather similar non-Goo factions for one. However, they are also clearly different without being... weird like the Goo. They are, gasp, a decent RTS faction, which it seemed Petroglyph had forgotten how to make.\n\nThat you get them with the Definitive Edition is already good, but another point in Petro's favor is that previous owner get it for free. For a game that underperformed as this one did, it's reassuring to see bold decisions such as this massive price drop and non-half-♥♥♥♥♥ DLC. Sure, it's because they're desperate, but they didn't give up, and they went on to make it far more consumer-friendly.\n\nAs for the other elements of the DE - Emergence is not an improvement on the shrug-inducing original campaign, actually, it's worse. The OST is now fully worth it (Frank Klepacki, if not at his most metal)  because they fixed it because they somehow broke the OST for close to a year. The Shroud is the best thing to happen with the game so far, it really elevated my own opinion on the game. You do as you will, but the new price makes it worth it for any RTS enthusiast.","February 8","true","40.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/transcendency/recommended/290790/","transcendency","Zen-Zinxe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/transcendency/","68 products in account","Grey Goo is basically an older style macro-focused RTS. If you're used to playing APM-fests like starcraft 2, this will feel slow to you.\n\nGrey Goo is pretty nice though. I have played and enjoyed many different types of RTS games, but I always wanted to see a newer game in the vein of Tiberian Sun, and this game reminds me a lot of Tiberian Sun. The graphics are really nice, in-game the 3 different faction units all are tied together thematically. Humans having a smooth plastic-like design with lasers and energy weapons, the Beta more industrial and metallic with cannons and machine guns. The goo is pretty much what you would expect, all their units resemble different shapes of shimmering metallic liquid.\n\nThe human and beta races play fairly similarly, the goo however plays entirely different as there are no goo buildings, everything the goo can make is a movable unit.\n\nThere are essentially no mico-abilities on units, so the micro in this game is limited to positioning and targeting.\n\nI would say this game is very close to being a perfect successor to the westwood RTS games, if anything the game feels like a cross between tiberian sun and starcraft. Base building isn't as good as it was in tiberian sun, but it's far more interesting than in starcraft 2.\n\nGrey Goo also happens to be on a short list of RTS games that have had a really cool single player story. The animated cutscenes in this game are top notch.\n\nAs much as I like Grey Goo, it really doesn't add anything new to the RTS genre other than a cool concept and story. In terms of gameplay it's less demanding than starcraft 2, but not as full of content as tiberian sun. As well made as it is, it will likely not blow you away, but it is certainly a fun game.","October 17, 2015","true","59.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

All 3 races core base mechanics are more unique than any game I've seen (even more than Starcraft, but it's close).  At the same time, it seems like the humans base is at a distinct dissadvantage without being able to expand and having power deficiency weeknesses.  However, they do have ways around this (such as steath miners and ability to mine any distance from their base).  I think they need a more durrable power grid (called conduit crosses), and the ability to expand, even if the expansions can't be as complete.  You can mitigate this shortcoming with redundancy in your grid lines, which I feel is great... but they just seem a little vulnerable still.  This is without enough play for you to put too much stock in, but it's my first impressions.  A lot of the unblalanced things in the game that feel to weak initially, are actually stronger than they seem once you figure out how they really work.  The single player campaign is short, sweet, and too the point, teaching you the game in the perfect number of missions quickly, but not overwhelmingly.  I really hope they keep expanding on this series with finer polish (and a little lighter on the system requirements).  But if you give it a try, beware that your initial impressions may betray you because of the unconventional mechanics which are rewarding with a small invenstment (of just about 3-4 games) in learning them.","October 18, 2015","true","11.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The base-building and unit-building might have been a bit more expansive with more units and buildings to select from, but otherwise I liked what the game had on offer gameplay-wise.\n\nApart from the raw gameplay, I think the reason why I'm writing this at all is because I love the game's story, atmosphere, graphics and soundtrack so much. I admit, I'm not the most competitive RTS fan, but I can't get enough of listening to Frank Klepacki's (He's a big name when it comes to game composers, I believe) soundtrack for this game and contemplating the game's different factions and characters.\n\nI have probably spent 3-4x more time in listening to the soundtrack and thinking of the game world than I have playing the actual game. The humans in Grey Goo are so interesting with how, in Ecosystem 09 at least, the humans are small in numbers and one single human settlement is both managed and developed by a single human scientist.\nThe graphics in Grey Goo are spectacular and head over heels above the graphics of the other RTS games I've played.\n\nIn all honesty I'd like the idea of having the creative design in Grey Goo combined with a more "sandboxable" experience such as a city builder or a turn-based tactics game.

I'd tried a few other sci-fi RTS games in the past and none of them held my attention for long... boy was I in for a surprise!\n\nGrey Goo is one of the most creative and beautifully animated games I've played in a long time! The cutscenes and pre-mission briefings almost look real when I'm watching them, the audio is damn near perfect, and the gameplay is fast enough to keep up a good pace, but also encourages thoughtful preparation and decision making.\n\nSo, lets go down the list of races first, as is always important with an RTS game:\n\nThe Beta: A race of four armed humanoid aliens who have been on the run from something they refer to as "The Silent Ones" for generations. They're a sort of warrior race by necessity, having to constantly worry about their adversaries catching up to them as they're the last of their species. All three races get an 'Epic' unit, one that can be built by combining several buildings and spending a lot of resources. Their epic unit is the Hand of Aruk, a mobile weapons platform with a cannon that launches missles for massive explosive damage. Its slow and the cannon takes a while to recharge, but all around the cannon are little slots where you can have your other units ride ontop of the platform to add firepower to it. Outfit it with a few tanks and you've got a holy terror for your enemies to deal with.\n\nThe Humans: Oddly enough WE'RE the super-advanced race this time around! Humanity went the Star Trek route in Grey Goo, becoming a spacefaring colonization race. As war has been rendered unnecessary for centuries all the human units are rather weak drone-robots that were mostly used to deal with aggressive wildlife on various planets. Infact, the leader of this expedition is one of the only two actual humans in the game! The other two units are a humanoid robot and a relic from the last war humanity ever had and MUM, their main computer. The Human's epic unit is Alpha and, well, this is also probably a relic from said war. Lemme put it this way: remember Power Rangers? Well you get your own space-age megazord!\n\nThe Goo: This is the game's namesake and while it sounds silly its actually one of the most creative things I've seen in a while. The goo is a giant amoeba-like mass of nanomachines that can split itself off into smaller units which then morph into the more traditional units. While in amoeba form it can climb up walls and literally EAT buildings and enemy units, consuming them to heal itself and give you resources to make more units! At time of writing I haven't gotten to their epic unit yet, but I'm definitely intrigued to see how this all ends.\n\nThere's one more species, but it's in the DLC expansion and I haven't played it yet. Its called the Shroud and is apparently the "Silent Ones" that were hunting the Beta.\n\nAs for the game overall:\n\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Some of the most creative species concepts I've seen since I first played the original Starcraft.\n- Gorgeous animation, I can't believe this is an indie game!\n- Gameplay that encourages a thoughtful approach to enemies rather than the ol' standby of the 'zerg rush'.\n\nWhat I'm meh about:\n- The controls can be a bit awkward at first since all the units that you can build are tied to the keyboard in the menu, making it easy to select something by mistake.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- A couple of the missions can be pretty frustrating. I had to repeat one of the human ones several times when you're trying to find a downed spaceship and if the opponent finds it first it gets blown to bits within a few seconds, causing the mission to fail.\n\n\nOverall: With Blizz winding down Starcraft this is a definite way to scratch the RTS itch. I wholeheartedly recommend buying this game!","March 11","true","9.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

When this game came out, it had several important technical issues, poor marketing and a quite big pricetag, as well as some unbalance. Most of the negative reviews come from those days. Luckly, the devs have been working very hard to fix all of that, and wow they did: technical issues fixed, pricetag reduced to normal levels permanently, free DLCs, and a 4th race also for free. Not to mention the huge dedication the devs are pouring on the community as well, by answering the forums regularly and organizing tournaments.\n\nTo put it simply: when you check other reviews about Grey Goo, pay attention to the date of those reviews. In its current state, it is more than worth every cent.\n\nI prefer to start by the negative points, so let's go for them:\n\n- Because of its bad start, it has a limited playerbase. Everyone could guess the current efforts to improve the game are aimed to bring more players to it, and I can understand that, given the huge amount of work dedicated to it. I guess it will need some time to grow a good playerbase, but so far it has been growing. If everything else about this game appeals to you, then by all means buy it, so that the community will grow.\n\n- Campaign is short for a classic RTS. It is well done, but players that go after lenghty SP experienced would prefer something more. It is played with the 3 original factions, looking at the conflict from their respective points of view, and aimed to learn to use each faction. That said, the conflict in the story is relatively small-sized, so it kind of makes sense to have a short campaign.\n\nThose are the bad points. Now to the good stuff!\n\n- It just feels fresh, yet like a good ol' RTS. While some will see some inspiration taken from big hits like Starcraft, the whole story and its factions are very original. The whole makes a very interesting sci-fi universe.\n\n- Gameplay feels comfortable and varied. Each faction plays utterly different from the others, especially at the base-building and unit-managing levels. Humans are the high tech ones (for once!) and focus on small, dense bases with powerful defenses and teleportation. Beta feel more traditional, and know how to garrison properly. The Goo is very mobile (they don't even have buildings, only formless masses of nanobots that spawn the actual units), and can adapt very fast. The Shroud is deceptive and its units complement each other well (even their buildings can support each other).\nIn addition, there is a wide variety of units for each faction, divided on ground and air units, each adapted to a role. There also are epic units, which are as devastating and cool as they sound.\n\n- Art design is gorgeous, both in visuals and audio, both in quotes, FX and soundtrack (which btw is a free DLC).  One of my biggest dislikes of Starcraft 2 is that its art style looks too cartoonish and limited after all those cool cutscenes. Grey Goo knows how to provide some cool models.\n\n- Steam Workshop! Used for designing maps. There has been at least one map contest, with nice prices for the winners.\n\nThe following points are very nice in my opinion, but I understand other players might not like them, so I have them separated from the previous ones.\n\n- Gameplay is not micro-intensive, like SC2. You don't need to have lightning-fast reflexes and muscle memory to use abilities. There are no active abilities in Grey Goo. Units can be upgraded with passive abilities, which alleviates the stress on the player. For example: from the Goo, have your artillery shots heal your nearby troops.\nAbout those upgrades: you can't have them all. Each faction has 5 upgrade categories, 3 upgrades on each. You can only have 1 from each category. In my opinion, this is a great way to encourage players to develop their own strategies.\n\n- The game is designed with competitive play in mind. There are ranked matches aside from custom ones. By unlocking certain achievements (not the Steam ones), you unlock player avatars from the game's units and places, with a cool lore description for each.\n\nTo sum up, it's a great RTS game that while it certainly had a bad start, it has improved a lot in all senses, and has a lot to enjoy, If you are looking for a RTS game that is not a copy of SC2 and feels like an oldschool RTS, this game is for you.","April 4","true","24.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Like most RTS the game offers three races to control and achieve victory with domination from one. The game is quite easy to learn but hard to master. Macro elements present in starcraft have very little meaning in GreyGoo which forces the user to rely more on strategy and resource management.\n\nOverall this is a game really worth having. It deserves big praise for not only making RTS approachable for new players, the game mechanics for a new playable race "Goo" is truely worth looking into.\n\n85/100","January 25, 2015","true","12.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

First, there are the humans who have an interesting way of base building where you are tied into building power grids to extend your base. It's an interesting take on base building while the other base building race, the Beta are set up like Halo Wars take on base building, you only have four points to build on from your HQ. After that you have to call in extra hubs to start new bases. There walls can also be mounted by various units for added defense! Next comes the 'revolutionary' Goo race that has no base building to speak of at all. As mentioned the Goo have no buildings at all, instead they have Goo Mothers which are essentially mobile HQ units that spit out goo units while they also have the ability to consume any hapless enemy units that get to close! Got the basics of what's going on here? Good.\n\nNow this game is supposed to lure you in with the tantalizing idea of facing this Goo enemy that eats units and can cross over any terrain for the most part. Sounds exciting right? Well, not quite. I'll get to that later, first the good!\n\nPros\n-High level of detail in maps\n-Professional looking cinematics\n-Good Voice acting (Always adds a nice touch in any game! Mostly. Eh)\n-Sharp looking units\n-Soundtrack (Very inspiring)\n-The goo!\n\nCons\n-Bad AI pathing\n-Bad campaign AI\n-Invisible walls\n-The goo!(Who would of thought?)\n-Campaign leaves you on a cliffhanger(Alright so its not a real con, *shrug*)\n\nThe campaing is something to be lauded, at first anyhow. The campaign consists of 15 missions in all, and interestingly enough you get to play as every race during the campaign! The first five missions you play as the Beta, the mid part of the game finds you playing as the Humans, and for the final five missions you are the insidious, ravenous Goo!(Ahhhhhhh!).\n\nThe Beta missions are fun and are a nice introduction to the game mechanics, the game shines in these early missions as you plod through lush rainforests in defense of your home planet from these mysterious invaders in shiny vehicles. (Hint: They are not the Goo). The game runs fine until you run into Goo, the goo do change the gameplay and that's interesting. Truly it is. But it turned out to be a bit of a let down in all honesty. (Heres looking at you 'The Trench' and 'Crash site') I expected the goo to come in waves, to come tearing into my base and just start munching everything. It didn't to my dissapointment. As it turns out the Goo is very much like the other races in terms of units. One thing I noticed, especially on the Crash Site is how annoying it is to hunt down the Goo for good cause you always seem to miss one of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Goo mothers somehow, and then you have to chase that one across the map, it's not really a challenge, it's a test of patience really. I had some fear for the rest of the campaign missions that this would be a recurring theme.\n\nMission: Crash site tips!\n-If you initial base is shot to hell, rush to build a repair pad, when you get the second Hand of Ruk bring it to your base and begin a fun process. Have one of your hands of ruk hunting goo mothers whilet the other gaurds your base and heals from the repair pad. RInse and repeat.\n-Drop refineries on any resource veins you uncover! You can actually wall off half the map and man the walls, thus funneling the goo out into the open where it is easily defeated. Unorthodox? Maybe, but it works!\n\nFrom the Beta campaign the game throws you into the Human side of the conflict where you and your robot allies seek to protect yourselves on two front's as the war heats up. The human's way of base building where you are tied into this sort of expanding grid system is a bit weird. Worse, if the grid is destroyed any buildings tied into it at that particular spot and beyond it go dead. I enjoy how you can spam artillery and turrets and basically turn the game into a tower defense game in most missions.\n\nThe human missions are also where you run into some annoying and or game breaking moments. Theres a campaign mission called 'The Observatory' that finds you facing down three Beta commanders at once in what promises to be an epic battle where you face overwhelming odds to save one of your only other human friends who survived the crash. I discovered something that kinda made the whole mission a cake walk.......\n\nMission: The Observatory tips!\n-Build your defenses up at the elft entrance to your base, put up walls, spam turrets and artillery.\n-Rush for invisibility tech for 'Dagger' units.\n-Spam Dagger units while building up right side of base with plenty of artillery and anti air.\n-Send Daggers to every enemy base.\n-WIn.\n-(Sigh in dissapointment of how easy it was)\n\nTheres a theme here with invisible units, I promise. For some reason the AI cannot or refuses to build detector units in this mission. I won by blasting each base to bits with twenty something invisible daggers as the AI units stood there and let themselves get shot up. I Blew up the air base the same way. I then rushed the last base and blew it up too....using invisible Daggers.\nNote: This was on hard difficulty too.\n\nThe next mission that manages to be a bother is 'The Terminal'. You and an AI commander from the Beta team up to take down the Goo! Yeah! Kick ♥♥♥! It actually turns into a pseudo tower defense game sprinkled with 'Defend your useless Ally as the Goo munches everything'.\n\nTrue story ahead here folks, my Ally in this mission came under attack by the Goo and even though I helped them fend off the Goo attack my Ally AI never built another unit for the rest of the game. Even though they still had refineries and factories\n...\n...\nThe goo in this particular mission sends out it's epic unit, 'The purger' or as I like to call the 'deer in headlights'. The Goos purger ended up finding my allies base and started attacking it, I thought the mission was over since the Purger could wipe out his base as the hapless units he did have showed no sign of moving to engage this new threat. Luckily for us both the Purger stayed right beneath his base beside the cliff top and only attacked his outlying buildings. The purger actually destroyed his outlier buildings and then instead of pushing fowards it stayed right where it was and didn't move. Taking advantage of this stupified Purger, I preceded to bomb it to smitherenes with impunity. The purger never moved a muscle as I bombed it to death.\n...\nOn the flipside you do get to build the Human's epic unit! It is as glorious as it is shown in the cinematic trailer if your wondering. Another interesting thing that happened is that the Goo's units got stuck in corners and on cliffs and even units out in the open suddenly stopped moving and stayed still for the rest of the game. Perhaps they knew I was coming for them eh? A scared Goo enemy is a dead Goo enemy, or a sign of something wrong with the AI.... For the rest of that mission I preceded to chase goo around the map and eventually ended up hitting my unit cap as I patrolled every resource point and cornered the Goo. After bombing it to death the day was one! But was I having fun? Eh.... GreyGoo promised epic battles with this new mysterous race called the GreyGoo, it was going to be terrifying, insidious, and oddly enough not very grey,(More blackish??? Further data needed.) But instead I found myself dissapointed by the Goo and only kept playing the Campaign to see how the epic struggle between the three races would end.\n\nI'm not going to talk about the Goo campaing much because that's where the game falls apart.\nTwo words: Invisible walls. Take a look at my pics of the game if you don't believe me folks. You can beat all the hard missions with invisible walls of Radiants. You can beat the last mission by rushing from the start... GreyGoo, a revolution unrealized.  :(","January 25, 2015","false","27.9"," 211 of 408 people (52%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","52","211","408","65","23"

That heritage shows clearly in the game. Since the last years only brought us MOBAs and Starcraft-type clicking frenzy games, Grey Goo returns to the roots: No unit skills, no tedious micro-tasks and a focus on strategy.\n\n\nPlayable Factions\n\nThe Humans\nWith technology evolved to an almost magic-like level, the Neo-Humans have created a society without war or woe by delegating most tasks to AI entities. After abandoning their quest to find other intelligent life, they are called to Ecosystem 09 by a mysterious signal to find themselves confronted with the need to wage war against two unexpected opponents.\nPlaying the Humans gives the player one central powersource, to which each building has to be connected and the ability to build strong defenses and harvest resources from every point of the battlefield.\n\nThe Beta\nAfter barely escaping extinction by a force they call "the silent ones", the remaining members of the Morra (called Beta by the Neo-Humans) find refuge on the Planet of Ecosystem 09. Within a generation they colonize the planet and harness it´s rich resources to prepare thier way back to the stars. Using kinetic and explosive weaponry, they find themselves attacked by unknown hostiles, which are diffrent from those they fled from.\nPlaying the Beta one builds hubs anywhere on the map to power buildings and share technology among them. So, the Beta can build outposts everywhere and fortify every chosen position to harvest it´s resources.\n\nThe Goo\nOriginally created by the Humans to cartograph the galaxy using the so-called "keyholes", the Von-Neumann-Probes were abandoned by their creators, when they canceled their efforts to find intelligent life. Made to adapt to changing circumstances, these nanomachines evolved into the Goo, an all-devouring army traveling via the keyholes from world to world, devouring everything on the way back to earth.\nTruly innovative for the genre, the Goo has no base but formless nano-blobs that move over terrain and produce new units by consuming resources, growing and splitting off smaller parts, which are turned into combat units. The formless Goo can traverse mountains and most impassible terrain and consumes enemy ground units and structures it comes in contact with.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nSingleplayer\nThe singleplayer campaign is compelling and offers the player a well-made narrative told in high quality cutscenes and missions with changing types of objectives. From the classical "annihilate the enemy" to "escort the civilians to safety" the classics are covered. There are six missions for each faction. Every mission has bonus objectives of varying type of difficulty. The character design is nuanced and interesting, since the Beta have much more in common with the ancient humans (us) than the Neo-Humans do.\n\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe Multiplayer-part is one strong side of the game. It has dedicated servers and is comparably well balanced, especially considering the existence of the Goo as playable faction. I found the macro-focused gameplay of GreyGoo the very anti-thesis to the current and announced Starcraft II. APM is not as important as having a good strategy and reacting well to your opponents decisions.\n\nGraphics\nNice, polished models and effects and design by WETA. Really pretty for an RTS. The big explosion effects are missing, except for the game-ending epic units, which are, following their nametag really really epic.\n\nPerformance\nWorks fine with my machine. Heard of people with older rigs having slight problems.\n\n\nNotable special features\n\nLanguage\nPetroglyph Games hired the very person that created the language of the Na´vi from the movie Avatar to create a language for the Morra (Beta)! It is used and subtitled in the campaign cutscenes and maybe there will be the possibility to actually learn to speak it.\n\nMusic\nMade by Frank Klepacki, the lead composer of the great Soundtracks of Command and Conquer, Dune and many more has created three soundtracks: Clean synthesizer music for the Humans, heavy Industrial for the Beta and classical music mixed with dubstep for the Goo!\n\nMotion Capture\nThe facial animations of the characters in the cutscenes have an unusual high quality as seen in barely any game before.\n\nEditor\nThey included the very Editor they used for the campaign design into the game! It´s industry-level, has lots of features and is getting patched and expanded.\n\nAdvanced AI\nThe AI of the game does not cheat. It scouts you, adapts to your strategies and has no economic advantage. AI personalities and AI difficulty can be randomized.\n\n\nProblems\n\nSmall playerbase\nThe playerbase is relatively small because the marketing left to be desired. One can basically always find someone to play against, since there is a steamgroup for Grey Goo, but the long lists of custom games one would wish for are not reality.\n\n2-4 players\nThe game only supports up to 4 players in multiplayer at the moment.\n\nOnly 9 maps\nThe map pool is tiny in comparison. Map contests and upgrades will likely follow.\n\nBalance issues\nThere are some imbalances, that need work. If and how the devs will react to those, is yet to be seen, since the game has just been released recently.\n\nNo destructible environment\nIt´s not important but I´d like to see the Goo eat trees it moves through! It´s kinda strange to see military structures crumble and get consumed while the fauna gets spared. There is also wildlife missing and structure and unit models do not show sustained damage properly.\n\nNo observer or replay function\nThese are not ingame. The developer announced to be working on them since some time and promised to add them soon.\n\nAI issues\nNonresponsive units just standing around somewhere or abusable pathing flaws plague the AI. Additionally, RTS-experienced players will have no problem defeating it.\n\n\nSummary\nThis is the very game, Command and Conquer fans have been waiting for over the last years! I am confident that they will work on the small flaws of this well polished product and that more is to come!\n9,5/10","February 3, 2015","true","258.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arontimes/recommended/290790/","arontimes","Aron Times","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arontimes/","54 products in account","ProsThree very asymmetrical and balanced factions. For a game that's been out less than two weeks, there is no single dominant strategy or faction in multiplayer.\nSimplified and streamlined base-building and unit production (macro) allows for more focus on the fun parts of RTS, namely, strategy and tactics (micro).\nSlow movement speed and extremely powerful artillery heavily discourages deathballs, and encourages you to spread your forces around the map. I personally maintain three armies of mixed unit types on the map at any given time.\nShort but challenging singleplayer campaign (5 missions per faction for a total of 15 missions). You gain access to your entire arsenal very quickly, and the difficulty ramps up so quickly that many players have been stuck even on Easy Mode.\nVisually spectacular and well-acted CGI cutscenes between missions.\nMap editor with Steam Workshop integration.\nLAN multiplayer and offline play. None of this always online nonsense with other modern games.\nConsErratic optimization issues. The game runs sluggishly on some systems way over the recommended system requirements, but runs well on some older systems. Devs are working on this issue.\nUnintentional region locking. Devs have confirmed that Steam accidentally region locked the game, and they're working on a fix.\nAircraft AI is terrible. First, they deal massive overkill when on attack-move command, and they automatically return to the battlefield if they're order to attack or attack-move. This is contrary to established C&C aircraft behavior, and makes it difficult to keep track of them and to keep them alive. A lesser issue is that aircraft don't have a separate rally point or head to the nearest airpad when they're built, increasing the difficulty in keeping track of them.\nIt's expensive! $50 (USD) is a lot to ask for, and will greatly limit this game's playerbase until this game goes on sale or the price is permanently lowered. I'd like to say that it's worth the price, but I actually got this from a key reseller for only $35 (USD).\nNo replays and no observer mode.

Awesome soundtrack.\n\n\nCons: Holy balance batman! Limited amount of players in general, you tend to queue against the top 40 players int he world any day of the week. The maps are very awkward, as some are very imbalanced toward a certain race or another due to catalyst placement(basic resource). Strategy is lost when each races tier 1 units are basically the best unit due to the ability to mass them in small tight knit groups that have one or two counters that are lackluster when you cant get in range.\nIE: Drovers usually deal with Stalkers well, but if you have 40 stalkers, the drovers cant even get into range to start aoeing down the striders, basically body blocking. Pathing is wierd, hitboxes are weird when trying to move units around, they just slide about like they are all in a hockey rink.\n\nBasic armor needs to be looked at.  Walls from both beta and human need to be looked at, as 1000 hp is really silly considering the low cost and its no-effort utility.\n\nThere is a very limited variety of units on each race, and even less upgrades, you basically get 5 total for your entire race. And once you upgrade one you cannot upgrade two others. At all.\n\nGoo is very strong at early harassment as long as they are not harassed themselves.\nPro games where the goo player gets found before the minute mark almost always end in the goo players defeat, since they rely so much on their production/main unit the Mother Goo. She clocks in at an amazing 6 feet/hour.\n\nHumans are locked into this ugly power conduit design that honestly is just terrible. I'm not sure how much cocaine was consumed during the development to think that anyone would enjoy never expanding and dealing with insanely small amounts of space to even build in. This is even WORSE on certain maps that have very tiny starting placements.\n\nBasically the only race that feels even close to fun to play is Beta, at least they can expand and actually maintain map control rather than watching your units slowly travel across the entire map because thats where your factories are stuck.\n\nThis will never grow, and probably never see any esport coverage. Funny enough since there is a tiny little playerbase, I was able to play most of the top 10 players(and getting owned by them) from the day I got the game.\n\nI enjoyed it while it lasted, but seeing no new players and the complete silence from the devs make this game a dead end. I shouldn't of listened to the circlejerk and passed this one by. Sadly, since I gave it a chance I'm out of the time period for a refund.  6/10.","June 17, 2015","false","36.7"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

However the campaign missions so far have been a practice in annoyance. I will recommend this on the skirmish mode alone, but the computer AI needs some tweeks to make the missions less...frustrating. I bought the game on TB's comment that it is a base defender type game and great for gamers that are not click ninjas or over caffienated teenagers. The game seems to switch between micromanagement armageddon (third campaign mission, with added shaking screen and repair mini game!) and slow buildup of forces only to have them wiped out by one unit. It is very rock paper scissors.\n\nThe humans are also incredibly gimped by their need to connect each building to the main hub with "conduits" that have the armor and health of a child in cardboard armor.

Grey Goo is an awesome RTS!!!\n\nThere is something about great RTS battles that you take with you for life, and GreyGoo is a new proving ground for those experiences to flourish. It offers both a rich cinematic-laden experience for the single player campaign, as well as a challenging and competitive multi-player experience (check out the GreyGoo Twitch streams).\n\nEver since I first played the original Warcraft I have been an RTS fan. I'll never forget being at my friend's house for a sleepover where we linked two computers with a serial cable and played a Humans vs. Orks deathmatch. We'd let our peons and peasants hack at trees all night and wake up to spend all our vast resources of gold and lumber for an epic battle. Fast forward to now and we have GreyGoo, a fresh RTS experience that brings back to the forefront all the things I remember loving about RTS games in the past, while also distinguishing itself in a modern way amidst the other giants in the genre.\n\nIn short, GreyGoo has a great story, AWESOME cinematics/graphics, unique races, and gameplay. It's definitely worth it for any RTS fan, and the money you pay is saving you the torture of the Free-To-Play ad ridden, pay-to-win, pay-to-not-loose-years-of-your-life model of games!\n\nSo whether you are a long time fan of the genre, or are new to it, goo get this for your RTS collection!","February 9, 2015","true","515.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I didn't find much replay value in the game - but I also play RTS games mostly for the campaigns, not the multiplayer, so my opinion doesn't represent the typical player.\n\nOverall, it's definitely a good RTS.

I beat it on hard difficulty with all possible achievments (even saved all humans) and I am not korean.

It looks very appealing. The CG during campaign is very well done. Also, the AI won't instantly zerg rush you like some of the modern games available now. That to me is a cheesy way to appeal to "hardcore" gamers while making the game inaccessible to casual gamers. It will send armys to keep you on your toes, but in my time with this game it didn't feel cheap (Age of Wonders for reference). I like time to set things up before getting into the fray, so for me this was very pleasing.\n\nThe negatives are probably the limited options available. The units feel pretty generic. The tech boosts don't convey a sense of elevated ability. It can take what feels like fifteen minutes to dispatch a enemy base with a full population cap army. This might appeal to some multiplayer gamers. But it just doesn't feel like you are a group of bad dudes roughing up the opponent with your high tech gear. It feels like you are shooting bottle rockets at a brick wall. Also, just for future game companies of the genre who might read this: spice it up. Unit variation is good. Powered up tech is good. Wouldn't it be cool if the enemy base was hiding a nuclear bomb or something and your army was unaware and upon catastrophic fail your attacking army was blown up in a huge explosion? Or how about if damage was registered more realistically, with pieces falling off or parts exploding in a shower of molten metal? That would be so awesome and increase the playability. You see it in other games. Just feels no one really innovates anymore in these games. As a fan, it leads to a stale kind of feeling. Nothing breaks you out of the feeling of gaming more than sitting for 15 minutes while you hear "pew pew" and see the same flashes and explosions.\n\nThis is a good Command and Conquer style game. If you like that, you will probably like this. It is a bit generic, but it is well done generic. I got it on sale for twenty bucks. I would say it is worth that for sure. Just don't expect ground breaking stuff.","October 18, 2015","true","3.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

All the classes are awesome to play with.\n\nBad:\n- The Goo class feels like it's lacking some good units, I wouldn't mind them having flying units.\n- campaign does feel a bit short, makes up with the multiplayer atleast. There is also the DLC, but they could have just added it (corporate commander crap).\n- Mission do feel a bit repetative, stuff like the goo being able to cross mountains could have been focused on more. I could easily win a match by just building a large army or an epic unit. There wasn't any challenging (strategic thinking) matches. Except for the first Goo mission though\n\nOverall a good game, regardless of it's bad points.

I'm a big fan of Red Alert 2, Universe at War and many other Westwood and Petroglyph games and this definitely has the same impact and satisfying gamplay.\n\nNice graphics, good music, good sound effects and it just generally feels good to play. I found myself cranking up the music volume which is always a good sign in a Westwood/Petroglyph title! Thanks, Frank Klepacki!\n\nMissions feel good so far and I tried some skirmishes too which were fun (even if I'm not very good yet!!).\n\nUnit voices are present and correct and sound good.\n\nSo far my only real complaint is that the base-building with the Human and particularly Beta faction feels very clunky and strange. Structures have to be attached to each other in a kind of grid pattern and it feels odd and cluttered to me. I'd prefer just a normal Red Alert 2 -style building method, that's my favourite. Construction units can be OK too.\n\nI believe the Shroud faction has a normal building system though and the Goo has a far more novel system than the others.\n\nThat aside though it's a fun title and my impression so far is around an 8/10 :)","May 25","true","9.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Faction balance is good in general, and their gameplay is asymmetric. Macroing tends to be the main focus; you set many factories to build on repeat. Single main resource. Base-building style varies between the factions.\n\nSingle-player campaign (with bundled DLC campaign) took me around 16 hours while completing secondaries. A few missions were frustratingly hard (on hard difficulty), but by no means unbeatable after a restart or two after I knew what to expect.\n\nIt's worth it, especially if it goes on sale.

Rather than try and talk through every single bit and piece of the game I'm going to give my first impressions, then later on I'll try and throw something more complete up.\n\nFirst things first: it's gorgeous. The cutscenes, the units, the buildings, everything feels really solid. I will say that my computer chugged a bit on the menu and at the beginning of each cutscene, but my computer (while pretty nice) isn't top of the line. Specs at the bottom if anyone cares. Weirdly enough the actual gameplay doesn't seem to have any slowdowns at all, so I'm wondering if it's just some minor glitch that'll be patched out.\n\nNext up: it's fun! Most of the gameplay is pretty intuitive, the units respond in fairly interesting ways, and in general the game feels like a competent studio worked on it. The only real issue I had as the Beta in the campaign was a mild misunderstanding of the hub system, and if I'm being honest that's probably more down to me being oblivious than anything.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer at all as yet (waiting on a couple of friends to pick it up), but the gameplay seems like it would translate really easily and well to multiplayer.\n\nThe tutorial section of the campaign does a good job of explaining things, and the fact that the tooltips are visible without being overwhelming or intrusive was really nice.\n\nApparently there's a map editor, and I can hardly wait to start tinkering around with that!\n\nApparently a fair number of the people in the developer came out of Westwood, and I can only say hurrah to that! I loved me some Red Alert back before the black hole known as EA destroyed them and it's good to see that they seem to be back in business!\n\nOne thing I wish they'd bring back is the faction system that existed in Emperor: Battle for Dune. The faction/subfaction choices added a lot of spice to that game, though the overall game sadly doesn't really hold up these days.\n\nPC specs:\n\nCPU: AMD Phenom II 1100t black x6 (running @ 3.3 Ghz)\nMemory: 8gb 1600 hz RAM\nGPU: Nvidia GTX 760 (EVGA card)\n\nMy hard drive is pretty much garbage, but that just means slightly longer load times.","January 25, 2015","true","6.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I even got it on sale for $20 and I feel a tad cheated. The story mode is extremely short, which wouldn't be so bad but they basically leave you in the middle of the story. It just screams "Oh well, better get some DLC in the future, right? Wink Wink. Huh? Don't you want to know what happens, come on, give us more money." I buy DLC to expand on a game, not to get to see the actual ending.\n\nAlso, the units are all extremely boring. They are the same units and buildings down to the HP, just reskinned with a different name. And none of the units really stood out for me. Beta were interesting at first, but the human forces were uninteresting for the most part, and the goo were just annoying to play by the end. Overall I feel like this game just lacks something major and while I don't regret buying it, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nHowever on the positive I will say that I haven't ever seen a game with such good visuals. The units and maps come alive and you can see some pretty small details from time to time. And the cut scenes are hands down the best I have ever seen.","July 3, 2015","false","36.6"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","1"

The classes do feel really balanced and I find all three classes pretty fun. What this game doesn't do unlike other rts games such as starcraft is each unit having their own counters based on different races. All units do have counters but it's more each unit has an objective such as seiging instead of army combat etc. The game is really well optimised and I have not had any frame rate drops with all four players on max size armies. The graphics are also quite pretty, especially for an rts game. You can feel the command and conquer influence when playing it but that's to be expected due to the developers and it's also a damn good thing anyway. Overall, I would say it's worth picking up at the full price and I believe this has potential to become a big game with a good following.","January 23, 2015","true","2.9"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","19","36","2","0"

The campaign is great but the multiplayer is very difficulty to get into, especiall for the non-goo factions. I have no editted this review 3 times in different states - joy, rage, and now neutrality. At first i was blown away by the sleek design and well organized maps and the unique feel of each team. The secon time was after being soundly defeated by the goo which - which at the time, felt like an over-powered team. Now after watching twitch and replays I was not only able to play better, but defeat the goo player that had decimated me so many times I almost uninstalled the game. The one beef I have with goo is that they have so many detectors, not because i rely on my stealth units to do damage...as daggers are rather weak, but it mkaes it very hard to keep eyes on the goo moms - which is what wins or loses games. Either the small proteans or the goo moms should have detector, not both. Only because the goo also have their scout/detector unit which means that goo has more detection than any other faction.\n\nTL'DR there is balance in multi-player, you just need to really learn the game to see it. The goo have a slight edge over the other teams, but that edge- the abilit to quickly control the map, is also their greatest weakness, if you can exploit it.\n\nThe human team is slightly under-powered. Concidering a few of our units are signicantly harder to get out than the other 2 teams I would like to feel a bit more punch behind my units. I would like to see the Gladius becoming slightly faster - but that may just be me wanting a stronger unit.\n\nIs the game perfect? No - but it is a damn good effort, and if you can get passed screaming at the screen when you get beaten once again by goo or one of the top 10 players it is a fantastic game.\n\nPros:\n- simple easy to use UI\n- by not requiring to constantly moniter unit production you are free to really play tactically and out maneuver your enemy.\n- the teams are very diverse and allow for specific exploitation.\n- the AI is intelligent and challenging even in the campaign. Can honestly that hasn't happened to me in a long time.\n- despite not being a AAA company, the cinematics, music, and voice acting are top notch and very well done.\n\nCons:\n- High learning curve for new players getting into multi-player the reason for this is con number 2\n- small player base. Wait times for a match can get up to 10 minutes. Because of the small player base you often play the same people over and over again and those who play the game most often at the top 50 players. Which can be very frustrating for new players, i know I got slaughtered a few times. But beating that one goo player after losing 15+ matches to him... that's a feeling i cannot describe.\n\nThis game needs more sales and a lower price tag. The free weekend is what got me into it, and a few more events like that might just get more players involved.","October 24, 2015","true","82.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The campaign took me approximately ~15 hours to complete, and even on easy the missions were surprisingly difficult.  Each mission offered something new, and never was repetitive.  Also, I will be playing through it again very soon because I realized afterwards you unlock special steam achievements if you complete all bonus objectives in a mission in addition to your primary missions, which I did not do the first time through.\nOne thing you probably will notice is that the campaign, even though it has a great storyline, plays as more of an extremely in-depth and advanced tutorial for the multiplayer.  It introduces you to a faction and what it has to offer for 5 missions, then switch to the next faction and allows you to become acquainted with that one for 5 missions, before switching you to the last faction.  So if you would like to get into the multiplayer, I highly suggest you play through the single player mode first.\nAlot of people have complained about not being able to find matches for multiplayer, however, I think the free weekend/steam sale has fixed that because I have not had any problems finding matches.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game!","October 25, 2015","true","28.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The one down side that I have found is a very short single player campaign.  However, I found the story and universe to be compelling.  This is a great buy if you find it on sale, or perhaps if you are a big RTS fan and do not want yet another EA or Blizzard game.\n\nWarning!  I do not ever play RTS games online or even in multiplayer.  I enjoy the great challenges presented by the unique scenarios and puzzles inherent to good RTS games.

Building base and army feel less chore than classic RTS, and more easy because there's automation for building units and base\n- great graphic. It bring me back some memory of SC1, but I wish units could have more texture detail\n\nCons\n\n- only 3 factions with 9-11 unit types per factions, I wish it'll go the same direction as DOW instead of SC2, DOW is not as balance as SC2 but people still love the game because it fulfill their multi-factions war fantasy\n- a wall of core-gamer and competitive gamer bashing suggestions and ideas from casual gamer. That's why there's not much hope for new units and new factions\n\n- Human units design looks too simple....it's just some random floating objects with gun for me","January 1","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The one down side that I have found is a very short single player campaign.  However, I found the story and universe to be compelling.  This is a great buy if you find it on sale, or perhaps if you are a big RTS fan and do not want yet another EA or Blizzard game.\n\nWarning!  I do not ever play RTS games online or even in multiplayer.  I enjoy the great challenges presented by the unique scenarios and puzzles inherent to good RTS games.  To me solving an seemingly impossible puzzle is much more rewarding than training myself for years to micro-manage units only to lose to some 10 year old who is using a hack IT did not even make.","January 2","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

About 50% of the upgrades are typically worthless because of how specific they are. the other 50% are only sometimes taken, depending on the situation.\n\nOverall I'd give this game a 7.5/10 hoping it will grow to have more features, more maps, more units etc etc.","July 8, 2015","true","55.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You won't get any of this unfinished/beta/alpha crap. The graphics are very good. Gameplay is smooth for me even in high unit battles.\n\nThis game is a throwback to the Command & Conquer days with its own twist. People who don't enjoy the fast paced nature of Starcraft 1/2 and like to spend more time strategically planing instead clicking all over the place then this game may be up your ally.\n\nThis game is by no means easy just because it is a more laid back RTS. Several missions I struggled with on even Normal difficulty, and I like playing Starcraft 2 campaigns on Hard and above.\n\nYou don't need to fill up your refineries with worker units. They auto produce resource haulers as necessary. This makes defending what you own much more critical.\n\nUnit production buildings can have more than one unit set on repeat so it cycles building to what you define making setting up army compositions very simple.\n\nThe Tech perks you select really define how you choose to play each game. For example. A Lancer(Humans) fires a channeling beam that does more damage the longer it fires without stoping. Sound Familiar? Well you can select an upgrade that transforms its weapon into a railgun that travels a set distance and pierces targets damaging every unit in its path. So you need to decide if you want a building killing mega beam, or a light unit shreading Rail-of-a-Good time.\n\nThe exception to many of the things I have listed is the Goo faction. They have a much diferent playstyle that involves no permanant buildings. instead you have a Mother Goo(Mobile home base of sorts) that grows in size as it absorbs resources and units. You then split the Goo up into smaller sizes and morph them smaller ones into units and such.\n\nAll in all each race feels likes its own. Some of the early units feel generic, but that changes when upgrades and more advanced units come into play.\n\nThere are a few things I would like to see implimented. When you fail a mission they should prompt you to restart without making you load back through 2 other screens and have to reskip the cutscenes(which are awsome btw). There are a few other things I had on my brain but I lost them. Nothing that really detracts from the games enjoyment for me.\n\nI'm hoping to see expanded campaign content in the future.\n\n-Gui","January 30, 2015","true","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I only found out about Grey Goo two weeks ago and decided to give it a try.\n\nI have been pleasently surprised.  It does have a slight C&C feel to it (not generals, but C&C, Red Alert type feel).  It plays like those old RTS with some of the annoying features of the old RTS games out of the picture.  (No camp in your base for your super weapon)\n\nLike many said it is not a Starcraft so if you expect it to play like that you will be disappointed - there is not as much micro as you would have in SC and the pace is slower.\n\nIt feels very well polished, so far the single player campaign in the best I've played in an RTS in years.  It is a bit short, but the cutscenes are plentiful and the story is great.\n\nThe three factions are very different as well.  There may be a lot of similar units between them in some regards, but the base strategies differ vastly.\n\nIf you like RTS games and you liked the old ones back in the late 90's early 2k's pick this game up.

The name Grey Goo actually had me question paying 50 dollars for a new game.  I know what the name refers to, but I really feel that with all the other spectacular work put toward the game, a better name could have been agreed upon.\n\nOnto why I feel like writing a review.  This game is gorgeous.  Even the character designs during the cutscenes look great.  The world you play in looks alive.  And a cool cover system is in place by having overhead forest canopy that blocks you from enemy sight so you can spring an ambush.\n\nPlaystyle is very similar to Command & Conquer and Warcraft 3.  Easy to learn but difficult to master.  At least from my experience.  Other more proficient RTS gamers may find the game too easy.  But I do recommend this game to all levels of players.\n\nIf you have the money to spend on a new title, it would be well spent on this game.  I wish the name was different, in fact I passed over the game at first based on the name alone.  I'm happy that I gave it a second look.","January 23, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not only does it have a greaa soundtrack and absolutley stunning cutscenes, but you  get to choose what songs you want to play with the Jukebox feature. But onto the meat of the game. Of the three factions, the Beta are fairly typical for RTS games. They are well balanced and spread their bases around the map. This in contrast to the other base building faction, the Humans, who unlike the Beta, build one expanisve well-defended base. Their strategy is typically to turtle and send out waves to wear down enemies and pick off enemy instalments. Now, on to the real pull of this game; the Goo. The Goo are a completely new type of faction that has never been done before in this type of game. Instead of building a base, you start off with one Mother Goo, who, depending on hoe much resources it has absorbed, can spilt into smaller blobs called Proteans. There are 2 types of Proteans, Large ones, which are about as slow as the Mother Goo, and split into heavier unit types, such as tanks. The other type, is the zippy small Protean, which  spawns light infantry. On top of this, Mother Goo and Protean blobs can traverse any terrain, and absorb building and units, making them something akin to melee-range siege weapons. Despite all this innovation, the game has a few setbacks. Despite the campaign telling a good story and having constant and wonderful cutscenes, some of the levels are absolute hell, like the 5th and last Beta level, where after holding out for 15 minutes, you spend an hour running around the map chasing down the last goo blobs. The interface also is very clunky and unresponsive, though a lot of that can be changed by toying with your hotkeys. All in all, this game is just the breath of fresh air the genre needed, from all the Total Wars and Starcraft. 8.5/10","January 25, 2015","true","36.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I bought this today, managed to make it to the fourth mission on Normal mode so far. I got my ♥♥♥ kicked.\n\nResources are running out fast, you have to expand and the AI are relentlessly harassing you. This isn't a game where you can turtle and build a massive army to attack. Each base is temporary (aside from your HQ), each force of unit counters are critical. When you finally get half the map locked off and defended your population cap is up and you have to start deterring defenses to form an offensive force.\n\nIn contrast to most recent games, this difficulty curve is a pleasure. I don't want it forgiving, I don't want it easy. I want to be forced to play the mission over and over until I figure it out. I want to have to walk away and take a breather because the last hour resulted in a crushing loss based on a timer and some information they didn't give you until the very last possible minute.\n\nA job well done by the original creators of CNC who apparently haven't lost their roots. Having a strong faction balance, great mechanics and an unbuffered feeling that I thought didn't exist in gaming anymore, I am very pleased. The game was not rushed and Petroglyph made sure to dot their I's and cross their T's.\n\n9/10 - Only losing a point for the conduit system ripped off of CNC3 Nod turrets.","January 25, 2015","true","13.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's still that feeling that certain situations are "supposed" to be solved with particular rock-paper-scissors combos, but this game has a nice way of mixing it up with the tech system, allowing some wiggleroom for your favorite units.\n\nThe Goo as a faction are unlike anything I've ever played in an RTS before, the closest facsimile I can equate are the Heirarchy from Petroglyph's innovative yet ill-fated Universe at War: Earth Assault, but even that doesn't describe it adequately. They aren't such heavy hitters, and rely heavily on hit-and-run tactics to attack effectively.\n\nOverall, if you're aching for a new RTS, pick it up, I wouldn't recommend it if you have a personal favorite right now you couldn't go without.\n\n","October 19, 2015","true","21.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also, disconnects happen too frequently, but that can be fixed if the devs get their butts in gear.\n\nThis is a decent RTS.  However, it is hampered by two things. 1) Too many disconnects which haven'tbeen fixed yet. 2) Lack of online players.\n\nThe game play is definitely economy bound.  You have to watch your economics closely in order to build the right units at the right time.  Good micro helps in a pinch, but the macro is what will make or break you.  So if you like RTSes where micro is the definining factor, you may not like it.\n\nThe "Goo" class is a nice innovation.  The other classes have to hunt and destroy because Goo has no HQ in one place.  This makes for some tough tactical decisions, including for those playing Goo.\n\nThe AI is hard in campaign mode, but the campaign isn't really compelling.  The fun is in multiplayer mode.\n\nThe connection issues can be fixed if the devs put their mind to it, so it wouldn't stop me from buying the game.  What might stop me is the lack of online players available.  The initial price was that of a AAA game which limited the number of people who got it right at the beginning.  This limited the number of available players, so it made it hard to get a match going.  Which in turn caused others to stop playing.  So, the pool is kind of limited right now.  If you have other friends who play, though, or join a group where you can set up matches, it's fine.

It's bad, really bad.\nMaybe you got 2 friend and want to play with them all togheter in a team, and you just can't.\nThere is nothing to say about it, the developers, if they really care about their game should engage to make 3v3 available.\nOther games has it, and if Grey Goo want to be competitive should add this feature very soon.\nSecond point, the balance.\nEveryone you find in multiplayer are almost BETA or Goo, let's ask oursef why? Well;\nAnother point Developers should see, is that the Human Lancer is pretty weak. It's point is to be the Human heavy units (as the avalance from Beta) and it only deal 20 damage, then 20, then (after 4 secs) 70. The avalance from BETA has 250 damage (300 is the damage of an epic units and avalance is not an epic unit, I would make notice it to people), almost same penetration (10). It just ONESHOT every enemy unit, the only things that try to limitate it's firepower are the range and the fire-rate, both useless, because you can just shut down the enemy at 1° shot. If you accompany them with anti-air and light is just the perfect army in mid game. The cost are almost the same, avalance cost 600, Lancer cost 560. What I'm sayng is not just my opinion, if you check on multiplayer, there are few people playng humans, and they all rush, and even if they rush NOBODY even makes a Lancer. 20 starting damage is just RIDICULOUS. Even with higher fire rate. A good deal would be if Lancer would get 80 starting damage, reaching 130 over time. If this will not be done, Lancer will never be take seriously, you're better to directly remove the unit from the game. Another thing I would point is that the aoe damage of the alpha should destroy all light units entirely, that's why I would sudgest to increase aoe damage to 125 from 100. Anyway, this is not even needed because nobody uses Epic units in multiplayer. The REAL problem is the Lancer, actually.\nI would be glad to edit or even delete this bad review, but I will only if the games really change. Unless, it's almost a waste of money for the actual condition.","October 28, 2015","false","36.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Grey Goo resembles another RTS called Etherium but it's just not as interesting. Some of the ideas, like teleportation, are kind of badly executed in Grey Goo. You can find similar ideas in Starcraft 2 but better executed to suit how the user plays the game.\n\nI completed the Beta and Human campaigns but the gameplay just wasn't engaging enough to make me want to play more. I uninstalled just before the Grey Goo campaign.\n\nPROS\n1. Campaign looks Good\nI like the single player map, looks really good. Very well designed.\n\n2. Marketing\nI've heard of Grey Goo.\n\n3. Tree Cover\nGood to hide in. Like the way you can attack from cover, this is the part that resembles Etherium.\n\n4. Graphics ***\nTop notch. These are the best that I've seen out of most the RTS games that I have played. E.g. Lucy Tang, the commander of the Human faction just looks so real.\n\nCONS\n1. Multiplayer\nEvery single race is the same, they just have different skins. Units are basically divided into Light, Heavy, Air, Stealth and Ultimate.\n\n2. Complex Building Puzzles\nEvery race has their own jigsaw puzzle to figure out.\n\na. Goo\nYou need Mother Goos to slime their way to the resource pool and grow fat. After growing fat, they split like an amoeba and form Small/Large Proteans, which have to be split into the actual units. This notion is really ridiculous.\n\nb. Beta\nAliens in this game. Absolutely horrible, you have to attach attachments to Factories just to build the required units, wasting a ridiculous amount of time\n\nc. Humans\nJust like the Beta with even more complex building jigsaws as you have to lay power lines that cost resources. In this game, the humans resemble an alien race instead. Their buildings can teleport but it's rubbish since you have to connect them to a power conduit.\n\n3. Multiple Annoying Steps\nYou have to do so many tiny steps to achieve your objective that it's no longer fun. Here are a few examples.\n\na. Building High Tier Units\nFor every factory, you have to add attachments. You have 4 to choose from, Air, Tank, Stealth and Artillery. In order to build certain units, you have to add combinations like Tank and Artillery REPEATEDLY FOR EVERY NEW FACTORY. You can share certain upgrades for the Humans by building an upgrade in between 2 factories but that's only possible if you build a conduit long enough to build them side by side.\n\nb. Beta Defenses\nBeta's have some sort of garrisoning procedure where their units climb onto walls/platforms to shoot from. Instead of building a defense turret, you have to first build a wall, then build a unit, then get him to jump on it. What's worse is that each factory only produces 1 unit and each wall tower only garrisons 1 unit.\n\nc. Goo Spawning\nYou have to keep splitting up the Small/Large Goos or feed them to the Protean Purger. What the hell is this?\n\n4. Short Campaign\nWay to short\n\n5. Repairing\nIt is so annoying to have to click and repair each individual item.\n\n6. Air Units Reloading and Landing Deck\nAmmunition reloading? You also need a landing deck to keep the air units in. This is reminiscent of Command and Conquer's flaws. Also, the air units in this game are horribly underpowered.\n\n7. Extractors and Vision\nIn order to build an Extractor on a Catalyst Pool, you actually need vision of the pool. Somehow, the developers designed the Refinery's vision to be just out of reach of the pool. Thus, forcing one to send 1 unit just to scout.\n\n8. Extractor Resource Rate\nDepending on exact location of where you place your Extractor, you will get +8/+10/+13 resource rate and this is all a matter of placing your cursor 1 milimetre to the left or right. This is also linked to point 7.","October 15, 2015","false","6.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I really loved this genre game, but still it have minor bug and another thing that should be improve in future update and optimizing the core game to make sure great replayability and great experience toward gamers out there (i play this game on laptop that use obselete GPU nvidia gt 525m but still can play it and i had experience low FPS when there was so many many many many many unit >.< )\n\n\nWHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS GAME?\n\n+ It have 3 distinct faction that require player to play it with different style\n+ slow paced, no more APM keyboard of warrior of destruction  of speed of 1000 light years of spamming button that will blow your mind to micro each one of your unit until you forget about macroing your own base to train unit, expand base, build base (i think whose play starcarft 2 with 100 apm will find this game very modest and have more time to think strategy carefully)\n+ Excellent campaign with 15 mission overall, but very tricky mission 5 and mission 15 that will consume your much time even in normal mode, I failed many time in order to attempt this both mission. But still this campaign will be EPIC toward the end of this game\n+ I like Grey Goo Game unit variation. It have so many potential outcome\n+ User interface is likely distinguish based on the faction characteristic. It is very intuitive and easy remember like MOBA QWER keyboard style\n+ Best Auto macro unit training/ autoproduction (you don't require to repeat many times to train units. it have automatic queue-cycle that will repeat it self until you decide to stop its production. Sitback and enjoy but don't forget to rally point)\n+ This game is easy to learn and hard to master. very depth strategy in this game require you to know each unit, there will be no useless unit as each unit have its own benefit and its own capabiltiy. Each unit also have very unique attribute and modest upgrade to make sure the game will be fun to play\n+ Upgrade system is trully relevant and well balance. It is very crucial to upgrade your own army to counter enemy strategy. I found each of faction's upgrade are really efficient to counter enemy strategy.\n+ modable game. Damn sure this game will have good modding to extend its replayability in future\n+ nostalgia of CNC when i was child\n+ good music, my fav soundtrack is "agile maneuvers". Great job Frank Klepacki (i got it free)\n+ <spoiler> my speculation of this game : fourth faction is "the silent ones" according to morra/beta. the goo faction is good guy here that will defend sentient like human from extinct due to the silents one invasion\n+ (will add more in future)\n\n\nWHAT I DISLIKE ABOUT THIS GAME?\n\n+ very few map to play\n+ please improve matchmaking\n+ please make sequel fast\n+ no very super hard AI, after couple of game i found hard AI of 3 faction is rather easy and it have same strategy every each time I play\n+ minor bug occur occasionally but it don't appear to distract gameplay (lucky me for having zero crash, I am just using nvidia gt 525m)\n+ no matchmaking player coop versus ai (2 vs 2)\n+ i hope in future there will be 8 player maximum to play\n+ please make round cycle path Guard command (button G)\n+ unit that hold position still force move if collide/intersect with other unit's pathfinding movement. I don't want relocate again my unit and then hold postion again. Waste of time to focus on this matter.\n+ no passive stance behaviour, in other RTS games unit can have 3 or more stance which is passive, hold postion, aggrasive\n+ no replay like starcraft 2 (that is really demerit points!)\n+ (later i will update what I dislike about this game, it is so hard to notice fault within this game)\n\n\nMY FIRST EXPERIENCE PLAY MULTIPLAYER (UNRANKED) :\n\nI choose beta as primary faction, my enemy is human and we fight unraked match making. We played Stalker's Rise map and my position was west and my opponent was east. I did early scout and find out my enemy is focusing in economy and rushing to second and third refinery, I finished my second refinery after build small factory, I follow my intuition by trains commando to scout every potential of resources that opponent may place its extractor. This time, i have advantage of army while my opponent have advantage of resources and hard base defense (i scout his base again). I think carefully and made decision to favor more on offensive path than defense. few minute later, I have an adequate army to raid his base but as i scout then, opponent base is likely hard to breach. In meantime I did discover enemy's 5 extractor in total while I only have 3 extractor. That time I only have two choice whether to raid his base or harass his economy. So, I decide to harass his economy by destroying his undefend extractor  with all my army. Lucky me, my opponent just retaliate with only quarter population army while not having chance to fight back with my half maximum population army. I managed to destroy his southeast and northeast extractor. While Harassing his economy I hastenly build Hand of Ruk (HOR) Epic Unit. After 5 min, I brought my HOR to near his place for penetrate his strong defense with HOR long range nuke. Guess what, my enemy also finished training alpha. My nuke land first at alpha but it barely reduce alpha hitpoint, i got panic and send all my unit to attack his alpha and then his alpha overwhelm my army within second. So I extend my vision with stratus and eject beacon to enemy headquarter, I give up to fight head on with his alpha directly so I change my focus to his headquarter. I command HOR to attack his headquater(HQ) while running from his alpha (circulate his cliff base). I managed to destroy his HQ inside his base, his alpha stop chasing me and directly go to my base. I managed to destroy his alpha with HOR using hit n run strategy. And what left is destroy all his remaining structure. My first win unranked matchmaking.\n\n\nMY CONCLUSION ABOUT THIS GAME :\n\nThis game have a big potential to expand and become more polish infuture. Don't get me wrong this game have more merit than demerit. It have weakness and stregth. For me this game is perfectly fine and it need more content to play such as arcade mode feature based on starcraft 2. I highly reccomended to play this game for all who suck at APM  and noob like me. This game is likely target to the customer whose want slow paced action casual gameplay.

I wish more games would do things like that! The gameplay is very fluid not so stressfull like in Starcraft, yet it leaves much space to improve ones build and playstyle. Unit composition and scouting are a key element to win your games against other players. Overall i liked the different play styles a lot.\n\nThere are a few things buggin me but that is to be expected with a game that is brand new. I haven't had any performance issues so far. The only thing that I hope to see in the future are a few more units to bring a little more diversity into the game which is so far very nice.\n\nOver all I really like this game a lot and would reccomend it to everybody that likes the RTS genre or futuristic games!","January 25, 2015","true","19.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At its heart it's a bit of a mix of Starcraft and C&C3, with enough differences to have easily fought for a place in the crowded RTS market of a few years ago. The question is how much its novelty in 2015 is part of the reasons it's getting some very good reviews?\n\nI don't think it's unfair to say that Grey Goo is a bit rough around the edges. The graphics aren't going to push a mid-range PC much, and I did find some bugs with loading and menu screens, however the cut sequences are impressive for a team on a smaller budget and the overall style is classic RTS (in a good way).\n\nThe three factions comprise humans, the humanoid Beta, and the eponymous Goo. Other reviewers have commented that the former two are quite similar and the latter not great fun to play, but I'm quite liking all three and the more you play the more the subtlties are starting to come out. Also, the Goo is about as different a race as you're likely to see in an RTS and could lead to some interesting tactics in a three-way scrap. The team deserve some real credit here and I'm looking forward to seeing how the factions will develop, but I'd also like a few more skirmish maps to play about with (presumably we'll see both in DLC).\n\nSo, to answer my question, only a bit. Novelty value aside this is a fully-fledged RTS with a decent campaign and enough skirmish options to keep single players happy, at least whilst more maps come out, and the asymmetrical set up is going to be great fun for multiplayers. If you're looking for a new RTS and you pick up Grey Goo - and I certainly recommend you do - you won't be be disappointed.\n","January 25, 2015","true","40.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The talking mission briefing was a nice touch, really felt like a throwback to an older golden era of RTS as did the amount of units and such.\n\nMy main gripe is that it plays somewhat slow.  Units move slow, they fire slow, projectiles are slow.\n\nI did not feel like unit composition was a high focus, almost all missions I won with one type of ground unit+air (except for playing as goo).\nHumans were worst in this case, a 200 army of revolvers was used in all the campaign maps unless I could make the capital unit and that was pretty effective- only weak against enemy artillery.\n\nAt the current price I’d still buy it.\n\nI feel they could have done more with the campaign, perhaps your cliche commando style map or such.\n","January 30, 2015","true","20.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I really loved this genre game, but still it have minor bug and another thing that should be improve in future update and optimizing the core game to make sure great replayability and great experience toward gamers out there (i play this game on laptop that use obselete GPU nvidia gt 525m but still can play it and i had experience low FPS when there was so many many many many many unit >.< )\n\n\nWHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS GAME?\n\n+ It have 3 distinct faction that require player to play it with different style\n+ slow paced, no more APM keyboard of warrior of destruction  of speed of 1000 light years of spamming button that will blow your mind to micro each one of your unit until you forget about macroing your own base to train unit, expand base, build base (i think whose play starcarft 2 with 100 apm will find this game very modest and have more time to think strategy carefully)\n+ Excellent campaign with 15 mission overall, but very tricky mission 5 and mission 15 that will consume your much time even in normal mode, I failed many time in order to attempt this both mission. But still this campaign will be EPIC toward the end of this game\n+ I like Grey Goo Game unit variation. It have so many potential outcome\n+ User interface is likely distinguish based on the faction characteristic. It is very intuitive and easy remember like MOBA QWER keyboard style\n+ Best Auto macro unit training/ autoproduction (you don't require to repeat many times to train units. it have automatic queue-cycle that will repeat it self until you decide to stop its production. Sitback and enjoy but don't forget to rally point)\n+ This game is easy to learn and hard to master. very depth strategy in this game require you to know each unit, there will be no useless unit as each unit have its own benefit and its own capabiltiy. Each unit also have very unique attribute and modest upgrade to make sure the game will be fun to play\n+ Upgrade system is trully relevant and well balance. It is very crucial to upgrade your own army to counter enemy strategy. I found each of faction's upgrade are really efficient to counter enemy strategy.\n+ modable game. Damn sure this game will have good modding to extend its replayability in future\n+ nostalgia of CNC when i was child\n+ good music, my fav soundtrack is "agile maneuvers".

Waste of time to focus on this matter.\n+ no passive stance behaviour, in other RTS games unit can have 3 or more stance which is passive, hold postion, aggrasive\n+ no replay like starcraft 2 (that is really demerit points!)\n+ (later i will update what I dislike about this game, it is so hard to notice fault within this game)\n\n\nMY FIRST EXPERIENCE PLAY MULTIPLAYER (UNRANKED) :\n\nI choose beta as primary faction, my enemy is human and we fight unraked match making. We played Stalker's Rise map and my position was west and my opponent was east. I did early scout and find out my enemy is focusing in economy and rushing to second and third refinery, I finished my second refinery after build small factory, I follow my intuition by trains commando to scout every potential of resources that opponent may place its extractor. This time, i have advantage of army while my opponent have advantage of resources and hard base defense (i scout his base again). I think carefully and made decision to favor more on offensive path than defense. few minute later, I have an adequate army to raid his base but as i scout then, opponent base is likely hard to breach. In meantime I did discover enemy's 5 extractor in total while I only have 3 extractor. That time I only have two choice whether to raid his base or harass his economy. So, I decide to harass his economy by destroying his undefend extractor  with all my army. Lucky me, my opponent just retaliate with only quarter population army while not having chance to fight back with my half maximum population army. I managed to destroy his southeast and northeast extractor. While Harassing his economy I hastenly build Hand of Ruk (HOR) Epic Unit. After 5 min, I brought my HOR to near his place for penetrate his strong defense with HOR long range nuke. Guess what, my enemy also finished training alpha. My nuke land first at alpha but it barely reduce alpha hitpoint, i got panic and send all my unit to attack his alpha and then his alpha overwhelm my army within second. So I extend my vision with stratus and eject beacon to enemy headquarter, I give up to fight head on with his alpha directly so I change my focus to his headquarter. I command HOR to attack his headquater(HQ) while running from his alpha (circulate his cliff base). I managed to destroy his HQ inside his base, his alpha stop chasing me and directly go to my base. I managed to destroy his alpha with HOR using hit n run strategy. And what left is destroy all his remaining structure. My first win unranked matchmaking.\n\n\nMY CONCLUSION ABOUT THIS GAME :\n\nThis game have a big potential to expand and become more polish infuture. Don't get me wrong this game have more merit than demerit. It have weakness and stregth. For me this game is perfectly fine and it need more content to play such as arcade mode feature based on starcraft 2. I highly reccomended to play this game for all who suck at APM  and noob like me. This game is likely target to the customer whose want slow paced action casual gameplay.

I just took a punt on this because it was a FTP weekend, and I love it. It is essentially supreme commander but with a 200 unit cap and walls. Which is exactly what I wanted. A classic RTS with base building, resource harvesting (and the economy management as a side effect, and defending your resource ), ground and flying units etc. I like that the higher tier stuff unlocks as a match progresses, so you can't just rush a heavy unit at the start. You have to build a unit factory, and a silo, and research a piece of tech before you can build a large unit factory for instance. So the game ramps up nicely into a large scale war without the worry of rubbish rush wins. You still need to be careful though!\n\nAll in all, I've been looking for a classic RTS like this for a while. If you liked SupCom, you'll like this.

I hadn't played any thing like this since Starcraft, which to be honest got kind of overwhemling with all the available customizations and associated strategies that I finally just hung it up. Grey Goo left me wanting more. Its challenging, even on easy. Some levels you sale through and others mess you up over and over until you finally scrape through it.  The base building system is simple and varies between the 3 factions, Unlike C&C where the opposing forces were mirror images of each other.

However, it lacks intensity and likewise replayability. It all comes down to game speed.\n\nI've been playing RTS's for a long time all the way back to the first C&C's. It's by far my favorite genre of games. While i respect the choice of slower gamespeed for style of play, GG is a bit too slow. The ability to be quick on your feet with high APM, quick thinking and fast micro is pretty much obsolete in this game. This type of intensity is a huge part of competive RTS gameplay.\n\nThe units and game mechanics are pretty awesome and well done. Honestly, if everything were the exact same and the game speed sped up to double (yes double) what it is now, it would probably be pretty fantastic. Until then i probably won't be playing too much.\n\nThere have been network issues and i've been getting dropped from about 1/4 of my games. But the game just released so i'm not considering that as part of my review.\n\nAnyway there you have it. The speed does not do it justice, which is a shame because the game is very well made.","February 5, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can confirm that it seems to work fine on a Surface Pro 1 with an intel HD 4000/i5 at 1280x720. Despite everything on low the framerate remains playable and it looks pretty good too. So far I have only played the skirmishes.\n\nThe game itself is just what I was hoping - a lovechild of CnC, Supreme Commander and Starcraft 2. I found this much more accessible than Starcraft so far and the factions seem fresh and new.\n\nThe production values are excellent and the interface is fairly easy to get to grips with. I have not read any tutorials, tried the single player or looked online....just jumped right in and it seems easy to learn and fun to play.\n\nIs it a better game than starcraft? So far it is more to my tastes and I remain hopeful. If you like RTS games and want something fresh yet nostalgic, I cannot recommend this enough. My initial rating for this game is 9 out of 10.\n\nHappy to pay the full asking price and I am most likely going to buy this for my brother so we can relive our childhood.\n\nA very happy customer - let the battles begin!!!","January 25, 2015","true","31.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Its C&C-style large-scale top-down strategy emphasis (as opposed to Blizzard style bottom-up micromanagement hell) makes the game fun for casual to moderately serious RTS players.  "Serious" RTS players who measure their success in APM might be disappointed, but they will also be missing out on a great game.\n\nThe storyline and characters are engaging and memorable enough, with the cutscene character models being some of the most realistic seen in a game of any genre.\n\nThe lack of a robust AI is a problem, but not one that brings the game down.  It is a pity, because it stops challenging the player fairly early in the game, but in general RTS AI has never been strong, and we should not expect it.\n\nThe very small number of maps means that play outside of the campaign can become dull and repetitive more quickly than it ought to, and the developers should address this by producing a number of them in the future, perhaps with the planned expansion.","May 5, 2015","true","64.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everyone is always going to look at CC because the RTS formula is basically simple and it doesn't really change from game to game, with the expection of company of heroes.\n\nI heard this game be desribed as a base builder like CC but the combat seemed rushed like starcraft.\n\nI think the main fail of this game is simply the soilders/vehicles. I think there is actually only one soilder in the game, the rest our machine based. They don't have any special fuctions even your artillery can't be force to fire even if you know the other team is there and they are firing at you.\n\nSImply put, it's basically horde attacking. You can try to take out anti tank guns with long distance weapons. Whoever has the biggest horde wins. The only semi interesting thing is that if your army gets destroyed more than likely you are finished because units take a long time to make.\n\nI feel like this game could have been so good, but it's just not.\n\n","October 17, 2015","false","2.4"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","14","28","0","3"

Short answer: There's a lot of meat to the multiplayer of this game if you take the time to learn it, and the game world is worth learning about.\n\nThere are a lot of people who compare this game to Command and Conquer, which they should. It owes a lot of its design to the CnC games, but I don't think that it is fair to call this a stripped-down clone. It has certainly been streamlined; unit, building, and technology production is always at hand, and you don't need to move your hand off the QWER keys to get to literally any part of it. Units are simple, too. You pretty much just right click them where you want them to go. It doesn't get much more complicated than telling Artillery to attack ground to lead shots and blind fire, or telling your aircraft to return to hanger en mass.\n\nWhat a lot of people seem to totally miss out on is how focused on map awareness and harassment the game is. While it isn't as frantic as Starcraft, you are constantly moving around, trying to take and hold resource nodes from your opponent. Brush inhibits vision of where the enemy is and makes scouting units valuable even when the enemy is not using stealth tech. Because you are getting resources from 5-10 nodes scattered across the map instead of 1-3 bases, there is action going on through a much larger percentage of the map compared to other RTSs. While there is much less focus on APM to play a good game, it isn't like it will put you to sleep, either.\n\nEverything that everyone says about the storyline is true. The cutscenes are excellent, and the world is refreshingly bright and lush compared to the grimdark war stories that most RTSs are about. The mission design is... not great, but the AI has been playing a lot smarter since the last update. It's worth the 12-15 hours to play before you dive into multiplayer.\n\nIf nothing else, I really recommend picking this game up to play as the Goo faction. There is really nothing like it in any other game that I've played. Getting to play a faction with all base mechanics fulfilled by a self-replicating super-unit with pseudo-flight and melee capabilities is just so... different from anything else. If you are a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try.","March 31","true","20.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you are into Warcraft/Starcraft type of fast-paced real time strategy games, that's a good choice for you. The four factions are unique in their own fashion. All of them have a unique design and they demand a different playstyle and approach from you, although the main structure of building- and unitsystem is the same by all of them. The cutscenes are beautiful, the voiceacting is really good and THE MUSIC...amazing!\n\nThere are some minor issues with it, for example the lack of zooming options and the graphics are a bit outdated, but regardless I think it is really worth taking a look at this game, although it's not a blockbuster from a famous studio.

Namely for me, Frank Klepacki.\n\nSound 5/5\nThe music in this game is truly amazing. Klepacki took a risk trying the orchestral music type, and it paid off. He has made other music like this in previous games, like  In the Line of Fire  from  Tiberium Dawn , but that was mere dabbling. The entirety of  Grey Goo's  is in this orchestral style, and it is perfect. The individual tracks really make the game come alive, and they all sound unique.  Grey Goo  reintroduces a mechanic from other games that I love, the jukebox. Letting me listen to the best tracks in whatever order. The soundtrack is amazing, and I listen to it on its own.\n\nDesign 5/5\nThe hotkey system in  Grey Goo  is one for the ages. I almost can't play other RTSs anymore because I've become dependent on it. Its fast and sleek. The alien race, the Beta, are so real. They have a distinct culture, and even a language made for them. The cutscenes look so real, its unbelievable. There is much to say about the design in this game, but mostly its just flawless.\n\nGameplay 3/5\nThere have been a lot of complaints about the gameplay, and I can see why. There are very few unit types, and there is no distinction between infantry and heavy units. Its rather linear to say the least, in a genre that should be more wide. Everything takes so long to make. The game struggles very hard to just stay alive when the unit cap is reached. However, the armour and damage mechanics are quite unique, and the Goo, despite being labeled as an overpowered Zerg ripoff, are very balanced and fun to use. Epic units are plain, unadulterated fun to use. The simplicity of the game, despite being quite the flaw, is kind of refreshing.\n\nStory 2/5\nBloody hell, its not a ripoff of  Starcraft , alright? I'm not going to describe the entire story because its quite intricate, and this is a review, not a synopsis. At first glance, it seems rather analagous to  Starcraft , (the Beta are the Terrans, Humans are Protos, etc.) and it does borrow elements from  Starcraft , but it still remains its own. Unfortunately, the story is tattered, and fifteen campaign missions is simply not enough to craft a believable world from. It could be so much more, but its too short.\n\nTL; DR\n\nGrey Goo is a unique, and refreshing take on the dying RTS genre. It falls a touch short in some areas, but compensates, making a well-rounded game, definitely worth your time.\n\nConclusion\n\nPrice Worth: 100%\nRating:         8/10","June 16, 2015","true","67.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","1","2","3","0"

Most campaign missions can be completed by finding AI exploit (normal difficulty) and it's not hard at all. Also this game must have the worst implementation of dynamic music at all. Example: Calm music is played during expansion base time and suddenly get stopped and nothing is played.  Then one small scout unit approach wall surrounded base and get shredded by 3 commandos - 180 APM music is played like it's some sort of battle of two epic army and 5 second after calm quiet time with no music return. Cringe worthy missions post screen.\n\nBought it at low price, haven't big expectations and I am still disappointed. This game makes me appreciate more THE COMMAND AND CONQUER ULTIMATE EDITION on Origin. Crate power up's on skirmishes with various effects and buildings capable to counter early attacks like NOD triple Shredder Turrets and automatic vehicle repair near factories in CNC 3 or any stuff in CNC 2 - both fractions have EMP cannon, GDI has grenadiers, NOD has cyborgs and in expansion - the reapers. Hell in CNC 3 simple infantry could build bunker by its own.\n\nSmall note: About campaign stupid AI  - similar issues I've seen in demo (prologue only) version of SC2 Legacy of the Void. "Oh seems invisible unit like Dark Templars are attacking my outpost? I just accept my fate and let them die." (Normal difficulty too)\n","March 24","false","30.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The campaign is well done with some really nice CGI scenes and a good all-round story, nice visuals and game mechanics overall.\n\nHowever, we play Real Time Strategy games nowadays for the multiplayer, which Grey Goo has of course.\n\nA shame then, that the multiplayer portion of Grey Goo is now essentially dead. It started out with a player-base of about 2750 people worldwide on launch. The current average player-base at peak times is now around 70.. 'worldwide'.\n\nThat combined with some MAJOR issues, like the dev's inability to fix multiplayer lag ( which is probably one of the reasons all of the players left ), The crazy price tag ( I mean, I've got 70 hours on record, and I still think it cost too much ) Like, the only other RTS at that price is Starcraft 2.... obviously not going to get grey goo over a storied well looked after series like starcraft for obvious consumer reasons.\n\nOther things like lack of maps ( More are comming aparently ), No replays ( which is being added, aparently ), bad unit balance (as in with one Race, you can win by just spamming the same 2 Tier 1 units, since AOE just cant handle them anymore after the latest "balance update" ) bad tech balance, for example free repairing of expensive aircraft, or extra harvestor armour, or extractor armour... the armour thing should be combined, with one choice being something completely different from the armour and aircraft repair, its an obvious choice every time.\n\nI want to love this game so much, but because of the non-existant player-base and some of the more aformentioned issues, I just cant. I mean, the game is a good as dead, the dev's might as well stop updating and make Grey Goo 2 or something.\n\nA sad "Unable to Recommend" from me.","April 24, 2015","false","97.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

All three factions have unique playstyles, and both the Beta and the Humans are very fun to play as.\n\nI cannot recommend the game, sadly. The later missions where you play as the third faction, the Goo, are absolutely abysmal. The game pits you (as the Goo), against massively fortified Beta positions that periodically send attack forces against you. In any other RTS, or even just playing as the Humans in this one, that could be a pretty fun challenge!\n\nUnfortunately, it's incredibly frustrating as the Goo. Due to their extremely non-traditional economy (resource gathering is done in bursts, there is no base-building or fortification whatsoever, and all units are spawned in small groups by sacrificing "mother" units) and the overall fragility of their units, it becomes less of a fun battle to press through enemy bases and more a tedious slog of setback after setback. It takes a huge amount of time to build an army of any meaningful size with the Goo, and it's all but guaranteed that army will be wiped out within one or two battles.\n\n","February 26","false","10.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I love these classic simple RTS games that don't try to be more than what they are and just realize how good the core mechanics of an RTS are without all the stuff added on top. Also unlike Starcraft which I would call more RTT than RTS this game doesn't ask you to monitor each unit with near perfecion to be effective. It hence truly is an RTS that is an RTS and nothing more when you look at the mechanics at the core of the game.\n\nBut there are these subtile things, the Goo ofcourse being stand out playing unlike anything else and yet they don't deviate to much from the core meaning that they are fun to play, a bit different and bringing in an other dynamic to the game. Looking at the Humans their need for a clever base design and keeping it compact while needing static defence for the base as their mobile units need to defect extractors or be on the asault most of the time. The beta are perhaps the most classic of all the ability to just clunk down a base anywhere gives them great flexibility, but at the same time makes them vuranble to multi front attacks as their static defense relies on units of which you can only have so many.\n\nThe single player campaing is nice and plays well, though some missions need some tweaking specially one of the later beta missions presses you with attacks right away without you getting a chance to even build some basic force. Sure they can be overcome, but could have been done a bit better I say. The cutscenes and stuff are world class without question the animation and art is just stunning and the humans really edge on uncanny vally almost. Such work really adds vallue to the signle player campain.\n\nOveral I would really recomend this game to anyone who likes RTS and specially the ones of yesterday and who think like me that many RTS games from recent times are either to Large and complex or to micro and should be named RTT instead.\n","February 1, 2015","true","9.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The half bake are pages taken from many other games; one example are units hidden in forest are invisble until one of your own units goes into the forest to expose them other wise you can't shoot at them. Its kinda hard to really hide a heavy unit under tree covers this is not LoL hidden in the bushes you know. And the Goo faction have element copy from the alien from Earth series. The UI always been hard to perfection so therefore, Grey Goo UI have some miner design flaws as well.\n\nStory in a RTS o.O oh my, well Grey Goo did above the average RTS story at least its interesting imo. But as it is I cant say Grey Goo was any better in term of game play when compare to other RTS. If I may suggest it would been more fun to see battle last a lot longer, I mean units die in 5-10 sec is not exactly a long battle or much to see. The fact units cant change there main weapon or lact of mode/secondary/option have made it a one shot pony like too many RTS unit design.\n\nThe game dont have much to offers in term new innovation, while the BETA race design should been the human while the human faction looks a bit more on the alien side, and would have fit the BETA more imo. However, the maps, graphics, 3D models, and story elements are all up to date for year 2014 RTS standerd. I rate Grey Goo a good RTS game and can stand on its own with Standerd RTS CORE gameplay. IMO Grey Goo the name is bad and so the bottom line it just ANOTHER RTS with above average Story IMO but still good game. I can't recommend with my PLAY TIME nor I personally will pay more then $5 for it so get the game when its on sale other wise spend in moderation.","October 18, 2015","false","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

At first I was pleased that the three races  seemed to differ in approach to base building more than most games of this nature, that impression vanishes as you realise how linear it is and that the units are just the same thing reskinned for each faction.\nIf you like the resource gather, build base, overwhelm enemy genre then this is ok - but not at the full price.

(on my native 1600x1050 or whatever view)\n\n\nvery slow unless you like the slow pace of this game, like age of empires slow or so. but at least that game has 100 times more diversity of units. usual hording zerging mobbing massing RTS game with the semi standard 200 pop cap. (with no unit cap buildings, so instant 200 cap from the start)\nthe two base factions are very similar.  units aren't very diversified, one anti air, one artillery, one siege breaker, one tank, two scouts, two fliers (except for goo) very slow gameplay. its a different rts game for sure, but not in a good different. i would in no manner ever spend the near $40 full price, maybe if i had a job again the $20 sale price.  you're better off with command and conquer (mods?) and starcraft 2, age of empires, etc.\n\n\n\nyou can't force fire attack on the ground with artillery sometimes (hand of ruk) and other artillery units.  perhaps i was trying to have them fire too close to themselves, but with a lack of 'attack range' other than the useless 'fire range of 400' description, and nothing in the options that i could see (ground control 2 thank you!) enables unit sight lines \ attack lines etc.  i could barely do a thing with the artillery. most useless units in the game unless firing upon static \ idle units.\nany unit should be able to force fire, hence the reason why force fire was ever created i'd imagine.\n\n\nupgrades. oh gods.  this game has 4 upgrades. only 4.   actually its 4 selections of 3 upgrades. for a total of 12. but you can only select 4.  so its still 4 to me.  a nice way of making actual tactical decisions. if they mattered much really.  here's the best part! if you research one upgrade, and decide to choose one of the other 2. you remove that upgrade, to purchase the other upgrade.  but your original upgrade? you'd have to research it ALL OVER AGAIN AND PURCHASE IT if you didn't like the new upgrade.\n\ngameplay. all macro and .1% micro.\nunderbrush \ cover is semi useful. if you could tell where it begins and ends.  sometimes i would put units in a forested area thinking 'oh they're under the cover' whereas in reality they're probably on the border between entering cover and exiting it. thus being fired upon with no enemies under the trees too.\n\nvery hard to tell with the patrol system, it looks like your standard multiple waypoint system, with no way of telling until you actual view the entire patrol path, that yes.   unit does go point A-B-C...Z-A all over again.  it is not shown this way in game.  so example.  make a unit patrol in a triangle.  you would make the patrol waypoints look like /\   <- see how the bottom part of the triangle is missing?  the unit automatically fills that point out as the unit goes from the last point of 'this triangle' across the missing part, back to the beginning.\n\nwould've saved me a lot of time if i could just beta test like i do other games. at least then this review and complaints may be taken into consideration.\n\ni'm just trying to save you $49.99 <- gods is a game never worth this nowadays that i can think of.\n","October 18, 2015","false","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A huge effort has been made here to create a compelling story, with every mission ending with a cut-scene and some of them beginning with one as well. Voice acting during said cutscenes is excellent, and unit voice acting is also pretty decent - you don't hear the same lines every two seconds when giving orders, so that's nice -. On the topic of voices, they actually hired someone to invent a new language for the Beta aliens, and they use it! I can appreciate a company going the extra mile for this kind of thing, even if said aliens switch to English when you're playing them. I'd honestly have liked it more if their whole campaign was subtitled instead, but that's my personal opinion. Soundtrack is also pretty nice and varied.\n\nNow, I have two main issues with the single-player campaign. The first one is that it's pretty short : 3*5 missions isn't much, even if some are challenging enough even on Normal difficulty. The first two missions of a faction are usually some kind of tutorial, so really you get three full-length missions per faction. But when you see the amount of extra work they did for every one of said missions, it' can almost be acceptable. However, they're also quite badly designed as far as actual gameplay is concerned, and that's more problematic. Almost every single mission follows the exact same pattern of : start with very few units and buildings while enemy is already fully developped, rush some early units for defense to repel the constant assaults, then start building a huge army and crush your enemy without encountering much resistance. Objectives aren't particularly varied, they're of the "Destroy every enemy" variety almost all the time with generally one different mission per faction (i.e. the Beta campaign has the only actual siege defense mission). The designers also seem to really like the concept of magically spawning enemy units, which I've always found terrible in RTS games and a proof of designers being unable to create actual difficulty. It's frustrating to face, but it also limits player creativity because you cannot try a bold assault to try and destroy some of the enemy facilities to relieve your main base from the constant assaults for instance. Even worse, sometimes the "magical unit" is an epic unit, which is extremely powerful and is supposed to take 5 whole minutes and a lot of ressources to build. Sometimes the epic enemy unit will spawn even if you've already beaten the player it supposedly belongs to, which is completely stupid.\nThis is sad, because obviously the developer put a lot of work into this campaign... so I have to wonder why they didn't spend a little more resource on the actual design of the missions. It's all in the "exterior" of the campaign, but the meat of it is actually pretty bland and not that interesting once you get to it.\n\nMore on the gameplay : the factions have a very distinct look&feel especially as bases are concerned (or lack of base, for the Goo) so that's very good. However, a LOT of units are extremely similar in every faction, especially ground units (the Goo does not have aerial units, so there's more diversity there). Light tanks are very similar, artillery that fires from long range, etc. Obviously there's going to be some staples, but since units do NOT have any special ability whatsoever (except passive ones, like "attack applies a debuff") armies tend to follow a similar composition all the time. Compare to a game like Earth 2160 (which I'm going to use as example because it's similar on several points, including the aliens with a very distinct playstyle.) where the LC clearly has more manoeuverable units and some very unique weapons (like the electric cannon), but paper-thin units.\n\nAs far as multiplayer is concerned, the first thing you'll notice is that it's dead, with players sometimes waiting up to 20 minutes for a game that has a high chance of being over after your opponent used a cheese strategy. Most people have already abandoned the game at this point due to a combination of imbalance, lags and disconnects (including people abusing disconnects to avoid a loss, and somehow this still isn't patched as of 7th March) as well as performance issues for many people. Also there's neither replay nor observer mode, shocking for a game that pretends to cater to the e-sport crowd. The new balance patch is also terrible with devs using a sledgehammer to destroy half the units instead of trying to carefully balance the game, nerfs everywhere that will make some units and buildings close to unusable (i.e. teleporter). The rarely-used Humans somehow took most of the nerfs for some weird reason.\n\nSkirmishes are terrible and their main "redeeming" quality is that unlike in many other games, the AI does not cheat by getting free resources or building its units twice as fast. That's good because it means less frustration/unfairness, but on the other hand it also means that skirmishes are ridiculously easy even on Hard, especially in a 1v1 setting. We're very far from C&C 3's Brutal AI for instance, that took me many tries to beat. The only other correct point is that "Free for all" is actually implemented correctly, so AIs will not implicitly team up against the player.\nAll of this is just negated by the fact that the skirmish AI sucks terribly and does not pose any challenge whatsoever, no matter the "personality" that you choose for it. In fact, that's why the AI gets tons of free units in the campaigns : because the AI is way too bad to be a threat if it doesn't start with a full base and 10 extractors. This means that there's really no point in playing the skirmish, not as a "preparation" for the multiplayer (which will probably be completely dead soon anyway) and not as a fun game itself. Compare to Stronghold Crusader that also had AIs with different "personalities", but they were actually a challenge. And this game was released more than ten years ago, and was also arguably more complex. There's no reason for such a simple RTS (compared to most of its concurrents) to have such a terrible AI.\nIn fact, the skirmish mode is so boring and uninteresting that the achievement page lists literally 0% of people as having the "Win 100 skirmishes" achievement. No.One. I'm pretty sure back in the days I won way more than 100 skirmishes in C&C Generals for instance, but this game also had better AI, more unit diversity and also much more map diversity.\n\nOverall it's still a somewhat enjoyable game but waaaaaaay overpriced for what it is. If you really like RTSes like I do and are starved for a new game it can be sort of worth buying, but it's still not worth its price and even at 50% the content is light compared to many other games. However it's admittedly a relatively well-polished title : I haven't found a single bug and the game runs fluidly on max settings. (I do have a brand new computer though, and quite a lot of people have had performance issues)\nThis game is not worth its price, the single-player content is weaker than in a lot of games (which are usually much cheaper), lack of replays, observer modes and bad balance means that multiplayer is also going down the drain so if that's your main reason to buy a RTS, you're out of luck with this title.","January 29, 2015","false","30.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The half bake are pages taken from many other games; one example are units hidden in forest are invisble until one of your own units goes into the forest to expose them other wise you can't shoot at them. Its kinda hard to really hide a heavy unit under tree covers this is not LoL hidden in the bushes you know. And the Goo faction have element copy from the alien from Earth series. The UI always been hard to perfection so therefore, Grey Goo UI have some miner design flaws as well.\n\nStory in a RTS o.O oh my, well Grey Goo did above the average RTS story at least its interesting imo. But as it is I cant say Grey Goo was any better in term of game play when compare to other RTS. If I may suggest it would been more fun to see battle last a lot longer, I mean units die in 5-10 sec is not exactly a long battle or much to see. The fact units cant change there main weapon or lact of mode/secondary/option have made it a one shot pony like too many RTS unit design.\n\nThe game dont have much to offers in term new innovation, while the BETA race design should been the human while the human faction looks a bit more on the alien side, and would have fit the BETA more imo. However, the maps, graphics, 3D models, and story elements are all up to date for year 2014 RTS standerd. I rate Grey Goo a good RTS game and can stand on its own with Standerd RTS CORE gameplay. IMO Grey Goo the name is bad and so the bottom line it just ANOTHER RTS with above average Story IMO but still good game. I can't recommend with my PLAY TIME nor I personally will pay more then $5 for it so get the game when its on sale other wise spend in moderation.","October 18, 2015","false","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A huge effort has been made here to create a compelling story, with every mission ending with a cut-scene and some of them beginning with one as well. Voice acting during said cutscenes is excellent, and unit voice acting is also pretty decent - you don't hear the same lines every two seconds when giving orders, so that's nice -. On the topic of voices, they actually hired someone to invent a new language for the Beta aliens, and they use it! I can appreciate a company going the extra mile for this kind of thing, even if said aliens switch to English when you're playing them. I'd honestly have liked it more if their whole campaign was subtitled instead, but that's my personal opinion. Soundtrack is also pretty nice and varied.\n\nNow, I have two main issues with the single-player campaign. The first one is that it's pretty short : 3*5 missions isn't much, even if some are challenging enough even on Normal difficulty. The first two missions of a faction are usually some kind of tutorial, so really you get three full-length missions per faction. But when you see the amount of extra work they did for every one of said missions, it' can almost be acceptable. However, they're also quite badly designed as far as actual gameplay is concerned, and that's more problematic. Almost every single mission follows the exact same pattern of : start with very few units and buildings while enemy is already fully developped, rush some early units for defense to repel the constant assaults, then start building a huge army and crush your enemy without encountering much resistance. Objectives aren't particularly varied, they're of the "Destroy every enemy" variety almost all the time with generally one different mission per faction (i.e. the Beta campaign has the only actual siege defense mission). The designers also seem to really like the concept of magically spawning enemy units, which I've always found terrible in RTS games and a proof of designers being unable to create actual difficulty. It's frustrating to face, but it also limits player creativity because you cannot try a bold assault to try and destroy some of the enemy facilities to relieve your main base from the constant assaults for instance. Even worse, sometimes the "magical unit" is an epic unit, which is extremely powerful and is supposed to take 5 whole minutes and a lot of ressources to build. Sometimes the epic enemy unit will spawn even if you've already beaten the player it supposedly belongs to, which is completely stupid.\nThis is sad, because obviously the developer put a lot of work into this campaign... so I have to wonder why they didn't spend a little more resource on the actual design of the missions. It's all in the "exterior" of the campaign, but the meat of it is actually pretty bland and not that interesting once you get to it.\n\nMore on the gameplay : the factions have a very distinct look&feel especially as bases are concerned (or lack of base, for the Goo) so that's very good. However, a LOT of units are extremely similar in every faction, especially ground units (the Goo does not have aerial units, so there's more diversity there). Light tanks are very similar, artillery that fires from long range, etc. Obviously there's going to be some staples, but since units do NOT have any special ability whatsoever (except passive ones, like "attack applies a debuff") armies tend to follow a similar composition all the time. Compare to a game like Earth 2160 (which I'm going to use as example because it's similar on several points, including the aliens with a very distinct playstyle.) where the LC clearly has more manoeuverable units and some very unique weapons (like the electric cannon), but paper-thin units.\n\nAs far as multiplayer is concerned, the first thing you'll notice is that it's dead, with players sometimes waiting up to 20 minutes for a game that has a high chance of being over after your opponent used a cheese strategy. Most people have already abandoned the game at this point due to a combination of imbalance, lags and disconnects (including people abusing disconnects to avoid a loss, and somehow this still isn't patched as of 7th March) as well as performance issues for many people. Also there's neither replay nor observer mode, shocking for a game that pretends to cater to the e-sport crowd. The new balance patch is also terrible with devs using a sledgehammer to destroy half the units instead of trying to carefully balance the game, nerfs everywhere that will make some units and buildings close to unusable (i.e. teleporter). The rarely-used Humans somehow took most of the nerfs for some weird reason.\n\nSkirmishes are terrible and their main "redeeming" quality is that unlike in many other games, the AI does not cheat by getting free resources or building its units twice as fast. That's good because it means less frustration/unfairness, but on the other hand it also means that skirmishes are ridiculously easy even on Hard, especially in a 1v1 setting. We're very far from C&C 3's Brutal AI for instance, that took me many tries to beat. The only other correct point is that "Free for all" is actually implemented correctly, so AIs will not implicitly team up against the player.\nAll of this is just negated by the fact that the skirmish AI sucks terribly and does not pose any challenge whatsoever, no matter the "personality" that you choose for it. In fact, that's why the AI gets tons of free units in the campaigns : because the AI is way too bad to be a threat if it doesn't start with a full base and 10 extractors. This means that there's really no point in playing the skirmish, not as a "preparation" for the multiplayer (which will probably be completely dead soon anyway) and not as a fun game itself. Compare to Stronghold Crusader that also had AIs with different "personalities", but they were actually a challenge. And this game was released more than ten years ago, and was also arguably more complex. There's no reason for such a simple RTS (compared to most of its concurrents) to have such a terrible AI.\nIn fact, the skirmish mode is so boring and uninteresting that the achievement page lists literally 0% of people as having the "Win 100 skirmishes" achievement. No.One. I'm pretty sure back in the days I won way more than 100 skirmishes in C&C Generals for instance, but this game also had better AI, more unit diversity and also much more map diversity.\n\nOverall it's still a somewhat enjoyable game but waaaaaaay overpriced for what it is. If you really like RTSes like I do and are starved for a new game it can be sort of worth buying, but it's still not worth its price and even at 50% the content is light compared to many other games. However it's admittedly a relatively well-polished title : I haven't found a single bug and the game runs fluidly on max settings. (I do have a brand new computer though, and quite a lot of people have had performance issues)\nThis game is not worth its price, the single-player content is weaker than in a lot of games (which are usually much cheaper), lack of replays, observer modes and bad balance means that multiplayer is also going down the drain so if that's your main reason to buy a RTS, you're out of luck with this title.","January 29, 2015","false","30.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(on my native 1600x1050 or whatever view)\n\n\nvery slow unless you like the slow pace of this game, like age of empires slow or so. but at least that game has 100 times more diversity of units. usual hording zerging mobbing massing RTS game with the semi standard 200 pop cap. (with no unit cap buildings, so instant 200 cap from the start)\nthe two base factions are very similar.  units aren't very diversified, one anti air, one artillery, one siege breaker, one tank, two scouts, two fliers (except for goo) very slow gameplay. its a different rts game for sure, but not in a good different. i would in no manner ever spend the near $40 full price, maybe if i had a job again the $20 sale price.  you're better off with command and conquer (mods?) and starcraft 2, age of empires, etc.\n\n\n\nyou can't force fire attack on the ground with artillery sometimes (hand of ruk) and other artillery units.  perhaps i was trying to have them fire too close to themselves, but with a lack of 'attack range' other than the useless 'fire range of 400' description, and nothing in the options that i could see (ground control 2 thank you!) enables unit sight lines \ attack lines etc.  i could barely do a thing with the artillery. most useless units in the game unless firing upon static \ idle units.\nany unit should be able to force fire, hence the reason why force fire was ever created i'd imagine.\n\n\nupgrades. oh gods.  this game has 4 upgrades. only 4.   actually its 4 selections of 3 upgrades. for a total of 12. but you can only select 4.  so its still 4 to me.  a nice way of making actual tactical decisions. if they mattered much really.  here's the best part! if you research one upgrade, and decide to choose one of the other 2. you remove that upgrade, to purchase the other upgrade.  but your original upgrade? you'd have to research it ALL OVER AGAIN AND PURCHASE IT if you didn't like the new upgrade.\n\ngameplay. all macro and .1% micro.\nunderbrush \ cover is semi useful. if you could tell where it begins and ends.  sometimes i would put units in a forested area thinking 'oh they're under the cover' whereas in reality they're probably on the border between entering cover and exiting it. thus being fired upon with no enemies under the trees too.\n\nvery hard to tell with the patrol system, it looks like your standard multiple waypoint system, with no way of telling until you actual view the entire patrol path, that yes.   unit does go point A-B-C...Z-A all over again.  it is not shown this way in game.  so example.  make a unit patrol in a triangle.  you would make the patrol waypoints look like /\   <- see how the bottom part of the triangle is missing?  the unit automatically fills that point out as the unit goes from the last point of 'this triangle' across the missing part, back to the beginning.\n\nwould've saved me a lot of time if i could just beta test like i do other games. at least then this review and complaints may be taken into consideration.\n\ni'm just trying to save you $49.99 <- gods is a game never worth this nowadays that i can think of.\n","October 18, 2015","false","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I love base building RTS games, and this one brings back some aspects of the classics. The Beta's walls were a huge draw for me since I love defensive style and miss the walls of Age of Empires. The Beta and Humans are fairly typical races and not much different from what you'd see in Starcraft. The Goo are unique in their mobility.\n*Tip* There are only 16 levels in the main campaign. Do them on hard the first time around and you'll get your play time out of them.\nThe main downside of this game is the lack of player base for multiplayer. I'll keep waiting in queues for now, but when they're 10+min long it gets too much.

However, it may not be the best game for you.\n\nPros:\n-Graphics\n-Stock maps are good\n-Campaign is comprehensive tutorial wise (since that's really all it is)\n-Hard difficulty campaign is still a challenge however\n-Balance is pretty good\n-Relatively new, updates are quite likely\n\nCons:\n-Relatively new and non-mainstream\n-As such, playerbase isn't all that huge\n-Some tech choices are objectively better or worse\n-Low map variety\n-AI is predictable and very bad at mid-late game\n\nAnd now, there are a couple of key traits to this game that you might see as pros or cons, depending on how you like your RTS's.\n-Emphasis on map control and positioning over build path and micromanagement\n-Units are fairly parralell between races\n-Resource collection is automatic once you have the building done\n-Expanding is key to passing early game eco, and takes a lot of skill to do well\n-Units are fairly weak on their own\n-Buildings hold up well against early game rushes\n-Brush mechanics\n\nTL;DR:\nLess micromanagement, more map control awareness.  It's lacking in maps, though it's very new and we can likely expect more.  8.75/10 from me, but it may or may not be your cup of tea personally.\n$50 is steep, check out some people playing the game to make sure or wait until it goes on sale.\n\nAlso the humans are fantastically british.","April 9, 2015","true","66.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes they are labeled but would it be easier to put AT not "Strong against armoured units".\n\nlike rock paper scissors:\n\nInfantry>AT\nTank> infantry\nAT>Tank\n\nEverything should be easy to counter, but the tanks are the most powerful unit by far. And the so called "AT" classes can barely fight against tanks. This game does not have a very good "Oh he's building air well then I'll build AA and Tank" or "He's building tank infantry?

I'm Gold in that game, and most games are about throwing large armies against each other. (Don't get me wrong, I love SC2) In Grey Goo, battles feel longer, and I can control small raids against enemies thanks to an easier economy. One thing I suggest if you try multiplayer, don't try to build Epics every game! They are situational, used to finish a game in a fun way.\n\nThe campaign, despite being short, is good. You play 5 missions as the Beta, the Humans and the Goo respectively, for a total of 15. The atmosphere is better than in SC2 in my opinion, but due to the length, you cannot get immersed enough in the story. Some events might be familiar for those who have played SC.\n\nOverall, at release, it was an overpriced decent game. Now, even if it wasn't on sale, I would still say it is worth the money.

However, a lot of the time you will find your units shooting a stray wall post instead of attacking the enemy pelting them two feet behind them.  For a game who's goal was to not be the "twitch APM" style of game that StarCraft is, your army often requires a LOT of babysitting to be effective.\n\nWhile it is true you don't have to micromanage your base much, I feel like there are a few inherently broken things.  When attacking, especially if there are walls, your units like to clump up to shoot the wall post they could just walk past and become perfect artillery bait...  And even a single artillery unit can annihalate your light troops.  It doesn't help that the AI -always- has artillery pre-placed in perfect "gotcha" positions.  Brush also seems to be a problem.  The AI seems to have issues when being shot at by something.  In most RTS games, if a unit gets shot at from something outside its range it will still attempt to engage so it doesn't just die in vain.  In Grey Goo they just... stand there.  Same for things attacking them from inside brush.  The game notifies you they're under attack.  But they just stand there dumbfounded as lasers rip them apart from inside the woods because they can't see the unit inside unless they move into the brush as well, or have a detector with them.\n\nI have found that playing through the campaign requires several restarts until you find the "perfect" build order.  Mistakes are punished hard as the AI with all of their already completed and entrenched positions vs you starting with literally nothing means you have no breathing room what so ever.  The maps, however, are small for the most part so restarting usually isn't that bad unless you fail right at the end.  Also many of them are snaked with frustrating impassible terrain that can make fighting the grey goo a frustrating lesson in chase the mothers around the map since they can freely cross terrain that is impassible to the other races and are constantly spawning more mothers.\n\nThose issues aside though, I still mostly have fun with it.  I'm not even sure why.  I'm definitly not a pro RTS player and I've even had to just stop playing several times after having to restart the same mission three or four times in a row because I'm not playing the game at the pace the AI wants me to play so I wind up with auto-loss when it assaults required mission objectives before I'm anywhere near ready to defend them.  Maybe it's just because I don't want to lose and keep coming back just to beat it...  I think maybe if I can break out of the Supreme Commander mindset and learn that the campaign triggers aren't going to wait for me like Supreme Commander's do and I'll do better.  Or maybe I'm just easily amused by the pretty particle effects and animations, but despite all of the game's weaknesses I don't hate it.","February 4, 2015","true","12.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At first, I felt the simplistic build order would dull the game, after the first few rounds, I realized the it gave me more time to concentrate on my strategy.  I really enjoy the fact that there are multiple way in which to win each map.  The AI is also good at changing things up each time you play it.

There are some definite pros and cons to this game.\n\nI know it is still early in its development so I will be gentle. I will admit that I have not researched this game a whole lot but I have always been a fan of RTS games and purchase them all of the time. As far as RTS games are concerned this one is a pretty game. The movies/cut screens are pretty solid. Game loading time is okay. It runs pretty smooth in the beginning but can get a little laggy towards the end.\n\nOverall the biggest issues I have are the current price of $50. In its current state this is far from a $50 game for what you get in return. Personally I like the human faction and to only get 10 units to pick from and only be able to build almost as many structures is a little boring to say the least. Sure I have tinkered with the other 2 factions but I am sticking to humans as that is my game style. When running the campaign it would be nice to be able to select which faction you would like to play for. It starts you off with the Beta faction. I am not sure what happens past that as I have not gotten that far yet.\n\nOver all, it is safe to say that this is a good game but it is definitely lacking in some areas and it is not a $50 game. I am hoping that the money that we spend on it will be used to add new content as time goes on and if we are charged for that content it will be extremely disappointing.","February 4, 2015","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After much fumbling around as the game was 'out of range' for my monitor and contacting customer support (which is great by the way), I was able to play the game. Unsurprisingly, what I wanted was what I got. I've put about ~16 hours into the game so far, and have enjoyed the vast majority of the campaigns so far. The final mission in the Beta campaign is a real ♥♥♥♥♥ to complete, but is possible. Aside from this, I have been doing a lot of silly stuff in the skirmish mode, for example using mother goo to consume entire enemy bases, but yet again, have had a lot of fun doing so. I have not encountered any bugs or problems so far, although the game occasionally crashes (on average one every six hours, so not too bad). However, the campaign does get a little bit 'samey' as most of it is 'Destroy all the enemies', although this is to be expected.Finally, I really enjoy the cutscenes, as they are top quality, and are basically the line between CGI and greenscreened cutscenes, as they are really that good.\n\nIn conclusion, I find this game very enjoyable so far, and reccomend it to anyone who wants a slower paced RTS with an excellent storyline and top notch cutscenes. I say this game is very goo'd and give it a 8 / 10 For asymmetry, interesting story and brilliant customer service.","February 6, 2015","true","18.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I did have some fun going through some matches, but ultimately don't anticipate this will remain in my library for long. Specifics thoughts:\n\n-Nice keyboard shortcut scheme. You select the building or unit type with QWER+ and then it brings up a new set of choices, again QWER+ and then a final menu. So, if you need a certain unit you very quickly realize you can do EQQ or whatever... but, the game does lack some expected commands. Can't pause at any point or change the game speed, no select all units, couldn't figure out how to bring up FPS, etc.\n\n-Has a neat cover system where you can hide in a forest and fire from it w/o being targeted... but, there's few areas on the maps and they are too large. They should've been more liberal with the placement of cover and included some smaller one-unit areas. Some other games I can recall have done this maybe a bit better.\n\n-The two human/alien races are a bit too similar. Props to them for making the Goo race work very differently, though. I feel they put all their risk in this one race and played the rest of the game too conservatively.\n\n-The units within those races are a bit too similar. For example, it's very obvious in a game like StarCraft how a marine, siege tank, and hellion are different. No questions about strengths and even confusing unit types. In this game, the units tend to run together once in a category. There are a few exceptions, air units and artillery are definitely different, but I found the units overall a bit bland.\n\n-The tech is pretty cool. You have 4 tech choices each with 3 options. Once you commit to an option within those choices (eg, Tech granting Anti-Air unit ground attacks as well) you can't pick the other 2. Was easy enough to manage from the interface and understand what each bonus was. I tended to pick the same bonuses game to game, unsure if that was play style or simply balance problems but would have to play more to know for sure.\n\n-Framerate / slowdowns - Toward the end of a longer game, the game 'stutters' while trying to compensate for what I think is low framerates (can't pull it up to determine, though). Could be network? Hard to say what it was, but I've got a solid connection and a solid i7 w/ GTX 960 and graphics actually mostly turned down.\n\n-Building placement all have to be part of your initial set of root structures (either your HQ or hubs if you're playing Beta). They went for a smaller singular base as a game decision, okay that works. However, it is not elegantly done. Some of the ways attachments work early on (you have to attach a Tank module to a factory to allow you to build tanks) make it easy for new players to make mistakes and build useless modules. In addition, it was a bit buggy when selling structures, I'd sometimes cut power off to half my base. Okay, that's a feature, let me rebuild it to connect power again. Nope. Guess it is a bug, but ran into a few times where visually I should have power but half my buildings wouldn't.\n\nAll in all, for a 60% off steam sale this reminded me of the heyday of RTS fifteen years ago where I'd pick up a new game in the summer and nine out of ten times would see it fall flat, just as this one has.\n","June 16, 2015","false","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

It's core concepts, from everything to it's delicate unit models, to it's gorgeous cutscenes, and it's amazing soundtrack make it a 'good' game. The unit models are unique and creative, every aesthetic of Grey Goo from it's units to it's structures and walls, make me want to play this game. However, the only thing that is great about this game is it's aesthetic and soundtrack. Grey Goo has beautiful music, and a fantastic Sci-Fi setting, with cutscenes that allow us to get into it's wonderful world. But the aesthetic is all this game is, and it's gameplay gets old very fast. Everything that involves gameplay is somewhat lacking, greatly.\n\nPerformance has improved since then, but the abundant players that once played are now nearly gone. The Singleplayer is one hell of a ride, the Beta missions were done absolutely perfectly although it had a few flaws. The Human and Goo missions soured the singleplayer for me, as I was treated with an escort mission and stealth missions. While stealth missions aren't too bad, the reason why it's so bad is because of the lack of unit variety. I wouldn't complain if we had some stealth units, but we don't, and we're forced to watch the A.I. do some patrol paths for several minutes.  It's also incredibly frustrating because the devs have ripped the 'micro potential' in this game. A RTS game, where army control 'should' be crucial, but having very VERY limited units in a stealth mission in a game where micro potential is thrown out the window? Yeah, that doesn't mesh well. The human escort mission wouldn't be too bad if the Goo weren't able to traverse and hide everywhere, or if their anti-air units weren't so powerful. That being said, the Beta Missions are the only great part of the campaign.\n\nThe hotkey system is absolutely terrible for an RTS. While critics like Total Biscuit claimed that it was innovative, hotkeys begin to feel less like shortcuts and more like a mess. I don't play Dota2, or League of Legends, I don't play Mobas, I play RTS games, so of course I'm going to end up fighting against this game's hotkey system. It's a bit hard to get used to the first time, and I didn't care to learn it. It would have been 'innovative' if these hotkeys were customizable, right? But they aren't, you're forced to learn this terrible hotkey system, and if you play RTS games, that is something you can't get used to. I would love it if it were a customizable hotkey system, so that I could use my 'own' shortcuts.\n\nThe unit variety is incredibly lacking and the only difference between units is their stats, really. They all play the same and it gets boring, fast. The only time units have variety and identity is in the early game with the commando/sentinel/drover units. The three unit concepts are great, and they all feel different and act differently, but when you realize that t1 is easily outclassed by t2 tank spam and/or artillery, you stop seeing this kind of variety. Every t2-t3 unit acts almost exactly the same! The three races don't have their own unique equivalents to tanks or artillery, and most of the time they just play the same. All tanks and siege units pretty much fight the same way, they are all slow, can't traverse terrain, etc. We don't get speedy, fast ground units, like in sc2 or CnC, that could deal damage and harass effectively. We don't have stealthed units or sabeoteur types, infantry is nearly nonexistent, and there are no activated unit abilities. Every unit in the game has this very slow turn radius, and act at very VERY slow speeds. Because of this, you're more inclined to clump armies, rather than to spread them out if you're under attack from artillery/air, or you need a surround. Also, there are no support units with special abilities, like the ability to repair or heal friendly units. There are no abilities that can turn the tides of a match or make anything interesting. All units will also focus-fire targets instead of picking their own, which makes micro frustrating. Units that are told to attack move somehow gain 10x the mass they had before, and push each other into enemy fire, instead of attacking the closest unit. Not only that units will always target the one with the lowest health, and will follow that unit until it finishes the job or it's dead. So if you just attack move, and the guy moves that low hp unit out of the way, YOUR ENTIRE ARMY WILL CHASE IT.\n\nThe units being able to hide in forests/trees/shrubs is the only thing that's innovative about this game. Most of it's concepts are 'dumbed' down from the RTS genres. Rushing has been pretty much nerfed, there are no support units, casters, healing units, or even stealthed units. It's upgrade system is incredibly lacking in terms of an RTS, they give 'passive' abilities, which barely makes up for the game's lack in unit variety. What's even worse is that each upgrade takes almost forever to get out, I believe one upgrade was 2minutes long. This makes timing pushes kind of pointless, and the builds in this game really boil down to who gets the most refineries up first.\n\nFor $50 this game is seriously not worth the price. There is so much lacking in unit variety, that it's laughable. Units are what you get to sell players your game, and we all get 10 units that play and act the same. There's no support units, casters, or stealth units, the Singleplayer is about 15 missions, unit upgrades are lackluster and just lazy. The hotkey system is something that RTS gamers will have extensive trouble learning, and even with Epic Units (the game's selling point) they are completely boring compared to CnC Kane's Wrath's Marv, Hexapod, and Redeemer. Many players have stayed away simply because of this game's high price tag, and you know what? Stay away. I feel like I was ripped off.","April 16, 2015","false","57.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

It's easy to get lost in a "oh god no slow RTS of this kind Red Alert 3" mindset, but that immediatly sprawls doubt into my mind - while it's immediatly visible that this was made by people who worked on great games before, why did they have so much trouble with making unit control good? I mean... it's hard to explain.\n\nFor example, in C&C3 and RA3, I could send 16 bombers on 16 different targets in 20 seconds. Here, it's nigh impossible to micro like that. All units of one type are bunched up in the selection box, and even the control is pretty basic. Attack move, hold ground, guard, that's it. There are no abilities. The strategy is limited to "bunch up 200/200 units and A-move" or "get artillery and slowpush every single inch". Even economy was automated almost to the point of not existing, and micro is... almost discouraged.\n\nEven the units don't do many different things. Just build 1 type from each category + some artillery and you're golden, maybe some AA but only after they've revealed they have aircraft. Anti-armour from light units, tank from heavy units, and a fighter from flying.\n\nEpics are more interesting, but... they're tad too powerful. Place an Alpha in a chokepoint, nothing will ever get through. Two Hand of Ruks are capable of killing a stream of thousands of Goo. Etc. It's really hard to kill an epic unit once it's out. No amount of strategy available will save you if they have support. Hand of Ruk can easly decimate 200/200 of units. And in the campaign, oh god, when you face epic units of Humans and Beta, it's always on a map with many, many chokepoints and narrow fields. It's impossible to position against AoE\n\nThe build menu is good. It's basicly what was in C&C3, but with less hotkeys. The idea of the tech tree is pretty interesting. You get to pick 1 out of 3 upgrades, however some are just straight up better than others. That effectively limits the tech tree significantly, as usually most people will always pick the same upgrades.\n\nI can't get my thoughts straight. So I'll tl;dr - it's the same type of a game as C&C3, but inferior in gameplay mechanics and campaign. Doesn't mean it's bad. It's a good. But not good enough. It's clusmy. It's basic. It performs badly.\n\nEdit: upgraded my PC to the best I could. Second most powerful 980GTX and a new CPU. Game still runs like crap.","March 7, 2015","false","15.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I dont write reviews much but there is a diamond in the rough if the devs could see the potential.\n\nSlow paced RTS, computer on easy will knok on your front door before your base gets structured enough to defend yourself (like a zerg rush but with guns) once you kill 1 there will be another to follow within 5 to 10 sec.\n\nNot an intuitave game and the base structure is simplistic which leavs me the feeling that I only have a few options making a skirmish feel like a pre written war novel...long, painful and everyone dies.\n\nPros;\nGreat grapics\nCreative races\nStory mode (Did'nt get enough time to explore it much)\nFluid framerate (even at 4x superscale)\n\nCons:\nSlow inital base developement\n\nWeak base (lowest rung) fighters that take way to long to build/create. In SC a zerg rush can be stopped by marines or protoss infantry if played correctly\n\nGame Mechanics - for being a simple tree structure It was too difficult to well develope your army (balancing of time/resources required)\n\nBalancing - While the idea was creative and interesting It really makes the impression that the focus was put into the story rather than the skirmishes. If you want a RTS to live forever (like SC original) make the multiplayer aspect shine. No one plays the story for years and years. if this game was built around a multiplayer community that could mod and contribute to the final product then even with the flaws mentioned above it would go toe to toe with the best of the best because the gamers would be driving the game aspects not just reading it page after painful page.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nI won't pay for it untill it gets a community driven feel. cheapen and hasten lowest rung fighters to allow for epic infantry battles that start early and persist untill you develope higher teir fighters (cost of lowest teir should be less than 1/2 that of the next highest). Simple base structures should be quicker and use less resources to make. bigger maps with community developed maps supported. dedicated customizeable servers with an ingame browser would get the community to a religious following.\n\nI think it can be great but that will depend on the devs ability to let go a bit.","October 16, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

C'mon...."\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, and the CGI is eye-popping since WETA Workshop was in charge.  Even so, there were a few times I ran into graphical bugs.  One of them was rather severe, as parts of my goo-soldiers reached up into the "sky" where my face was to obscure my vision.  This vibe of "quality, but...."  is pretty pervasive throughout the game.\n\nThe story isn't particularly special, but perfectly serviceable for a game like this.  The few characters are two-dimensional.  My problem was its sloppy deliverance.  You feel as though you arrive 20% of the way into the story, and the back-lore presented later is surprisingly barren.  Given the basically non-existent ending, I get the feeling they're hoping to flesh a lot of things out in future installments.\n\nThere are three races to play.  Architecture is modular for the Humans and the Beta.  Although the Humans can teleport their buildings to elsewhere on their grid network, and in spite of the wonderful visual differences between the two styles, they are nonetheless painfully similar to each other.  The Goo is a marked difference, with no buildings whatsoever.  It simply partitions itself when it's gathered enough resources.\n\nThe UI is kind of terrible.  While it's been simplified for the purpose of building structures and units, there is a bewildering number of hotkeys in the game because the developers just couldn't be bothered.  Every unit has basic functions like patrolling or attacking the ground, but they don't exist on the UI.  If you don't remember the hotkeys, you have to go into the ESC menu.\n\nThe building rotation feature is absolutely terrible.  Beta structures have individual power hubs that you place and build off of, and while the feature of "a blocked building" is appreciated, once you let go of the rotation key it places the building.  A lot of times there are simply bad spots no matter what way you rotate, and you are forced to place the design and then delete it, rather than simply taking your hand off the key.\n\nAlso, I have to complain about the Human's Large Factory.  In order to build their epic unit (or simply attach all four of the tech hubs), in theory you just need to lead a power conduit to the rear of the structure.  This doesn't happen though, because the Human snap-to grid is awful, and automatically attaches the structure by its SIDE to the conduit, obscuring one of the tech hub slots.  Rotation of the building does NOT FIX THIS.  What this means is you have to build a grid, place the building, build more grid around the back, and then DELETE other parts of the conduit.  That's about as inefficient as it could possibly be.\n\nThe game also didn't really try with tutorials (or they simply didn't hold your hand).  Normally I'd be fine with that, and anyone with RTS experience will figure most of it out anyway, but an option to review tips would have been nice.  Once, I clicked a tutorial of the Epic unit I had to build for the Beta, but had other concerns at the time (the game has NO PAUSE BUTTON), so I had to click it away.  It then disappeared.  Permanently.  I had to look up on the internet exactly how the structure was built, because the game's "Encyclopedia" didn't want to tell me.\n\nThere are no hero units.  Units themselves are varied and have particular traits, but these are limited mostly to ranges and ground and/or air capabilities.  They have no abilities, however, and this severely limits the depth of the game.  Whoever has the most guys wins.\n\nFor the tech trees, you get to pick 4 of 12 upgrades.  That's it.  And you can't pick two in the same category.  At least some of these techs are shared between the races.  You do get the ability to unlearn a tech and learn another one in its category, but really?  FOUR TECHS?\n\nThe environmental details bring a little more strategy to the game.  Elevation matters in terms of visibility.  There are small forests of cover for units to hide in, though I imagine that against a human player, those are going to be the first places checked.  You can build actual WALLS in the game instead of just turrets.  The Goo can scale impossible cliffs in their gelatinous form, and for any race, tapping into another resource pool does not require a "Town Hall" type of structure.\n\nThe AI is a little shoddy.  I've had enemy units wander pretty close to my own and go by unassailed, and my units have done the same.  I never used the patrol function, so maybe that has something to do with it. Basically all campaign missions feel heavily scripted rather than intelligent.  In any case, the AI is exploitable, but really, how intelligent did it have to be when the game is about throwing endless units at a problem?\n\nOh, I almost forgot --- lots of people complain the game is difficult.  I have concluded these are probably teenagers or young twenty-somethings who never played any of the old RTS games.  By no stretch of the imagination is the game hard on the middle setting, though there are a few missions which are trial and error.  Those particular missions should have had better coordination and presentation of information, but by no means is the game "hard".\n\nOverall, the game is a solid quick-fix for RTS fans, with really nice production value, even if the mechanics should have been so much more than they were.  Specifically hard stopping the story so they could lead it into a sequel was not appreciated.  The game itself is about 16 hours or so, and that's with several restarts of certain missions.  Overall it's fun, but it won't inspire you to dump tons of hours into it.","October 18, 2015","true","15.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has the same feel, but is different enough to keep you interested. The story is intriguing, characters are fairly compelling, and the goo faction is especially unusual and requires thinking outside the typical RTS mindbox.","October 21, 2015","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matthawke/recommended/290790/","matthawke","MattHawke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matthawke/","45 products in account","I picked this up during the summer steam sale and while it does have some nice qualities, overall I feel it is lacking in depth, expected RTS features, and overall seems a bit risk averse to give it staying power. I did have some fun going through some matches, but ultimately don't anticipate this will remain in my library for long. Specifics thoughts:\n\n-Nice keyboard shortcut scheme. You select the building or unit type with QWER+ and then it brings up a new set of choices, again QWER+ and then a final menu. So, if you need a certain unit you very quickly realize you can do EQQ or whatever... but, the game does lack some expected commands. Can't pause at any point or change the game speed, no select all units, couldn't figure out how to bring up FPS, etc.\n\n-Has a neat cover system where you can hide in a forest and fire from it w/o being targeted... but, there's few areas on the maps and they are too large. They should've been more liberal with the placement of cover and included some smaller one-unit areas. Some other games I can recall have done this maybe a bit better.\n\n-The two human/alien races are a bit too similar. Props to them for making the Goo race work very differently, though. I feel they put all their risk in this one race and played the rest of the game too conservatively.\n\n-The units within those races are a bit too similar. For example, it's very obvious in a game like StarCraft how a marine, siege tank, and hellion are different. No questions about strengths and even confusing unit types. In this game, the units tend to run together once in a category. There are a few exceptions, air units and artillery are definitely different, but I found the units overall a bit bland.\n\n-The tech is pretty cool. You have 4 tech choices each with 3 options. Once you commit to an option within those choices (eg, Tech granting Anti-Air unit ground attacks as well) you can't pick the other 2. Was easy enough to manage from the interface and understand what each bonus was. I tended to pick the same bonuses game to game, unsure if that was play style or simply balance problems but would have to play more to know for sure.\n\n-Framerate / slowdowns - Toward the end of a longer game, the game 'stutters' while trying to compensate for what I think is low framerates (can't pull it up to determine, though). Could be network? Hard to say what it was, but I've got a solid connection and a solid i7 w/ GTX 960 and graphics actually mostly turned down.\n\n-Building placement all have to be part of your initial set of root structures (either your HQ or hubs if you're playing Beta). They went for a smaller singular base as a game decision, okay that works. However, it is not elegantly done. Some of the ways attachments work early on (you have to attach a Tank module to a factory to allow you to build tanks) make it easy for new players to make mistakes and build useless modules. In addition, it was a bit buggy when selling structures, I'd sometimes cut power off to half my base. Okay, that's a feature, let me rebuild it to connect power again. Nope. Guess it is a bug, but ran into a few times where visually I should have power but half my buildings wouldn't.\n\nAll in all, for a 60% off steam sale this reminded me of the heyday of RTS fifteen years ago where I'd pick up a new game in the summer and nine out of ten times would see it fall flat, just as this one has.\n","June 16, 2015","false","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

I'm Gold in that game, and most games are about throwing large armies against each other. (Don't get me wrong, I love SC2) In Grey Goo, battles feel longer, and I can control small raids against enemies thanks to an easier economy. One thing I suggest if you try multiplayer, don't try to build Epics every game! They are situational, used to finish a game in a fun way.\n\nThe campaign, despite being short, is good. You play 5 missions as the Beta, the Humans and the Goo respectively, for a total of 15. The atmosphere is better than in SC2 in my opinion, but due to the length, you cannot get immersed enough in the story. Some events might be familiar for those who have played SC.\n\nOverall, at release, it was an overpriced decent game. Now, even if it wasn't on sale, I would still say it is worth the money.

For the very short period I got to try this game, in over all I liked it. Over all gameplay was great. The importance of economy is something I missed in rts-games, yet it wasn't taken too far. Unit building and upgrading is what you could expect from rts-game. The units themselve were mostly usual, one is strong against one type of enemy and weak against other. What I missed in units, were better artillery units. What I got to experience felt like the artillery units had way too small range to be usefull. I tired using stealth units to increase the range but it still felt, that artillery game style wasn't available.\n\nThe most dissapointing thing in the whole game was, that the beta race had at the beginning cutscene their own language, which they spoke. But in the actual game play they spoke english. Now this broke the immersion immediately. Here I had my hopes up, that this game would have done things differently but I was once again denied this. This is kind of the breaking point, why I personaly most likely wont buy this game, atleast for the time being.\n\nNot much  more I can say about the actual game, since I only got to try it for the first 3 campaing missions. This game is better than most of the rts-games available. There are couple gameplay mechanics I would like to see in this game, like better unit control like in SupCom.\n\nIs this game worth 45,99€. For me no. It couldn't sell itslef to me in 18,39€, therefore it would have to do much more to be worth 45,99€. If the beta race would have spoken their own language, I would have bought this game, but now it just feels odd to hear them speaking english.","October 19, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Lush, diverse environments, very well thought out maps, a short story but the landscape tells enough to strech it out, no sloppy excuses to wage war here.\n\nBASE BUILDING\nEach race has it's own unique building format allowing for a completely dfferent play style in base building, be it dispersed, centralised or deadly mobile baby belching carnage.\n\nUNITS\nThe one down fall this game may have is it's units diversity. Each race can build a max of 200 and although each unit may look different each approach is very similar, you have several sets of upgradable abilities that are revesable / interchangable. In this game no unit has it's own micromanagement bar the epic, it comes down to your ability to control the sway of war not how quick you can bash a spell button.\n\nMAP EDITOR\nThe map editor is second to none, this is where the game really shines. Build the ultimate skirmish map or even deisgn your own campaign with almost no limits. Such a varied and vibrant world, you can even import your own prefabs and textures and dish out a decent set of instructions to your AI factions. though the editor does not come without a few minor bugs., well... just. SAVE OFTEN..lol\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nAs yet i have not dealt with the multiplayer side of things bar the map making. I have heard it was randomly crashing though from what i read grey goo has been fixing/fixed the issue, they run tournaments for cash say $75000 to win? so issues can't be to prolific. The fan base is growing so you should expect more and more to log in for war, at present the online number can be a little low from what i hear.\n\nThis game has come from a few of the ppl from Westwood before EA fked it, so it will have some old school feel n appeal for some.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n( i got it on sale via the free weekend )","October 24, 2015","true","80.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are 3 factions: Beta, Humans, and Goo. The Beta are really the only ones worth while. The goo you have to seek and destroy on the map and they can be quite dodgy, so thats a bit annoying considering it isn't likely that a patch of goo could turn the tides of war.

For the very short period I got to try this game, in over all I liked it. Over all gameplay was great. The importance of economy is something I missed in rts-games, yet it wasn't taken too far. Unit building and upgrading is what you could expect from rts-game. The units themselve were mostly usual, one is strong against one type of enemy and weak against other. What I missed in units, were better artillery units. What I got to experience felt like the artillery units had way too small range to be usefull. I tired using stealth units to increase the range but it still felt, that artillery game style wasn't available.\n\nThe most dissapointing thing in the whole game was, that the beta race had at the beginning cutscene their own language, which they spoke. But in the actual game play they spoke english. Now this broke the immersion immediately. Here I had my hopes up, that this game would have done things differently but I was once again denied this. This is kind of the breaking point, why I personaly most likely wont buy this game, atleast for the time being.\n\nNot much  more I can say about the actual game, since I only got to try it for the first 3 campaing missions. This game is better than most of the rts-games available. There are couple gameplay mechanics I would like to see in this game, like better unit control like in SupCom.\n\nIs this game worth 45,99€. For me no. It couldn't sell itslef to me in 18,39€, therefore it would have to do much more to be worth 45,99€. If the beta race would have spoken their own language, I would have bought this game, but now it just feels odd to hear them speaking english.","October 19, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'd say no less then $20 for the game which is what is on sale at the moment. Good game though, diverse races, each having their strengths. Also each one has their own UI's which is a nice touch.

I'm Gold in that game, and most games are about throwing large armies against each other. (Don't get me wrong, I love SC2) In Grey Goo, battles feel longer, and I can control small raids against enemies thanks to an easier economy. One thing I suggest if you try multiplayer, don't try to build Epics every game! They are situational, used to finish a game in a fun way.\n\nThe campaign, despite being short, is good. You play 5 missions as the Beta, the Humans and the Goo respectively, for a total of 15. The atmosphere is better than in SC2 in my opinion, but due to the length, you cannot get immersed enough in the story. Some events might be familiar for those who have played SC.\n\nOverall, at release, it was an overpriced decent game. Now, even if it wasn't on sale, I would still say it is worth the money.

Shiny shiny graphics, and the cutscenes are top notch with great voice acting, linking the missions in the SP in a meaningful way with an interesting story.  The 'tips as you go method' of tutorial is nice and user friendly without forcing you to go through the usual step by step 'now press C to crouch' a lot of games resort to when theres lots to tell, instead we get a bit more show, which helps you remain interested.\n\nLevel maps are full of moving scenery and wildlife fly through the map as you battle it out, giving the landscape a more realistic feel than the old C&C games ever managed.  Now that I mention C&C though, we come to the negative.  Grey Goo feels exactly like Tiberium wars or Generals albeit with lovely graphics and modern unit design.  I found myself playing the game exactly as if I was playing one of those games.  It's encouraging when the worst thing I have to complain about is that Grey Goo is similar to some classic RTS games which I know and love, but there you are, it didnt feel different enough to establish its own vibe despite everyones best efforts with the exciting music, and did I mention how nice the graphics are?\n\nOnly other minor quibble, having upgraded a base to the point you acquire a major technology, you cannot then build that major tech in a new facility unless it is similarly upgraded.  Example : I decided I would build bombers, so you need a hub large enough to accommodate an aircraft hanger, a factory, an air upgrade and an artillery upgrade.  Want any more than four bombers at a time, you gotta build all that again, just building a hub and hanger wont do.  I'm prepared to do that, but it slows things down if you need to build that much infrastructure to advance a strategy when you could just build a small hub, and a large factory and mass produce cheaper faster land units, and repeat, and repeat.\n\nSo my free weekend experience, while I liked the game, I only played three levels and feel I have seen enough. I didnt want to stick round to see the titans or try multiplayer or finish the story, ultimately I wasnt that excited and unfortunately I'm taking Grey Goo off my wishlist and calling it a day.\n\nHowever.  I do give a thumbs up, I do recommend the game, theres no real downside to it and if you pick it up at a good price I'm sure lots of people will have lots of fun, it just wasnt for me.","October 18, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

C'mon...."\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, and the CGI is eye-popping since WETA Workshop was in charge.  Even so, there were a few times I ran into graphical bugs.  One of them was rather severe, as parts of my goo-soldiers reached up into the "sky" where my face was to obscure my vision.  This vibe of "quality, but...."  is pretty pervasive throughout the game.\n\nThe story isn't particularly special, but perfectly serviceable for a game like this.  The few characters are two-dimensional.  My problem was its sloppy deliverance.  You feel as though you arrive 20% of the way into the story, and the back-lore presented later is surprisingly barren.  Given the basically non-existent ending, I get the feeling they're hoping to flesh a lot of things out in future installments.\n\nThere are three races to play.  Architecture is modular for the Humans and the Beta.  Although the Humans can teleport their buildings to elsewhere on their grid network, and in spite of the wonderful visual differences between the two styles, they are nonetheless painfully similar to each other.  The Goo is a marked difference, with no buildings whatsoever.  It simply partitions itself when it's gathered enough resources.\n\nThe UI is kind of terrible.  While it's been simplified for the purpose of building structures and units, there is a bewildering number of hotkeys in the game because the developers just couldn't be bothered.  Every unit has basic functions like patrolling or attacking the ground, but they don't exist on the UI.  If you don't remember the hotkeys, you have to go into the ESC menu.\n\nThe building rotation feature is absolutely terrible.  Beta structures have individual power hubs that you place and build off of, and while the feature of "a blocked building" is appreciated, once you let go of the rotation key it places the building.  A lot of times there are simply bad spots no matter what way you rotate, and you are forced to place the design and then delete it, rather than simply taking your hand off the key.\n\nAlso, I have to complain about the Human's Large Factory.  In order to build their epic unit (or simply attach all four of the tech hubs), in theory you just need to lead a power conduit to the rear of the structure.  This doesn't happen though, because the Human snap-to grid is awful, and automatically attaches the structure by its SIDE to the conduit, obscuring one of the tech hub slots.  Rotation of the building does NOT FIX THIS.  What this means is you have to build a grid, place the building, build more grid around the back, and then DELETE other parts of the conduit.  That's about as inefficient as it could possibly be.\n\nThe game also didn't really try with tutorials (or they simply didn't hold your hand).  Normally I'd be fine with that, and anyone with RTS experience will figure most of it out anyway, but an option to review tips would have been nice.  Once, I clicked a tutorial of the Epic unit I had to build for the Beta, but had other concerns at the time (the game has NO PAUSE BUTTON), so I had to click it away.  It then disappeared.  Permanently.  I had to look up on the internet exactly how the structure was built, because the game's "Encyclopedia" didn't want to tell me.\n\nThere are no hero units.  Units themselves are varied and have particular traits, but these are limited mostly to ranges and ground and/or air capabilities.  They have no abilities, however, and this severely limits the depth of the game.  Whoever has the most guys wins.\n\nFor the tech trees, you get to pick 4 of 12 upgrades.  That's it.  And you can't pick two in the same category.  At least some of these techs are shared between the races.  You do get the ability to unlearn a tech and learn another one in its category, but really?  FOUR TECHS?\n\nThe environmental details bring a little more strategy to the game.  Elevation matters in terms of visibility.  There are small forests of cover for units to hide in, though I imagine that against a human player, those are going to be the first places checked.  You can build actual WALLS in the game instead of just turrets.  The Goo can scale impossible cliffs in their gelatinous form, and for any race, tapping into another resource pool does not require a "Town Hall" type of structure.\n\nThe AI is a little shoddy.  I've had enemy units wander pretty close to my own and go by unassailed, and my units have done the same.  I never used the patrol function, so maybe that has something to do with it. Basically all campaign missions feel heavily scripted rather than intelligent.  In any case, the AI is exploitable, but really, how intelligent did it have to be when the game is about throwing endless units at a problem?\n\nOh, I almost forgot --- lots of people complain the game is difficult.  I have concluded these are probably teenagers or young twenty-somethings who never played any of the old RTS games.  By no stretch of the imagination is the game hard on the middle setting, though there are a few missions which are trial and error.  Those particular missions should have had better coordination and presentation of information, but by no means is the game "hard".\n\nOverall, the game is a solid quick-fix for RTS fans, with really nice production value, even if the mechanics should have been so much more than they were.  Specifically hard stopping the story so they could lead it into a sequel was not appreciated.  The game itself is about 16 hours or so, and that's with several restarts of certain missions.  Overall it's fun, but it won't inspire you to dump tons of hours into it.","October 18, 2015","true","15.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its got a pretty solid campaign, and a fresh building system. It is simplified from a game such as StarCraft, and it's more of a crank-em-out and send them to the front line kind of game. The multiplayer is not horrible, even though I am not terribly good at the game and the people i have played definetly are. So get ready for at least one solid ♥♥♥ kicking. There are 3 factions: Beta, Humans, and Goo. The Beta are really the only ones worth while. The goo you have to seek and destroy on the map and they can be quite dodgy, so thats a bit annoying considering it isn't likely that a patch of goo could turn the tides of war. The pre rendered sequences that play during campaign missions are pretty alright.\n8/10\n","October 19, 2015","true","21.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For the very short period I got to try this game, in over all I liked it. Over all gameplay was great. The importance of economy is something I missed in rts-games, yet it wasn't taken too far. Unit building and upgrading is what you could expect from rts-game. The units themselve were mostly usual, one is strong against one type of enemy and weak against other. What I missed in units, were better artillery units. What I got to experience felt like the artillery units had way too small range to be usefull. I tired using stealth units to increase the range but it still felt, that artillery game style wasn't available.\n\nThe most dissapointing thing in the whole game was, that the beta race had at the beginning cutscene their own language, which they spoke. But in the actual game play they spoke english. Now this broke the immersion immediately. Here I had my hopes up, that this game would have done things differently but I was once again denied this. This is kind of the breaking point, why I personaly most likely wont buy this game, atleast for the time being.\n\nNot much  more I can say about the actual game, since I only got to try it for the first 3 campaing missions. This game is better than most of the rts-games available. There are couple gameplay mechanics I would like to see in this game, like better unit control like in SupCom.\n\nIs this game worth 45,99€. For me no. It couldn't sell itslef to me in 18,39€, therefore it would have to do much more to be worth 45,99€. If the beta race would have spoken their own language, I would have bought this game, but now it just feels odd to hear them speaking english.","October 19, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's core concepts, from everything to it's delicate unit models, to it's gorgeous cutscenes, and it's amazing soundtrack make it a 'good' game. The unit models are unique and creative, every aesthetic of Grey Goo from it's units to it's structures and walls, make me want to play this game. However, the only thing that is great about this game is it's aesthetic and soundtrack. Grey Goo has beautiful music, and a fantastic Sci-Fi setting, with cutscenes that allow us to get into it's wonderful world. But the aesthetic is all this game is, and it's gameplay gets old very fast. Everything that involves gameplay is somewhat lacking, greatly.\n\nPerformance has improved since then, but the abundant players that once played are now nearly gone. The Singleplayer is one hell of a ride, the Beta missions were done absolutely perfectly although it had a few flaws. The Human and Goo missions soured the singleplayer for me, as I was treated with an escort mission and stealth missions. While stealth missions aren't too bad, the reason why it's so bad is because of the lack of unit variety. I wouldn't complain if we had some stealth units, but we don't, and we're forced to watch the A.I. do some patrol paths for several minutes.  It's also incredibly frustrating because the devs have ripped the 'micro potential' in this game. A RTS game, where army control 'should' be crucial, but having very VERY limited units in a stealth mission in a game where micro potential is thrown out the window? Yeah, that doesn't mesh well. The human escort mission wouldn't be too bad if the Goo weren't able to traverse and hide everywhere, or if their anti-air units weren't so powerful. That being said, the Beta Missions are the only great part of the campaign.\n\nThe hotkey system is absolutely terrible for an RTS. While critics like Total Biscuit claimed that it was innovative, hotkeys begin to feel less like shortcuts and more like a mess. I don't play Dota2, or League of Legends, I don't play Mobas, I play RTS games, so of course I'm going to end up fighting against this game's hotkey system. It's a bit hard to get used to the first time, and I didn't care to learn it. It would have been 'innovative' if these hotkeys were customizable, right? But they aren't, you're forced to learn this terrible hotkey system, and if you play RTS games, that is something you can't get used to. I would love it if it were a customizable hotkey system, so that I could use my 'own' shortcuts.\n\nThe unit variety is incredibly lacking and the only difference between units is their stats, really. They all play the same and it gets boring, fast. The only time units have variety and identity is in the early game with the commando/sentinel/drover units. The three unit concepts are great, and they all feel different and act differently, but when you realize that t1 is easily outclassed by t2 tank spam and/or artillery, you stop seeing this kind of variety. Every t2-t3 unit acts almost exactly the same! The three races don't have their own unique equivalents to tanks or artillery, and most of the time they just play the same. All tanks and siege units pretty much fight the same way, they are all slow, can't traverse terrain, etc. We don't get speedy, fast ground units, like in sc2 or CnC, that could deal damage and harass effectively. We don't have stealthed units or sabeoteur types, infantry is nearly nonexistent, and there are no activated unit abilities. Every unit in the game has this very slow turn radius, and act at very VERY slow speeds. Because of this, you're more inclined to clump armies, rather than to spread them out if you're under attack from artillery/air, or you need a surround. Also, there are no support units with special abilities, like the ability to repair or heal friendly units. There are no abilities that can turn the tides of a match or make anything interesting. All units will also focus-fire targets instead of picking their own, which makes micro frustrating. Units that are told to attack move somehow gain 10x the mass they had before, and push each other into enemy fire, instead of attacking the closest unit. Not only that units will always target the one with the lowest health, and will follow that unit until it finishes the job or it's dead. So if you just attack move, and the guy moves that low hp unit out of the way, YOUR ENTIRE ARMY WILL CHASE IT.\n\nThe units being able to hide in forests/trees/shrubs is the only thing that's innovative about this game. Most of it's concepts are 'dumbed' down from the RTS genres. Rushing has been pretty much nerfed, there are no support units, casters, healing units, or even stealthed units. It's upgrade system is incredibly lacking in terms of an RTS, they give 'passive' abilities, which barely makes up for the game's lack in unit variety. What's even worse is that each upgrade takes almost forever to get out, I believe one upgrade was 2minutes long. This makes timing pushes kind of pointless, and the builds in this game really boil down to who gets the most refineries up first.\n\nFor $50 this game is seriously not worth the price. There is so much lacking in unit variety, that it's laughable. Units are what you get to sell players your game, and we all get 10 units that play and act the same. There's no support units, casters, or stealth units, the Singleplayer is about 15 missions, unit upgrades are lackluster and just lazy. The hotkey system is something that RTS gamers will have extensive trouble learning, and even with Epic Units (the game's selling point) they are completely boring compared to CnC Kane's Wrath's Marv, Hexapod, and Redeemer. Many players have stayed away simply because of this game's high price tag, and you know what? Stay away. I feel like I was ripped off.","April 16, 2015","false","57.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","4"

It's easy to get lost in a "oh god no slow RTS of this kind Red Alert 3" mindset, but that immediatly sprawls doubt into my mind - while it's immediatly visible that this was made by people who worked on great games before, why did they have so much trouble with making unit control good? I mean... it's hard to explain.\n\nFor example, in C&C3 and RA3, I could send 16 bombers on 16 different targets in 20 seconds. Here, it's nigh impossible to micro like that. All units of one type are bunched up in the selection box, and even the control is pretty basic. Attack move, hold ground, guard, that's it. There are no abilities. The strategy is limited to "bunch up 200/200 units and A-move" or "get artillery and slowpush every single inch". Even economy was automated almost to the point of not existing, and micro is... almost discouraged.\n\nEven the units don't do many different things. Just build 1 type from each category + some artillery and you're golden, maybe some AA but only after they've revealed they have aircraft. Anti-armour from light units, tank from heavy units, and a fighter from flying.\n\nEpics are more interesting, but... they're tad too powerful. Place an Alpha in a chokepoint, nothing will ever get through. Two Hand of Ruks are capable of killing a stream of thousands of Goo. Etc. It's really hard to kill an epic unit once it's out. No amount of strategy available will save you if they have support. Hand of Ruk can easly decimate 200/200 of units. And in the campaign, oh god, when you face epic units of Humans and Beta, it's always on a map with many, many chokepoints and narrow fields. It's impossible to position against AoE\n\nThe build menu is good. It's basicly what was in C&C3, but with less hotkeys. The idea of the tech tree is pretty interesting. You get to pick 1 out of 3 upgrades, however some are just straight up better than others. That effectively limits the tech tree significantly, as usually most people will always pick the same upgrades.\n\nI can't get my thoughts straight. So I'll tl;dr - it's the same type of a game as C&C3, but inferior in gameplay mechanics and campaign. Doesn't mean it's bad. It's a good. But not good enough. It's clusmy. It's basic. It performs badly.\n\nEdit: upgraded my PC to the best I could. Second most powerful 980GTX and a new CPU. Game still runs like crap.","March 7, 2015","false","15.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I dont write reviews much but there is a diamond in the rough if the devs could see the potential.\n\nSlow paced RTS, computer on easy will knok on your front door before your base gets structured enough to defend yourself (like a zerg rush but with guns) once you kill 1 there will be another to follow within 5 to 10 sec.\n\nNot an intuitave game and the base structure is simplistic which leavs me the feeling that I only have a few options making a skirmish feel like a pre written war novel...long, painful and everyone dies.\n\nPros;\nGreat grapics\nCreative races\nStory mode (Did'nt get enough time to explore it much)\nFluid framerate (even at 4x superscale)\n\nCons:\nSlow inital base developement\n\nWeak base (lowest rung) fighters that take way to long to build/create. In SC a zerg rush can be stopped by marines or protoss infantry if played correctly\n\nGame Mechanics - for being a simple tree structure It was too difficult to well develope your army (balancing of time/resources required)\n\nBalancing - While the idea was creative and interesting It really makes the impression that the focus was put into the story rather than the skirmishes. If you want a RTS to live forever (like SC original) make the multiplayer aspect shine. No one plays the story for years and years. if this game was built around a multiplayer community that could mod and contribute to the final product then even with the flaws mentioned above it would go toe to toe with the best of the best because the gamers would be driving the game aspects not just reading it page after painful page.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nI won't pay for it untill it gets a community driven feel. cheapen and hasten lowest rung fighters to allow for epic infantry battles that start early and persist untill you develope higher teir fighters (cost of lowest teir should be less than 1/2 that of the next highest). Simple base structures should be quicker and use less resources to make. bigger maps with community developed maps supported. dedicated customizeable servers with an ingame browser would get the community to a religious following.\n\nI think it can be great but that will depend on the devs ability to let go a bit.","October 16, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoVeryBored/recommended/290790/","SoVeryBored","SoVeryBored","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoVeryBored/","143 products in account","When the game works, it works well.  However, a lot of the time you will find your units shooting a stray wall post instead of attacking the enemy pelting them two feet behind them.  For a game who's goal was to not be the "twitch APM" style of game that StarCraft is, your army often requires a LOT of babysitting to be effective.\n\nWhile it is true you don't have to micromanage your base much, I feel like there are a few inherently broken things.  When attacking, especially if there are walls, your units like to clump up to shoot the wall post they could just walk past and become perfect artillery bait...  And even a single artillery unit can annihalate your light troops.  It doesn't help that the AI -always- has artillery pre-placed in perfect "gotcha" positions.  Brush also seems to be a problem.  The AI seems to have issues when being shot at by something.  In most RTS games, if a unit gets shot at from something outside its range it will still attempt to engage so it doesn't just die in vain.  In Grey Goo they just... stand there.  Same for things attacking them from inside brush.  The game notifies you they're under attack.  But they just stand there dumbfounded as lasers rip them apart from inside the woods because they can't see the unit inside unless they move into the brush as well, or have a detector with them.\n\nI have found that playing through the campaign requires several restarts until you find the "perfect" build order.  Mistakes are punished hard as the AI with all of their already completed and entrenched positions vs you starting with literally nothing means you have no breathing room what so ever.  The maps, however, are small for the most part so restarting usually isn't that bad unless you fail right at the end.  Also many of them are snaked with frustrating impassible terrain that can make fighting the grey goo a frustrating lesson in chase the mothers around the map since they can freely cross terrain that is impassible to the other races and are constantly spawning more mothers.\n\nThose issues aside though, I still mostly have fun with it.  I'm not even sure why.  I'm definitly not a pro RTS player and I've even had to just stop playing several times after having to restart the same mission three or four times in a row because I'm not playing the game at the pace the AI wants me to play so I wind up with auto-loss when it assaults required mission objectives before I'm anywhere near ready to defend them.  Maybe it's just because I don't want to lose and keep coming back just to beat it...  I think maybe if I can break out of the Supreme Commander mindset and learn that the campaign triggers aren't going to wait for me like Supreme Commander's do and I'll do better.  Or maybe I'm just easily amused by the pretty particle effects and animations, but despite all of the game's weaknesses I don't hate it.","February 4, 2015","true","12.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are some definite pros and cons to this game.\n\nI know it is still early in its development so I will be gentle. I will admit that I have not researched this game a whole lot but I have always been a fan of RTS games and purchase them all of the time. As far as RTS games are concerned this one is a pretty game. The movies/cut screens are pretty solid. Game loading time is okay. It runs pretty smooth in the beginning but can get a little laggy towards the end.\n\nOverall the biggest issues I have are the current price of $50. In its current state this is far from a $50 game for what you get in return. Personally I like the human faction and to only get 10 units to pick from and only be able to build almost as many structures is a little boring to say the least. Sure I have tinkered with the other 2 factions but I am sticking to humans as that is my game style. When running the campaign it would be nice to be able to select which faction you would like to play for. It starts you off with the Beta faction. I am not sure what happens past that as I have not gotten that far yet.\n\nOver all, it is safe to say that this is a good game but it is definitely lacking in some areas and it is not a $50 game. I am hoping that the money that we spend on it will be used to add new content as time goes on and if we are charged for that content it will be extremely disappointing.","February 4, 2015","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But personally I dont care about single player.\n\n\nControlls:\n\n+ Hotkeys are customizable. just some minor limitations and bugs, that i assume will be fixed some time.\n\n+ Camera location hotkeys exist\n\n- Some controlls are not thought though, For instance, the attack move mode disappears after shift clicking it. That makes it cumbersome to queue them. On the other hand, patrolling and repairing modes stay activated until a right click. It should be the same logic as for the attack move: click once -- > attack move mode gone, shift-click --> stay in that mode.\n\n- Cycle throug subgroup key exists, but is not bindable\n\n\nGame concept:\n\n- Terrans and beta have very similar tech trees - why?\n- For terrans every building must be connected to the main base - you cannot have a 2nd base from where you can start to connect stuff. That means ...\n- it is harder to expand\n- there are little possibilities for being cheesy (no hidden stuff ...)\n- its not fun at all\n\n\nOther:\n\n+ Maps look really fancy\n+ The goo faction is really innovative and cool\n- Kind of stupid to call the game after one of three factions\n- Terran units all look very similar\n\nConclusion:\n\nI am not sure if I would recommend this game. In the current state no. But some improvements regarding controlls and entirely changing the terran faction might make the game a lot more fun. In the end I have to say: I am disappointed - mostly because it is so close to be a good game.\n\n\nI was looking for a casual alternative for SC2, something I can play when dont feel like hacking more than 150 APM. Lets assume it is not about APM and we are able to execute every strategy we want. Than there are a lot of valid strategies and cheese for every faction in SC2, but I do not see that in Grey Goo.\nMaybe because I am a noob, but Terran in Grey Goo definately do not offer possibilities for creative stuff.","October 18, 2015","false","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It comes with a full featured 15 mission campaign consisting of 5 missions for each of the three factions to tell a story in the style of StarCraft or WarCraft, eight multiplayer maps that can be played 2v2 or 1v1, and a strong skirmish AI for those players who either don't feel the need to play online, or cannot for whatever reason (more on that later). Taking place on a lush habitable world called Ecosystem-9, Grey Goo is an impressive achievement and a sign of great things to come from developer Grey Box. It also kind of sucks, and that is a real shame, because there is no reason for it.\n\nFirst, the good. Grey Goo's three races are all extremely interesting and just bursting with flavor. The humans on Ecosystem 9 are members of an expeditionary fleet who have arrived to survey and colonize the planet. Their units are all drones (save their awesomely cool epic unit, the Alpha, a kilometer tall exoskeleton that fires a sweeping laser blast) to emphasize the lack of available human personell, their bases consist of linked nodes and rely on impressive turrets powered by artificial intelligence to defend themselves. The beta are a more traditional RTS race, relying on robotic fighting vehicles and infantry; they build their bases off of many smaller hubs that can be placed anywhere in your vision range. Perhaps most interesting are the titular Goo, a mobile race that builds no structures, but who employ many mobile masses of goo that serve as your resource collectors and factories. Taken together, the races feel very fleshed out and interesting, and I was impressed by the imagination that went in to them.\n\nThe developers also succeeded immensely at their goal of streamlining the game. Units themselves have no individual abilities, so the player can focus on production and positioning; every single structure and upgrade can be conveniently built directly in the UI with the Q, W, E, and R keys; along with a seldom-relevant population cap, there is only a single resource to manage. Grey Goo also looks gorgeous on low to medium settings and still runs well on my relatively old machine.\n\nFinally, Grey Goo's campaign is also a really impressive technical feat. The developers wisely avoid giving you too much up front, and during the course of your 15 mission campaign they reveal a complete and interesting universe that, frankly, I am very excited about. Each mission is bookended by some impressive CGI, and while you get fewer action oriented cutscenes relative to other games, it still feels like you're playing a game made by professional people.\n\nOf course, if you have the misfortune to be actually playing the campaign, that feeling will quickly erode. This is one of the worst, most poorly designed RTS campaigns I've ever seen. I don't want to give the impression that I am saying that lightly either. Grey Goo's missions are chockablock full of moments that will make you throw up your hands in genuine rage and exasperation, or cause you to bellow "WHAT?!"\n\nIn one mission you are tasked with building the Beta's epic unit and then crossing the map with it. Literally seconds in to the game you will face a complete attack wave, and the only way you can prevail is by exploiting the incompetent AI and maneuvring your single unit (you will not have had time to build even one at this point) and picking off their army one by one while they attack your buildings. In another mission, you are required to find an escape pod for one of your AI crew members, activate it, and then return it to your base. When I found him, the activation simply failed to trigger, and even after I had completely wiped out the enemy forces, I was unable to complete the mission. In general, the map design consists of narrow corridors that make necessary micromanagement of your units an incredible chore.\n\nEven when the game is functioning as intended, it is outrageously difficult for no good reason that I can see. I was at one time a Master league StarCraft player, and breezed through the StarCraft 2 campaign on Hard. I found Grey Goo a test of my skill, and unfortunately a test of my patience. I was pushed to my utter limit while attempting the campaign on hard difficulty, and I eventually swapped to normal and still found that punitive, so I dropped it down to Easy to cruise through the final three missions. It was still a long slog each time on that difficulty (made more painful by the fact that the developers went trigger happy with spawning enemy epic units in the final stages of the game), and I averaged around 40 minutes per mission, most of which is comprised of a slow battle of attrition through carefully arranged enemy defensive structures that have far too much health. A patch has since toned down the Normal and Easy difficulties, but they are still a complete chore to play, and in no way enjoyable except as a crucible to test yourself.\n\nThe campaigns fail completely as a teaching tool as well. Early in the Goo campaign you are told that your mobile factory and harvester, the Mother Goo, can collect resource spigots by moving over them. They do not mention that these spigots regenerate even if your Mother Goo just sits on the resource point, and that in 100% of occasions your mother goo should sit stationary, collecting resources. In fact, almost none of the units get a proper introduction the way they would in other RTS games, and I am still confused as to why you would ever build the Beta's siege unit when it is so squishy and expensive, and fails to outrange towers.\n\nFortunately, the multiplayer components of the game are good, if in need of some balance fine tuning. Unfortunately, barely a month after launch, it is nearly impossible to find someone online to play with. It isn't clear if this is because the game has been largely abandoned, or because something went badly wrong on the developer end, and the multiplayer is apparently region locked for reasons no one can understand.\n\nThe Verdict\nGrey Goo oozes promise. I have every expectation that when we get the enticing sequel that the campaign promises. it will be a home run. But this first effort falls far short of the mark, and you should only play it if you are absolutely dead set on doing so. I went in determined to like it, and Grey Goo's remarkably bad campaign and nonfunctional multiplayer beat the appreciation out of me in no time.","March 7, 2015","false","13.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

They may not look as good, but in my opinion, it's more about how well the game PLAYS, rather than how good it looks.","June 24, 2015","false","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm Gold in that game, and most games are about throwing large armies against each other. (Don't get me wrong, I love SC2) In Grey Goo, battles feel longer, and I can control small raids against enemies thanks to an easier economy. One thing I suggest if you try multiplayer, don't try to build Epics every game! They are situational, used to finish a game in a fun way.\n\nThe campaign, despite being short, is good. You play 5 missions as the Beta, the Humans and the Goo respectively, for a total of 15. The atmosphere is better than in SC2 in my opinion, but due to the length, you cannot get immersed enough in the story. Some events might be familiar for those who have played SC.\n\nOverall, at release, it was an overpriced decent game. Now, even if it wasn't on sale, I would still say it is worth the money. Don't play as if you were playing StarCraft, and you'll love it!","June 13, 2015","true","32.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each faction gives its own style of play. Grey goo also has a pretty good single player which is great. My only complaint will be the unit cap of 200. I'm sure it has to do with performance and whatnot. But on some maps/levels it seems to go pretty fast especially as the Beta.","May 20, 2015","true","15.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Despite what others say, it is fairly balanced and concentrates on strategy more than micro like most newer RTS' to date.  I see people complaining about the unit structure, but I dare say, these people obviously never played the original C&C.  The units and gameplay are loosely based on the classic old RTS that we know and love.  Back when you only had... 2 factions to pick from.\n\nThe only con I have with this game, is in fact the Goo.  I don't like their faction, and all the skirmishes I play with friends, the Goo are not used.  I find the game to be entirely more enjoyable with out the goo faction in a match.\n\n8/10 would play without Goo again.","February 1","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This one feels like a good old RTS, where you can actually build structures and manage resourses.

A thing or 2 change from faction to faction and grey goo itself is fun to play with too, but it gets boring after a bit.","March 26","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
