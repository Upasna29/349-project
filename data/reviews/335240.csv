Once you play enough, you can vote on these kinds of maps to tell the others if you liked them or not\n- Warning: Some random maps can cause your client to crash, so be wary when playing this mode\n\nMusic mode:\n- You can post Youtube links to a playlist to hear your music! Comes in handy if you get a bit tired of the 3 default songs in the game\n- Most of the time, people don't even play music and instead just play regular videos\n- /skip is a very handy command for this mode\n\nRacing mode:\n- Times are cut in half to one minute\n- Sometimes, this is the easiest place to earn first stats\n\nBootcamp mode:\n- No cheese for you! ^_^\nNo cheese for you! ^_^\nNo cheese for you! ^_^\nNo cheese for you! ^_^\nNo cheese for you! ^_^\n(repeating)\n\nDefilante mode:\n- GOTTA GO FAST, GOTTA GO FASTER FASTER FASTERFASTERFASTERFASTER\n\nSurvivor mode:\n- HOLY CHEESUS LOOK OUT FOR THAT CANNONBALL!\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing a mouse and Shaman\n\nMouse:\n- You gotta go for first place, what else is there to go for?\n- When you don't get that first, blame everyone except yourself\n- "noob sham" is a popular term\n\nShaman:\n- Build quick, or everything is screwed up by the other mice\n- Save everyone, that's what everyone expects from you\n- GET RID OF THAT OTHER SHAMAN, HE'S TAKING YOUR SAVES!\n- An occasional anvil god doesn't hurt anyone. Oh wait...\n\n\n\nAll in all, I'm very satisfied throughout these 4 years, and hope the next 4 are just as great!","January 30, 2015","true","663.4"," 290 of 339 people (86%) found this review helpful 107 people found this review funny","86","290","339","107","7"

It's a clever balance of creative thinking and team-based gameplay that offers endless replayability and customization. The design is charming, and manages to appeal to players of any age.\n\nUnfortunately this is overshadowed by a horrible community, and even worse community leaders. Upon discovering that I could wall jump by rapidly pressing duck and jumping side-to-side (presumably before the devs knew about it) I was promptly IP banned and flamed by one of the developers. I attempted to explain what I was doing, and offered to show them, but I was shot down and never heard from them again.\n\nBecause of this experience, I can't recommend this game to anybody. Even though the game is free-to-play, it's just not worth the frustration.\n\nEDIT:\nSomebody just told me that walljumping is an important part of gameplay now.

Pretty fun and simple game where you play as a mouse along with a bunch of other people and try to get the cheese with the help of the shaman, a special mouse that has powers that allow him to construct structures to help the mice get the cheese. You could also buy cosmetics with the cheese. That pretty much sums up what the game was.\n\nI saw it on steam and thought i might get back into it. My God did it age horribly. The community is more awful than ever and now mostly consists of memelords and bronies. Theres a level up system that gives the shaman ridiculously overpowered abilities that allow them to single out people they like and complete the level for them and kill everyone else, which is usually what happens.

I loved the feel of it, when it was just vanilla and didn't have so many game-modes. But now, I am glad for the different game modes. And really... The only thing that has changed is that there are now badges, you can turn into a milk-carton mouse, and there are still clothes that make you look like a rejected Justin Bieber mouse. This part, I love- I mean, I get to be a mouse that has a mustache. I could have a fish hat. Seems like the future as we know it.\n\nI recently started playing it again because I saw it finally made it on steam (congratulations, by the way), but I was very disappointed at how it had changed. Badges? Levels now? It's suddenly more of a MMO than a platformer.\n\nThe one thing I absolutely hate, and have read that many, MANY others do, is most (as not all of the community is like this- a very rare amount aren't) of the community. Most are homophobic, racist, or just plain out rude to new players. Tribes are difficult to get into. It's basically LoL for twelve and thirteen year olds- I saw so many people complaining about the "rushers" and how we need to work as a team. The new levels of shaman are difficult to master- there's like, what, 100 new things shamans can do? And trust me, it can get nasty if you don't have certain things people typically have as a shaman (i.e. the hearts, the spawning in people when they're dead, the apple, the wings, you get my point), and well... I'm disappointed. In 2011, the community was better, but now... really, the only peaceful gamemode is Delifante, because no one talks in it.\n\nThis community has driven me to write actually write a review- something I've never done before. Play it if you want, it's free. It's a great game on it's own- the concept is fun, and it's easy to get addicted to. But to really be accepted by the community, well- that's something I haven't figured out on my own. But hey, don't take my word for it. Play it for yourself, see how you like it. This is just my opinion, but, it's something many of the players have noticed. I'll continue playing the game on my own, but I do not recommend others joining in.\n\n(Edit: I played this before it was on steam, hence why I said I've been playing it for four years. It's a game I go to every now and then, when I'm bored or really want entertainment from the stupid community.

Transformice can offer you LOTS of fun if you don't take it too seriously. It has always been hard for new players, you just have to take a little time to train the basic moves, and get familiar with shaman basics. There are many videos on YouTube about it. The community has kind of devolved... But, that happens to every MMO as they become increasingly popular in my opinion.\n\nThis is the most important maneuver: How to "Wall Jump" (WJ). This is possible due to friction on upright surfaces, and that you can jump in mid-air if you walk off a platform - When you jump into a wall and keep running into it, the game thinks you're on the ground again (due to friction), so you may then jump off the wall and return again to repeat (It is easier to practice and get your timing right on "Chocolate" walls (higher friction). Basically if you want to scale a wall on your right, you run right, jump into wall so that you are FALLING as you hit it (after highest arc of jump). If you hold RIGHT as you fall into the wall, your mouse should start to slowly slide down the wall while "running" into it. At this point, you STOP holding the RIGHT key down so that you are now free falling, tap LEFT to get away from the wall, you may NOW JUMP to get additional height and return to the wall. (remember to wait until you are past your jump arc to return to the wall and repeat the process). The Wall Jump will NOT work if your mouse is not FALLING as he/she contacts the wall. The game really opens up when you learn how to do this. It just takes practice.\n","February 14, 2015","true","0.4"," 71 of 91 people (78%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","78","71","91","11","4"

I started playing as a joke, but without noticing it I spent hours of fun in that game. Its really addictive, and the fun part is especially when you meet new people that might be considered as friends and its just nice playing with them. Now the bad thing about this game is that most people very often flame and rage and use bad words trying to hurt others, and in this game you will hear the phrase "noob shaman" used at least 253875396 times, and many of these times, it will be about you, but all you need to get over this is some patience. Don't just stop playing because some people are rude, spend time in the game, learn how to play, and everything will be much better.

I praise each and everything, about everyone. If someone fails miserably I scream in all caps "GOOD TRY BUD!!!" and generally just vomit positivity in a way that nobody can ignore. If someone does something well I will crap my pants as I excitedly get caught up in my own motivational praise. Suddenly the awkward "lol thanks" I get in return from a few modest players starts turning into "Thank you!@!#@ :DDDD" and eventually other people are catching on and start praising each other also and saying such wonderfully nice things to each other, and being very forgiving to shams which might not do so well. We are now actually a functioning TEAM. There is no cussing, and when someone enters the room and attempts to troll us, everyone bands together in our powerful bubble of godliness that we start to convert the troll and they too are now one of us.\n\nEventually, however, some kids have to go to bed, our team is breaking down and new people are coming in and I don't really have the energy to come up with new motivational quotes and so our godly bubble pops and I then can't help but sit back smiling while I contemplate my beautiful, albeit brief creation of friendliness, maturity and empathy...\n\n\n\n\n(old review)\n*edit* While still a fantastic game, Transformice is circling the drain if its moderators continue to allow people to stop making the game unplayable for others when they purposefully kill every mouse except for their friends so that their friends get to the cheese first. This is really infuriating.\n\n50 hours and I'm still a noob sham.\nOn a more serious topic, this game is really fun. It looks all kiddy and what-not, but it's not as simple as it seems. I mean, woah? You are a mouse, you have one objective... Get the cheese and return it to the mouse hole. But there's much more to it than that.\nThere's also a lot of cosmetic stuff you can buy with your cheese (currency) or with the fraises which you buy with real-world money. This in absolutely no way affects how good you are in the game, though, it just shows your decorating abilities. The real skill comes from practicing as shaman and helping your fellow mice accomplish their sole objective. There's quite a lot you will learn just by playing each map and watching closely what other shamans do with their skills (you can invest points into several different skill trees) and learning from them. You will make many mistakes and people will probably tell you to kill yourself (as a mouse, to decrease the timer and stop wasting everyone's time if all is lost), but if you can get past the sometimes unhelpful community (they are usually not that bad) you will find a really cool game!","May 19, 2015","true","165.8"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","22","26","4","0"

I've seen it change. A lot. Thought I should type up a review for it.\n\nThe game itself seem pretty simple at first glance. You play as a little mouse, going through obstacle courses to get the cheese and bring it back to the hole. However, there is a SHARP learning curve to this game. Learning how to Shaman (player that builds/summons bridges and helps the mice get to the cheese and back) is a very VERY important skill needed to have a good time in this game. However the tutorial never even touches on how it's done. You're pretty much thrown into a public server with no idea what's going on. Nice!\n\nMy huge pet peeve with this game is the community however. The community is HORRIBLE. I won't strech on it but let's just say its rampant with pre-teens/teens who think they're cool for using offensive language/slurs. Yeah. Fun\n\nWhat keeps me from leaving the game however is the concept overall, once you get past the learning curve (and the obnoxious main chat), it can be a pretty fun way to pass the time. Plus hey, if you're willing to drop some cash on in-game currency, you can make some cool looking outfits.\n\nBottom Line, I have mixed Feelings for Transformice. If you're willing to google how to work the game and accept the community, then highly reccomend it!\n\n","February 16, 2015","true","311.7"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

I love it, but at the same time I don't! But I personally can't recomend it today. If you, however would of asked me 2010-2012 I'd immediately say yes.\nI wouldn't recommend it today because I never actually played Transformice for the game itself. Frankly, it's pretty boring. The only reason I played this game was the community, which over the years got worse. Today almost every rooms chat is dead. Barely no one talk anymore. + no one who I used to play with is online nowadays, which was the biggest reason I quit back in 2012. After having spent about 1,3k+ hours on the game, 8k firsts and 20k cheese.\n\nThe game itself is mediocre, fun at times but isn't especially exciting or thrilling. I do however like the mechanics, being good at walljumping take skill and hours upon hours of practise. But is rewarding since being good at walljumping bacically mean getting a much higher first to cheese ratio. The competitive leaderboard, the awarding feeling of getting better at the game and the community is definetly what made me play Transformice\n\nI only got good memories playing Transformice. And I'll always remember the feeling of being rank 120ish out of 30+ million, but it will never be like it used to be. And I honestly can't recomend this game in the state it is in today.","January 30, 2015","false","2.5"," 66 of 109 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","66","109","7","0"

It's pretty much the currency, and is used to buy aesthetic items like hats, skins, clothes, and building block re-skins for the shaman. The only problem i have with this, is that a lot of things cost thousands upon thousands of cheese, which can be quite a grind.\n\nUnlike a lot of 'F2P' games, the only thing that spending money does, is get you the before-mentioned aesthetic items, and plays no factor in whether you'll be good or not.\nSometimes you get cheese, sometimes you completely miss a jump and fall to your doom. That's the cruel reality of Transformice.\n\nThere are a few game modes, and levels with different mechanics (Like Soul-Mate levels [which you'll learn to hate]), but the premise of the game never really changes. You're collecting cheese to level up, and buy shiny things.\n\nOh, and speaking of leveling up, lets talk about the shamans skill tree. There's 3 categories to work your way up in, one focuses on saving the poor mice that have fallen or gotten stuck, while another focuses on making sure YOU stay alive. The last is completely mechanic based, making anvils weigh more, or giving you a larger radius to place things.\nGaining skill points is fairly quick, but leveling your shaman is another story as it counts how many mice you have saved and how quickly you can save them all.\n\nNow, im gunna talk about the controls, since so many people spawn as shaman and say "wut duh eh duh?"\nNow you'd probably notice, when you're shaman, that there is a box in your GUI that has several items and symbols. "What could this mean?!", you may ask if you're not witty enough to realise, those are the objects and whatnots that you can spawn within a blue circle around yourself (not all require being in the circle to be used).\n\nMost of the time, there is going to be a gap in between you/the mice and the cheese/the goal. You might already be guessing that you'll need to make a bridge with the objects at your disposal, but dont know how to make them connect.\nI will teach you, young padawan.\nI WILL TEACH YOU THE CONTROLS THAT SO MANY MICE BEFORE YOU HAVE FAILED TO COMPREHEND!\n\nC – Yellow Anchor – This anchor needs to be attached to another item and make this item unable to rotate. (Basic bridge/structure building tool.)\n\nB – Red Anchor – This anchor can be directly attached to the map or to any other item, but it can only be selected with a plank. Items are limited to a single red anchor and can’t be attached to any item that has a red anchor. Its main function is to rotate, and that’s not all! Red anchors have an other nice function: they can be placed on a dynamic item in order to prevent them to move! (This is probably one of the most useful tools because it can prevent things from moving or spinning, if you know how to use it.)\n\nV – Blue Anchor – This anchor needs to be attached to another item. It hinges the item. (press multiple times to change where it hinges)\n\nN and J – Blue Motorized Anchors – These anchors are to be attached to another item. They share the same properties with the blue anchor but the difference resides in the fact they can rotate automatically thanks to their motor. (Not used a lot, from what i've seen, but can still have its uses. J spins counterclockwise N spin clockwise)\n\nSpacebar - Ghost Blocks - Ghost Blocks are easily recognizable thanks to their transparency and blue shade. >mice can go through them but items can’t< (Mainly used to set an 'anchor' so that your structures dont slide around when mice are running about them.)\n\nI hope my review swayed some minds to join the cheese-race, and helped some aspiring shamans to nudge their mice along.

I have played Transformice since 2010. (Seriously, I still have my account from back then!) and I love this game! Many hours have I spent dying for la fromage.\n\nThis game is wonderful! It's simple in context, you are a little baby mouse and you need to get to the cheese and bring it back to the hole. The quicker the better. There is a shaman each map who will "help" you succeed, but like any great game, his power can be used for evil. You can be a troll shaman, a bad shaman (meaning you're a noob), or a wonderful shaman that all the mice bow to your feet for.\n\nA lot has changed since 2010, there are hats, clothing, fur and skin colors, and you can even buy exclusive shaman color tools like planks and boxes and personalize them how you like! I also saw the new addition of marriage which I think is hilarious.\n\nThis is a great game to play with your friends, you will be guaranteed more than a few laughs out of the game. There are so many unique maps and new maps are added daily and are USER generated! Meaning you can think of a devilish map and have us play it too!\n\nWhile there are kids who still play this game, the fan base is mostly adults who like to play it. It's addicting and the customization allows for you to want to stick around and get your goal items, badges, or titles.\n\nI have been a long time fan of Transformice and I will continue to be! Give this game a try! You'll love it!","January 30, 2015","true","39.5"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","22","31","3","0"

You can´t purchase anything that will give you advantage. In shop you can only buy things to make your mouse ''unique''.\n\nNow you certanly read some people saying the comunity is toxic. Well, its a free game and the majority of players are kids, go figure. If you dont want random people offending the dignity of your mother u should get good FAST and learn how to use shaman properly.\n\nThere is a leveling system, each time you level up you can get a new ability in many differents trees. Although the techs can help you the most important thing is learn how to use all itens available since lvl 1. It is with them that you will create platforms that take these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to their ♥♥♥♥ing cheese. You can find tutorials anywhere, you really should read them.\n\nFinally, there is not only one type of ''game'', each one of them have its own rules. One of them the objective of shaman is murdering the other mice.

My username on there is Nabbit, feel free to message me whenever I'm online. (Though I haven't logged in recently...)  This is what I've observed:\n\n\nPros:\n- Huge variety in gameplay\n- several different game modes\n- map editor\n- Shamaning (physics)\n- Great art\n- Funny and stupid at times\n- glitches can be hilarious\n- people are so stupid at times it's funny\n- Addictive\n- Not pay to win\n\nCons:\n- Bad community\n- elitism  (people from 2010 never talk to people outside that era)\n- obnoxious 8 year olds\n- never felt a sense of belonging here\n- Not competition-friendly\n- heavily ping-based\n- Annoying events that drag on for eternity\n\n\nAs a platformer, this is easy-moderate in difficulty.\n\nThere's a lack of instruction of how to complete certain parts of maps, (wall jumping)  that can deter the casual player to stop playing this game after one play.  But this is easy to learn, and once it's learned the game instantly becomes easier.   Shamming is harder, but once learned it's easy.  Not sure if this is a pro or a con. :P\n\nDo I recommend it?  Yes, but it's not for everyone.  If you want something challenging with a strong, nice community, (does that even exist in multiplayer games?) this isn't for you.  I personally like playing it while listening to music for relaxation.\n\n(Btw, someone said this is family friendly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarmacadam/recommended/335240/","tarmacadam","Tarmac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tarmacadam/","16 products in account","The concept of this game is very simple: You're a mouse, go grab the cheese and then back to the hole.\nHowever, there's much more hiding beneath that, which you can only find out by giving this game a try.\nThe developers are struggling to offer you as many updates and events as possible in order to ensure you the best gaming experience. The game is also not full of bugs as some may say. It's natural to expect bugs on occasions, but I haven't seen any major bug in a long time and they usually get fixed pretty quickly once they are spotted. The variety of game modes makes the gameplay itself even more interesting and appealing.\n\nThe design of the game is also very appealing and there's already a large collection of Transformice fanart on the Internet and a solid amount of players that have stuck up to the community for these more than five years. The customizable items is also an important aspect that makes this game very unique. The shop has a smart marketing strategy which allows you to buy most items either with fraises (which can be bought with real money) or cheese (which is only obtainable by playing). So even if you don't have money, you can still obtain the article you wanted for free if you gather cheese. There are also items that can be bought with cheese only, which encourages players to play the game in order to be able to buy them.\n\nThe opinions are split when it comes to changes: some prefer the old Transformice, some like the new one more. Either way, the concept of the game has always remained the same, just that the game has way more features than it used to have back when it was first released. Some updates may be silly, some may be great. But no matter what, this is not just an experience for us as players, but also an experience for the developers.\n\nI found out about Transformice from a friend on IRC.\nI have been playing it since its very early days, I did not have much of an idea about how the gameplay actually worked back then (except the "grab the cheese then go back to the hole" part), but all I know was that I got so addicted to it that I didn't want to stop and I wanted to learn all of its tricks so badly. The community lacked a forum back then, so the only way to find out about certain tricks was to directly interact with players in-game.\n\nSince then the community has slightly increased in number, but that didn't really change too much about how players behave. Maybe the ratio between underage users and adult ones has changed, but it's common to expect immature players since the game itself is normally targeted to a younger audience. However, you can find some amazing people if you at least try to explore this game a little more and not just stick up in a single room.\nI do agree that some players are toxic but this can be avoided if you simply ignore them. I don't see why one would give this game a negative review because of the community. Mods are doing their best to keep troublemakers away and a lot of issues can be sorted out if you try to communicate with the staff. I am sure that there will be at least one of them who would want to help. While the amount of volunteer staff is very limited in contrast to the amount of players, you may sometimes get a late response in-game, but there are also a variety of other contact methods that can be found on the official forum on atelier801.com, including the /report command to denounce rulebreakers.\n\nPersonally, I made A LOT of amazing friends here whom I still keep in touch with after so many years and I am grateful to this game that it made our paths cross. The community is the one of the strongest reasons I am still sticking around, as the gameplay itself would become boring without it to some extent. The community is what makes this game so colorful, massive and, sometimes, chaotic (in a good way, when there are like over 100 mice in a single room).\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend this game to everyone regardless of their age. However, I would not recommend it to people with a bad personality. Troublemakers aren't welcome. The game is fun to play if you don't play it alone.\nThere's so much more to say about this game, but it'd be better to not spoil it all, so try it out as it costs you nothing.","June 30, 2015","true","430.9"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","21","30","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnlantern/recommended/335240/","johnlantern","IKNOWYOUCANREADTHISSPIN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnlantern/","101 products in account","It seems that the developers of Transformice have finally found a new way of labeling and sugar coating unaddressed bugs and glitches by calling them "hectic physics". As fun and cute as this game is, I would keep away from it if you're not okay with frustrating bugs, persistent server crashes, overly dramatic staff, incomplete updates, and with that, updates that only seem to break the gameplay. If you were to even log in now and click shift+enter, you'd see an incomplete UI update bug that hasn't been addressed for almost 2 weeks, and we'll be lucky if it ever is. If you enjoy developers releasing an untested update on a game expecting users to beta test it for them (as if they look at user suggestions and reports), click download now. But all in all I think there's a lot about this game that makes it not "steam ready".\n\nIf you ignore the brokenness of the game and look at the community, you won't find too much better. I wouldn't come to Transformice expecting to find a kind community that will help you improve your skills. Expect to be called noob, cussed at, and made fun of for being a beginner, although there's a few kind souls out there that will help you out. A lot of spam too, but you can ignore spam and other users you don't like, so long as you don't ignore so many that you pass your ignore list limit of 500!\n\nBut hey, if you like dressing up mice in outfits and can put up with everything stated here (and more!) then maybe this might be worth checking out for you. I've still playing this game after 4 years and for some reason can't stop logging in every day...and it's free to play too.

This is the story of mice and their adventures for the holy grale, cheese. Cheese is currency in this beautifully fantasy-driven magnificant world in which the story is too directed and wrote by George RR Martin. Our main character, Shaman, or his nickname - Seamous helps these "flock" of mice flurry to the cheese in multiple levels assisting them with Boxes, wooden planks, AND EVEN BALLOONS. The currency of cheese as i mentioned earlier can buy multiple costumes and cosmetics. Like for example 3d glasses, pink wigs, orange wigs, and if ur a pure yolo'er you'll buy the fokin Xtreme top hat. Now if you can't afford these, you can just purchase with real money! Some may say this makes the game P2W, but in my opinion it makes the game more, well, open ended. You dont HAVE to buy the cosmetics and they certainly dont give you special abilities other than the obvious - cuteness. If this game costed money, i would buy it. If this game was early access and costed money, i would buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TylerTheDragon/recommended/335240/","TylerTheDragon","Tylerthedragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TylerTheDragon/","66 products in account","As a fan of this game for a long while, I can honestly say that the game has not changed much at all. This can be interpereted in many different ways, as the game is not changing so much that people who play the game around 2010 like I have won't stop playing because it's too different.\n\nThe basis of the game is a simple collect and return game where you either have to use skillful tactics (such as the wall jump) or the help of a shaman (In the normal and vanilla modes) to get the cheese and return (or find) the hole to return the cheese to. Every time you collect cheese, you earn +1 Cheese to spend in a store. The store has access to many customisation options (Compared to 2010 when I played, they added A LOT more) for you to create a mouse that you want.\n\nFor the people who want a challenge, after saving a specific number of mice (1000 mice) you can get access to a hard mode, where you are not allowed to use a red(global) anchor (the most stable anchor in the game) which is used in many bridges (and as a new addition, a new mode that removes all anchors but blue anchors, which tests the true skill of a shaman for experts).\n\nBecause the game is very fun already, there is no need for drastic changes, and because people are allowed to create their own levels, and a mode specifically for the earlier levels that were before the game allowed custom levels for those veterans who want to play the older maps.\n\nThere are a handful of modes in this game from the menu (There are unofficial ones but I will be adressing the mod-created ones because people don't often play custom modes):\n\n- Normal is your standard game with levels that are new, old and created by other people. These include racings levels and art levels, and can be played with a shaman and some without the shaman's help.\n- Vanilla is your standard game but with only old levels that are officially approved/created by the developers. This is an easy way to create cheese but lacks much challenge.\n- Survival is a game mode that allows a shaman to try to kill the mice. This is a skilful mode which requires you to know a bit about the games physics and tricks to stop trolling, but is also great practice.\n- Racing is a game mode that is similar to the standard gamemodes, but instead of using a shaman, uses many levels that depend on the person's skill and speed. This is a competetive mode where people compete to come in the top 3. This is great practice to get faster at the game and to beat levels first commonly without the help of a shaman if possible.\n\n-Bootcamp is the hardest mode in the game. This is a game mode that is similar to the standard gamemodes, but instead requires extreme skill and almost precice movement to pass a level. This is a mode that requires a large amount of knowledge of the games mechanics, like wall jumping, jumping off corners to create momentum and things in levels like advantages of trampolines and other things.\n\nI reccomend this game for anyone who wants to pass time!","April 1, 2015","true","504.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

You can't watch everyone!\n\nWhich is the problem. Nothing has changed in 4 years.\n\nIf you think it's charming, well, it is. It's a cute game.

(Spoiler Alert: I didn't get my game) I hate this game, every time i join a room/lobby, when i ask how to play, people are just spamming and spamming copy and paste text. About 90% of players are kids under the age of 10. If you do find a teenager or adult playing the game, tell them  that this game is a load of garbage. First of all, the trailer lies and lies and LIES. They make it look cooky, fun and enjoyable with amazing mechanics, but one that downloads the game sees the game, will think its GARBAGE. Now first of all, im not giving the game complaints, at times it has its positives. The positives being...1. A room with NO SPAM. 2. Being paired with a good shaman. 3. Having nice and kind people not shouting at their computer screens "OMG YOU SUCK SO BAD SHAMAN GO KILL YOURSELF LOLOLOL.". <-- This right here is the quality of how much intelligence you deal with when you start the game. Overall i rate the game probably a 4/10. The game is okay and without chat i would give it a possible 6/10, but kids screaming SRSLY YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GO DIE IN A PIT is just overall...stupid. The community is pretty much a bunch of kids that just got steam and only use it to play this game. Two quick things before i end this. Maybe add a 10 second cooldown between saying 2 messages or a 6 second cooldown? The 2nd thing is that i do play this game from time to time just to give it another go.

I can't really say if I would recommend it or not, because this game doesn't feel that bad, it's just....A mindless flash game, boring at times, fun at others. It's rather buggy, from what I've experienced so far, the gameplay is simple to pick up, and most of the stuff you can buy in the shop are just for show, which doesn't quite make it a P2W game.\n\nThe community is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, though. I've heard "Noob sham/♥♥♥ u sham/ sham u suk" a thousand times, each time the shaman fails to do something, they say that, because probably it's the only thing they can say. The community seems to be full of kids from other countries, too, which kinda makes it hard to deal with at times. By far, the best part of this game, is becoming the shaman to murder all the ♥♥♥♥ing mice that have been pestering and insulting you the whole time. Those are the best 20 seconds of the game, and then, 5-10 minutes just to become a shaman once again, and repeat the mice murdering spree.\n\nI can't honestly say much about this one, it's nice to play it for 20 minute or so sessions now and then, but I can't really recommend this game for the long run, it's just a short time killer, nothing else, unless you want to grind cheese for items, or buy frasies for....Items, like ♥♥♥♥ing hats. ♥♥♥♥ hats.\n\nGive it a try, it's free, it's a really fast download, you don't lose anything, really, but for me, I can't really play it for more than 20 minutes a session.","February 17, 2015","false","5.5"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","57","21","37","8","0"

The fanbase. This awful, teen angst-filled slum of safe spaces and triggered teens is something like no other. You really can't have fun here. If you say anything out of order, you get a ban. It's like the moderators forget that there is even a language filter half the time, since they throw bans left and right. I got two tonight, one for apparently not keeping the chat "suitable for all ages" and another for "linking porn."\n\nA friend of mine was commenting on the first I got, (firsts are something you get for entering the mouse hole first, collecting more over time earns you titles, etc), and jokingly said "What site can I get your hacks at" and I replied with "sex. com." I shouldn't have to say this, but that was a joke.\nNot even an hour later, I was banned for a whopping 168 hours, for jokingly saying "sex. com" in chat, to my friend. We left that server we were in, and played in another one before a nitpicky mod went back into the log and found where I said that, just to ban me. It's a bit silly, considering that most mods pick favorites and decide only to ban certain players.\n\nIt's a shame, since I've come a long way with this game.

The one with mice and cheese and cannonballs?  So many cannonballs...  Well, it's back... in Steam form!\n\nThe objective of this game is simple: Get the cheese, bring it back to the mouse hole.  However, that's only the beginning.  To get to the cheese, you might need to use purple trampolines, climb chocolate bars, avoid (or even use) hot lava, or even contend with jealous shaman bent on keeping you from your goal!  All this while playing with a handful of other players, live!\n\nSince 2010, this game gained a cult following, keeping fans of old and gaining fans anew.  These days, it's much the same as it always was... but with far more game modes, such as Race, Survival, and Defilante (Scrolling)!  It also has much more user-created content than it used to, such as maps and even wearable items for your mouse!  That's right: You can customize your mouse with items to set them apart from the rest of the crowd!  But you've gotta earn 'em by getting the cheese, first!  Or, ya know... buying fraises (strawberries), the microtransaction currency of the game, with real-world money. (The prices are actually pretty good, too!)\n\nIf you like side-scrolling action/puzzle games with an adorable twist and some amount of customization, or are just an occasional fan of absolute chaos, this is definitely the game for you!","October 1, 2015","true","10.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

However, despite some bug issues previously mentioned in the reviews, this is the only game that I sticked with for so long. Transformice is full of fun and challenging maps and the game is quite competitive, which makes you not want to go offline. You never know what the next round brings. Thanks to the huge community, I was able to find some absolutely amazing friends that are very close to me.

It's the perfect combination between casual fun on one side and the ability to communicate with others on the other side. This game is highly community driven thanks to the Map Editor, the LUA integration, the possibility to voteban people from the room if they're annoying. It's even possible to play moderator if you wish and check out reports other players made using the tribunal.\n\nSure, it's a pretty simple 2d game and it may not be as immersive as more elaborate games. But that's sometimes exactly what you should be looking for as it gives you plenty of time to chat up with other players. If you ask me, that's where a lot of other games go wrong. Not everything is perfect here and occasionally there are server issues or bugs, but in the end they get resolved and at least that means we get to laugh at Tig (one of the creators and known as a troll).\n\nDo I recommend this game?

Play since 2011 then went on hiatus for years. Going back to play since they now add in in steam :D\n\nPros:\n+ Simple gameplay\n+ unlimited maps (always challenging everytime change map)\n+ No cash stuffs that makes u more pro than other player (a.k.a 100% based on ur skill)\n+ cute gameplay\n+ survivor and baffbot (now change to music room) another option to kill time\n+ lots of servers for various countries\n+ small size :)\n\nCons:\n- idk is it just me... but the game gets so laggy sometimes. I even play l4d2, tf2, g-mod, etc. less lag than transformice which only 46 mb.\n\nThe gameplay back in 2011 way more simpler, now it has some addons like powerups when u level up. Well... idk it's a pro or cons. In one side it makes the gameplay more fun, in other side i also like the classic TFM with no powerups, so both newbies and pro players can be shaman with same tool (a.k.a again... 100% based on skill, not on powerups u get trough level)\n\nAnyway, I still love this game :)","January 30, 2015","true","1.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The gameplay is simple enough, run to get the cheese with a special round everyonce in a while where you get magic. Simple, but it also has enough going on that a good player can easily stand out in a crowd. Of course the key to getting the full enjoyment out of this game for me is finding a good room. The best games of transformice aren't that way just because there are considerate players (which is nice too), often its been the very active and lively chat thats kept me getting cheese into the wee hours of the night. I've  played this game on and off over the years and seen the transformation (he he) that its gone through. It's come a long way and Im glad to see it finally made it to steam.

I used to play this game several years ago, but finally went AFK, because in my opinion this game had some changes since I first play it, which I was not so like. At first this game is just a funny co-op game, but gradually it become something that Shaman keeps trolling players (not really, but its so hard to control Shaman that it requires lots of practice), also player must (yes, must, not just recommended) know how to do AJ (Air Jump) and WJ (Wall Jump) in order to beat most of the maps. In China however, the game is so lag, so WJ is not something that I can manage to do in several casual playing, so I fell behind other players in skill, plus I have really limited time to play, so I stop playing it. Now this game is on Steam, however the casual and funny co-op style of the game doesn't come back, and the lagging problem is still serious, I think I wouldn't come back and keep playing this time.","February 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I know it isn't the developer's fault that they are this way, but it is their fault that there is no censoring or better moderation. Also, from what I could tell, there is no real difference between the Steam version and the web version. The video options are very poor and there are little to no sound effects.\n\nTransformice could be a great game if they just went that extra step.

It doesn't provide 1080p textures for mice and the network code is rather bad. You'll have to deal with lag all the time.\nFrom a quality perspective it feels like a game released in 2005.\n\nNow, the community is a WHOLE other beast. It's really, really bad. This is a kids game. Combine CoD, Dota and LoL together and you still get a rather pleasent community compared to this monster.\n\nWhile you can't really influence the community, at least SOME moderation would be nice because currently it's non-existent.\n\nIf this game starts getting acceptable graphic and netcode as well as some moderating for their community, I'll reconsider this review. Before they do that however, I recommend you stay far away from this game.","February 8, 2015","false","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, mice. I may not like mice that much but I'm not the one to complain about mice too much.\n\nBut from what I read in some reviews this game is going pretty much downhill as I type, and this is coming from a lurker who plays games once in a while and prefers to play as a guest. I have heard that the people in there are like a bunch of dead horse beaters (and by that I mean extremely rude and punishing-for-no-good-reason people, drama mongers, people who insult you for either being new or dying a lot etc). I've also read about how bugs take too long to fix (or never get fixed at all) and the staff are immensely lacking in public relations and moderation ethics.\n\nUnless something is actually done to deal with all these issues, I recommend avoiding this game altogether. If this situation continues I expect a shutdown in around a year or two.","February 8, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just make up some name, jump in, and the servers would connect you with a couple dozen other players going through the same dozen maps to collect cheese and bring it to the hole. Simple. I first thought of it as some odd sociology expiriment, as almost all the maps at the time seemed to be testing the players. Half of them allowed players to go very quickly through it, but doing so would jeporadize the other mice. I didn't expect it to last a year, and yet in the year 2015, it stands.\n\nSo what's changed since then? Well, the community makes maps, of which there are now thousands of unique ones. Shamen have been given more interesting puzzles to work with, combined with skill trees to make interesting possibilities, along with Hard and Divine mode. Mod support is in, shown through the wide variety of rooms you can join. If you want to hone your skills as a normal mouse, Bootcamp will whip you into shape. If you want to be able to survive troll shamen, Survivor can show you the tricks to that. Music allows for users to submit Youtube videos to be watched by all the occupants, and there's more yet. Tribes are a thing, if you want to have friends collaborate for fun. The cosmetics channel true TF2 spirit by allowing you to alter the appearance of your mouse with a long line of items that all can be bought with in-game cheese. Events are brought about every holiday of the year, adding some new aspect to the game. Emotes became a thing, so you no longer need to pretend to sit or cry, because you can actually sit and cry.\n\nAnd you know what? It doesn't seem to be stopping. It just keeps going, showing true devotion to the style of having a simple, fun game. Just by playing as a mouse, getting some nice, tasty cheese.","February 8, 2015","true","106.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Transformice you are a mouse you must get the cheese and get to the hole in time. You have to choose which gamemode you want to play.. Vanilla reccomended for starters.. Normal reccomend for the average mouse Racing reccomended for the fast mouse Defiance you have to keep moving so you won't die reccomended for people who keep winning in Racing Boot camp it is very challenging Music Listen to some music while you try to win the round Survivor the Shaman wants to kill you avoid him/her! Even though most of the times it is a friendly game  But there's a catch! some levels are difficult or need a Shaman to beat.. you ask what a Shaman is it is a mouse that summons objects and helps you finish the round faster or possibly beat it.. For all of this I reccomend Transformice it is a good game! and don't be so picky about the graphics.. P.s theres hats in the game which could be bought by cheese","April 26, 2015","true","66.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I used to play this game several years ago, but finally went AFK, because in my opinion this game had some changes since I first play it, which I was not so like. At first this game is just a funny co-op game, but gradually it become something that Shaman keeps trolling players (not really, but its so hard to control Shaman that it requires lots of practice), also player must (yes, must, not just recommended) know how to do AJ (Air Jump) and WJ (Wall Jump) in order to beat most of the maps. In China however, the game is so lag, so WJ is not something that I can manage to do in several casual playing, so I fell behind other players in skill, plus I have really limited time to play, so I stop playing it. Now this game is on Steam, however the casual and funny co-op style of the game doesn't come back, and the lagging problem is still serious, I think I wouldn't come back and keep playing this time.","February 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

So many mice that it hard at first to focus on my mousey.  Other mice in game are other players.  Prunk does not know how they can chat with each other at same time as play through crazy obstacle course to get cheeses, but they do.  Prunk can only focus on not letting poor mousey die while controlling it with arrow buttons on keyboard!\n\nGame has different stages with different challenges for mousey but if your mousey die, then you wait for other mice to die or bring their cheeses to home.  There is also a mousey shaman that wears feathers.  Shaman helps sometimes if you wait long enough.  Each stage is less than two minutes because game wasn't crazy enough for peoples.\n\nPrunk think he has to play some more, but if you like chaos in a video game that challenges you to balance a mousey on a bubble to get back home or to jump on items to boost your mousey up to sky for floating cheese, then this game for you!\n\nEducatedOrc Prunk say:\n\nFun & Entertaining - 3 / 5 grunts\nSkill Leveling - 2 / 5\nAction Intensity - 4 / 5 grunts\nStoryline - 2 / 5 grunts\nAddictive - 3 / 5 grunts\nOVERALL - 3 out of 5 grunts","September 6, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, mice.

I have heard that the people in there are like a bunch of dead horse beaters (and by that I mean extremely rude and punishing-for-no-good-reason people, drama mongers, people who insult you for either being new or dying a lot etc). I've also read about how bugs take too long to fix (or never get fixed at all) and the staff are immensely lacking in public relations and moderation ethics.\n\nUnless something is actually done to deal with all these issues, I recommend avoiding this game altogether.

Since I started playing back in 2011, I've only seen the game get better ever since it started out from the small selection of around 100 or so default maps.  Now, there are way over 1 million community maps, and most of them are playable.\n\nTransformice gives you a selection of game mode to play from.\nVanilla - Servers in vanilla mode only contain the game's original maps (and event maps if it is a time of year)\nNormal - Servers with normal mode contain the vanilla maps, and the community maps (all types of community maps)\nRacing - Racing has a very simple goal - To get the cheese to the hole first. (Community racing maps)\nSurvivor - As a mice, you have to survive from the shaman as the shaman has to kill everybody within a time limit. Survive to gain more points\nAnd there are some more game-modes, but most aren't play as much.\n\nReally though, you should play Transformice in the end.  The maps are fun to play, the events that sometimes unfold during maps are hilarious, and once you get used to basic game mechanics, the community is nice as well.\n10/10","February 9, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just make up some name, jump in, and the servers would connect you with a couple dozen other players going through the same dozen maps to collect cheese and bring it to the hole. Simple. I first thought of it as some odd sociology expiriment, as almost all the maps at the time seemed to be testing the players. Half of them allowed players to go very quickly through it, but doing so would jeporadize the other mice. I didn't expect it to last a year, and yet in the year 2015, it stands.\n\nSo what's changed since then? Well, the community makes maps, of which there are now thousands of unique ones. Shamen have been given more interesting puzzles to work with, combined with skill trees to make interesting possibilities, along with Hard and Divine mode. Mod support is in, shown through the wide variety of rooms you can join. If you want to hone your skills as a normal mouse, Bootcamp will whip you into shape. If you want to be able to survive troll shamen, Survivor can show you the tricks to that. Music allows for users to submit Youtube videos to be watched by all the occupants, and there's more yet. Tribes are a thing, if you want to have friends collaborate for fun. The cosmetics channel true TF2 spirit by allowing you to alter the appearance of your mouse with a long line of items that all can be bought with in-game cheese. Events are brought about every holiday of the year, adding some new aspect to the game. Emotes became a thing, so you no longer need to pretend to sit or cry, because you can actually sit and cry.\n\nAnd you know what? It doesn't seem to be stopping. It just keeps going, showing true devotion to the style of having a simple, fun game. Just by playing as a mouse, getting some nice, tasty cheese.","February 8, 2015","true","106.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Transformice you are a mouse you must get the cheese and get to the hole in time. You have to choose which gamemode you want to play.. Vanilla reccomended for starters.. Normal reccomend for the average mouse Racing reccomended for the fast mouse Defiance you have to keep moving so you won't die reccomended for people who keep winning in Racing Boot camp it is very challenging Music Listen to some music while you try to win the round Survivor the Shaman wants to kill you avoid him/her! Even though most of the times it is a friendly game  But there's a catch! some levels are difficult or need a Shaman to beat.. you ask what a Shaman is it is a mouse that summons objects and helps you finish the round faster or possibly beat it.. For all of this I reccomend Transformice it is a good game! and don't be so picky about the graphics.. P.s theres hats in the game which could be bought by cheese","April 26, 2015","true","66.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The playerbase is in need of help. Apart from an occasional  group you will find, there will be padders and rude people in every room. It's absolutely hilarious when someone throws a snowball at an afk though, lol. There are many different modes you can play, survivor, racing, module, vanilla, etc. Survivor is where, instead of the shaman helping the mice get to the mouse hole, their object is to kill the players using cannons. You can guess what racing is (getting to the mouse hole fastest), module is basically a bunch of different rooms where you can do different things such as basketball, domination, traitor, etc. Vanilla is a room for newbies, beware, there are usually padders there trying to get firsts. These are just some of the plus and negative sides of the game, I've had some interesting experiences playing it and would reccomend!\n\nOverall: learn how to walljumo or you gon die","February 13","true","348.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mowshu/recommended/335240/","mowshu","«mowshu»","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mowshu/","267 products in account","Transformice is a funny MMO mouse-platformer. I have been playing this game since 2011, it is very fun and addicting.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and addicting with a high skill ceiling, you are a mouse trying to get the cheese back to the hole. Each round has a time limit of 2 minutes. The game offers great replayability, having over 200 official maps, and millions of maps made by the community, using the level editor. When you get cheese back in the hole you earn points, at the beginning of each round, the mouse with the most points will be the Shaman. The Shaman is able to spawn items such as boxes, planks, portals, trampolines, balloons, balls, anvils, and even spirits. The Shaman can use different anchors and make objects invisible in order to create constructions. The Shaman decides if he will save the mice and bring them to safety, or just ruin everything. Collecting cheese and saving mice will give you experience, used to unlock Shaman abilities in your skill tree. There are 5 different skill trees, the Mechanic, the Spiritual Guide, the Wind Master, the Wildling and the Physicist. As you earn more saves, you will unlock hard mode and divine mode which are harder, more challenging modes for Shamans. When you get cheese, firsts, save mice, complete bootcamps or take part in special events you will unlock titles. You can choose a title to display under your mouse's name. Your cheese and firsts gathered, mice saved, bootcamps completed and titles unlocked will be shown in your profile, making you want to play more to make your profile better. Cheese gathered is used in the shop to buy accesories, which can be equipped in head, ears, eyes, mouth, neck, tail, change your color and your fur and even customize Shaman items. The items can be customized, you can change the color however you want. You can even buy outfits, which save a combination of items made by you. The game is not pay to win, you have no advantage over the other players if you buy ''fraises'' and everything can be unlocked with cheese. This game offers an amazing character customization. You can create tribes which are basically groups players can join. You can chat, stay in your tribe house and even play youtube videos in it. This game is a great to just chat with your friends and troll around. You can create a room, mess around, chat while gathering a few cheese. As the game progresses you will learn advanced tehniques which require skill, such as wall-jumping, corner jumping, spirit jumping, turn-arounds, etc.  It will be pretty hard and confusing at first, but you will get used to it. You will never get bored of Transformice, there are 7 different game modes: Vanilla, community made maps, survivor, racing, music, bootcamp, defilante and 15+ mini games like prop hunt, hide and seek, tower defense, deathmatch, infected, traitor, football and others. On the other hand,the negative aspect of the game is the community. The community used to be very nice and friendly. Nowdays, people rage a lot and will usually call you a noob, a lucker or even worse if you get a first. They will be especially toxic against new players who don't know how to play Shaman.\n\nGraphics are simple, and they look pretty nice and cute. The game got a lot of improvements since it got released. The sound is not the best, it only has a soundtrack which some people might find annoying and a few sound effects.\n\nI recommend this game, very fun, addicting, give it a try, 9/10.","February 1, 2015","true","38.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I wanted to make a longer review where I'd point out all the things, but when I had about 2k letters here and I read few comments I removed it and decided to  be "more honest"...\n\nSo top 3 comments I'm seeing here atm are just hatin the cummunity... 0.2H, 1.6H, and 2.6H (but this one played before steam version) uh huh... OMG, are you stupid?! Just change the freakin room and DO NOT EVER ENTER VANILLA ROOMS JFC. That's the heart of cancer. I play on English2 normal maps (1,2... NOT vanilla1,vanilla2...) and the people there are actually nice. And if you really suck as shaman so just try to get better with fewer ppl omg.\n\n"Don't bother with this game, it's dead." - Says our #3 "exped" comment.\nYep, It's so ♥♥♥♥ing dead that there are nearly 18 000 players online and it's 2:30 in the friday morning!\nAnd how much has Evolve for example?\nUNEXPECTED INCREDIBLE 360 people!

I just wonder why you have so many hours when you complain this much... you must had some difficult childhood\n\n"This really should not be on Steam, and i don't care how many people like this, i find it boring and there is f2p games in Steam that are a thousand times better in entertainment" - says #anotheridonteven\nAnd Gaben just rubs his hands as he's looking at the money on his bank acc. Why else would it be here ofc\n\nPeople, for the love of god, don't be stupid, and use brain.\nWhat you have here is a really simple game for killing time with enough content for its simplicity. If the community seems as a bunch of kids to you so why the heck aren't you acting mature and why are you not ignoring them? It's really made for relax playing.\n\nHey, ye, I get it. What some people are saying is actually true. And I'm not taking it from them. It may get boring after a while, you may find yourself offended enough to the point where you can't ignore it or you just don't have to find the potentional in this game, but...\nThis simple game is still worth a shot, this much I can tell.\nhead to transformice.com - no registration/download needed","December 17, 2015","true","5.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game mechanics and game modes are very fun and very entertaining, but I usually don't play this game for more than an hour a session. I don't know much about the game before it's current version on 12/09/2015, but I do enjoy what it has become and hopefully more updates will be pushed in the future.\n\nI recommend this game if you're into puzzle games, but beware, it takes a bit of learning and speed bumps to get into this game, and if you're going to try it out it's recommended you get one of your friends who plays the game to help you out, because theres a lot to it.\n\nTo Atelier 801 personally, you've made a great game, the community is a bit questionable, but un-deniably you've made an amazing Puzzle MMO that I'll definitely play for at least a few months before getting bored of it. As for future updates, I'd like to see some that aren't just cosmetic updates with skins, hats, etc.\n\nSincerely, Ryan "Ren" Howell.","September 11, 2015","true","17.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

All of this being an attempt to show the new steam players that there is good and bad in all communities.\n\nI really hope the negative reviewers decide to give TFM a second chance. The majority of the community are 9 - 15 so it's a bit difficult to find mature and friendly players, but they're out there and I hope you find them! I've been scooping up new steam players and made a heap of wonderful new ( and older!! ) friends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chemical1125/recommended/335240/","chemical1125","chemical1125","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chemical1125/","29 products in account","Transformice is a game about collecting cheese and bringing it back to the mouse hole. The main mechanics are physics based like walljumping, corner jumping, some walls can be climbed, but some can't because they are too slippery etc. ice. These skills can be aquired after you've played the game for a while and observed other player's movements. There are several different gamemodes, some and mostly player made. As you collect cheese your cheese counter will rise and you will be able to buy cosmetic items in the shop. You also score points when you manage to collect a cheese and bring it back home. These points build up as you collect more cheese in a room. Getting first gives you more points. Eventually you will have the highest number of points and you will be chosen as the shaman. The shaman's job is to help the mice collect their cheese and get home safely. Shamans have the power to summon objects in the game. There is a experience level in the game, each level up gives you skill points that you can spend in a skill tech tree. These perks are only for shamans. Collecting cheese rewards experience as do shaman saves. When you get enough shaman saves you get the hardmode which disables some of the crucial abilities shamans need for making stable bridges. In exchange for that, you get a totem which you can prebuild and summon directly into the game instead of wasting time to build it while in the game and racing against time.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOpinions\n\nIn my opinion I feel that this game is in fact very fun and very stress releasing to play. It is not those kind of competitive games where you have to use your head and get stressed out. I normally play this casually, unless you are some sort of diehard fan you would probably not spend more than 2-4 hours on this game in my experience. Other than that, this game is fun in all aspects. I like the rewarding sense of achievement when I complete a difficult task of collecting the cheese and bringing it home in a gamemode called bootcamp. This is a factor which draws me back into the game and makes me excited when I feel like playing some Transformice.

If you're the competitive type who doesn't like luck based outcomes or you're looking for a good community to interact with than this is definitely no longer the game for you as the new shaman skills and player inventory make winning a complete toss up, the leaderboard is full of hackers, and the community is absolutely atrocious. That being said, there are also many good things transformice has going for it, my favourite being shamaning itself. You basically have to use different items connected by different types of anchors to build structures that the other players (mice) can traverse in order to complete the level. The difficulty of this increases as you unlock new shaman modes, should you choose to use them. Each new shaman mode will both impair and also add to your abilities. You can get extremely creative while as the shaman, and it's honestly the only reason I played this game for 4 years. The other players will 'race' in order to see who can get to the hole first, but there are so many factors that cannot be anticipated making this quite frustrating if you're trying for first. Random bubbles/balls/various other randomly spawned objects or even the shaman himself (95% of people cannot shaman well)  will constantly stop you no matter how good you are at the game. There are also a number of fun minigames such as soccer and pictionary, which can be fun if little kids and foreigners spamming insults at you is no deterrent.\n\nOther things to note:\n- Glitches. LOTS of glitches.\n- Lags worse than planetside 2\n- Mostly because the servers are in france (but for some reason most players are brazillian?)\n+ You get to play mouse dress up\n\ntl;dr game used to be 10/10 now its ded","January 31, 2015","false","125.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","6"

The only cons of this game- the community can be VERY rude and most are children acting like their a teenager, and these kids; usually the ones swearing they're heads off in chat when they "die"; and the moderators for ENG servers, they need to do a better job at monitoring spammers.\nGenerally speaking, you will also be tempted to buy fraises, so you can customize your mouse with more accessories and change the color of them. You can get anything in the game through patience and perserverance.\nI've played Transformice on the website since 2013, and recommend it but I will say, it does get boring unless there is an event.

Heck, I would play it MUCH more than I do now.  However, things have changed since then.\n\nThe game still has its great gameplay and cute look, but it is still riddled with glitches and bugs.  Plus there are HACKERS EVERYWHERE, so dont expect to get first if you see one.  The shop is fine and the clothes are neat, but its just a bit pricey in my opinion.  Even still, its a solid game in the gameplay category.\n\nHowever on the other end is the infamous community.  ITS BAD, REALLY, REALLY BAD!  In-game, there is either insults or arguments, no chat at all, and very rarely do i see good chat.  The community isn't noob friendly, as you WILL get called noob if you are not good or experienced in the game.  The forums are wither useless or a bit corrupted and jerky.  My sister tried to do normal forums stuff you would normally see, but people keep saying that she is copying people when she is once again, new [to the forums] at the time.  The moderation is very little, which is quite sad.  Overall an awful disgusting community.\n\nBut, if you can get past the community you will be in for a bit of fun, so i would recommend this.  Just refrain from talking, or being shamam until you get good.\n\n7/10 its good","February 8, 2015","true","22.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A game that manage to please both casual and hardcore players. What kind of beautiful magic created Transformice ?\n\nI don't know how they did it, but i sure know it's a success. You get sucked in by the cute mice with tiny hats and funny animaitons. You enjoy running along whatever contraption the Shaman manages to make, and grab the cheese. Then you start getting interested in some advanced mechanics like wall jumping. And you start to get greedy, you try to get the cheese first and become competitive. Finally, after a few rounds, you discover the whole new realm of shamaning, and understand how much complexity there is in that.\n\nThe game is 100% free (the only stuff you can buy with actual money are cosmetic items), so you have no excuse to not try it. And i dare you to not find something you like in it. Maybe you're gonna enjoy being a part of group of cute little mice that dance, and laugh and sometimes cry after an horrible jump into a bottomless pit. Maybe you're gonna enjoy the brain burning aspect of being the shaman and solving maps to help your fellow mice get their precious cheese. Maybe you're gonna get competitive, and strive for 1st place everytime, by taking insane risks to scalp a fraction of a second in your completion time.\n\nReally, Transformice is the best game to play with group of people with different video game knowledge. Everyone can find something in it.","February 15, 2015","true","39.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Heck, I would play it MUCH more than I do now.  However, things have changed since then.\n\nThe game still has its great gameplay and cute look, but it is still riddled with glitches and bugs.  Plus there are HACKERS EVERYWHERE, so dont expect to get first if you see one.  The shop is fine and the clothes are neat, but its just a bit pricey in my opinion.  Even still, its a solid game in the gameplay category.\n\nHowever on the other end is the infamous community.  ITS BAD, REALLY, REALLY BAD!  In-game, there is either insults or arguments, no chat at all, and very rarely do i see good chat.  The community isn't noob friendly, as you WILL get called noob if you are not good or experienced in the game.  The forums are wither useless or a bit corrupted and jerky.  My sister tried to do normal forums stuff you would normally see, but people keep saying that she is copying people when she is once again, new [to the forums] at the time.  The moderation is very little, which is quite sad.  Overall an awful disgusting community.\n\nBut, if you can get past the community you will be in for a bit of fun, so i would recommend this.  Just refrain from talking, or being shamam until you get good.\n\n7/10 its good","February 8, 2015","true","22.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
