Playing through it you can tell it is heavily influenced by Portal and Braid, and possibly other puzzle games. I really enjoyed the puzzle aspect of this game, however I give it a cautious recommendation as it suffers from some presentation and pacing issues.\n\nThoughts, game play wise:The good:\nThis is a first person puzzle game with several very interesting mechanics, which the game does tie in nicely together. If gravity fields and time rewinding sound fun to you, this game has them, and more! One of the main items in the games are orbs with different properties - water orbs extinguishes fire/ lava, dirt balls can be used on scales that generate power to open doors, etc. One unique thing I enjoyed was the momentum - you can grab orbs (they're heavy feeling in the game!) and roll them like bowling balls! Which means practice makes perfect and sometimes you can miss completely. Really reminded me of bowling but with huge, heavier orbs. The time travel mechanic kind of serves as a rewind/ save myself from death mechanic, and actually works as intended in this game - I haven't noticed any discrepancies so far.\n\nThere's also replay value in the form of: a 3-star rating system for time and the times you use rewind, as well as some secrets to find will be interesting to speedrunners and secret hunters.\n\nThe bad:\nHere are some reasons I didn't enjoy the game as much as I'd hoped, even with the interesting mechanics and combinations of these mechanics. The pacing was somewhat strange to me, and it felt like there was no particular ordering or progression. The game does introduce mechanics one by one, but apart from the rooms/ levels getting larger, I didn't particularly feel like the puzzle difficulty was making any meaningful progression. But the fact that I have this expectation may be due to the Portal games.\n\nAnother problem I had was that for the gravity field gun, there was always a lag and it may or may not work even though I'm sure I shot the gun at a correct place theoretically. This led to me restarting some long parts of the levels from scratch, and felt like more of a chore. Also the gravity field made things so blurry sometimes. If this was improved I think I'd have a better experience.\n\nConclusion:Recommended if you are a fan of pure puzzle games and enjoy playing around in large puzzle chambers, with a variety of mechanics. However the puzzles get sluggish, making some parts of the game feel like a chore. I give this game a cautious recommendation.\n\n~If you enjoyed this review, please check out the Completing the Backlog curator page, for other nice reviews by me and others!~","November 30, 2015","true","5.1"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","33","38","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlemissmirage/recommended/334830/","littlemissmirage","ItsJustaMirage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/littlemissmirage/","73 products in account","\nEntropy Rising is a first-person puzzle game where your identity and purpose are unknown!  At the beginning of the game, you descend from the heavens. It literally appears as so as you play as a pink, luminous orb that gently floats and guides you to your objective. It’s your job to jump from platform to platform without fail; even if mistakes were made, the game introduces a rewind mechanism which is activated by holding down the right mouse button. Despite having this option available, each level has a three-star challenge: one for simply completing the puzzle, two for completing it at the recommended set time, and finally by finishing the course without ever using the rewind ability (meaning not dying). So for those of you who are perfectionists or achievement hunters, this is will be more than enough of a challenge.\n\nThe game slowly introduces players to more gimmicky items such as the “Grabber Gun”, which can grab and navigate elemental components such as water or concrete spheres to designated points. Shortly after, you receive an upgraded version of the gun called the “Gravi Gun”, which allows the player to form a gravity bubble around more hostile spheres. Hostile spheres includes those made of lava, in which you can hover them slowly to their rightful place. However, this can only be done in certain areas of a level so there are limitations. After learning the ropes, you’ll encounter strange machinery such as the Thermodynamic Machine, which requires a specific temperature before allowing you to move forward. That’s accomplished either by using the Gravi Gun to transport lava spheres to increase temperature level, or simply using the Grabber Gun on water spheres to cool down lava. These game elements and items all come together to make the the game not only entertaining but also to add a problem-solving aspect to the title that’s not hard to grasp for first-time players, yet adds a good amount of challenge for skilled platforming players.\n\nEntropy Rising is very good with providing tips and advice in the shape of computer monitors. Like all puzzle games, you must first learn to crawl before walking and this game instructs the player in a smooth manner. It doesn’t become too overwhelming but supplies enough challenge to make the player think. The visuals are simple and aren’t too extravagant, however, it isn’t an aspect that takes the entertainment out of the game.\n\nBelow is a short preview video if you would rather see first hand than read. (I understand fully, trust me.)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUz5zUhkn5Q","November 23, 2015","true","0.9"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","1"

It's set in a weird little world populated by flying spheres and oversized measurement devices. You follow a mysterious pink sphere through the levels and solve puzzles involving elements such as fire, water and rock (rock cools down fire, water extinguishes fire, etc) which have to be combined in the right ways and places.\nOne unique and pretty cool feature is the ability to "rewind time" at any moment which saves you some frustration over having fallen to death or having dropped the wrong element as you can always go back really fast.\n\nPros:\n+ Graphics: Looks fabulous! Just check out the screenshots.\n+ Difficulty: Creative and (moderately) challenging riddles\n+ Controls: Well done jumping/platforming controls\n+ Soundtrack: Nice and non-annoying background music\n\nCons:\n- Story: Little of it\n- Length: Rather short (as you would expect from this kind of game)","November 20, 2015","true","5.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","19","22","2","0"

Nice thing is, you can always undo your actions, you don't need to reload the level or restart from a savepoint like in most first person puzzle games. Just don't expect a story to be told like in Portal, it's up to you to find out what all this might be.\nThe graphics is quite nice, way better than you would expect from a game set in a world of cubes and speres. Music and sounds fit perfectly and create an enjoyable athmosphere.\n\nThe puzzles are varying in type and complexity (as you would expect it, the later ones get more complex), and are neither too easy and boring nor too hard, and it seems they are created with love, even the details.\n\nIn addition, the Level(pack)editor gives you the chance to create your own levels. It is not quite the Portal2 style (not 4 points ov view in the editor and no fancy icons and pseudo 3D view), but you can "play" your level in a second window as yoou build it (it automatically reloads after every change as soon as there is a player spawn placed, without resetting the player position). And I did not find a way to crash it, in the worst case press undo and reset your player position :D. The developers already uploaded a small level pack showing posibilities on how to build puzzles in the games' style or even in a completely different style.","November 28, 2015","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is no exception. It has some really interesting ways of experimenting with gravity to create puzzles. Most of the time I really enjoyed the game. The only thing, I do not like so much, is the controls. Moving the balls around sometimes feels a bit random and slugish, which means that I had to try a while for solving a puzzle, even though I knew how to solve it in theory, just because the balls would fly off. Fortunately in most cases this can be fixed quickly by going back in time.\n\nOverall a nice puzzle game :)","November 22, 2015","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The go back in time ability seemed more like a gimmick rather than beneficial to gameplay, it just disallowed failure states entirely. Game has no personality and feels really boring, also very lacking in polish, its very bare bones. Also i felt the fun was controlled; why have a magnet gun if you cant propel things with it? Just grabbing things is boring. Even the gravity gun which was kinda cool was limited by only being shot on a certain kind of wall which just made it super tedious instead of letting players have fun with it. It honestly felt like a chore, and I was bored within minutes. Go play Portal 2 instead of this.","January 11","false","0.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"
