It's obvious that the developer got inspired by two great games - FTL: Faster than Light and Valkyria Chronicles.\n\nSuper Trench Attack 2 is a game where you proceed through randomly generated locations and battles, including special events like meeting mad men, bussinessmen, getting crew healed/damaged etc. The whole battle part is same like in mentioned Valkyria Chronicles - it's turn-based but all movement of specific characters are done directly by WASD controls.\n\nAs the previous game by this developer, graphic style is not serious but it's made in original silly way that you may like or hate. Check the screenshots and you'll see.\n\nPositives:- Unlockable content that motivates you to play again. More playable characters and upgrades.\n- RPG level and item set system for every character.\n- Unique silly graphics. Close to pixelart, not close to seriousness at all.\n- Low system requirements.\n- Low price in relation to the content.\n\nNeutrals:- Higher difficulty. But this is a standard for roguelike games.\n\nNegatives:- Repetitive battles. This guy goes there, shoots that guy. Another guy goes there, shoots any other guy...","December 26, 2015","true","4.3"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","0"

I would like to spend 20 more hours for STA1 though it's not perfect. But for this one I would only play it for less than hour, then take the card and go away.\n\nIt is a totally different game comparing with STA1. I can see many games in it, Oregon Trail, Valkyrie Chronicles, and Advanced War. But the problem is, it is NOT FUN anymore, and not free anymore. STA1 makes you feel like playing Skyrim WWI. You can go wherever you want, take down enemies to make some money and get lootings, complete missions, go find hidden places on the map, etc. But in STA2 you can only march in fixed routes which I dont even know what's the scenery is like, it's just lines, dots, lines, dots. NOT FUN.\n\nThe character doesn't speak funny anymore. In STA1 the guy makes joke once he get an opportunity, some may stupid but basiclly it's really humorous. STA2 has cut a lot on this one. NOT FUN.\n\nI have no problem with turn based fight, Valkyrie Chronicles is a good game too, but the difficulty should be in a step shape. I play this game with characters in 60HP and 20 Atk, then I ran across enemies with 400HP and 50 Atk, then it's GAME OVER. I mean, what the H***? The set of the character is useless, if you cannot finish the fight in 1st round then the characters would be badly wounded, and it would take a century to recover. The travelling could help you heal---like you need to take a travel to China. This is unplayable. NOT FUN.\n\nThe game itself may not be that bad, I mean not "BAD" bad. I can give like 6/10, but I refuse to recommand it cuz STA1 is a really funny game, I love STA1 and I dont want it get ruined. It's just a kind reminder to developers, cuz I think they care. The developer should think about what cause over 90% support on 1st version. The game should make players relax and have fun, not to tortue them with simple, boring digital journey.\n\n我不会向我的朋友推荐这款游戏，因为一代有趣得多。我想我应该会再在1代花上一些时间，但是2代对我来说基本上是挂卡游戏了。\n\n比起1代来，2代的游戏完全转换了模式。可以看到开发者在试图创新，我看到了很多游戏的影子，比如俄勒冈旅程，战场女武神和GBA高级战争，但是游戏本身的趣味性被打了大折扣。1代的自由度很高，你可以去刷兵拿钱，可以清支线地堡，可以做主线任务，可以探究地图上的秘密地点，有那么一点一战天际省的感觉，二代的自由度完全丧失了，你只能沿着固定的路线行军，直接进入战斗场景。\n\n1代很有趣的一点是主角讲话各种逗，虽然有的笑话蠢了点，但总体上营造了一种幽默的氛围。2代主角实在是缺乏幽默感，如果我要玩严肃的战争游戏我就去拉大栓了。\n\n我对回合制战斗没啥偏见，毕竟当年也是在PSP上玩女武神玩的昏天黑地的小青年。但是游戏设定很渣。我带着一帮60血20攻的菜鸡兵在第五个点就遇上了一波400血50攻的精英敌军，立即Game Over，我去你怎么不再开台Sdkfz222来呢。人物的血量跟没有一样，战略设计就是渣渣，你要是不能在第一回合干翻所有人你就会被最垃圾的敌人打成重残，然后每旅行一次回五六点血。。。回满血我估计你得跑到莫斯科去。\n\n游戏其实并没有那么渣，开发者是费了功夫用心在做的。我想我可以打6/10，但我依然不推荐这款游戏。游戏的本质目的是让玩家Have Fun，但这款游戏我认为没有做到这一点。","March 28","false","3.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","22","24","5","5"

Basically, not much has changed from when it was in early access with the exception of additional content being put into the game, with the new Company Officers being as unlockables after making a couple of runs by earning points towards unlocking them with different setups to start your journey with. However, I will be mostly be talking about the differences between Super Trench Attack 2 and another game that is clearly based off from is the gameplay aspect of Valkyria Chronicles.\n\nWhat traits does each game share?\n\n-The turn-based strategy of selecting a unit and controlling them freely around the map with a limited amount of stamina based on unit type\n-The setting is based around a world war setting\n-The general difficulty is your small squad vs the world\n\nTraits that's more prevelant in Valkyria Chronicles:\n\n-Heavily story-driven with visual novel-like cutscenes (very good story if not a bit cliché)\n-Third-person mode makes it easier to spot enemies from a distance once your soldiers have line-of-sight\n-Soldiers in your squad has personality in some description full with voice acting and unique character models\n-Somewhat varying objectives throughout the campaign\n-Multiple playthroughs are discouraging due to the imbalance in power between you and the enemy (mainly you can upgrade your squad and equipment to the point where you are straight up overpowered with orders breaking the difficulty even more)\n-Again, the enemy is heavliy underpowered compared to you.You can go through the entire campaign without spending a single upgrade\n\nTraits that's more prevelant in Super Trench Attack 2:\n\n-Gameplay is clearly the focus of Super Trench Attack 2\n-Very silly atmosphere compare to Valkyria Chronicles' serious atmosphere\n-Rouge-like elements with randomized battlefields\n-Difficulty is unforgiving so if you are not prepared for large scale fights, good luck\n-Unit controls in a top-down view so it's more difficult to spot enemies across the level, but they do give you feedback on line-of-sight and when you've entered their firing range\n-Little to no character personality\n-Squad size is half the size of what you can deploy in Valkyria Chronicles\n-no variable objecives with the only objective available is to eliminate the enemy team (Valkyria Chronicles mostly have you capture a specific control point, but they do mix it up from time to time)\n\nWould I recommend Super Trench Attack 2? The answer is yes, especially if you love the gameplay of Valkyria Chronicles, but are also looking for a challange that Valkyria Chronicles fail to provide after your first playthrough.","November 15, 2015","true","6.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

It's different playstyle from the Original (Squad based-turn-based, rather then a top down Isometric Shooter) Gives a new playstyle which I've found to be quite enjoyable. The games small events are generally funny due to being out of proportion in a way, and the game still can prove a challenge if your not careful.\n\nThat being said, this game is a little repetitive due to it being in it's current state. Each Zone only has one map, and currently the only kind of mission is combat - Meaning it can begin to get repetitive, but im pretty sure new missions and probably maps will come out at some time sooner or later.\n\nSo yeah, from my experience, I'd give this game an 8/10 in it's current state.\nEven if you don't really want this game, keep an eye on it - it has potential.","August 18, 2015","true","3.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","2"

STA2 feels like it took some things from FTL (and tactical game elements), without having the satisfying 'win' you get when you pass the end of a map. I didn't mind the gameplay change, but I do mind when a game doesn't feel fun.  It also feels like there's a drastic loss of funny things to encounter and I miss that. I think it deserves a neutral rating though because it's not a bad game, and I'll update this if I get further in and it changes my mind.","January 20","false","5.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

I'd still recommend getting it any day.  But this FTL clone or 'strategy game' is not something i would recommend. Everything about it is sub-par and not even the funny things are enough to carry it through to the next level.\n\nGet the first game, forget this 'experiment' by the dev.

I see a lot of people comparing it to FTL. I guess I can see why people would make that comparison. The map looks similar, you have crazy good/bad random events, and you can hire a squad as you progress. It is a rogue-lite, like FTL, so there is permadeath. Beyond these similarities the gameplay is much different.\n\nAs you move along the map screen you will encounter combat situations that will require you to put your squad to use. You will see representations of your squad members and enemies on a battlefield layout screen. From here you can strategize the best way to take out the enemy squad within your limited amount of turns. From the layout screen you can select one of your units and the game will switch into a top-down perspective of the battlefield. You are allowed to move and shoot a limited amount each turn (pistols=3 shots, shotguns=2 shots, rifles=1 shot, etc). This makes for some fun, strategic gameplay that I didn't grow tired of at all in my initial session.\n\nThe graphics are a throwback to late 80's/early 90's pc games- I can appreciate that. The Oregon Trail inspired hunting events are also a nice touch. Finally, the music is great. In particular, the music played during enemy turns. I can definitely recommend this game strongly to anyone who enjoys a good rogue-lite or even just an awesome nostaglia trip.","February 8","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Worth a look.\nI dug Super Trench Attack, more or less. This is a much different game.\nTurn based, squad-based battles instead of real-time clicky action. The system is interesting. You have a certain amount of movement radius to use per squad member per turn (if you activate them), as well as a certain number of activation points you can use to make your squad members fire weapons.\n\nYou use WASD to make your active squad member move, and can only see a certain distance around them, though you can, at any time, check the map layout to see where the enemies are. Not certain why view distance is limited this way; probably to keep the sprites at an appropriate size, which is understandable.\n\nThere are some light RPG elements to the squad building, but don't expect Jagged Alliance / XCOM / Wasteland 2 levels of customization. There are a few different classes, and you can select different weapon loadouts for particular characters.\n\nThere are also some random events between encounters, but they more or less seem to be either ways to lose or gain HP, or ways to buy stuff slightly cheaper or trade food for money.\n\nThat being said, I haven't played it that much yet... I will play it again, which is probably the biggest recommendation I can give.\n","December 22, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The battles, while interesting at first, becomes chore as soon as you get the hang of the game. The rogue-like depth is also pretty low as the game gets somewhat easy as soon as you figureout the effective combos.\n\nBalance is also terrible, as certain classes are absolutely useful while others are either somewhat limited to absolutely useless.

The first Super Trench Attack was an awesome not-to-be-taken-seriously shooter game with tons of bad guys, fun boss battles and something like a coherent story. This comes from the south end of a north-bound bull.\n\nWe have a turn-based "strategy". You move the your squad between map points from West to East (spending your food), with each point marking a random event, a battle or a shop. A red area covers the map behind you, showing the progress of the enemy army. The reason this all happens is that you stole enemy invasion plans and need to get them home to avoid the impending war.\n\nIf this doesn't scream FTL at you, go buy that game, it's orders of magnitude better than this ♥♥♥♥. The main reason being that in FTL, the encounters get you better equipment, more crew and ship upgrades. Here, you get some cash, some food or some damage. Randomly. So, while in FTL you are motivated to visit as many places as you can, here your best option is to take the shortest route to the exit.\n\nThe battles themselves look like tiny X-com missions - your soldiers can move some distance per turn, shoot (1x rifle or 2x pistol) or do some other stuff. Two pistol headshot hits are not enough to kill an enemy. And I didn't fihure out how to use grenades.\n\nPlus, the ugly pixelated graphics. That was the only part I hated in the fist game - I know it's "retro", but it sucks. Why can't we get a simple game that looks like it's the 21st century? The hardware can handle it, the game runs at almost any resolution, so why do we keep pretending we're stuck in 1984?","January 16","false","0.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Unlikely to First game, you control selected squad.\n\nGame mechanics are different (I think It's on worse).\nGameplay is something that I did not expect to be from this title (First game looks like fun comparing to this).\nUI looks like It's still in ALPHA.","August 6, 2015","true","5.8"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","5","17","2","0"

Overall this game deserves a solid 9/10 for its pixel polish & ability to do just a little more than you think you might!  A few surprises & a gripping pick up & play,  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys light squad management & a risk management travel system.","March 22","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Though as an RTS it has a 2d Xcom vibe with an ftl like layout ad gameplay)","April 2","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There's a real sense of urgency and danger in both food manangement, and combat. Definitely worth picking up, but perhaps on sale if you prefered the first game.","May 3","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
