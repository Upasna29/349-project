YOU'LL PROBABLY DIE.\n\nSo after earning the achievement for playing a single round for 20 minutes and landing myself 4th on the global leaderboard, I suppose I can adequately evaluate this game:\n\nIt's simple.\nIt's fun.\nIt will cook your eyes and strenghten your fingers.\n\nThis game reminds me a lot of Super Hexagon for its simplicity; if you liked that game then you will probably like this one, but it is also a bit more... bizzare. The premise is simple: use the space bar to control a colored bar between the upper and lower limits on a "gauge" while the background flashes alternating colors and patterns. The closer to the top of the gauge you are the more points you earn per second, but if you TOUCH the top or bottom you lose a score multiplier A.K.A. your lives (think the Bit Trip series: reach zero multipliers and its game over). Periodically you can collect score bonuses near the bottom of the gauge and, if you so elect, press the CTRL button to start controlling 2 bars at once for twice the points.\n\nProblem is, the game doesn't like it when you start scoring high and progressively speeds the rate of color flashing, swaps patterns more quickly, stretches/shifts/flips the screen orientation, moves the location of the upper and lower limits, changes music, and even flashes text questions and pictures of cats when you least suspect it.\n\nIt gets very difficult and I don't recommend playing for extended periods of time, especially on a large screen. That being said this can be a really fun game in small doses and getting put on the leaderboard is satisfying. In addition, after playing certain amounts more and more game modes unlock for you to try, tweaking one aspect of the game at a time to keep it fresh.\n\nIn conclusion I would give this game an 8/10 as a casual, but challenging, lunch break spender. The only detracting aspects of this game for me are:\n-The music is good, BUT it could be better. I prefer something even more aggresive in this type of game to keep me focused.\n-The agressive strobing of bright colors for minutes on end make this game difficult to play for more than 10-15 minutes, basicaly forcing the player to stop playing after a short time (and thats saying something because I have a pretty decent tollerance for this stuff).\n\nAll in all, for 4 bucks I'd say its well worth the money.","May 26, 2014","true","1.9"," 93 of 131 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","93","131","4","0"

Then maybe press ctrl to activate a second gauge and then hold ctrl to fill this gauge.\nIf either gauge fills completely, then you lose a life. If either gauge empties completely, you also lose a life.\nKeeping gauges close to full awards bonus points, and sometimes bonuses will appear which can only be received by almost emptying the first gauge.\nKeep playing until a high score.\n\nThe trick is, this game throws as much visual noise at you as possible to distract you from these goals. It will also invert and scale and wobble and blur the gauges to throw you off.\nVery rarely does this seem unfair, with the only visually confusing technique I've encountered being changing the background to match the gauge.\nOverall, it does a very good job of making the gauge levels distinguishable in some fashion, even whilst playing with your eyes and head.\n\nIt is a very intense visual experience and, as the achievement "♥♥♥♥♥♥" might suggest, a very intense digital experience.\nAs such I would not play this game for prolonged periods of time, as otherwise you risk damaging your sense of balance and fingers.\n\nBut, in small doses, this game is remarkably fun.\n\nThe baby level is creepy though.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShandyAndy/recommended/272990/","ShandyAndy","ShandyAndy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShandyAndy/","1817 products in account","Gauge\nThis review was last edited when I had completed around two hours play time.\n\nShort Review\nIts a pretty minimalistic game based around pressing the space bar to expand and releasing it to contract a horizontal bar (gauge) from the center towards the edge of the screen, ensuring it doesn't contract to the centre nor expand right to the outer limits (in which case you lose a life). The game ends when you lose all your lives or you run out of time. Whilst that may sound pretty boring the addition of some funky graphics and music make for much better gameplay than it sounds and I have to say although I got it in a bundle I wouldn't have been disappointed paying the standard price of £2.49. Personally its not a game I'd play for hours on end but for short bursts of 10 minutes or so I found it good fun.\n\nLong Review\nThe game can be played in windows or full screen mode. A mouse is required to change any of the settings but actual game play is via the keyboard and more precisely the space bar and control key - and that's it.\n\nThere is no tutorial but there are some hints available on the initial screen that cover the basics but having said that the game is pretty simple to pick up .. I got all the basics sorted in playing for 5-10 minutes.\n\nThe screen display is pretty minimalistic with usually just the current bonus, the number of lives left, the actual horiztonal bar control and the current score displayed, although sometimes only the control bar is dislayed and the display theme changes as the game progresses. The game is accompnied by some pretty decent music and some fairly psychodelic graphics.\n\nThe closer to the edge you keep the bar the bigger the bonus you accumulate so ideally you want to keep the gauge as close to the side as you can without actually touching it.\n\nAs the game progresses a few additional features are introduced such as grab points close to the center which give you the chance to activiate a second gauge which can be controlled by pressing the control key and whilst I have to admit initially controlling two gauges simultaneously proved beyond my ability for more than a 20-30 seconds or so after just a short amount of practice I managed several minutes at a time. Text is also displayed and the changes in graphics themes become more intense, distracting you and making the game much, much more difficult. The centre also moves out and the edges in making the area to control your gauge much smaller.\n\nAdditional modes are unlocked once you start posting scores in the millions .. One you see pictures of cats you're starting to get the hang of the game ..\n\nDouble gauges seem to score double points. Getting a grab point usually inceases the control area by pushing the center section towards the center of the screen.\n\nIf you are into Twitter there is a button in game that allows you to tweet your scores .. Not a facility I have used.\n\nThe is a global high score table which I have not troubled in the slightest ;)\n\nI'd strongly urge people to give this game a chance as I must admit I almost dropped it after playing for just 5 minutes but shortly afterwards something clicked and I found it strangely relaxing.

I don't even suffer from epilepsy, but I couldn't stand to look at these graphics for more than ten minutes! They don't add to the gameplay in any way whatsoever, rather detract from it. These graphics will actually lose a significant portion of their players, so why they chose to incorporate them is beyond me.\n\nThe game starts fullscreen, and has an option to go windowed. I say 'windowed', but there is actually no window to the minimised game. It sits right in the middle of your screen, and you can't drag it - essentially making the entire purpose of having the window option pointless.\n\nWhile there is a 'help' screen that briefly outlines the objective of the game, it's barely helpful. On top of that, there are no indications anywhere of the controls. The main screen just says 'Press Space'. It took me a fair few runs to even learn what I was meant to do and how to do it. This only became worse when the second bar was introduced (in the vaguest way possible).\n\nThe music isn't bad, but there are no options within the game itself to either lower the volume or mute the music. I had to do so through the Volume Mixer.\n\nEvery time you fail, the game has restarting, including the loading and the showing of the main menu. In a game that's all about timing, they really should have made it quicker to get back into the game.\n\nWhenever you click on anything on the main menu, it connects to information on the Steam Overlay. I guess they couldn't work out how to put a leaderboard in their own game. This is extremely annoying as the overlay halts the progress of many popular idle-based progression games.\n\nConclusion:\nSEVEN strong negatives and two minor positives.\n\n1/10. This game really should be free; it is definitely not even worth a tenth of the price the author is charging.","March 1","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of Psychedelic and sounds effects that will try to annoying you meanwhile you keep the balance of the to bars.\n\nThe bad points for me is that there is no variety in the music (or maybe it is hidden?), the more fare you progress more annoying sounds pop-in (so the game loose a little of the initial ambientation)\n\nThe game, for me, is not really worthy $4, maybe $1 as maximum, but that is just my opinion.","June 8, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The flashing lights are not nice after a long period of time, and even from the start, if you have a history of epilepsy or seizures, please don't play this game. Even if you  think  you may have epilepsy, don't risk it unless you have people around to monitor you. Anyway, it's simple, and it's a fun time-waster (but only as 10 minute intervals.) It's fun, sure, but $3.99 isn't worth it. Wait until it's on sale.","August 1, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
