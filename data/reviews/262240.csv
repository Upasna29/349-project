"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrincessHime/recommended/262240/","PrincessHime","Ｈｉｍｅ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrincessHime/","249 products in account","95 hours later, I remembered I do not have a review for this.\nUnlike most shoot em ups, SUGURI is surprisingly easy to get into. Even for the people that do not typically enjoy shoot em ups for more than 2 hours such as myself. So unless you really hate the shmup genre, I believe you should buy it.\n\nSUGURI is a type of game that theoretically should have no replayability, there's no randomisation in game outside of boss moves. All enemies come in the same order every time. And is the type of a game I normally abandon without ever finishing. However, the music and the game mechanics make it stand out rather well from traditional shmups and keep it enjoyable to play even after you've completed the game.\n\nAt the core, it does not differ much at all from a traditional shmup : Start a stage, enemies come from the right, you use a weapon to blow them up, then comes the midboss and finally the stage boss. Defeat that and continue doing this until the end of the game with minor variations to that formula. Except you have health instead of lives.\n\nThe difference comes from the fact that the game includes two types of projectiles, I am not sure how they're actually called but I just call them solid and non-solid for ease of understanding.\nThe way it goes is that Suguri, the same-named protagonist of the game has the ability to dash, which allows her to completely avoid non-solid projectiles and charge her Hyper attack meter. Dashing also increases her heat which on a direct percentage amount increases the damage she receive (eg 5% heat you will receive 5% more damage). This and the solid projectiles prevent you from using dash all the time to be completely invincible.\n\nSuguri herself carries two weapons (out of total 16) of your choice into battle, and when her hyper attack meter has built up, can use it to deliver a powerful attack with either of the two weapons. Hyper attacks replace bombing that you normally have in a shmup. Although, while it gives you short temporary invulnerability, it does not clear projectiles.\n\nWhat makes this game so special for me is the complete freedom you have where the larger enemy fights don't have a real timer set over how long you're going to be fighting them for. You think you can kill something in 5 seconds? Go ahead and try, if you do not die in the process you might just pull it off. Alongside the ability to experiment with different ideas of what might or might not work with the weapons you chose.\n\nAnd then there's the music, I can't find words for how much I like the music. While obviously not the type of music for everyone, it is really enjoyable.\n\n\nAs fun as this game is, there are some flaws, three of these being steam release exclusive and one is a general flaw with the game :\nThe game does a rather poor job at communicating with the player over what is or isn't dangerous the first time you play it.\nPlaying this with a lengthy name or a name with quite a few unique characters WILL cause you to crash at the end of stage.\nRather weird achievement situation. Right now, it is impossible to 100% the game achievement-wise. As one of the achievements does not unlock. Alongside that, achievements sometimes do not unlock or unlock only after you watch a replay of yourself unlocking said achievement.\nYour actual save file is not actually synced with steam cloud so upon switching computers, game reinstall or system wipe, you will have to reunlock the game again\nAlthough, despite not really a flaw. One minor oddity is that for some reason, the Story mode and the first option of the game (Complete a stage, unlock the next one to play at your will) was renamed to Stage Select upon localisation. While Arcade (Play all stages consecutively in one go) was moved to be the first option of the game.","December 22, 2014","true","101.4"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","41","43","2","0"

(I learned this the hard way). Suguri is a fast paced action shooter, kept my heart beating a lot faster than your average horror game.\n\nPros\n\n-I found this unique, there were an arsenal of many weapons with different kinds of tactics to put into use.\n-The dash ability was a very crucial yet fun way to progress through the game.\n-Game is very fast paced, there won't be a time when your body is relaxed (except when you're talking the bosses). It really keeps the excitement in the game\n-1st stage soundtrack was the best c:\n\nCons\n\n-There wasn't any tutorial, nor any guide to tell you that dashing can dodge beam attacks unscathed. You would have to also check the keyboard controls to realize its function before starting the game.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is one of the best bullet hells I have ever played.  9.5/10\n\nP.S I prefer keeping the game under a window mode.\n\n","June 14, 2015","true","73.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lunatichime/recommended/262240/","lunatichime","lunatic hime auxy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lunatichime/","421 products in account","It would be a real shame if fans of the shooter genre passed this one over as being too generic, or too similar to Touhou/Cotton/CAVE/etc games, because it has its own flavor that's really unique. Rather than simply firing in a straight line, or at fixed angles, in SUGURI, your character -- the eponymous Suguri -- actually aims at targets directly, with a simple lock-on system, and depending on the weapon, she has to pause briefly to fire.\n\nThis completely changes the dynamics of the game, with enemies doing the same, as well as firing rapid-fire homing attacks! I'd be lying if I said SUGURI is a difficult game, because it's much more than that -- as a danmaku veteran I was getting destroyed on Normal! Excellent timing, clever use of the grazing dash, and mastery of both of your equippable weapons are all required to win in SUGURI.\n\nAt the time of this review you can pick up SUGURI and the fighting-game sister title Acceleration of SUGURI for just five dollars together, which is an absolute steal for two inventive and fun games that will run on any computer, anywhere. I highly recommend both titles.","November 29, 2014","true","0.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

None of the stages dragged on too long, and they actually seem to get shorter with each passing stage. You have a large range of weapons to choose from, but you only start out with three of them; the more you try the stages, however, you unlock more weapons.\n\nThe story is simple, but it's actually pretty good; the characters all seem unique, thanks in part to their fights, but you don't see too much of their personalities until the sequel, Acceleration of Suguri. The art is also a bit simple, but it did grow on me; the sprites on the other hand look amazing, with the enemies sharing a distinctly different style compared to the chibi-esque style of you and the bosses.\n\nThe music, on the other hand, is overall a bit above average; while there were certainly standouts, namely the final boss and the entirety of Stage 4, the rest is pretty good at best.\n\nOh yeah, and this game is insanely hard. On my first playthrough, I could only manage Easy Mode, and even then it took me quite a few hours just to beat it. After getting more accustomed to how the game worked, though, I did finally manage to beat Normal Mode; it did take me a bit longer than it should have, however, thanks to my save data getting corrupted (I still don't know how, either).\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a difficult game that takes a while to get used to, but is a blast once you do, I would easily recommend it; it's easily become one of my favorite Shoot 'em Up games I've played, though I do still prefer its sequel.","December 13, 2014","true","16.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is pretty hard, but if you like a challenge, it's a good thing.  However, I cannot speak on the behalf on all people that they will like it.  Most casual gamers will probably say that it's too hard and give up on the 1st level.  Though, if you are persistent, you will win.  If you like shooters (I compare this to Touhou (even though I've never played Touhou) but horizontal other than vertical), anime girls, and challenge, then this game is for you.  I can't reccomend this to everyone, but for the people who love the criteria above, you will love this game.  The story is great, too.  I don't wanna spoil anything, so just play the game!  I would say that Suguri gets an 8.9/10.\nPretty good, but flawed without any HP Pickups throughout the stage, and other stuff.\nThanks for reading this long and stupid review.

For some reasons, exploding only seems to cause death in Sora (Suguri's prequel). Do not worry, all your waifus will be safe, you'll simply befriend the ♥♥♥♥ out of them Nanoha style.\nSpeaking of dying, you do not have lives in this game as continues are for losers, so you better get good worm.\n\nEnemy shoots two type of bullets, lazors that you can dash through and organic bullets that you can't dodge through but generally can destroy with your own weaponry. You unlock multiple weapons everytime you end a round, or when you get nice scores in specific level.  But do not worry, with the exception of one you'll get them all after your numerous failures.\n\nYou can carry two weapons at the same time, each weapon having an hyper which you can stack up to 3 charges, to gain charge you need to dodge/graze or hit enemies. Using those hypers will turn you invincible for a short period, but you might realize the window is really lenient and will allow you to shot a few round of your weapons before you really being in danger once again.\nNote that the weapons might have different effects if used while standing still or in a dodge, it can also provide a fire rate increase (really useful with the spread gun).\n\nTo score big, you need to kill enemies in a chain, the chain can be kept by either doing damage to an enemy or dodging lasers or grazing organic bullets, not that for it to count they need to touch the rainbow circles you create when dodging. If you're good enough you might beat me in the leaderboard on hard, but i doubt it because i'm just that good.\n\nThe music of the game is overall pretty decent, i just didn't liked the third stage and it's boss that much. But overall it's pleasent.\n\nOverall, Suguri is a pretty fun game, if you can get it for cheap i'd suggest giving it a chance. Make sure to beat Kae over and over for me.","December 7, 2014","true","25.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its an Addictive Fustration making game that has something very special about it.\n\nThe first thing you will want to know considering it tags itself as Bullet hell is, "Does it feel cheap when you lose?"\n\nAbsolutely not, and its one of the main reasons why I love this game. Theres never been a point where I have dies and felt that it was impossible. Losing in this game is down straight and true to Player error. Theres always away to beat the level and its that wanting to come back and finally beat that level that makes me want to play more. The game is very fustrating yet at the same time extremely fun to play at the same time.\n\nAnother Big highlight I want to point out is the Soundtrack. I don't know what it is With Orange juice but all the games they have developed have a great soundtrack. QP Shooting Dangerous had it. 100% Orange had it and if anything Suguri has it even better. It's a key point that people overlook in these kind of games. The right music adds so much more to your experience and Suguri has the perfect soundtrack to make you want to play it.\n\nPerformance wise. It plays at a solid 60fps smooth and silky. I haven't experienced any slowdown when things have got rather manic on the screen and it helps to the overall experience.\n\nThe Game also accomadates a good number of different guns and weapons, Allowing for a more personal experience. However, You may find that what works on one level may not work on another. Its like the game actively encourages you to either master your primary weapons or change your loadout to suit the kind of level and projectiles that you will face.\n\nFinally I will say the visauls of the game may look dated, but they are certainly acceptable. A game of this age is never gonna look the greatest but the quality is there in the right places when it is needed.\n\nOverall while its still early in 2015 and this being a rather oldish game, I certainly put it up there with my favourites of the year so far. It sits there in your library, taunting you to give it another go. To beat that next level and when you do, The rush of excitement and joy are on another level.

If you do, then read on.\n\nSuguri's plotline follows a girl named Suguri who has been given powers by her father after she encounters hostile enemies in the sky. She meets several members of a race of humanoids along this journey who wish to inhabit her planet... forcefully, by killing everyone else.\n\nYou go through 7 levels usually with the stage-miniboss-stage-boss layout however some stages divert from this norm.\n\nThe main thing that sets Suguri apart is the 'dash' feature. This makes it so she can just pass through most energy based attacks whilst taking no damage. However this raises her heat gauge, and the higher her heat gauge is, the more damage she takes. Another thing is her 'hyper'. This varies based on which weapon she has equipped but will unleash a large attack whilst protecting you from damage for a few seconds.\n\nA thing I find in a lot of bullet helly games is that they just feel cheap. You could be going through after making a lot of progress then something OHKOs you or there is an attack that you can't dodge. I never felt this in Suguri. This is because they have warning text when something big is going to happen so you can prepare and if you're cornered, you can just dash or hyper your way out.\n\nA main part of this game are the bosses. I never actually disliked any of them character wise EXCEPT one, but that's kinda spoilery so i'll move on. Each boss felt like they were like you, and I always felt slight remorse after killing them, after the RUSH OF EXCITEMENT. This game makes boss kills feel REALLY REWARDING.\n\nOnto the graphics, they're definitely dated, but I still like how the game itself looks, especially the characters. The game really suits it's graphics style and the fact that the graphics were bad by today's standards never got in the way of gameplay.\n\nThe music though, is very good. It never failed to make me pumped up for the level ahead and to me it never felt repetitive although I had played through the levels countless times.\n\nIn conclusion, Suguri is a very difficult game with a lot of features that make it feel like it's your fault when you die, not the game's. The game never fails to make me want to try new things and carry on until I finally beat that boss. The only thing that I felt could be improved, was the segments where you were 'indoors' as the bullets kinda glitch when hugging the wall, but thats 2 of 14 segments, so it's really not that big a deal. I'd reccomend it to anyone seeking a challenge and a decent story (towards the end).","July 19, 2015","true","12.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For this reason, I never even made it past the 2nd level and even though I only spent about an hour and a half on this game, I never feel like going back to it.  I would have loved to at least see the rest of the levels, so it would be nice if there were continues on Easy mode.

This is the main thing that completely ruins the game for me. Each time you shoot, you fire a shot (that will usually miss unless you're point-blank) and you'll end up getting hit by other projectiles on screen that were fired at you as you were taking your shot at one of the many enemies on screen. It doesn't help that about half the enemies feel like damage sponges, and your more powerful shots are often blocked by their own missile projectiles.\nThe "dash" feature (i.e. what the "focus" feature would be in other bullet hell games that slows your movement and focuses fire) makes you move very quickly and invulnerable to energy-type bullets, but your movement is nonstop and hard to control, making it more than easy to end up crashing into missile-type bullets.It makes no sense to me as to why the style of gameplay should directly clash with what bullet hell gameplay is set out to be.\n\nIt just feels pathetic when I've beaten other bullet hell games (some even on their respective Hard difficulties) yet can't even beat the first level of this game on easy. I gave this game several chances, and despite my fondness of Orange_Juice and its characters, I can't find any enjoyment in playing this game.","February 3","false","0.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

On the other hand, it had a good spread of cute girls that could murder you in many different ways if you weren't at the peak of skill.\n\nAll that difficulty made beating it so much more worth it.","April 23","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
