It involves quite some good reading and humor. The game gives you lots of choices, like "save the monsterling - or eat it", which in progress develop your character and the storyline.\n\nBesides the many small story bits, its not overly complex, but its very entertaining.\n\nThe Achievements are fun to hunt down and you will need to play through the game several times to get them all. Generally the game has plenty of replayability with its varied small stories, so that is not too much of an issue. I played it several times over and still find new ones. A playthrough shouldn't take more than an hour i guess, maybe less.\n\nIf i had to criticize something, then its probably that its not very long, but i guess that's the way the game was designed, its not meant to be a complex long thing, more something easy to play in between.\n\nAnd i would have loved to be able to design the looks my own monsterling, sadly the game doesn't give that option, i think its random how your monster will look like.\n\nTechnically the game is solid, no bugs or anything that i would have to mention.\nAlso i totally dig the artstyle, but thats personal preference =)\n\nIt also has the best emoticons, so thanks for that.\n( :hee::ooh::hmm::blech::grr: - they dont work in this Review post )\n\nConclusion: This is a very fun small charming game worth to be played =)","September 2, 2014","true","7.8"," 130 of 143 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","130","143","0","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/recommended/226740/","futome","Claire✿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/","322 products in account","It was fun! ...For the first run or two.\n\n\nWell that was upsetting. Monster Loves You! is a text, choose-your-own-adventure game where you start your life out as a newborn baby monster and you live your life up until your return to the slime vat pool or until you finish the game as an elder who transcended above death to decide what ulitimately happens between the humans and monsters when the inevitable conflict happens.\n\nYou have 5 personality traits, Bravery, Cleverness, Ferocity, Honesty, and Kindness. You gain and use your traits to your advantage in situations that require them. This would be awesome if there was actually more situations that required that. Because more or less everything you do it a sure thing. It's pretty obvious if you're going to lose something or gain something from most interactions. I'll continue that shortly.\n\nYou use these personality traits to your advantage to gain respect from other elders and monsters so you may be respected enough as an individual to transcend into becoming an elder on the day you are supposed to die. Then once you are an Elder, you must work to either build or sabotage human and monster relations in the coming days before the conflict of humans and monsters. It is this point I believe the story ends with the effort you put into this before the conflict.\n\nEverything about this game was really cool except that this game doesn't vary or switch up the story at all. By my second playthrough I already knew pathes and things I needed to say to reap the most (xyz) out of that "adventure" So I could get my stats high or close to maxed out as possible while getting tons of respect from the elders. I was hoping that after each death it'd be like a new life with new characters and new adventures. But I kept seeing the same thing over and over again already and it got really tedious and simply not fun. It immediately became apparent that i'd just start grinding to get medals for achievements. I don't care so much about the medals. It's nice to see new endings. But that's not the point of a game like Monster Love You! or at least shouldn't be circled around what the ending is going to be. The meat and soul of the game which is the time spent in each life stage is where you're spending most and pretty much all over your time as opposed to the scripted age-transistion stages. It was like I had a really amazing, fan-friggin-tastic sandwich, and in two playthroughs I felt like I was eating the same sandwich for months. I was so sick of it.\n\nContining on that point is that you get really familiar with each adventure pretty easily, they're very distinct and memorable most of them. And the options listed make it very obvious which choice is going to get you the most points and the good stuff.\nI was investing in honesty and kindness to achieve renown for honesty and kindness in the game, but I knew the choices in the game so well and understood where I could get off chalk-free in two playthroughs I already knew where I could build ferocity without consequence. I had kindness and cleverness maxed, I had honesty about 86% up there and I had roughly 69% ferocity. I shouldn't be able to get my ferocity stat so high while striving to get honesty and kindness. Cleverness was just so easy to pick up. It made it super-easy to bend the end game to my will because I had such high stats overall I could make the story anything I wanted it to be. Therefore there was really no reason to keep playing the game. Because in two playthroughs I could understand the routes I need to take to get the most (xyz) and how to get the medals and other things.\n\nIt as a really fun game my first two runs. After that, it just simply wasn't fun. Definitely wasn't worth the money I paid for it, I expected much more out of it after reading such nice reviews.\n\nAlso continuing, from what i've heard in the game, sounds like the game has only 3 soundtracks in it. And that's just a big no-no. The art directive is okay. They could've worked harder in a lot of areas, but whatever. The humor in this game is great. But it's not funny after you read it the first time.\n\n\nRegardless, Monster Loves You! is a nice and funny and enjoyable game. But after the second playthrough or third, you realize you're just doing the same thing again and it's not fun. I was really hoping that my deaths in the game would have an influence on my next life (which I read this in a review, this was a lie or a fabrication of their beliefs of what's going on in the game) But it doesn't and that's when I realized I was going to just be doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nOverall, this game wasn't worth the money I paid for it, I bought it for about 4 dollars and I personally just wouldn't really recommend it at all to be honest. As I said, it's fun and it's nice. But I personally think you should keep that money for something nicer that pops up on the steam store or in a steam sale that you'd rather grab.\n\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading my review. I hope it helped you in your decision to purchase this game or not, have a good day.","November 9, 2014","false","1.9"," 63 of 75 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","63","75","6","8"

The prompts and narratives have a sense of humour all their own and it makes for a delightful read.

You guide your monster through stages of its life, your actions determining your monster's attributes, such as ferocity, cleverness, and bravery.\n\nWhile each stage of life has multiple short adventures to take your monster on, they rarely influence each other, beyond some of them becoming easier depending on which 'stats' you've leveled up beforehand. It isn't until the latter of the game, which you may or may not reach due to your decisions in game, where you begin having an influence on anything beyond your monster village and the woods around it.\n\nMonster society is darkly humour- black comedy abounds. You meet many different fairytale creatures and have an opportunity to try and befriend or viciously murder and eat all of them. The soundtrack and visuals are bright and cartoonish, and fit perfectly.\n\nEach play-through will take you about twenty to thirty minutes, depending on how fast of a reader you are, and getting most of the endings is pretty intuitive.

Because that's what this game feels like to me. Except there's five kinds of stats and a mid level boss dependent entirely on dice rolls. It is based around living the life of a monster from birth to death, but it doesn't go far enough with it. Because of that, all the conversation forks are based around me asking myself 'Do I want more Furious Fred or Smarty Sammy points?'. It's kinda fun to experience once, maybe twice if you choose to sacrifice your monster at the midpoint of the game, and after that it's just about rote achievement hunting.","November 7, 2013","false","5.2"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","27","43","0","3"

The artwork is  colorful, lovely, and charming, reminding me of picture books that I read at a young age. The music is quirky and fits with the game quite well.

It's a choose-your-own-adventure type of game, starting you as a monsterling that was just born. With multiple stats (initially at zero), your actions will lead to the community respecting you (or not) and increasing statistical values about your personality (bravery, cleverness, etc.).\n\nThis is simple but, again, rather adictive. After 6 hours and about 8 (?) playthroughs I'm still getting newer and newer stories as I go along, which adds the replay value of the game (besides the fact that it possesses 14(!!) ending, to my knowledge).\n\nGraphically it's just multiple backgrounds with no real animations (unless you click your monster avatar, which will make him jump and say weird ♥♥♥♥ xD), so to review graphics, I'd really review one thing:\n\nUI (INTERFACE)\nNothing short of great. Buttons are clear, with something indicating what the story behind each clickable button may consist of. A scared monster face may lead to a story about investigating a human house, for example. Nothing more to say, really, informative, simple and slick, the UI excells in this adventure game unlike for of its genre.\n\nAUDIO\nWith no voice acting, that leads the music which is kind of a few tracks that repeat themselves. They are pretty good and chilling, suiting the happy and cute atmosphere the game transmits.\n\nSTORY\nBarely got anything to say about it:\n\nYou start -> You're born.\nGame ends -> You shifted the course of the world, creating an endless war between monsters and humans, or united them into one civilization filled with compassion and honor between eachother. OR you simply died, recognized for the trait you leveled up the most (braveness for example).\n\nThis allows for alot of replayability considering you like the style and the atmosphere of the game. Since it's pretty much YOUR story, relatability to the main character resides in you and only you. It's well done and the cuteness of your activities, monster reactions, UI design and drawing  give the game a MASSIVE boom of charm and interest to the player. This is precisely where you'll find the best part of the game. The juxtaposition of the charming style and the story make the game worth, in my opinion a purchase at any price equal or below its base one (9,99€).\n\nThe emoticons are expensive as ♥♥♥♥, tho. Anyway, I digress. Game's fully worth it for it's uniqueness among the genre. A solid 8/10 for me!\n\nP.S: Kinda weird steam updated it's review system and forgot the much asked "meh button", the score system introduction and all that...\nThe game is amazing and has nothing to do with said "Meh" button, but still... this review system still feels rather barebones and Valve sure has the potential to make this a great environment for a complex but useful review system (since any idiot can hop on Metacritic for example and bash a game they don't like, like Call of Duty (and that does happens to CoD, we all know it!)).\n\nAnyway, just my 2 cents...","May 3","true","10.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","2"

I would play this with a child. We would learn a lot in how to get along with others and for that I have a positive view of Monster Loves You! For a parent, this is probably a good game to play with their children.\n\nBut it is far too short to justify a $10 pricetag. There is simply not enough content to justify it.\n\nAnother thing worth considering is that your actions, generally, provide few negative consequences. You would have to actively seek out the worst possible answer to even reach the worst endings within this game. There is simply no challenge, though in retrospect, that may have been the point.\n\nHowever, given the lack of content, this only serves to hurt the game instead of actually reinforcing the gaming experience, gaming being used very liberally in this situation.\n\nI really do like this game. I appreciated the variety in the scenarios and the writing was very cute. However, there is simply not enough to do in this game and the things to do don't provide any measure of challenge. I found myself with most of stats being maxed out without any active consideration towards any stat but one.\n\nIt was honestly harder for me to not get both Human and Monster relationships up to 100%. It just seemed like this was too easy and even though I'm not expecting something difficult on the level of some other Steam games, it just felt like this game was handing everything to me.\n\nSo, sure, buy this game and play it with your kids. But, honestly, there could have been so much more and for that, I cannot recommend buying this.","September 3, 2014","false","1.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

You live your life, ascending to elderhood and beyond, making a difference into the world of humans and monsters.\n\nThe Pros  Adventure  - The fact that the endings are so different and unique with each choice you make and each gamethrough - makes the process of playing fun.\nSoundtrack  - The music is smoothing and relaxing, the ambient changes as to the situation you are in and the different stages of your monster.\nThe achivements  - It has very easy to obtain achivements. All the 14 achivements are game related and are based on the way you make your choices, the tricky part is that you have to play the game again for 14 times in order to get all the achivements - dictating the end of you life as a monster. Don't worry - completing the game with all the achivements takes around 5 - 6 hours.\nThe price  - The game is always found in either different budles or at 50% off. The low prices you might find at sales or coupons justify the buy.\nPhone  - You can play this game on your telephone, be it Android or IPhone.You can enjoy all the stages of the evolving your monster at the comfort of your bed, on your phone.\nThe BONUS  - You can become a Neurosurgeon, also one of the achivements, with just some simple choices and without needing any medical preparations! The Cons   Trading Cards  - I loved this game and I wanted to craft the badge but the spicy price the trading cards have made me think twice. Though the perks of having a badge in this amazing indie game made the damage minimal. Though, if you want to sell the trading cards you can get in on a big advantage and I recommend you do this.\nRepetitive Gaming  - Even though I liked to play it for 14 times, it got boring. The scenes dont change, the characters dont change, the challenges dont change, the musin doesn't change. The only difference is the 5 minutes at the end where all the magic happens.\nThe personality  - As you make different choices you upgrade your Kindness, Bravery, Ferocity, etc. The fact that you don't know  which  one of them you upgrade can also lead to removing points from others(such as +1 Ferocity, -2 Kindness).\nConclusion Did I like this game? A lot!\nDo I recommend this game? Yes.\nIt has so many posibilities and over 900 choices to make - Devour a little girl, help a wounded deer, eat three little pigs, ASCEND TO BECOME AND ELDER AND LEAD THE MONSTER TO ANIHILATE THE HUMANS, and so on.This game is worth purchasing.","January 3, 2015","true","4.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I was interested in this game after discussing it with my brother, who had seen a playthrough by YouTube personalities Game Grumps. A few days later, this game was the Steam Daily Deal.\n\nIf you like super casual gameplay, choose-your-own-adventures, and text-based games, then you will enjoy Monsters Loves You!\n\nThe game is extremely short - I completed one playthrough in less than 45 minutes. Keep in mind, however, that I read A LOT and can read considerably quickly.\n\nThe aesthetics (like most other elements of this game) are fairly casual with a small pool of recycled pictures and text. The detail in the scenery is good, and your monster's appearance varies greatly and seems to be determined by the initial options you select. The music is suprisingly good, and the ending background music in particular adds a majestic, urgent feel to the gameplay.\n\nThe controls just involve you to click, and the learning curve is minimal. There is no apprent tutorial, however, many of the options have a "help" button that you can click, allowing things to be explained without progressing the story - in dialogue options, this is usually presented as the top/first option (clicking it will provide you with additional situational information without continuing the story).\n\nI have to stress that gameplay is extremely casual, and since this is a text-based game, you will have to really rely on your imagination to fill in the details. Readers interested in the theme will probably like this game, however, if you do not read regularly (especially for recreational purposes) you may find this game to be very boring.\n\nAlmost every decision you make in the game will result in you obtaining (or even losing) different stat points like bravery, respect, ferocity, honesty, etc. For example, fighting a bear and winning may give you points in bravery, ferocity, and respect. Besides respect, every monster stat is represented on the bottom of the screen in the form of different icons, and you can click each one to give you additional information. You can level all stats to a maximum of 100.\n\nThe stats are important for the end-game, where many of your actions are dependent on your stat scores (ex: to successfully fught off an opponent you need a high bravery/ferocity rating). Furthermore, respect is extremely important for getting other monsters on your side, especially in political situations. While the "politics" element really interested me, remember that this is an extremely casual game, and the politicial intrigue is reflectively minimal. Most of the politics involves your interactions with both the human and monster communities, and the end-game (if you get that far) will add two new gauges - the "how humans view monsters" and "how monster view humans" meters (maximum value of 100).\n\nRespect is critical for the end-game, where your decisions will determine which particular ending you receive.\n\nEach "phase" of the monster's life cycle is broken up, and you have a fixed amount of turns before you advance to the next stage of life. The last stage requires you to have a high respect rating and/or high character stats.\n\nDuring each "phase," you can go adventuring. I really liked this part, because you only have enough "turns" (represented by days) in each "phase" to go on adventures. When selecting an adventure, you must click on different icons to activate a mission - you are not given any information besides the pictures on each adventure icon. I loved this mechanic because it made things less predictable and also more exciting. I am not sure if the available adventures are randomized for each playthrough, but I have noticed that they can be different each time (it may depend on the initial options you pick right when you start playing).\n\nFor achievement hunters, you will have to do A LOT of playthroughs, since you need to unlock every possible ending. After doing enough playthroughs, you should be able to progress through the game fairly quickly, especially once each adventure icon becomes more and more familiar to you.\n\nThat being said, it is very, very easy for you to become bored of this game if you try to get all the achievements in one (or few) sittings, since all of the decision tree consequences will be known to you. Instead, I strongly suggest you only do one playthrough per sitting, and try to spread the playtime for this game around to keep things fresh. Remember, there is A LOT of text in this game, so avoid it if you do not like reading.\n\nFor choose-your-own-adventure buffs and text-based game lovers, this casual game will fit very well in your libraries. For anyone not interested in those things, you might want to avoid playing this.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","September 3, 2014","true","1.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

As you progress through the story, at certain points in your life you are given adventures to go on. The choices you make in these adventures determine the course of your life, and the overall outcome of the story. There are a wide array of adventures available at each section.\n\nYou might think that this is simply a game for kids, but while kids will enjoy this, it does have some aspects where an adult might understand the more mature themes. It is worth noting however, that the overall playtime for the game is quite low, but trying to get the possible endings & exploring all of the available adventures will bump that time up somewhat.\n\nThe graphics in this game are very nice. Although they are not the most important part. That falls to the text. The story is written in a very nice way, that makes it easy to enage in.\n\nThe game is controlled via a mouse although if you can stream to or play the game on a tablet, it will work much better.\n\nThe music in this game is very nice. It's not too obtrusive and compliments the storylike nature of the game.\n\nSomething I do feel that this game would really benefit from is if there were some way of making user-generated adventures. After several play throughs, you will come accross all of the adventures and end up repeating yourself.\n\nAll in all, ths is a very nice choose your own adventure game which is definitely worth buying. Although, If you don't like reading, then don't buy the game.\n\n\n","November 1, 2014","true","3.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That doesn't mean it's bad, but if you're looking for frenetic gameplay, you won't find it here. Instead, everything in this game hinges on your decisions and how you live your life as a monster.\n\nIf I had to compare MLY to a video game, the closest thing would be a very, very old game called Alter Ego (from 1986, not the 2010 game of the same name). The similarities are striking, with the exception that in MLY you play a monster in a fictional world whereas in AE you were a male or female human in the real world.\n\nAlthough MLY's interface is better than AE's, it lacks the same depth. In AE, you didn't just make decisions and get older, but you could get an education, hold down a job, get married, get pregnant (if you were female), die prematurely, and so on.\n\nI wish MLY had included something like those options as it would've increased the replay value a lot.

Each phase has "mini adventures" from which to choose and then options within the adventures.  The choices drive your "personality"\n\nGood - the little adventures are amusing and there's a semi randomness to what gets offered as a selection in each phase that lends to some replayability.  There are 14 possible outcomes for the end game.  It takes about 10-15 hours of game play to achieve all 14 outcomes.\n\nMy criticism is with the choices lacking materiality on the final outcome.  The choices cause the trait percentages to vary. Basically you get about 30 or so choices and find they lead to one final choice yielding your outcome - you could choose the same 30 adventures/same choices every play through, get to 80% in every trait and about 70% in respect.  (not that you'd do that, but you could and it would not restrict final outcome overly much at all other than neurosurgeon and modest legacy).\n\nBasically the choices at birth/child/teen just arent material enough.  They should cause the final outcomes to be far more restrictve and potentially open up new content.  Instead  all forks in the path lead to what is effectively a common point.\n\nMy second criticism would be the elder phase -  the choices are mundane - one choice will pretty much cause How monsters/humans view one another to go up and the other cause it to go down.  The phase is akin to clicking "help" or "sabotage" buttons 15 times in a row.  The adventures themselves were creative but the choice selections and how they cause ""your own adventure" to evolve in my view lacked creativity.\n\nSummary - The mini adventures are quite amusing but other aspects of the game are lacking.\n\nFor 2-3$ and the replayability of seeing how each choice affects your traits it gets a borderline thumbs up.\n","December 30, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Later in "life", the stat will determine if you will continue to live or die, how well Elders are listening to your advice and what the outcome of the inevitable meeting between Humans and Monsters is going to be (also if you get a career as a disguised neuro surgeon among the humans or not!)\n\nEach lifecycle takes between 20-40 minutes to complete. Later ones take a bit longer if you are going for specific outcomes, as you suddenly need to plan ahead.\n\nAfter playing a lifecycle 3 times, I started noticing a lot of repeated missions/stories, and while the writing is pretty good and quite funny, the repeats are my only real gripe about this game, as it turns an otherwise very nice casual title into a grind for the achievements.","June 8, 2013","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I got it for 1.74 and I'd pay that for this game. It's very simple and one and the  play through is about 30 minutes long. Anyone who likes games like the yawhg & long live the queen should get this.  The game is beautiful and I very much enjoy the cartoony childish artstyle, it really gives a very cute feel to the game which accompanies the cute personalities of the other monsters. The writing is adorable and it really gives you a childish, nice and adorable vibe. Some of the adventures were very similar which made the game feels repetitive but it's still fun to re-play. , I wish there were more adventures were you simply interact with an item and don't do much conflict solving (similar to the red riding hood adventure). Over all the lore of the game was satisfying and easy to get and remember, the town of omen has nice  rustic design  and the mosters look cute and unique and almost a bit eerie, they remind me of monsters inc type monsters. I doubt they'll do updates in the future but I find the game very lacking in  gameplay elements and wish they'd add more.\n\n\n\nHowever ,for a 6.99 game it is very lacking in things to do,  I think some stuff should be added:\n\n- Love arc. Monsterlings are obviously not born via bang bang so love and relationships in this society would be pretty un-needed; However it would be a cute addition to the game and some of the other monsters I would love for my monster to have a relationship with.\n- Unique art for each monster. A lot of art is often reused for different character which makes it hard for me to remember names of who's who. There are about  three different icons for the different monsters, so when they talk I am not sure who is who.\n- Longer days for Monsterling and Adolescent phase. I wish I would have more time to shape the personality of my monster before I went off to being older. The game was the most fun as a monsterling because I really felt like i was making an imprint on my character.\n-More varying scenarios. The different situations you're put in are often very smiliar and you usually have three ways of solving it, via mischeif, fight or smarts. I wish there were more ways to solve a situation and more unique situations to solve. It all felt very repetetitve.\n- Interactive backrounds. It would be fun if you could click in different places of the background and having a reaction. For example clicking on a vase and make it fall over and getting +1 cleverness or something.","September 3, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It in many ways passed my expectations with its beautiful music (love the guitar picking) and great take on a choose your own adventure.  You can blow through the game itself in just under an hour but in truth that fits this game well.  You go through a number of monster life cycle stages and your actions will dictate your monsters personality and ultimate its fate and potentially the world.  As such it approaches things from a childish perspective often which from my perspective is not a complaint but might be for some.   Might be a bit overpriced as while you can replay it I don't believe the quests change.  So yeah there's lots of different endings but even in RPGs i usually stick true to form so having all those choices and endings is great but with no other gameplay to speak of I don't think it would have much value in this case.\n\nA great game with wonderful production values and character just probably overpriced at anything over $5 or if you get it in a bundle.

The game is strangely addictive and I find myself wanting to see all the endings.\n\nThe UI looks and feels like a mobile app. It consists of large, easy to press, buttons on a simple background. The buttons come in two different types, pictures which are somehow related to an action, and dialogue for different choices and tests.\n\nThe game play is simple, you click a button, read some text, and see how your choices modify your stats. You go through several development phases, starting as a baby slime and moving up through full fledged elder monster. If you make it to the end, you can decide the fate of monsters and humans.\n\nThe choices and options can get repetitive over multiple playthroughs. This is particularly frustrating since auto-saving means you you need to start from the beginning each time you attempt to get a new ending. As there are 14 different endings, I really wish there was some sort of save or rewind functionality so that you could skip the earlier phases.\n\nAs long as you don’t mind eating children or kittens it's a good game to kill some time.\n","August 31, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is very similar to the old game Alter ego (which you can play for free here: http://www.playalterego.com/alterego). I really love games in which you are responsible for the actions you make. There are every new quest new choices to make. If you decide to be brave you will receive +bravery points. This will have influence on option that are available later on in the game. For example if you want to impress certain Monsters or Humans you need to roll two dices (based on yoru bravery) to see if you are succesful.\n\nIt is very easy to build up your personality points, and some options are really obvious what the outcome will be. The quests results are a bit predictable at times. But nevertheless it is a cute game which i enjoyed very much. Although for a very short time. You can finish this game in under an hour. Of course there are many other paths to take and endings to see.\n\nPros:\n- Decisions, decisions, everything comes down to decisions.\n- Humorous and fun to read.\n- Different endings.\n\nCons:\n- Very short.\n- Decisions have only influence on your personality not on the overal storyline.\n- Text-based.","July 11, 2013","true","3.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Whilst it’s easy to discount it as a child’s game, given it is based around a colourfully-lit interactive story, the truth is that the complexity of the narrative is as apparent or discreet as you allow it to be. You can take the time to think out your responses with an end goal in sight, or just haphazardly click on whatever sounds good at the time and get a result. With roots in storytelling and even text-based adventure games, Monster Loves You! is a charming and unique title that will take most gamers 30-45 minutes to play through, but getting all the endings will take more than a little thought and time.\n\nCheck out my full review[shoddypixels.com].","January 5, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game could have been promising if, Crusader Kings style, when playing as a monster born after the previous one the impact of the previous monster could be felt, but every time you start as a new monster, it is as though you had never played the game before.  The game teases social changes in monster society, but since the game never advances forward in time, it's all just window dressing, as no matter what everything will be reset once your current monster dies.  Given that each playthrough is extremely brief, the result is a shallow experience.  Most of the endings are basically stamps for finishing a brief runthrough with a monster who had a certain combination of stats.\n\nYour choices in the game affect your monster's personality, but your monster's personality stats do not have much effect overall.  As far as I can tell, when you begin a new game you get a randomly selected monster image to act as your monster's avatar.  Unfortunately, unlike other monster raising games (like the genre-creating Tamagotchi, cutting age software from the year of our lord 1998) your monster's personality and disposition do not affect its appearance.  Your monster's personality stats affect skill checks in the "Elder" segment of the game, and in a few places before, but once you get to the Elder segment the game allows you to choose your best stat for use in skill checks, meaning you will pass every one that you attempt.\n\nAnother complaint is that the game features a few recurring characters, but events show an image of a generic monster whose emotion is meant to represent the emotional energy of the scene.  It would have been nice for these images to show the recurring character that is involved in the scene instead.\n\nThis game has a lot going for it - the art is fun and the interface is fine.  The monster society has some fun ideas behind it.  But unless the game can get more interactive, I cannot recommend it to others.","September 8, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As far as I can tell there's no real failure state, just different outcomes. What's shockingly bad about this game is it's length, it only took me about 40 minutes to get to the end of the game, From what I can tell there's only three endings, and they could all be written on the back of a stamp. A lot of the game is conveyed through writing, which confuses me for such a childlike game, that seemingly is made for children, it lacks a lot in any form of animation, which is surprising considering most VNs have characters change pose occasionally. Another thing is this game is boring, the effects of your actions never feel like they have much of an effect on the gameplay until the end, and most of the options are pretty much 1:good, 2:bad, 3:nuetral.\n\nIn summary: A boring VN that doesn't last long and fails to have more than three cookie cutter options and endings.

This is partially offset by the fact that there appear to be more options that will appear in a single playthrough, and that you won't be able to ever pick all of the options every time either.  The inclusion of Achievements and Cards give some added depth, but some of the Achievements appear to be based on failing in some scenarios so it's not always apparent what might need to be done for the Achievement Hunter.\n\nThe soundtrack is minimalist, but the solo accoustic guitar  is pleasant and quite nice, and matches the style of the artist very well.  A glaring omission, here, is the lack of a purchaseable soundtrack (at the time of this writing).  The artwork is quite lovely, and the whimsical nature of it nicely matches the intent of the game.  It is static, with only a few things that move -- mostly the clickable hotspots so that it's apparent what will actually give a response from the game -- but it feels like a callback to old adventure or even the old solely text-based games so I don't find that a bad thing.\n\nThe writing is excellent, though you'll most likely find yourself skipping some sectiions as the become more familiar.  It may be a good game to play with your developing reader, though I highly recommend you play it a few times, yourself, as some of the game can wander to the dark or violent (You ARE a monster, after all.) and your mileage may vary as to what's appropriate for your own child.","November 7, 2013","true","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's more of a choose-your-own-adventure kind of thing. There is no platforming, no questing, no inventory, no racing. And that's completely fine.\n\nThat said, if you've ever enjoyed books that allowed you to choose your own adventure, you're bound to love this. There are a lot of options and outcomes, all done in a cartoonish and clever style. Don't be fooled by the presentation though, this is not quite what you'd call a "kid's game".\n\nWhile there is no voice acting, the options you're presented with all have distinct feeling to them, which plays great with idea of shaping your monster from a morsel to an Elder. The various personality traits - such as bravery, ferocity, kindness - increase or decrease depending on your choices. Your options for the final outcome are determined by how high or how low these traits actually are. This also gives MLY plenty fo replaybility, as there are plenty of different outcomes each granting an in-game emblem as well as an achievement. Great for trophy hunters.\n\nI definitely recommend getting this if you're looking for something mellow and relaxing to pass time with. Each "run" is about 30-60 minutes long, depending on what scenarios you receive and how fast you read.\n\nHowever, know what you're getting into. I cannot stress this enough. Do not get this if you're looking to jump on platforms, or shoot things, or race vehicles - or do anything other than read and choose reactions to the situations presented. It does just this one thing, but it does it really well.","January 4, 2014","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Replayability is fairly high, but that is because you can play an entire game in about half an hour if you take your time and read through all the mini-plots.\nMonster Loves You! seems more like a mobile app than a full-fledged PC game, and I'm sure it could easily be ported to mobile devices if it hasn't already been. Once you've played through the game, most of the surprise is gone - none of the achievements are horribly difficult to get (well, maybe the Advanced Neurosurgeon one), and after you've gone through those, you'll move on to something else, but look back on Monster Loves You! with a heart-felt "Heh".","December 24, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The choices you make do matter and effect your endings and you can get multiple endings out of the game. Your monster that you play as can look completely rediculous (in a good way) but does not always match the storyline. "You shred Nash Nash with your claws." But a decent number of monsters that you end up with actually have no claws, sometimes not even arms at all! This can be frusturating but it in no ways makes the game unplayable, at least for me. Having a blob for a monster that is supposed to be able to climb, claw, bite and run around is a bit disapointing. I did enjoy the game very much so and will play it again every once in a while just for the memories and fun even though I would know EVERYTHING about the game and have unlocked every ending.","June 13, 2013","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You start of in a cauldron of goo and work your way up to adulthood. The game itself is as short as that description. The first time I finished it it took me just under an hour. That's the main drawback of the game, short as hell.\nMonster loves you is a Visual Novel. The art although I regret not getting to see much of it during the story, mainly because the dialog boxes covered the images is what you would find in a children's book but not to childish to stop anyone else from playing it in that regard.\nWhat do you get to do? All you do is click dialog boxes. What do these boxes contain? Text of course. Just joking. This is the core of the game. You grow up based on the choices you made starting from day 1. The shortness of the game is countered by a decent ammount of choices that you get.\nVerdict time. I for one got this on a -50% sale and got exactly what I signed up for. An amusing story that did not drag on to the point clicking a dialog box becomes a chore. I couldn't wait to click and read what my choice did and let me tell you, some of the choices you get to make are either hillarious on their own or the result is.\nIf I were to give it a score I would go for around 8 / 10, and as always that's the grade according to how much they achieved and how much more they could have.","June 12, 2013","true","1.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/d0ugyt/recommended/226740/","d0ugyt","D0ugyT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/d0ugyt/","413 products in account","The first video game I played was GTA3, all the way back in 2001, on the PS2. I didn't enjoy it very much (and still don't enjoy GTA-style games in general). The second game I ever played was much better - Age of Empires 2, on the PC. Why do I bring this up? Because it's important to note that I started playing video games well beyond the era of the text-based adventures and RPG's of the 80's. Which is important to note because Monster Loves You! is essentially a text-based adventure game, albiet one that doesn't require typing and has a graphical interface.\n\nIt's definitely a solid game, with a clearly defined goal that you're working towards, and it's probably the right length for a modern text-based adventure. The graphical interface is cutesy enough, and is very effective in capturing the player's interest. The game also successfully incorporates some clever RPG-like stat-building, with a series of stats that can be raised or lowered depending on the conversation options the player chooses. All these elements combine into a lighter game that will be enjoyed more by casual gamers than those that play more seriously.\n\nWhich is why I can't recommend this game; most people on Steam simply won't enjoy it for long enough to get their money's worth. While I enjoyed it, that was only for 51 minutes; I have no desire to play through the game again. That's not the fault of the game, moreso the fault of the genre. Gamers have simply moved on from the days of the text-based adventure, and now prefer their RPG stats to be accomponied by a 3-dimensional world that they experience through the eyes of a character they make. If you enjoy text-based adventures or more casual games, than this is a game that you'll get multiple hours of enjoyment from. Otherwise, the stat-building and graphical depiction of the story simply won't be enough to keep you captivated beyond the first playthrough.","February 17, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Depending on your choices (presented as text options) you'll progress into branched mini-stories, receiving or losing points in a serie of traits like Bravery, Cleverness, Cruelty, Kindness and so forth.\n\nFrom an adult perspective, the game might seem unchallenging and you'll really enjoy the last part, dedicated to politics and community management. But from a child perspective, the game offers alot of behaviors to explore, and to learn that choices have consequences - both in short and long term. And it's possible to be really really mean too - you're a monster after all and nobody will punish you for that.\n\nThe art is cartoony and childish (of course), and the langage proper to the young audience.

All things considered, mediocre at best.\n\nThis short, light hearted narritave driven game aims to tell a notably different story every playthrough based on your actions.  Unfortunately, the story is broken up into tens of small, fairly mundane story arcs, which are generally kept very separate.  One's actions have little effect on future story arcs, with only the occasional action which benefits from high stats in certain areas.  Additionally, the overarching plot is weak.  It lacks substance.  Very little that happens in the tiny sub-arcs actually seem related to the main story-line at all, and the climax of the game seems to have little to no build up.  It just suddenly happens after you've complete the requisite amount of missions.  Every aspect of the game I can think to name lacks depth:  the interactive elements, the characters, the story, the visuals (there are only a few images used the entire game).  Further, despite the attempt to make a story that is adaptive to the player's choices, the lack of content makes the replay value extremely low, so expect to only get a couple hours out of this game.  It only says I have 10 hours because I accidentally left it on over night.\n\nTL;DR:\nHighly lacking in content, with a surprisingly bland story.  Mediocre at best.","January 14, 2015","false","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it isn't. At first I worried that my decisions could wound, if not destroy, my character - such as life is. However, there was no threat. I was worried that a lot of decisions might have flip-side effects that make decisions far more difficult than they seem, but they're not.\nI was really looking forward to fleshing out my character and choosing between eating children, becoming an outcast creature or building friendships and skills such as Alter Ego that this game, I am guessing, is heavily built from. But it's not.\n\nI played through the whole thing - including reading and considering every decision - in an hour. Yes, there's replay value to be sure, but for no other reason than to get achievements and a pat on the back for clicking the right, very terribly obvious, buttons.\n\nIt's a shame that the developers didn't do more with this. There was such a great possibility here.\n\nIn the last stage of the game, you're offered two icons with a %. One is how much monsters like humans, and the other how much humans like monsters. You just have to press some buttons to get these in the direction you want, for the outcome you want. If you balanced your character throughout the game - which isn't very difficult, I wound up with 90%+ in all on the first go, you've got no problems with this "Grand Finale".\n\nIt's fun to play for the first couple of stages, and the dialogue is actually very well written, and the graphics are comically wonderful - however, this only reaches out to the child side of me.

Your monster earns trait points and respect for the things they do and how they choose to approach them--and sometimes you choose poorly.\n\nA monster lifetime will take you about 30-60 minutes to play through.  Different scenarios will present themselves--some of which are referred to later on.  The stories are delightful.  They fit in to fairy tales and it's suitable for children--though there is a death component to the game.\n\nThe music is breezy and sets the mood.

There's not much to the storyline: This is a simple text-based Choose Your Own Adventure that allows you to roleplay through a limited number of story endings.

This may be a good game for people with anxiety who need a quick distraction at night. It doesn't take much attention of commitment to play, so it's easy to spend a few minutes clicking through the story and letting the music do its work.\n\n$9.99 is a rather steep price tag for such a simple game, though.

But Back to the Here and Now.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe Gameplay is more like a classic text adventure. Much to read and at the end you get a collection of things your character can do. For better visualisation you have beautiful handdrawn background, depending on your current location. To make every choice in this game more worthwhile (and to compansate the missing feature of running around in the world and exchanging things for something you could actually use on your adventure) there is a little stats-based system build into it. Nothing much, it keeps track of various characteristica that change depending on the decisions you make. And it actually doesn't do anything else in the game, it's only needed at the end to calculate which ending you will receive, which can range from tragic to hilarious, if you play your cards right. But more of that later.\n\nStory\n\nYou start your adventure in a giant green pool of goo. Soon you will grow arms, and legs, and wings? Maybe. You can help those little things around you, or just eat them. And when you have grown strong enough you will embark from the slimy goo, seeing the light of the sun for the first time, and begin your new life as a little Monsterling.\nThe Story follows you through your life from a little monsterling to your adulthood and eventually your death (and even beyond if you meet certain criteria). In every life stage you receive a collection of adventures you can go on, each one takes a day from your clock until it's time to grow up. But careful here. You have more adventures than days, so you can't take on all of them, the adventures are only presented as icons, and many adventures share the same icon. So you can only guess what you will encounter there. This system will go through all 3 life stages. As little monsterling you learn the ropes of being a monster and rarely leave you broodchamber. During your childhood / Teenager times you learn something about the outside world and how dangerous and fascinating humans can be. Those humans should be on a modern day level. Your adulthood begins with an initiation rite to determine what kind of task you will do in the monsterworld. It's calculated from the stats you build up in your life, but doesn't add anything to your further adventure. You just live your life and do tasks inside and outside of the monster settlement. At the End it's time for you to return to the pool of goo you came from and pass on your memories to the monsters of the next generation. Or, if you did something right with your life, you may receive an oppurtunity to become an elder and just maybe doing some great deeds out there.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat you can expect from Monster Loves You! is a fairytale like adventure game which let you see such stories from quite a different perspective. And maybe you encounter characters like Puss in Boots, or Hänsel and Gretel. The Art is exceptionally well made and the fact that each playthrough will have different adventures and outcomes you gain a certain replaybility. So give it a try and choose your own little twisted fairytale.\n\n\nIf you want to get a better look at a playthrough of this game just click the link below:\nhttp://youtu.be/pX7Gbe8U7gI?list=UUMxIS2guRxfCuJ1gllMecuA\n\nFor more Reviews visit my Blog at:\nhttp://achievementunlockblog.wordpress.com/home/","September 24, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have run through the game 15 times, and have yet to explore every scenario, let alone every dialogue option of every scenario.\n- The humour is great.  It can be a bit crass or gross at times, but you *are* playing as a monster.\n- I like that you can mold your character's personality as you go, so if you don't want to be a mean monster you don't have to be.\n- Each game takes just 15-60 minutes (depending on how fast you are clicking through the text), so it doesn't feel like a slog to keep trying for new endings.

The reason is that even though you don't always get the same quests, after awhile they do start to repeat...so after the first couple of playthroughs it gets a bit, well, repetitive .\nNot only that but there is no save feature, meaning that to get every ending you have to play through the entire game each time.\n\nOtherwise this is a quirky and enjoyable choose your own adventure and definitely worth a look, especially if you can catch it on sale.","April 16, 2015","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The quality of the game feels like something similar to Telltale Games (and that's a good thing). The makers of this game put in many different paths into this game so that you can get a different end result for every different response that you give to a situation. For example, I chose the honest path and was rewarded with a nice ending. You can choose to be mean to other monsters or be loving, choose between being nice to humans or tricking your fellow monsters into thinking that they're evil. Overall, this is an incredible game and I would highly suggest buying it. I got this as a part of the Humble Bundle and I wasn't 100% sure what I was getting.

Depending on your choices (presented as text options) you'll progress into branched mini-stories, receiving or losing points in a serie of traits like Bravery, Cleverness, Cruelty, Kindness and so forth.\n\nFrom an adult perspective, the game might seem unchallenging and you'll really enjoy the last part, dedicated to politics and community management. But from a child perspective, the game offers alot of behaviors to explore, and to learn that choices have consequences - both in short and long term. And it's possible to be really really mean too - you're a monster after all and nobody will punish you for that.\n\nThe art is cartoony and childish (of course), and the langage proper to the young audience. Even if the total play time for a character's life is short (about an hour), it's possible to come back once in a while to have fun guiding another creature in the path you've chosen.","February 10, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The whole story is played through reading little vignettes about moments in your monster's life then deciding what it's going to do at that moment. When it's still a baby your choices will mostly just effect its own personality, but as it gets older the things you decide will also come to determine how much other monsters respect it and eventually how well their tribe gets along with their closest neighbors.\n\nThe game contains much more replay value than you might expect; you never get enough turns in a stage of life to pick every story to read through and it's also randomly (as far as I can tell) chosen what stories will be available for you in each new game, so if you start a new playthrough you'll find plenty of new scenarios to play through as well as being able to make different choices in ones you've drawn before.\n\nI would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants something light and fun to kill a couple hours.","August 3, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're tasked with answering a few questions and solving a few problems in order to determine a personality. Your personality is essentially your skills, and how you answer the problems and questions will determine your skill level.

This is essentially that, but as a videogame, with a visible character for you to be. You evolve with your actions, leveling your personality and form depending on your choices. It is a highly fun game, with plenty of replay value--though I do warn you should always click on whatever new adventure you have possible to avoid repetition. It's definitely more akin to a book then a game, so don't hop in expecting a average 'point and click adventure'. Another slight warning; This game is very child-friendly from what I've played so far, but does depict death and the 'natural cycle of life'. I feel as if it covered the topic wonderfully (Especially if you choose to 'delay' near the end, and talk with the monsterling.), which may actually be a plus for parent's who aren't quite sure how to explain such complicated matters to children. An average playthrough is roughly one-hour long, but the game is definitely replayable for at least two more times (possibly not in the same day, however.) In the end, I highly reccomend it for both it's nostalgic feeling, and general entertainment.","March 19","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The quality of the game feels like something similar to Telltale Games (and that's a good thing). The makers of this game put in many different paths into this game so that you can get a different end result for every different response that you give to a situation. For example, I chose the honest path and was rewarded with a nice ending. You can choose to be mean to other monsters or be loving, choose between being nice to humans or tricking your fellow monsters into thinking that they're evil. Overall, this is an incredible game and I would highly suggest buying it. I got this as a part of the Humble Bundle and I wasn't 100% sure what I was getting.

Being short and shallow is forgivable, but an added lack of replayability should put anyone off the 10 euro price tag.\n\nIn any other story game, what you do locks you into a distinct route through the story. Befriended a certain character, choose to pick up a sword and take the route through the creepy forest? You can be sure that character will remember, you're more likely to become a swordfighter and you might learn something in the forest that you can use later on. Sure, there might be some statistics involved, as you'll need strength to handle your sword and maybe at least 20+ survivalism to make it through the forest, but these are the things that bind you to the story. It sets you on a certain path that creates a mood, an understanding of the world, expectation of what happens next and gets you exclusive endings unavailable somewhere else that makes you feel like it was worth investing. It makes you feel the game/story recognizes you and entertains you with how it accomadates your unique choices and personality.\n\nMonster loves You has none of that. The game has three to four chapters, one for each stage of your life. In each stage, you have the choice out of some 20 adventures, with you having the time to go on some 12. All of them are already unlocked straight from the get go and they have no bearing on what kind of monster you are or on what what choices you've made before as a story. Being the goal of the game, they each raise your stats by a bit and by the third chapter certain adventures require your stats to be at a certain level before you can succeed to gain... more stats. By the fourth chapter, you can proceed to use your stats to crudely manipulate the outcome of the game and get the different endings by... raising or lowering new stats with the correct stats.\n\nYou can randomly kill one day and spare the other. You can get nearly killed by humans at the start of your life and then get a happy ending with the humans at the end, without any explanation. It just is... because of stats. Other monsters don't actively recognize your past actions. As long as you pick the right buttons to make the correct gauges go up, and regardless of who you are, you can work yourself up towards any available outcome. Sure, sticking to a specific personality gets you furthest, but only because you can't possibly level all the stats and being consistent at least raises enough of them to succeed to pass checks.\n\nIt deprives the game of personality and the feeling you're interacting with a living world, when the two of you simply don't react to each other in a way that is based on story.\n\n\nThat said, the game looks okay if you like the artstyle and I can vouch that the writing is actually kind of great, but as a game or an interactive story, it fails abysmally with shallow mechanics.","December 18, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's largely narrative based, with short, charming/macabre episodes to play through, and shape your monster and  the world with it. Short playthroughs, lots of variation, adorable graphics.\n\nOne of the most enjoyable casual games out there, for my money, if narrative based games are your cup of tea.

Your life starts in a tank of slime and while growing up you gain different amounts of personality traits (bravery, cleverness, ferocity, honesty, and kindness) and the respect from other monsters based on the desicions you make as monsterling, adolescent and fully grown monster. If you are sufficiently respected you may continue your monster career as an elder, or you get recycled in the tank. You may even go on to achieve great accomplishments in the diplomatic interactions between monsters and men. You can write monster history!\n\nMonster Loves You! is a cute little game, or rather a cute little interactive story, where the choices you make matters. It is very nice in small doses, but after a couple of lifetimes the little adventures you experience starts getting a bit repetitive. The same can be said about the music. It is interesting that the way some choices influence the personality are not immediately obvious, but that they start to make sense after a while when more is learnt about monster life. The storyline is inventive and clever and the monsters are cute to look at. Monster Loves You! offers a relaxed escape from the human reality.","May 17","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game consists of many small storylets which you can choose a respone to, and are then rewarded with stat points corresponding to that response. These stat points make up the “personality” of your monster, and later may determine how much other monsters respect you, and ultimately your ending.\n\nI generally like things like raising sims and CYOA games, so I was kind of surprised by how little I enjoyed this game. Overall, I see two major issues with it: it lacks meaningful choices, and it’s too long for what it is. Most of the storylets described rather mundane events (i.e. should I save my friend from bullies, or join in on beating him up), so seeing alternative resolutions to those wasn’t especially interesting. And there doesn’t appear to be any real consequence to raising a ferocious monster versus a kind monster, aside from gathering achievements.\n\nCYOA-type stat building games can be fun if they don’t overstay their welcome (for example, The YAWHG), but I found myself getting pretty bored by about the halfway point of each playthrough of this game.\n","February 11","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it would have benefited from allowing save games so you could save-scum your way into many of the endings (without having to start over each time). The transition animation between menus really got to me after a while too. So, I don't think it's worth $10, but if it's on sale it might be worth it.","April 8, 2013","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked the idea, chilled and had fun while playing BUT the gameplay is only 40 minutes long with 0 replay value. I mean, you can replay the game for the sake of getting different ending (achievements), but basically you'll be facing exact same choices all over again and giving a different answer each time.","March 17","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
