So when you work your way up to commander of your entire race it feels like you've earned it, and the journey feels so much better.\n\nThe game takes a bunch of themes and ideas and actually blends it together quite well, I'm surprised this game was able to be at all fun given the scope of the game and the indie developer.\n\nFirst off you got your ground battles. These are fun because each faction requires a (semi) different plan of attack.\nSalvation? Maybe try getting into melee range so you can beat the crap out of them without worrying about their shields.\nFree Nations? They're the Jack-Of-All trades for this setting, with pretty good speed, melee, and firepower, but nothing to special of their own. Try using your factions unique abilities to get the edge.\nDrone Unity? Keep your distance and try to pick them off that way. They're slow, so strafe/flank them.\nWyr? Target the guys placing the turrets first so you don't get overwhelmed. Use AOE to try damaging them and their turrets as well.\nAliens? AH ♥♥♥♥ FIRE EVERYTHING HOLY ♥♥♥♥\n\nNext is your space battles, which offer much less complexity. All ships fire the same missiles and have the same attack patterns, but the general battling is still fun.\n\nThird is bounty hunting, which are space battles, except the targets are all different and have different abilities, and you have to find your mark and take him on alone. Shakes it up a little, and its cool to unleash your inner Space Cowboy (actually this kind of ends like Cowboy Bebop too) but they're the same bounties for all factions, and I don't get that at all.\nWhy does the Drone Unity care about some guy desecrating corpses? Last I checked I'm exterminating the human race, shouldn't I hire this guy instead?\n\nFourth is when you become leader of your faction, and that's awesome, because it turns into a (albeit simple) strategy game where you can still go in with your troops and fire lasers at robots. You then invade colonies to secure resources, build up your defenses to protect your own from others, destroy billion dollar enemy space stations, and generally try to ruin everyone elses' day.\n\nFifth is when you investigate spooky wormholes and alien planets, trying to piece the titular Salvation Prophecy together and collecting runes that give you sweet powers during land battles.\nEver wanted to summon a space T-Rex to destroy those murder-bots threatening the human race? Well ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it, SP is your game.\n\nThe time before the end game is where the game both comes alive and screeches to a halt. Just when you've almost either negotiated peace with, or exterminated all other factions, holy ♥♥♥♥ aliens invade! Easily tougher than all the other factions combined, threatening your planets and stations.\nDid you let each faction have their own system and negotiate peace, so that you would have three friends to help you fight this threat?\nDid you, like me, exterminate all other races and RULE THE GALAXY? Then congratulations, you have all the resources in the universe to help you fight the alien menace, alone.\nThe game comes alive here at first because you probably haven't finished dealing with all the factions yet, so for a while you're fighting aliens on one side and kill-droids on another, and that's exciting.\nIt screeches to a halt, however, when you've finished everything you need to do and are just waiting for the damn plot to advance and your cartographer to find the final wormhole. Eventually you get bored because there are so many aliens and fighting them takes so long, and the portals respawn so fast it's almost a joke. You just wait for them to destroy another base so you can rebuild it again and cut your lossess.\n\nThe plot is alright, although it's more of a setting really, and the setting is interesting, revealed little by little throughout war with other factions.\n\nThe game is also really atmospheric, the alien planets have an absolutely existential-horror level of isolation in a hostile environment. Here's a fun game, pan the camera out as far as you can and maybe turn the music off on either the third or final alien world, it's downright spooky I tell you, especially when you're playing as a human. And all the  planets in the home galaxy are also unique artistically but really boring. You don't get a sense that that is where people live and work to get resources or anything like that. Same for the stations.\n\nWhat I like about this atmosphere is that you can mute the background music and make your own atmosphere whenever you want. And whatever music you play will fit no matter what, leading to absolutetly ♥♥♥♥ing awesome results.\nShooting lasers back and forth between humans and drones and want to jack up the intensity? Pendulum.\nFlying around hunting space bounties? How about the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack?\nWant to act like the smooth rogue you are? Shooting down ships and conquering planets like it isn't a problem? Some electric funk or electro swing, This Head That I Hold did it for me\nDrifting through space and feeling contemplative? Throw on Sad Machine\nHeading through a wormhole to an alien planet billions of lightyears away and want to awaken your soul and attempt to understand the very essence of the universe? Moonchild.\nFinal boss? Queen or Dragon Force, send that alien to hell with maximum style!\nReally experiment with this, the enjoyability goes up a hundred fold with some music, and the possibilities are endless.\n\nProblems are that it eventually gets really repetitive, so maybe take a break every once in a while.\nSecond is that it has no sort of quick battle select, which sucks. So in order to do a fun part I liked I'd have to restart the entire game and work back to the part I want to play. And dammit sometimes I just want to get high and shoot some robots with laser guns.\nThird is that towards the end game you're basically just drifting around for like an hour waiting for the plot to advance.\nFourth is that every planet and station feels empty. I don't see anyone just living in the faction, or even what day-to-day life would be like for them, this was especially apparent for the humans. And all the stations are the same inside for each faction, so that's dull, but given the budget I don't really mind.\n\nBut it's just a fun fun fun game full of robots, laser-guns and laser swords, aliens, and space battles. Totally worth buying, maybe get it on sale, but I don't think you'd regret it if you payed full price either.","November 22, 2014","true","227.6"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","60","65","11","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weyen/recommended/248450/","weyen","Kail","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weyen/","1153 products in account","This game is a flawed gem.  It's definitely unpolished, but unique and interesting in it's own way.  If you're looking for a really smoooth, AAA title, you might want to look elsewhere, but I had a lot of fun with Salvation.\n\nThe game is basically a war game.  You choose to play as a soldier in one of four factions, but the gameplay structure is the same for all four.  Starting out in a space station that functions as a shop / hangar / communication hub, you get missions that fall in to one of two types: on foot, or in space.  The "on foot" missions are pretty simplistic third person shooting sections where you run around a field and blow up buildings and enemies.  Each race has three weapons: a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, and a special weapon (like an energy shield or a bomb launcher).  Space missions put you in the cockpit of your space fighter, and generally play like a simplified version of a space shooter, similar to something like Rogue Squadron or Strike Suit Zero.\n\nThe game is technically open world in that you can go anywhere, land on any planet and walk around, but since there's a war happening in real-time in the background, there's not a lot of time to explore.  Completing missions gets you rank points (which give you promotions to advance your career) and money, which you use to upgrade your gear for the "on foot" sections and your spaceship.  You can also get skill points to level up your character.  However, there isn't a lot of customization here.  Each faction has only one character model, which you can't change (humans can choose a few different skin tones), and one spaceship model, which also never changes.  You can't even change your name, as far as I could find, even though it's just a text string.  And while you can level up your character, you'll generally get all the upgrades in the game in one playthrough.  This isn't inherently a bad thing, just bear in mind that you won't be able to, say, play a stealthy commando one run and a patient sniper the next or anything.\n\nMoment to moment gameplay tends to be pretty shallow.  The "on foot" sections are pretty straightforward, just move the cursor over the enemy, hold the trigger, and use a healing item when you get low on health.  Space combat is pretty similar, although movement is slightly more complicated, you're still just pounding on enemy shields and popping a shield recharging item when yours get low.  Annoyingly, enemies also get health/shield restoring items, meaning that a lot of fights tend to be drawn out affairs where you beat an enemy down to five or ten percent health and he pops a potion and heals back to 100, so you beat him down to five or ten percent again and he pops a potion and heals back to 100, so you beat him down again, and so on, until he runs out of regen items.  It's pretty basic stuff, but it does get the job done.\n\nOnce you get to max rank, you become your faction's leader, and can direct where you want attacks to focus on, as well as what buildings to build on colonies and so on.  This isn't as game changing as it sounds, though, because you can't really control if you win or lose a battle except by going there and killing everyone yourself, and since you can't have more than one attack going at once, you may as well join in on the battle anyway.  However, enemies can still attack your bases while you're out, so progress tends to be irregular.  You may get back from conquering one planet only to find you've lost two somewhere else.  Or, sometimes, none, since the AI's decision making seems to be random instead of adhering to a specific strategy or anything.  The endgame does get a bit annoying, too.  Story events basically negate the progress you made in the game up to that point, and the challenge ramps up, except "challenge" in this game means massive waves of enemies with titanic health pools that take forever to burn through.\n\nBut I don't want to exaggerate the negatives, this game is a lot of fun, especially early on.  You advance in rank fast, earning new abilities and upgrades fairly quickly, but never so quickly that you feel overwhelmed.  The UI is clunky and ugly, but straightforward and easy to learn.  And one of the really great things this game does is gives a sense of scale: you're usually going in to combat with 20 other allies, so you feel like a small part of a large team, rather than some unbeatable lone wolf, which is a neat feeling.  On those occasions when you do have to do something solo, that aspect always made it feel special to me, making that jump without a swarm of allies around me felt more dramatic and tense because of their absence.\n\nIn terms of graphics and sound, this game is pretty inconsistent, as indie titles often are.  There are a few good bits, a lot of the models look fairly nice.  But as a whole, the art direction is hit and miss, there are issues with lighting and materials, the environments are very low detail, and so on.  Outer space is full of asteroids and fights take place at point-blank range, making the galaxy feel small and cramped, while ground fighting is almost all on a slightly hilly outdoor map with few decorations or geological features making it feel barren and empty.  The UI, as I mentioned above, is functional, but clunky to use (especially if you have to use it in combat) requiring a lot of extra clicks and wasting a lot of space.  Animations are inconsistent, with some of them being fairly good (the sexy swagger of a Salvation officer) some of them being really bad (the derpy run cycle of a Drone Unity soldier) and a lot of them being flat out missing (like any kind of forward diagonal movement animation, your character just animates like he's running straight forward and drifts to the side).  The audio is serviceable, but doesn't really stand out.  The game does run at a nice framerate, though, and never crashed or ran in to any other technical problems during my playthrough.\n\nOverall, this is almost a poster child for indie titles.  The lacklustre graphics and shallow gameplay are made up for by the fact that this game tries to produce an experience that's mostly fun and unique.  It's full of issues that a larger studio could probably have fixed, but the quirky nature of it's core gameplay produces an experience that a more polished title probably wouldn't match.  Overall, I can't recommend it to everyone, but I definitely had a lot of fun with this game.\n","May 27, 2014","true","15.3"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","33","34","0","1"

A space type game where you both command and fight, both in space and land.  Although it wasn't quite what I had hoped it to be after playing for a little while, I still enjoyed the concept, and enjoyed playing it.  When I became the faction leader I proceeded to concentrate on expanding my Empire while gradually destroying my enemies.  I was doing really good, and then came the alien invasion.  From that point forward it was a full time struggle just to survive and rebuild against their attacks while waiting for the storyline to continue.  But I thought to myself, "Well, once I destroy the alien invasion I can go back to finishing the game by defeating my opponents", and decided to see the alien invasion as a good late game variable as it did cause powers to shift, and even allow one faction that was all but destroyed to make a comeback.  So I procedeed to follow the storyline which led to the solo attack against the alien mothership, which took about 4 attempts, then landed on the alien homeworld and defeated the "Boss" alien.  And then the game ended, apparently with me sacraficing my life to destroy the alien homeworld.  So really, once the alien invasion occured, the only objective left in the game is to survive long enough to defeat the alien mothership and Boss on the alien homeworld.  Because of this, I was left very disapointed, since the game turned from a changing dynamic of a power struggle to defeat everybody else, to a very narrow storyline of survive long enough for the final battle that ends the game.  Overall, would not recomend this game.","December 11, 2013","false","14.9"," 105 of 161 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","105","161","0","7"

I imagine certain aspects of the game would get repeatative if that's what you focused on but the real beauty of the game is the diversity of play.  I've had a good mix of gameplay so far.  Huge land battles assaulting enemy ground installations, space battles assaulting space stations, exploring alien planets on foot, and hunting down dangerous pirates in space.\n\nMost recently I've achieved the highest rank and opened up some of the 4X style gameplay.  I'm now able to allocate resources towards colony and fleet building as well as dictate where and when my faction will strike next.  THIS is where the game truly gets awesome.\n\nEarly on I enjoyed the diverse missions but got a little frustrated with how stupidly my faction would chose targets.  We lost a lot of ground that way.  We'd lose colonies, lose space stations while I was on other missions.  It did however add to a sense of urgency to the gameplay.\n\nAt first I didn't like that galactic events happened realtime, but after putting in a number of hours it's become one of the better features in my opinion.  It adds life to the game; if you sit on your hands and do nothing, your faction's holdings will be crushed.  I get to really see my contribution in a way no other game I've played is able to show.\n\nOverall I gotta say it's an amazing game.

The vastly different types of gameplay mean that none are as detailed as a game would be that concentrates on that one aspect. But every part of the game is enjoyable and together made for a fun package. So while the third person shooter part has been done way better in other games, I will still run to the dropship to support the rest of the Salvation troops in the planetary invasion of a Drone colony.

So amazed that I immediately spent my money on it blindly, just hoping I would get something good out of it atleast. For a good while I most certainly did. However, the game becomes too simple and boring very quickly: There is one gun type, one soldier type, and one spaceship type, and thats it. There is no variation in this game at all. The only variation are the different races which all are basically the same thing with the same progression, but different abilites, statistics, and some different models. There is just no substance at all to this game, and it leaves you wanting so much more to every single aspect of it.\n\nAll the ground battles are essentially the same ground battle with varied models, and sometimes they just reuse the same models for different things. Space combat is the same thing essentially, though I admit it is fun for awhile because its got some neat mechanics. Theres somewhat of a fake sense of progression to it that bases get upgrades and ships get upgrades but once all the upgrades are upgraded it is once again just bland. The epic story-line makes it exciting for awhile but then once you get past all the prophecy nonsense its just this really bland game with terrible animations and it just feels half-baked. I'm not the kind of person who cares much about graphics either, its better to have great gameplay and terrible graphics I always say, but this game doesnt have either. The only thing interesting about the gameplay like I said was the prophecy story-line which has a bunch of puzzles, and a nice little sense of discovery that made you feel like you were unearthing something nobody ever knew about, but all it ammounts to is some more half-baked abilities to aid ground battles.\n\nOnce you get past the main gimic of the ranking system and you make it to faction-commander you realize just how boring this game is: Being faction commander is not really any different than being the lowest on the totem pole. You don't get to create or leave your own mark on anything in this game, you dont get to customize your character, you dont get to build bases, or try different strategies in battle. Nope. The only thing you get to do as faction commander is tell your guys where to have their next monotonous ground or space battle, which you still have to go fight and essentially win for them by yourself. You dont even get to make a larger fleet of troops or ships, nope just what you've always been fighting with, that or less, which why on earth would you ever want to do that? You dont even get to command your troops in battle, except for telling them to make a retreat.\n\nNo customer service what-so-ever either, no updates, nope this is considered a "finished product" though it doesnt feel finished at all. You won't be getting any more out of your 20 bucks than the crap thats already on the table with this one.\n\nMy opinion? Don't waste your money. You can take in all this game has to offer from the screenshots above, and actually playing it wont get you very much more out of it.","February 25, 2014","false","13.4"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

Still, however, some parts of the game become repetitive quickly, and it is especially annoying that later in the game you still have to partake in the same kinds of missions you take on in the beginning. The only difference then basically is that you're in control of where these missions take place, but delegating (as you would expect to be able in a commanding position) is not a thing here.\n\nStory-wise the game is very linear and simple, but that's okay. The only irks I have with the storyline are that towards the end it often takes longer than necessary for the next story mission to show up.\n\nTL;DR: All in all, this game is quite enjoyable overall. It's certainly got its share of shortcomings, so I wouldn't recommend it for full price, but at any discount you're getting yourself a solid game woth spending some time with.","December 21, 2014","true","21.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

It has an amazing concept, a really good storyline with two distinct endings, and plenty of great lore. However, I can't like it. The beginning of the game? Awful. It's mostly grindy, you feel very not powerful, and the like. The middle? Amazingly fun, complex tactical simulation. The ending? Tedious, and even more grindy than the beginning. Without spoiling anything, you can spend the entire game carefully building up an entire empire only to watch it be tore down, with little you can do. Some of the most fun I've had in recent gaming history has been in the middle section of this game, but I honestly don't feel like I can recommend it.\n\nIn addition to my other hesitations, the game is very glitchy. There are also missions exclusive to sections of the game, with know way of knowing in advance which missions will vanish. I had to replay the campign just to get some achievements that I missed because I didn't realize the missions would be inaccessible later. The graphics are also wanting, with absolutely no customization available -- and it definitely feels like it's missing.\n\nOverall, Salvation Prophecy is an amazing attempt. I feel like if it had been given the funding it needed, it could have become an amazing game, similar in caliber to the other space epics but distinct, bringing its own unique perspective on the space sim. But it wasn't. It felt far too much like an indie game that desperately wanted to become something mainstream, it just needed the funding.","February 4, 2015","false","24.0"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

Completing missions and helping allies brings cash and exp. points(both depending in rate on how well you perform) to develop your skills, improve your space fighter ship and buy better weapons. Minimum dialogues and other waste of time. The story is simple yet rather abstract than dull, and you actually don't care about it, waiting or looking for the next bunch of enemies to deal with.\nBesides, flying spacecraft includes two mini-game-like processes when moving at long distances.\nAll this game's missing i'll easily find in many others yet i can't even remember a game to compare with what it possesses of.

It will drive you nuts but not nuts enough to not buy the game (for a sale price of course :).\n\nThe tutorial first and fore most is great. Absolutely, it will walk the gamer through everything you need to know and will even politely say where to go next.\n\nAs stated, this game is essentially STO. You are able to walk around your station (and other planets) and participate in raids or a take over of a planet. There are two aspects to the game : 3rd person over the shoulder and controlling a spaceship. The spaceship aspect is pretty cool as you get to be in control of space jumps. There will be missions where the player will need to travel quite a distance in a short period of time. This is done by initiating wormholes or the jump drive. This in itself is a mini-game that could potentially make the game better, or drive someone nuts. The player is also able to take part in major fleet missions involving destroying another rivals space station. This game is very controller friendly and make navigating through wormholes and warp jumps easy. This game does a good job allowing you to control exactly where you go - however some may find wormholes and the warp jumps annoying. Armor, stim packs, and even weapons for your character become modifiable. You are also able to choose between 4 races.\n\nI got this game as a gift and would likely only buy on sale. I would rather play Star Trek Online though as I feel it has more depth to it. This game tries but that little extra freedom of being able to walk around your own ship or wherever is not there. The gameplay itself (movement and action) is alright at best. A lot more could have been done in these regards. I mean cmon, you get to invade a planet!\n\n\nRATING : 7/10\n\n\nGameplay	B-	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	B-","December 19, 2014","true","1.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/generalzee/recommended/248450/","generalzee","generalzee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/generalzee/","92 products in account","Salvation Prophecy seems to me to be the reaction of a programmer saying "You know what needs to be redone and improved? Star Wars: Battlefront 2's sandbox mode." In this persuit there were some successes and some failures.\n\nSuccesses:\nIn general, the game does a good job of making you feel like an important piece in your army, but not necessarily the whole army. If you work with your units rather than doing your own thing you'll be more successful, but it also seems at the end of every battle (especially land battles) that had you not been there, the odds of winning would have been zero.\n\nThe game takes a while to get warmed up, but once you reach "Faction Commander" status, some strategy elements become highly entertaining, Managing resources to create well-placed armies and defences is interesting, and working with or against the other factions is the best part of the game, in my opinion.\n\nSpace battles are fun, and upgrades for your ship really feel important and obvious (rather than some games where upgrades make such a minor difference you can hardly tell they've been installed). While the space battle system isn't completely intuitive to veteran space simulator pilots, its fairly easy to learn the new rules and becomes a new and interesting challenge. Furthermore, piloting your craft through wormholes and hyperspace turns out to be an important skill, though I do wish that computer players coming out of hyperspace would exhibit some amount of damage, as you often do.\n\nFailures:\nThe biggest failure of this game are the land battles which are incredibly repetitive. After finishing a battle you will likely need to take 5 minutes for your trigger finger to relax after it had been held down non-stop for 15 minutes or so. While the factions are each unique, each member of a faction plays practically identically, but perhaps with different skill levels. The game could have added significantly more depth with different weapons (other than "Standard Blaster, Melee, and Faction-Specific).\n\nSome factions are simply better than others. The Salvation, after which the game is named, have an ability to heal themselves, and also have an ability to throw up a reflecting shield making a skilled human player practically invincible. Meanwhile, the amusing Wyr are large targets with almost no defensive capabilities.\n\nThe main plot of the game is fairly unimaginative. Factions fighting in space, check, prophesy and chosen one, check, inexplicable and inevitable galactic doom, check. I didn't feel like I was very invested in the plot, and the only reason I was motivated to finish it was that if I spent any more time not finishing it, I would have eventually lost.\n\nThe worst part about the plot was that it was carried through by plot-specific missions which mostly involved you trudging around alien planets toward a puzzle solution. There are alien beasts on these planets, but solo combat basically involves standing there, holding down the "fire" button, and waiting. You'll always win, so the monsters seem less like a tactical roadblock and more like a waste of time. I think these missions could have easily been shortened to just the puzzle sections to be much more effective.\n\nSome of the mechanisms of the game are also broken. If another faction destroys a third faction's base, its totally within your power to build a new base there instantly, as it is within your power to instantly rebuild any base destroyed by your enemies. This makes losing battles more of a bother than a tactical setback, and it makes winning seem awfully easy. If you're like me, by the time you unlock diplomacy, two of the factions have already been reduced to one or 2 bases, and their surrender is easy to coax.\n\nI hesitate to reccomend this game because the issues do keep parts of the game from being fun (especially by the end of your campaign when the last thing you want to do is another damn land battle), but there's also so much good in this game. I would love to see a sequel with some more depth, and maybe a little more production value.\n\nIf this game is on sale, it is probably worth checking out.","November 30, 2013","true","19.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I love the fact that this game connects so many different playing styles: ground combat, space combat ect.  Don't get me wrong, there are quite a few issues that should be adressed, but the game itself is a fresh wave of air in todays mainstream game industry and I'm pretty confident that the sequel, enriched with better animations, graphics, perhaps more dynamic combat and a bigger world ect. would become one of the greatest bestsellers or all time.","February 15, 2014","true","0.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

After each successful mission you get rank points and credits and sometimes badges that gives you bonus credits.Missions are 3 kinds. Land attack as a soldier, Space attack/defense on your spaceship. Land attacks are boring,you as a soldier must upgrade your skills and gear while the defender can have turrets,fliers and even mech and in numbers both sides are equal. 20v20 soldiers ... and defender got bonus toys. Space battles are fun for most of the time. 20v20 spaceships and defender got the his base with turrets and a battleship. In both fights attacker got less toys but wins most of the time. Sadly all this gets boring after you do ~20 of each fights.\n\nGAME LACKS DEPTH! Which is the main cause to get boring/repetetive. As Droid I had only 3 weapons to use - blaster,claw and missle launcher. There are skills for your guy but you can max them quite fast. There is no specialization to make the game a bit more interesting. Everything looks the same because of lack of customization. Even when you reach the rank of Faction Commander you still look like everybody else in your faction.\n\nI was hoping to see in the game option to gather a squad of 3-4 droids from my faction and go hunt bounty targets but nope,you are all by yourself.\n\nUnstable Wormholes were nice but when I got to check 4th one I simply stopped playing because just the end part of the mission is different : check the wurmhole,dream about the planet and the animals on it, wait for cartographer to upgrade your ship and check the planet.\n\nI thought when I reach the rank of Faction Commander the game will be a bit more interesting... Was I wrong... As FC you can build stations,colonies and order attack, no attacks, an attack because you need to take part in the attack. You can't order several attacks and pick one to join in,you cant send troops to support stations/colony that will be attacked and to order an attack you have to be on station from which you gonna launch the attack.\n\nOverall I can't really recommend the game unless you feel like doing the same thing over and over again. The game doesnt make you feel important with the lack of customization.It just makes you one of the mass.","September 26, 2014","false","9.0"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

Go look at the space screen shots... yep that's as far as the HUD goes: no radar or target lead reticle.  The equipment and skill progression is very poorly paced.  The Mount and Blade-like dynamic war is innovative, but doesn't really mean anything as the races tend to keep a stalemate until you reach the faction commander level.  The writing for the opening and the "timeline" pieces are amazing, but almost none of that color reaches the gameplay portions.\n\nI got it for 10 bucks, but if I paid more for it, I would have been angry.  Bottom line is that the graphics are circa 2006 and the gameplay is shallow and gets repetitive fast.  It's not a bad game, it's just that there are so many other good games out there you should be playing instead.","February 13, 2014","false","5.8"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","18","32","0","2"

This developer, even with a limited budget, with beyond what he could have done and added a great storyline, that had me into it the entire game.

Fight/lead battles in space under the same criiteria. You start as the lowest rank and work your way up to the top.\n\nThe space combat is very smooth and fun, the ground combat is different for each race and is very fun. Each race uses different weapons an abilities and you can customize your own through usage of different weapons you can buy. You can upgrade your weapons as well and earn special abilities to aid you in combat. You can upgrade your spaceship as well.\n\nThe story is pretty good and is a nice bonus to the whole "sandbox" being able to ascend to the top of your race and conquer the galaxy, unite it, or enslave it.\n\nEvery time you jump in hyperspace there is an amount of skill needed however due to a little minigame that plays (that also hurts some persons' eyes).\n\nOverall though this game is a marvel and is definitely worth a playthrough.

It's a space combat sandbox game. You upgrade your ship to kill baddies faster and better in the air. You upgrade your gun to kill baddies better on the ground.\n\nThe good:\n- This game is upgrade-friendly, but not in the flash game sense. You're forced to actually stage your upgrades rather than just "buy what you can afford." Upgrades are done smartly.\n- It looks amazing.\n- It's incredibly fun. You get a real sense of immersion through upgrading your character and progressing, beating more and more drek out of the enemy.\n\nThe bad:\n- Sometimes the spaceflight missions are dauntingly hard if you don't know the "trick" (spoiler: the trick is mostly going straight for the station's turrets, then the station), leaving you with a derpish AI squad whose main speciality is hurling themselves against turret fire and dying, and not much support in the battle.\n- Many of the rooms in your home battle cruiser seem empty and not well-designed; the battle command room is the size of a gymnasium and mostly empty except for two guys. Kinda weird.\n\nIf I were to gauge what sorts of efforts went into this game, it would be 30% overall design [i.e. making sure the game is fun and paced well], 50% engineering [i.e. making sure everything works] and 20% design [i.e. making sure the game looks pretty].\n\nLinux compatibility:\nOverall, the game is a great Linux port which hasn't crashed once on me.\n\nOverall:\nThis game is well worth the money.

Textures are low res, location are reused, models are ridiculous sometimes.\n- Animations are hilarious\n\n+ Space combat effects are decent\n+ Very few obvious bugs to speak about\n+ unique planetary missions have amazing locations\n\nSound:\n- your own music recommended\n- voice acting is ridiculous\n- actually not that many sound effects\n\n+ doesn't get annoying\n+ space travel effects amazing\n+ no bugs detected\n+ ambient sound effects help immersion\n\nGameplay:\n- simplistic in every area\n- little choice of items, most useless\n- difficult to understand why are you promoted to faction leader so soon\n- otherwise unbalanced (AI and Aliens)\n- land combat AI sucks (worst part of the game actually)\n- shallow story line, some ridiculous moments especially with runes\n- arcade minigames in warp tunnels and wormholes\n\n+ story is presented in interesting manner and despite being quite simple is properly explained and transparent, you can tell the reason for the ongoing war\n+ missions. Mass fighter jumping in and out of combat is just the most amazing thing this game has (I say this as FreeSpace veteran)\n+ simplified arcade combat - not necessary a good thing but at least it is made in proper way (does not annoy)\n+ side missions, hilarious pirate descriptions\n+ multiple aspects (well, not that many) of faction to manage\n+ ending better than Mass Effect 3, despite very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ final boss battle(considering mission length this battle is actually a good thing)\n+ overal feeling and atmosphere is a combined shadow of Homeworld, FreeSpace and Mass Effect titles. It is quite simply good.\n\n\nConclusion:\nLove and care is visible in each and every part of the title. It is properly done, relativelly bug free, not badly imbalanced jewel that makes it obvious - developers really wanted to deliver but were short on funds. These are the pople who seem to know what they are doing and where they are heading, just didn't head the means to make the journey.\n\n\nYou will not be disappointed if you get this game on sale, even tho it is short you will enjoy this.\n\nAnd perhaps showing your support will prompt people responsible for Salvation Prophecy to create a sequel.","January 16, 2015","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You start off as a run-of-the-mill GROPO taking part in planetary invasions as directed by your higher authority.  As you rank up you're given a fighter so that you can take part in space missions.  You buy your upgrades, there's some minor customization on how you get to the end of each faction's 'tech tree'.  At some point you'll become the faction commander.  Now you get to decide where to send your fighters and grunts.\n\nAll in all.  I had a lot of fun for the 15 hours (currently) I've put into it.  It's a little of everything.  Some base building, some rpg, some third person shooter, some space combat.  The game makes sense it what's it's trying to do.  You want to colonize a planet to get more resources for your faction.  You need to invade the current owners colony and wipe it out first.  Before you can wipe out the colony you need to clear space station and fighters in orbit.  But before you can do that you have to launch the spae invasion fleet from one of your own space stations.  But you have to build the fighters even before that.\n\nOkay, don't get intimidated.  It makes sense.  Build your fighters.  Point em at the enemy and launch.  Go with em to make sure they win.  Come back and launch the grunts.  Go with em to make sure they win too.  (Note, as far as I could tell you will never establish numerical superiority--which would be negative for me).  Then build the colony, get it's resources and repeat.\n\nGripes.  Each part of the game has it's own gripes.  When I'm launching an invasion fleet, why can't I luanch multiple invasion fleets from different areas?  Your soldiers/pilots who go with you do their own thing.  You can't give them objectives.  You can't ever esrtablish numerical superiority, even if by launching invasion forces from different stations.  THere are more, but I can't think of them at the moment.  But it comes down to the focus.  Because the focus is wide, it doesn't neccessarily do each part of the game as polished as it could be.\n\nBig Gripe:  I played with a controller and two things really irked me.\n1)The controls were a bit weird.  A B Select and Start didn't follow their usual functions.  As in, A (bottom middle button) = accept/forward, B (far right button) = cancel/back, Select = in-game menu, start = global menu.  Salvation Prophecy has it to be A=Accept/forward/use, B = accept/forward, select = back, global menu, start = in-game menu.  Also, no dedicated button to missles and emp? (missile defense)\n2)When you accept a call/mission in the fighter it does not pause the game (no gripe there) but it does slow you down to a crawl while you try and figure out why someone keeps calling you every 5 seconds while you're in the middle of a dogfight...which, btw, if you accept said call in the middle of a dogfight you run an 80-90% chance of dying.\nI have no idea if this holds true for the Mouse/Keyboard controller options.\n\nGraphics are dated but not so bad as to detract from the story and what it is you're trying to do.  The map is kind've small, the tech tree is kind've short, there aren't many weapons to choose from, the upgrades for your fighters are kind've short...\n\nThrough all that, I still really like this game.  While it doesn't do any one thing stellar, taken all together it's a fantastic game.  I hope the developer at some point in the future makes a sequel.","May 18, 2014","true","21.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I like the mix of linear campaign structure versus quasi-open sandbox, though there aren't really many different mission types; pretty much everything boils down to shooting in space or on land. Even the "acid-trip missions" end up being little else.\n\nBut the sense of achievement and growth as you progress through the ranks is palpable, the options for using different stims and perks on land and equipment in space are enjoyable, and it doesn't really get old. It's definitely a game you can pick up for twenty minutes and play a quick mission or two and put down again.\n\nIt's fair criticism that the graphics aren't fantastic and the game is repetitive, but it's clearly a low-budget effort and packs a lot more fun than its tiny asking price suggests. I think I picked it up on sale for something like $4.99, and I've already enjoyed ten-plus hours with it before even beginning what I suspect is the end-game final conflict phase.\n\nIn short, it's a lot more fun than I thought it would be and highly recommend it for those who like sci-fi FPS or space combat games. There are bigger more polished games, but this is an overlooked and undersung value option that aims high and partially delivers.","May 25, 2014","true","10.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

More like an 'eh' waggle of the hand.\n\nSalvation Prophecy is a prime example of how music and sound can make or break a game. It's essentially a military space fighter, turned military space strategy/shooter about halfway through. You choose your faction, have a few fights, go and collect these relics through these very boring special missions and then take over as commander of your faction and subsequently beat everyone else up.\n\nWhen I first started with the drones, there was no music. When I fought on a planet, there was one track. When I fought in space, it played what sounded like idle space music, not epic space music. The voiceovers spoke at the speed of cabbage. The single laser gun sound effect became very jarring, very quickly and I fought melee alot, just so I didn't have to hear that sound. To put it bluntly, the audio was awful.\n\nBut that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the space battles. The overall idea was good and executed well, although more detail in the strategy portion of the game would have been nice. The effects and little minigame when warping somewhere were actually really effective and I never found myself growing tired of jumping.\n\nSo, this game is okay. Could have been a lot better.

The mechanics are the same as all the other spaceflight sims, FPS, womholes, and starjumps are included as required space sim memes.  So far the conversations are weak.

As the game goes on the enemies and enemy buildings/turrets/etc become stronger and take more shots to kill, increasing how tedious everything is.\n\nAfter you reach max level and become the leader of your race, you can command attacks on enemy bases and space stations, which you personally have to lead. You can only command one action at a time, which causes everything to move extremely slowly, and you can't combine the forces of multiple stations.\n\nThe enemy AI isn't that great either, once you power your ship up enough you can repeatedly do attack runs on the enemy station practically unmolested and win the battle while everyone else is flying around shooting each other. Enemy ships don't seem to target you or try to follow you, they just seem to shoot at you if there's nothing else nearby to shoot at. The ground missions aren't a whole lot better, other than the targeting on the enemy turrets is so bad you can just keep slowly strafing and they'll never hit you.\n\nAll in all, I like the concept behind Salvation Prophecy, but it really needs better enemy AI, better mechanics, and more improvements to your ship that you can make after halfway through the game.","May 2, 2014","false","15.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The execution is poor.\n\nIn the shooter portions of the game you will be riding a dropship down to a planet's surface and killing the opposing force. The foot controlls w,a,s,d to move, right click to aim (no over the shoulder here, it just makes your reticule appear) and left click to shoot. That's it. No crouch, no cover mechanic, just trading fire until you or your opponent die. There are slight variations in the different races weaponry, but their skill trees are all the exact same.\n\ndogfights are the better portion of the game. You can fight using three weapons, laser fire, missles, and emp bursts which destroy incoming missles. The fighting is intense and challenging. The real problem with the ship combat is the navigation. to jump from area to area in the game you will need to warp and use black holes. warping is a mini-game in which you will be avoiding electric beams that do damage to your ship. black holes have you flying through a tunnel and avoiding the sides, operation style. often you will have to navigate two or three of each to get to your mission. The black holes are the most frustrating as damage is unavoidable and and you will need to use your healing items before a battle even starts.\n\nThe strategy portion of the game I never got to and before you cry foul let me explain the ranking system in the game. You will start out as the lowest ranking in your military installation only being able to do shooter missions. after doing a couple of those you will rank up and have access to  star fighter missions and exploration. There are about ten ranks in the game and the very last rank is the one that gives you access to the strategy portions. I am about 4 hours in and have moved up to about rank three. The strategy missions could be the most amazing thing to happen to gaming, but I would have to wade through at least 5 more hours of mediocrity to get there.\n\nI cannot recommend Salvation Prophecy unless you are a hardcore space sim fan and even then I would wait until it drops to bargain price.","February 15, 2014","false","4.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The core gameplay is solid. Initial impressions for gameplay are: Ground combat is similar in control and objective to Star Wars Battlefront, but without the class system. Ship sections feel like Freespace with the jump sections feeling like the corridor runs in Star Fox. The leveling system and upgrade system feel somewhat like Meltdown's in that they are focused in providing linear progression in key areas. They aren't full of fluff like a traditional level-up system is. The game design feels focused and while not inspired, it does bring new life to old tried and true systems with new art and new narrative. I am running the game with an integrated HD graphics card and it runs pretty smoothly.

Anyway. The game has amazing Land battles, but the space exploration and space battles are where the real meat is at.\n\nLet's go into details, Shall we?\n\nFirst off, In most space shooters, are you allowed to warp between wormholes and jumpgates? I didnt think so.\n\nSecondly, The land battles arent just spam spam spam spam blow that up spam spam, you auctually need to follow your squad and try not to get singled out (if you are playing on a decent difficulty that is)\n\nThirdly: The game has multiple factions to choose from, wich in all games is a nice little addition\n\nFinally: The game doesent "beat around the bush" with what it tries to be. It is a Sci-Fi Third person shooter. It is quick, clean, and to the point, the game does have some nice little humor kinda thrown it too.\n\nNow that we have looked at the pros, lets look at the darker side of things.\n\nCon 1: The game does get EXTREMELY Repetetive, so i would go ahead and be prepared to get bored if played for too long\n\nCon 2: The models created for the game look OK, your not gonna be blown away with astetics here.\n\nCon 3: The textures are... Lacking. I mean, I understand the game is older than most, but it has aged worse than most too.\n\nAfter all of that, I have concluded that the game is a very nice addition to your Steam Library, its fun, has great space and ground battles, and although it doesent have a Spot on Story, has a nice narrative going for it. Overall, I give it a 8.0/10 in my book, So if u have 20 dollars layin around, why not buy it!","July 6, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You fight in an army, work your way up to eventually command the army, and so on.  The only problem is that the battles are really damn repetitive.  You shoot at some guys, shoot a building, then repeat that two more times and then you win.  Every battle is nearly identical.  The space battles are a little better, but even that essentially boils down to "shoot a couple ships until they blow up and then shoot the space station until it blows up".  It seems like they put a lot of thought into making a fun and ambitious game and then forgot that they actually needed to make the battles fun.  The RPG elements are oversold, you earn money by doing missions, and use that money to buy better weapons and armor and such.  But all the items are identical, except there are 5 different tiers that are all slightly better than the last.
