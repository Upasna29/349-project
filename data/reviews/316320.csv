Camera should have been higher on the moments when you drive forward in "high speed" ( fire figher minigames has 2 of these).\nThen the options... whooboy. You are only able to play this game on fullscreen and the highest resolution was 1280 x 960\nThe audio feels like it likes to jump between low and high on its own. And in audio department, this game lacks any language selection, so only english.\nThis game also lacks any way of skiping cutscenes, so you will see lots of them.\nBut what this game has is save slots, so you and your friends and all kids can have their own saves, and no-one will cry about someone using their saves.\nBUT the biggest problem I had, was that from time to time, when opening new story, the game would crash before the cutscene, might be because I go to next one immeadetly and don't do anything before that, but it is still annoying.\nBut is this game worth 15 â‚¬, I don't know, I did kinda enjoy it. This game is supposed to be light hearted and meant for kids, and I tell you, some kids games are bad to the core.\nIf you have some spare change and see this game in sale and want something casual to play, try this out.","December 16, 2014","true","1.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","2"

Seriously, who wants to play sharing the same keyboard!?\n\nThe gameplay feels like South Park Rally with a little bit of Superman 64, having to reach checkpoints while driving although not as hard.\n\nVery tedious and not very interesting. It's not a bad game but I would only recommend this to parents who play computer games with their kids.\n\n3/10","September 20, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
