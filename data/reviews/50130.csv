Grenades and the like exist too but I did not really use them a lot. I LOVE my shot gun.\n\nSo what is there in the game:\n- story: very good\n- graphics: very good\n- sound: very good\n- fist fights: good\n- gun fights: very good\n- driving: good\n\nAnd if that is really not enough for you: there are playboy magzines to find which each show one picture. This alone is a reason to get the game. Ok, not really, but I like it nevertheless :)\n\nI really think that most older gamers who did ever enjoy a shooter will enjoy this game too.\n\nNow I am waiting for a special on steam to get the DLCs:\n- "Jimmy's Vendetta" and\n- "Joe's Adventure"\nwhich tell stories and seem to allow free roaming.\n\nI have to repeat, I was blown away by this game, I did not expect such an old game to be that good.\n\n\nupdate: I do not like the DLCs, don't waste your money for the DLCs. But get the main game!","October 30, 2014","true","17.9"," 381 of 411 people (93%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","93","381","411","25","9"

Think of Mafia 2 as the best of your favorite gangster movies only much longer and with you in control of the action and you'll get an idea of what the game is really like.\n\nGameplay is reminiscent of GTA only without the auto-targeting aspect. At its core Mafia 2 is a 3rd person over the shoulder shooter.The game takes place in 1940's - 1950's America so expect period guns (M1945, Tommy Gun's, shotguns); vehicles (not actual licensed cars but closely based on period autos); and clothing. The driving mechanics in Mafia 2 in my opinion are a vast improvement over the on-ice feel that the vehicles in GTA IV featured. Driving insane speeds is possible but expect a quick death if you crash (on hard difficulty anyway).\n\nUnlike other open-world or sandbox games, the focus of Mafia 2 is the main story. Admittedly Mafia 2 is short on sidequests and minigames. This is generally a problem if you go in expecting a GTA clone. Mafia 2 is most definitely not that. Personally I found the focus on the story refreshing. Instead of distractions like pizza delivery missions or other time wasters, Mafia 2 is about story driven events that include everything from jewelry store heists to covert missions planting explosives to assassinate a rival family member.\n\nWhile Mafia 2 doesn't feature any type of online gameplay there are plenty of collectibles in-game including Playboy centerfold magazines (complete with nudity) and wanted posters to keep you occupied. I highly recommend this title!","December 3, 2013","true","17.3"," 282 of 321 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","282","321","3","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TKoMEaP/recommended/50130/","TKoMEaP","Favorite Son","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TKoMEaP/","134 products in account","Overall Opinion: For those that prefer story over everything else, Mafia 2 is pretty much the perfect game for you and is worth every cent. And if you're not invested in that story, Mafia 2 is still a good game, but probably only worth $20 or so.\n\nNumber Rating: 8.5/10\n\n\nMafia 2 is arguably the most underrated game of the last generation. And honestly, I can't blame people for saying that. I had never heard of the game until the 2K Humble Bundle...yeah.\n\nBefore you even think about getting or playing Mafia 2, you need to know, THIS IS NOT A GTA CLONE. This game is ALL about the story, is extremely grounded, and the world is mostly just there for looks while you go from objective to objective. If you go into Mafia 2 expecting GTA in the 40's and 50's, you'll be disappointed.\n\nPC Port: Meh. FoV is too close indoors, but you're not indoors for that long so it's not a big deal. Also the game's AA solution is really strange, and only applies to some objects it seems. I have no idea what it uses because all it says is "On" and "Off". And for some reason the game uses what appears to be DoF when you start driving really fast, but the DoF messes up so much that it can really chug on the frame rate at times. The BIG issue with the port, is that it appears to have a memory leak issue, and after long sessions with the game, it can get really annoying. Physx will just stop working after a few hours of playing, but comes back when you restart the game, and it starts to drop in FPS REALLY badly in cut scenes after a few hours of playing. It's too bad this was never patched, because the game looks great, easily one of the best looking games from 2010. It also runs good for the most part, and stays around 60fps most of the time on my 660 and i5 rig. Come on 2K, I know it's been 4 years, but patch that crap! For now, I recommend just restarting the game after each chapter if you REALLY need those Physx effects (and they do look pretty good, I have to say).\n\nVisuals: Like I said, looks really good for a 4 year old game. I actually found myself just stopping the car for a moment and looking at "Empire Bay" in the middle of the night during winter. It really does look that good. Now, yes the textures haven't aged well, some of the fatter characters with round faces look really odd due to the sharp edges, and the DoF will sometimes mess up and ruin a scene (although it only happened once for me). At the end of the day though, it's a really good looking game.\n\nStory: The selling point of this game.\nAll you need to know about the story is that:\nIt's well acted\nHas a fantastic soundtrack with it\nHas a polarizing ending, I loved it thoughGameplay: Sadly, this is the part that gets thrown under the rug for the story. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay works fine and is fun, but the depth just isn't there. The shootouts are great fun, and the environments they happen in are pretty destructible, which forces you to change strategies in a moments notice. Plus the AI is challenging (I got my butt handed to me a few times on the medium difficulty). The boxing matches are really cinematic and fun, the stealth works fine, and driving is shockingly realistic. However, all of this lacks depth. You have a pistol, shotgun, grenade,Tommy, SMG, and that's about it. Yes, these guns have different "versions" of them, but they're barely notable, the revolver feels identical to the M1911, each takes 3 shots to the body to kill, or one to the head. Fighting is limited to a light punch, heavy punch, and dodge. And, once your enemy becomes "stunned" you have a little QTE finisher, that's it. No knives, bats, or anything to give it variety. The stealth is bare bones: crouch, stick to cover, don't get noticed, and hit "q" behind someone to watch Vito knock out someone. The driving is pretty much the only area that this game shines at in terms of gameplay. You actually have to follow the speed limit, Vito will die on impact if you get into a car crash too hard (no going through wind shields and getting up just fine in this game), watch for red lights, etc... It's actually quite impressive how detailed the driving mechanics are. Sadly the cop AI is pretty inconsistent, I've crashed into cops before at 60MPH, and the cops did nothing, and I've also barely tapped a cop car and gotten arrested for it...\n\nSetting: "Empire Bay is a fictional city on the East Coast of the United States of America, based on a combination of New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Detroit with elements from other US cities during the '40s and '50s..." - Mafia 2 wiki\nThat pretty much sums it up. I did feel LA Noire nailed the "Post WW2" era USA better, but this game does a pretty solid job, with 3 radio stations filled with 50's and 40's classics.\n\nMusic: Normally, I don't give music its own category in my reviews, so that should say something about how amazing this game's soundtrack is. The first thing I thought when I booted up this game was "Holy crap, if the game is as good as this theme...this is going to a fantastic game." Seriously, even if you have no intention of playing this game, just do yourself a favor and listen to the soundtrack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0NuvnfTXQI\n\nPros:\nSoundtrack\nStory\nVisuals\nActing\nDriving\nShootouts\nAI\nSetting\nCharacters\n"Wanted" SystemCons:\nEmpty Open World\nChapter breaking bugs (events not triggering, forcing player to restart chapter)\nPC Port Issues\nInconsistent Cop AIIndifferent:\nFighting Mechanics. It's fun, but can get repetitive.\nHow Big The Open World Is. It gives a lot of variety to where the missions are, but since the world is rather empty, it gets boring to drive through towards the end.\nLet's hope we don't have to wait another 8 years for Mafia 3!","October 14, 2014","true","17.0"," 148 of 165 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","148","165","0","0"

The police evasion is a very tedius, but over all more fun method, Unlike games like GTA where, you loose the police and you can then drive past them with a car thats smashed up, covered in blood with bullet holes in it and they won't beat an eye, this game requires you to get your car fixed up, new plates added, and a change of clothes to get the police to not suspect anything next time they see you.\nControls - The controls are very nicely done, as far as combat is concerned, the aiming, the slow motion, everything is brilliant. As for driving, They have gone for realism with it, Some people might like it, I wasn't really a fan of it, it takes a bit of time to get used to meaning I spent most of the beginning of the game crashing into things and getting shot up in no time, but with a bit of practice you become a good driver in no time, But then again, its realistic, its how cars where back then.\nStory - One of my favorite stories of all time, I can't really describe it, but you will have to play it to find out. Its a whole story of betrayal, emotion, sadness but at the same time, partying, trust, money. The story is a crazy mix of family life and gang life. The best way to describe it, is sort of on par with Breaking bad. A hardworking man taking up illegal tasks to help support his family.\n\nI can't actually believe I got this game for free by voting in a contest, The fact that it was a free giveaway made me think quite poorly of this game and it took me a while to get round to playing it, and that was a big regret. This is by far one of my favorite games.","March 7, 2015","true","145.7"," 135 of 148 people (91%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","91","135","148","12","2"

Did I enjoy it? - yes.\nIs it open world? - yes & no. Due to the story-driven progression your experience is limited and all the cut scenes and missions prevent you from doing as you like. As there are no real side missions the game isn't heading to do that and even though if you take your time and avoid "triggering" the next mission / day, you will return soon to go on.\nIf you accept these limitations and don't expect the GTA-features (it is too linear for that), though Mafia II has GTA-like elements you will have a good time playing. Moreover, you should be interested in the story that unfolds - at least I've enjoyed the cutscenes (even though there were loads of them) but otherwise you won't find much to what you're actually doing here.\nWhat would be a great addition which is missing here, is some sort of free mode where you can do as you please. So there is little replay-value if you are not aiming for the story or hunting achievements.\nWhat are the gems of this game?\n- Story - Voice acting - Music - Atmosphere & Details (40s, 50s nostalgic)\nAs I am a sucker of that time I can recommend getting this game, gameplay is solid as well. The map is just big enough to suit the purpose.\n\n(Note: True PC-gamers will be a bit disappointed as it feels like a console game BUT a great one, the PC-port is well done\nin my opinion.)\n\n> Thumbs up\n\nEDIT: I discovered that there are DLCs for Eastern Europe that aren't even available or listed on steam. I don't get why the full Mafia II experience isn't being delivered in the Extended Edition - Thumbs down","November 11, 2014","true","21.6"," 95 of 108 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","95","108","2","0"

Note that I have, at this moment in time, never before played Mafia I.\nAlthough I have played other such titles, for example Mafia Wars, The Godfather games, Omerta City of Gangsters and of course GTA and also Saints Row.\nThis game, has by far one of the most gripping main story lines I have come across for this genre. (Personally)\nI played this first on Xbox 360, and I have many many hours clocked.\n\nNow I shall tell you about a few features.\n\nCar mechanics;\nthe driving is lovely and realistic. No manual gear changing or first person head turning ( I belive there is a fine working modification for first person) but everything works smoothly as it should. You can turn on or off a speedomiter on as far as I know all cars. There is also an option to turn on or off realistic driving ( more slipping when it's wet with rain and snow, realistic breaking, that sort of thing. ) Car damage is very well done and there is a car mechanic shop at your service, as well as a few other types of shops : ) you as the player cannot shoot out of windows as far as I know without some sort of modification to the game, but other NPCs in the car can and will if need be ( if they use a gun normally  xD ) You can open the bonnet and boot of most cars, which is a lovely feature :) they really did well on the cars, I mean you can take the hubcaps off from damage.. taking out the lights and tyres is very fun and rewarding.. shooting through the windows is very nice.. the bumpers bounce about nicely when they partly come apart.. spinning out and drifting is very nice, aaandd, you can shoot the sirens to stop them xD! There are many many vechicles to see and drive, from armoured vans and trucks to small sports cars and hotrods : D.\nNext is the violence mechanics;\nShooting is very well done, you can also punch up enemies with your fists.. the fighting is well done!\nYou can kill someone instantly if you shoot the head, so there is minor locational damage, and all animations are very good. There is blood also.\nThere is a good cover system, alowing you to take cover on most objects however they are. You can also destroy most objects as you please.\nAtmosphere;\nIt feels veryy genuine. The music, crisp textures and wonderful lighting provides a truly nineteen thirtys to seventys feel. Something perhaps out of The Italian Job, or a James Bond movie..\nThere are many many songs out on the few radio stations.. from home radio to car radio you can listen all the time :D\nOh, voice acting is absolutly top notch. For the most part there are no hiccups!\nYou can dress differently, answer phones and use rest rooms, buy drinks and food, and take a stroll out and about.\n\nI love this game. I hope you will or do too :)\n","March 19, 2015","true","16.0"," 76 of 84 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","76","84","4","0"

It was original, brutally mature, and insanely addictive.\n\nIn this game, you start as a soldier in WW2 where you see some intense "Brothers in Arms" action.\n\nNext, the game brings you back to the States in February, 1945 - and I won't spoil the storyline any further.\n\nThe game doesn't throw you into driving right away. you actually get to enjoy the view of the city.\n\nThe cut scenes are interesting to watch to say the least. I like GTA games, but I don't remember being able to sit through a single cut scene, it just never stuck with me. However, in Mafia 2 as well as Red Dead Redemption, you DO want to watch the cut scenes. Read Dead for instance, was filled with some good, albeit heavy well-thought out secular life philosophy. That isn't exactly the case in this game, this IS a gangster game after all. However, it IS impressive how they managed to keep the story strong without resorting to the well-known cliches that are associated with Italian gangsters, plus there is some good vulgarity, nudity, adult magazines and great original one-liners.\n\nThe attention to detail is simply outstanding. I wouldn't be surprised if the developers hadn't taken their time to create every shelf, every book and every street corner for that matter, with the utmost care to detail. The NPC models are numerous and if you dont scrutinize the NPCs too much, you just wont often find same NPCs, just let the game flow over you. The interior designs are amazing too look at and the icy roads are a b1tch to drive on.\n\nHaving played the demo, and getting my first glimpse at the map, I was disappointed. It is small in comparison to Just Cause 2 and Red Dead, which is still a bit of a turn off for me. HOWEVER, the major point is how they managed to utilize the city to its fullest potential. Meaning, the miscellaneous stores and buildings often have an interior with and without people that you can see, which only adds to the sheer depth of the city. You actually get a feel that you are standing next to an apartment building filled with people. In GTA series, buildings were but lifeless texture blocks. Also, there are plenty of missions that take place inside buildings. One of them, involving a safe, will put a long smile on your face as you listen to the conversation between the two security guards. The shootouts are okay, the usual shoot -take cover type of action. The funny thing is that whilst completing the shooting missions, I found myself wasting time by observing the details of furniture and other objects which are greatly polished.\n\nIts also fun to see the well-familiar WW2 American propaganda posters. Remember, the walls have ears... There are plenty of artifacts in the game indicating your 1940's era. Babe Ruth's posters, movie posters and what not.\n\nSome random conversations in the game are outright genius. "Extra! extra! I am freezing my ball$ out here..." or "Spending nights with Rosy Palm and her five sisters" are just a few of them.\n\nThe radio broadcast gives an incredible insight into how people talked and thought. The then-live broadcast of WW2 events and battles is interesting enough for you to stand and listen, getting more and more immersed in the game.\n\nI also wouldn't mean hearing some original Italian Language with English subtitles. That is how I played Assassin's Creed II actually.\nThe lock pick system is reminiscent of the Watchmen game, but it is MUCH easier to handle\n\nAnother cool thing is that you can pimp your ride, AND you can customize your plates. Go vulgarity!\n\nAlso, for those of you still yearning for the good old days of the first game, tune in Empire Radio whilst driving and feel yourself get a decade younger for a moment.\n\nThe Brooklyn Bridge replica is impeccable. I ride the Brooklyn Bridge on my bike quite a few times every summer, and let me tell you, the game nailed it the bridge where GTA 4 failed. Enough said. Also, there is a nice replica of the Brooklyn-Bridge Expressway as you take the right exit off of the Brooklyn Bridge - on the Brooklyn Side.\nThe docs are also in the right place.\n\nThe fist fighting is reminiscent of the Bourne Supremacy game, plus there are some cool easy-to-pull of combo moves\n\nThe cut scenes actually retain the car damage that you may have sustained completing a mission\n\nThe BAD:\n\nThe lip sync is not exactly top notch, in fact its bad.\nYou can tell they just had the characters flapping their pie holes whilst adding the relative dialogue. I guess only Bioware can pull a well-made lip sync, among other companies.\n\nI also think that the main character could use a bit more charisma and inner thoughts just like Tommy in the first game.\n\nAnother thing is that after a couple of hours of playing, you find that there isn't really much to do in the city besides enjoying the scenery, driving and going to bars. But, I guess that's why the developers tried to push the game into linear play in an open-world map.\n\nBut it's all good. The city itself is a part of the story and while you don't get to visit every corner in the city during the story line it is sitll nice to know that you can explore this very polished world.  It is sad that the game's engine hasn't been used since in many other game, it really has a lot of potential.","November 27, 2013","true","43.7"," 131 of 167 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","131","167","0","0"

The pace is great from the very beginning were it tells the Story of your character when you were younger and how you end up doing what you are doing. You start doing little jobs here and there to get some money to pay a debt left by a family member. Right from the start you feel that family is the most important thing but as you go deeper and deeper you realize that it's hard to not involve the ones you care because of your decisions. As you go through the Story you experience a better life with better cars, a better house and most of all, more money, however, the main character wonders if this is what he really wanted to have when you end up doing things you may not feel proud of.\n\nWhen you start the game it's Winter time. It's cold and it snows a lot. The roads are slippery and covered in snow. After some certain events I won't spoil, you return to the city during Spring time where everything feels more alive. More bright colors, people driving their convertible cars and the streets are finally filled with green grass without any sign of snow. As always, it's great to drive around town when it starts to rain. Feels good. This was a good idea to give you the feeling that time is passing. It's always interesting to see a different season after some time when playing a game.\n\nThe visuals are really well done. Facial animations are really good and they made a great job with the details on the characters faces such little scars or others "imperfections". The city feels amazing and things like bridges have great textures and look particulary well done. You can see that there was a big effort on the little details around the city too. Posters, prints and the Marketing about Cars, beer and other products are really well done using the culture from the time like the pin-up style.\n\nThere are not many side quests or activities to do as someone might expect from other open games but the Story makes up for it leaving you interested from start to finish. There are however some Collectibles that may extend your play through such the Playboy Magazines which is a nice touch and I'm sure it will take many more effort from players to search for them since they can be more interesting than, say, collecting dog tags or audio logs for completion purposes.\n\nBottom line, this was a good game with an interesting Story. I had great fun with it but I think it's time to move to the next game on my Backlog. I would honestly recommend this game and if you like the setting then you won't be disappointed to see the work they put in recreating these times paid of. *\n\nSide curiosities:\n\n- Some people requested this game to be banned in Italy due the fact that it could damage the portrait of Italian-Americans.\n\n- It's one of the games that uses the "F" word the most (more than 200 times).\n\n- While there are Playboy magazines to be collected these did not exist in the time the game was occurring (1945 to 1951) only 7 years later in 1953. As for the images from the game itself they are from 1958 to 1968.","February 17, 2014","true","11.2"," 69 of 82 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","69","82","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/singularious/recommended/50130/","singularious","The Singularious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/singularious/","598 products in account","Three disclaimers before this review:\n\n1. I am a big RPG fan.\n\n2. I love story-driven games.\n\n3. If you hate to read words, then skip to the end.\n\nI blew through the main campaign in Mafia II in just over 15 hours, and I would say that my overall rating would land very close to the Metacritic average. I'd give it a C+ or B-\n\nMost reading this already know what kind of a game Mafia II is. For those just starting their investigation, it's a 3P action shooter/driver. There will be inevitable comparisons to the Grand Theft Auto series, but outside of the big city setting and gunplay, it really isn't. All preconceived notions there should be thrown to the wind.\n\nWhat I liked about Mafia II:\n\n1. I loved the story driven game. The writers did a good job of tying seemingly disparate scenes together later in the game. And there was enough character development to at least *begin* to become emotionally tied (or repulsed) by certain main characters. More on that later.\n\n2. Dialogue. You're going to have quite a few cutscenes in this game. I personally thought they were well dispersed and well-done. Voice acting is *excellent* and dialogue writing is good (not great, more on that later).\n\n3. I loved the shooting mechanics. Some will disagree strongly, but I played with an XBOX 360 controller, and I found the shooting to be fairly true to real life. You can definitely nail down plenty of head shots, but you're going to have to work to be able to do so. Pistols were actually my favorite in-game, as I could (when able) concentrate on one enemy at a time. I also loved that NPCs responded to my firing. They would behave differently when I was firing. It came in handy later in the game with larger fields of oppenents.\n\n4. I really liked the relationship with police. They seemed to ramp up their vigilance accordingly, and occasionally, they (realistically) interrupted gunfights with other parties to try and bring order. Sometimes, this was a welcome "backup", and other times it was infuriating, but fairly realistic.\n\n5. The length of the game. It was relatively short, but for me (parent, full-time employed) it was perfect. No grinding, very little backtracking. A clean, linear gameplay line on the main story. Note that I did very few side quests (maybe two?). This is not an open-world game (no DLC for me), for those that prefer them.\n\n6. The settings and extras. I loved the way the seasons changed and it affected everything from driving (snow, ice) to attire and graphics. The environment really draws you into the time period you're playing in nicely. The collectable WANTED posters and Playboy magazines are a nice touch, too. Vintage specific/appropriate and a little treat. I can't imagine who is rolling through and finding all 100 mags, but that achievement is available for you perv completionists out there. ;)\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n1. The story. Yes, I also liked it. But there were moments where it felt forced. There were scenes in the game that I kept wondering, "What am I doing here?". But they had to be played. Those times it felt much less organic than it could've. Overall, the story was compelling, but it was close to having been truly great. The game is most certainly still worth playing, IMO, but it left me with a little twitching feeling about what could've been. While some characters were developed fully, others left me scratching my head and wondering about motives and actions.\n\n2. The dialoge writing. There were some great dialogue moments, but there were also a few moments of gratuitous self-indulgence. I'm not a prude or a puritan, but there were a couple scenes that seemed over the top for no apparent reason. As a writer myself, I realize sometimes part of character development is showing an ugly side of someone, but in Mafia II this seemed to happen with dead ends to further development (Eddie, in particular, IMO). I just left with the feeling that someone thought this would be appealing to a certain audience. If so, that audience is younger and more crass than me (which is fine).\n\n3. A lack of choices. This is on me, since the game isn't an RPG. *But*, due to character development (or lack thereof) in several scenes, I kept thinking, "WTF, man!? WHY am I trusting this guy? There is no sane person who would do a job for this guy after what he's done to me. This doesn't make any sense." There were also several fire fights that turned into mass murder scenes as opposed to calculated revenge kills. Those weren't realistic or fun for me, even though I *loved* the fire fight mechanics.\n\n4. A lack of stealth abilities. This isn't the only game like this. But there were moments where it would've made sense IRL (to me, anyway) to actually be just a *bit* more subtle in entry into/exit of an enemy stronghold. It would've been considerably more rewarding and fun to at least *start* to choke people out/knock them out/muffle a shot before you got noticed. There was precious little of this available.\n\nOverall, if you've got 15-20 hours to kill, I'd actually recommend this game highly. Especially if you've grown tired of sci-fi/fantasy settings and want to play something closer to home (Earth, 20th Century).\n\nMafia II has a really, really good story, some very memorable moments, some incredibly fun shootouts, and quite a few other fun missions that I've never seen in a game before. On sale, this game is well worth it, and for those that have already picked up free/cheap, I'd queue it up. I don't think many will be disappointed.\n\nPlay on and be happy, peoples.","December 9, 2013","true","17.3"," 54 of 63 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","54","63","0","0"

Roaming the streets of Empire Bay had its limitations on what you could do and what you couldn't. It's free roam felt slightly restricted as it's not as open as games such as the GTA (Grand Theft Auto) series. The open world felt quite similar to Sleeping Dogs in a way.\n\nThe 1940s-1950s setting didn't feel like a new era to me as it reminded me of games such as Driver which was one of many favourite memories. The music in the game didn't appeal to me too much as I'm not really a fan of the 50s music.\n\nThe customization with vehicles and character clothing is very limited, although it was enough for me to enjoy. Graphics were decent and didn't get me too worried about it.\n\nI encounted a bug or two while playing the game and a graphical problem which did get quite frustrating to a point. The checkpoint system in this game also felt like a very perfunctory attempt by 2K Games which would have added about an hour of unnecessary playtime.\n\nGameplay felt similar to GTA in a lot of ways which I was able to adapt to easily. There were quite a few mundane missions which consisted of driving to locations, etc. Getting into a gun fight in this game really felt riviting and awesome! Along with everything else, the storyline is what kept me going through this game. It basically covers the game up from a lot of it's flaws.\n\nDefinately a game worth playing if you are in for a good storyline and pumping gun fights.\n\nScore: 7.5","November 27, 2013","true","15.5"," 52 of 62 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","52","62","0","0"

THESE ARE WONDERFUL NEWS TO EVERYONE WHO DIDN'T TRY OUT THIS GAME YET!\nAd-notation #2: I am giving this title a GOTY for 2010. Even in 2016, it's still a masterpiece.\nBasic Information\nTitle: Mafia II\nGenre: Action\nDeveloper: 2K Czech\nPublisher: 2K Games\nRelease Date: 22 Mar, 2011\n\nGeneral Impression\nMafia II is a game that is more than great! It also has a big impact of emotions, when you see its final scene you are likely to cry, or to be sorry, because Joe is taken away from Vito. In this game you have 15 chapters, 50 playboys, 250 wanted posters and so many collectibles. In the free roam time you can take a car and drive through the beautiful city of Empire Bay (New York City). You can also fight with the cops or with the gangsters, you can have both fists and gun fights. There are a lot of shops, alike: clothing store, upgrading cars workshop, gun shop, restaurants and bars. I played it very much because I felt like this is the perfect game for me. Shooting is very nice and it's also comfortable. Driving cars is awesome, because it's easy to handle any car. This game is similar to Grand Theft Auto IV, but I consider it better made.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics of this game are beautifully designed, being somehow close to the reality, because this game takes place in Empire Bay, a copy after New York City. The nature things are well designed, such as trees, the sky, the grass, flowers, etc. The buildings seem a lot with the real ones from New York City, which is enjoyable. The cars are just art, I love the way they are designed, they make you feel like you're in the old times. The sky varies from temperature, being sunny, cloudy, etc.\n\nAtmosphere\nThe atmosphere of this game varies from being inside you own house to being outside or in a restaurant/building. When you're driving, the police has a very well made AI, because when you go beyond the legal limit or crashing into another car, they will fine you. On bridges/highways you can drive with 70 MPH, and in the city only with 40 MPH. In the cities, you may find a lot of buildings, roads, people, stores, nature things, etc. Unfortunately, you can't enter most buildings, the ones being accessible are your flats/houses and stores. It tends to be an open world game, even though the missions tell you exactly where to go, without any side quests. In the DLCs, you choose the missions in what order you like, being better for Open-World guys. This game has both countryside part, but mostly city part.\n\nAudio\nThe soundtrack of this game were made by Matus Siroky and Adam Kuruc, 2 well known composers. While driving, you are able to switch the radio station to 3 big channels. They deliver music and news. The outside sounds are pretty much the noise of cars, people who are talking, and even nature sounds, such as birds, winds, etc. When you're in a building, you can mostly hear car horns. During the missions, soundtracks will play, all of them completing the game's Original Soundtrack. The bullets' sounds are also realistic, as well as the engine noise of the cars.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is about a young guy Vito, who accomplishes missions, such as killing enemies, eliminating important bosses, and mostly anything related to killing. Vito has a large selection of guns where to choose from, such as machine guns, rifles, pistols, grenades and his own fists. Vito can run very quick forever, unlikely in other games, where stamina is not unlimited. His health recovers pretty fast, depending on the difficulty. On hard, you aren't able to see where enemies are located on the minimap, so that you have to spot them. The more your health drops, the more likely it won't sit at 100% forever. It will come lower and lower, snacks and drinks can fully recover his health. Both gunfights and boxing are very fun. Driving cars feels very awesome, just think when you listen to old but gold music and driving through the New York City. It's just a great feeling.\n\nStory\nThe story is about a young guy called Vittorio Antonio Scalleta (Vito Scalleta) who came from Sicily in USA with his poor family. His parents were poor, living his early life in a poorneighborhood, where he met Joe. When they both get 18 years old, they tried to rob a bank. Joe escaped from the police, but Vito didn't. He had to choose between jail or going to World War 2. He chose World War 2, which is a mission in the first chapter. Vito is taken as a soldier in Sicily, participating in the Husky Operation. He got shot, so he got back to America. In chapter 2, Joe manages to keep Vito home, getting him a car and a new place to live, his own house. Through the 15 chapters, Vito will take part in missions through the whole Empire Bay, helping his buddies, Joe Barbaro and Heny Tomasino. He will have to do a lot of choices, killing a lot of people, and generally having a pretty sad life. I won't spoil the ending, because the story wouldn't be nice while knowning the ending.\n\nEngines\nThe engines on this game are well optimized, I haven't met any bugs or crashes, neither screen freezes. The people's movements are realistic, depending on the situation, moving calm or either running out from the firefight. The car movement feels very realistic, the crashing is also very accurate. The water always flows, but when you fire bullets in it, it will start shacking. You can also go with your car in the water, resulting in a respawn back on the ground. The nature objects seem very nice, especially trees, which always shake because of the wind, etc. This game can be run even on pretty old computers, which I consider very important, looking at the fact that this game is complex.\n\nStrong PointsVery nice graphics for 2010\nGood and emotional story\nGood gameplay and feeling\nVery good engines and movements\nVery rare to none crashes or bugs\nYou have a lot of cars to ride\nYou have a lot of weapons\nVery big surface to explore in many ways\nYou can earn a lot of cash to spend in stores\nWeak PointsThe ending is very vaguely presented\nNo side quests / additional missions\nNo multiplayer, the biggest disadvantageGeneral Ratings\nGraphics: 9/10\nAtmosphere: 9/10\nAudio: 10/10\nEngines: 9.5/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nStory: 10/10\n\nPersonal Rating: 9.41/10\n\nNote: All ratings are being given in function of the game's releasing year.","March 4","true","140.8"," 69 of 89 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","69","89","10","19"

Story is linear yet rather compelling with some scenes / missions intersecting with the original Mafia story line, quite a nice touch there. Environment & graphics are great & really captures the mid-40's to early 50's expertly, with authentic to era music, vehicles, weapons & clothing. Although besides the hunt for easter eggs there's very little incentive to stray from the main story line & not a lot happening if you do. It's an immersive open-world with the freedom to do but a few things. Voice acting is good.\n\nCombat mechanics feel quite good & are overall rather satisfying, the cover system is fluid & practical. Good melee fighting mechanics, however very basic. Nice stealth system, yet is only optional for a couple of missions. The driving feels good, but does get a bit repetitive. The AI is mostly quite sophisticated & seems to offer randomised  events purely for spectation appeal.\n\nOverall it's a good title well worth a once over.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluehardt/recommended/50130/","bluehardt","Blue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluehardt/","403 products in account","Heavily focused on storyline and action packed game with great attention to detail, which you do not want to miss on.\nWhat can you expect from Mafia II? Beautifully crafted city to experience, '40-50s atmosphere delivered by music, clothing, guns, cars and rest of the visuals overall, well done driving mechanics, where every car handles differently along with the same feeling when it comes to shooting from a variety of guns.\n\nThere are so many tiny details, which make the experience even more rewarding, like: driving on a red light can trigger nerby police patrols to start a chase after you, if you drive car long enough it can run out of fuel, no more "every car is open and ready to go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t" or packing two magazines of bullets into enemies, before they fall down. It's really easy to immerse into the world.\n\nStrongest point of the game is without a doubt - its plot. Without spoilering anything - life in a family isn't as colorful as one would expect. One day you are rich and without any worries about tommorow, when suddenly you are left out on a street the next day. Story of Vito Scaletta goes through all of the shades, from white to black and all the way around again. You need to remember that being a member of the family has its own set of rules and responsibilities, and all in all - it's like walking on rope. Remember, everything is just a buisness.\n\nGreat cutscenes with beautifuly animated characters supports told story strongly.\n\nI can't really put a finger on anything to be honest. If I've really wanted to find any flaws - that would be probably enemies' AI, who sometimes acted really out of place (like running straight on you for no reason), but for the most of the time it wasn't a case.\n\nOne thing I would wish for (even though whole package was complete) were moments where you had to make a certain choice. During the game there were more than a few moments which could be resolved by an ablity to decide about their outcome - choosing one or the other way to deal out with the problem at hand. Would call it a perfect game then.\n\nMy verdict? This comes as close to a 10/10 as it gets, but since some minor things could be improved 9.5/10 for overall experience.\n\nP.S.

It really feels like you are playing through a mafia movie, or moreso a season of a show akin to The Sopranos.  This is mostly a great story-driven experience set in a sandbox, more than it is a traditional sandbox game.\n\nSomething about Mafia II is just charming in a way that makes it really fun even though there is nothing groundbreaking about it.  The story is great, in my opinion, and the voice acting is beyond solid; and the simple things like the different atmospheres of the different chapters (due to weather, time period, etc.) keep you enticed with the game even though it may have comparably less features than other sandbox games like it.\n\nIf you just play through the main story it can feel like the sandbox is tiny, but it really is quite large.  If you like collectibles and hunt down the wanted posters, or just wander around, there is really quite a large world to explore.\n\nThere are some flaws, but they are mostly insignificant and easily ignored, and nothing really that damning.  If you want to play on hard the checkpoint system may prove a little frustrating but just make sure you go very slow, and if you play on easy you really shouldn't die at all so you can focus on enjoying the story.\n\nBasically, if you've played a sandbox game like this, then you have already experienced all the gameplay this has to offer.  But if you are looking to experience a good story in a game, or simply want another new sandbox to explore, or maybe both: I can say you will enjoy Mafia II for sure.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","September 7, 2014","true","84.7"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","34","43","0","0"

An injury however will give you the chance to rest a few weeks back in Empire Bay where your mother and sister live. Joe however uses his contacts to hand you over the neccessary papers to get out of the military service.\nAfter he welcomes you and picks you up for a small drink and sends you home, you are fee to discover the open world.\n\nThe open world\n\nis pretty alive as there are different weather effects such as snow, rain, sunshine etc and there is a day night circle but it will only shift when you begin a mew mission.\nThere are a lot of different npcs doing a lot of different things and remain quite chatty or angry if you bump into them. Some will get out of the car just to curse you if you have caused an accident.\nIf you missbehave for example you are speeding, the police will take action and persue you, however they are far more tolerant than the officers from GTA. If you stop and wait till they come to your window, you can pay a fee and they will let you go.\nAt certain spots you can watch the railway go by, ships cruising on the sea and riverside or even airplanes crossing the sky. The sounds contribute a lot to the atmosphere and change according to the place you travel.\n\nVisually the game still keeps up with current games and only a few textures might reveal that the game was released a few years back.\n\nThere are 3 different radio stations you can listen to or turn off the radio if you rather enjoy your own music.\n\nThe map is not that big and sadly some features like public transport is cut from the final version of the game which is really dissappointing since the map could have been even more alive that way. You could have used taxis buses or even the subway as a passanger and probably travel a bit faster from a to b.\nThere are some buildings you can enter for example burgershops to regain some more heatlh, clothes shops to change your outfit and gas stations to buy gas for your vehicle.\nYou also will have a place to live which however is often changing during the events of the story.\nSome quest related buildings are only accessible during the story mode.\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe missions\n\nare often different from eachother, adding a lot fun to the gameplay. However during the end of the game I and a lot of other players had the impression the devs had too much pressure to keep up the release date and the missions become somewhat plain and routine.\nYou can also finish missions in different ways and sometimes have a different outcome for example if you have to break into a building and open a safe you either can rush in and shoot your way out running from the cops or you can sneak in stealthkill or avoid the guards, move to the basement, turn off the alarm and open the safe without any noise to leave silently. This will also affect the cash you earn at the end.\nYou can fight unarmed or with a large selection of different firearms. The combat is really fluent and also the dodging to avoid enemy hits or bullets works mostly fine.\n\nI wont spoiler about the story even though the game is quite old and it also depends on ones taste anyway. If you like the Italo mafia movies shown on TV you wont be dissappointed for sure. The English voice cast is pretty good and I also think they did a good job with the German voicecast. Twists within the plot keep the story interesting and lets you want to finish the game to its end.\n\nThe dlcs are mostly included now in the so called directors cut edition. Jimmys Vendetta and the Betrayal of Jimmy do sadly not feature a movie based plot which was included in the base game but instead offer mission spots arround the 1953s Empire Bay map. The NPCS mostly are visualized by an imagine and a text stating whats the story about and what you have to do.\n\nIf you still dont have Mafia II and cant get it on Steam, try to search the net or Gamestop to try it out.","May 5","true","5.8"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","0"

Very enjoyable to drive and customize.\n+ Stealth sections are pretty simple but neat, though there are too few.\n+ Graphics, textures, and lighting are decent for their age.\n+ Extensive licensed soundtrack.\n+ Collectibles in this game are magezines with indecent ladies in them.\n\nCons:\n- Not a lot to do in the open world, kind of a tease.\n- So. Much. Driving. Imagine GTA IV, but you can't use a taxi cab to fast travel anywhere.\n- While fist-fighting is a little neat, it was meant to be a niche for this game and isn't all that fleshed out.\n- Sudden, cliff-hanger ending. This game never reached the length the devs wanted it to be (Fifteen chapters short of their goal of forty. Game takes about 10 hours to beat if rushing). Some of the dev-proposed endings are circulating on the internet if you want closure.\n\nShort of GTA IV, best open-world game I've ever played.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/50130/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nMafia II is an open world, action, third person shooter game. Where you play as Vito Scalletta, you follow the life of Vito starting out with being caught in a crime and being sent to fight the war, upon his return he finds himself getting wrapped up with his old buddy "Joe", doing more daring and daunting heists.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You are Vito Scalletta, an immigrant from Sicily. You start out with your friend Joe Barbaro pulling small time jobs, eventually escalating to the point where they join a Mafia family and get themselves really twisted up in some crazy adventure.\nI found myself often times questioning the ethics of this game, but I found it reassuring to see that some of the characters found themselves questioning their very own actions. It's very easy for a game to paint some glamorous "mob glory days" picture of crime, which I personally would disagree with, but the characters seemed quite genuine in what they said and how they acted.\nI don't want to give away any of the story, but let me just say the game doesn't make the "jobs" super easy and make it seem like something you could do in real life. The consequences from various actions where quite believable and made me appreciate, respect, and enjoy the story and this game all that much more.\nOne more note about the story, there are radio announcers which will respond to dynamic events that happen throughout the game, I reacted differently to different scenarios the second time playing through and the radio announcers also had different things to say about the event. I think that's really cool!\n\nGame Play: Don't jump into this game like it's a FPS, it doesn't play like one at all. I started the game on Medium difficulty (I thought I was ready for what was to come... I played Just Cause 2, so I wasn't new to 3rd person shooters... not quite.) Here's the tip: Get used to ducking behind cover, towards the end of the game you can only take a few shots before you die.\nMovement is quite natural, as always; I use a keyboard and mouse for my play style, you duck behind cover, and there isn't much complication with other buttons, unless you're trying to adjust the radio station in the car (I did that often, once I stopped crashing into stuff).\nVehicle controls: Atratzu hates driving in video games, he has it as a taboo, but he tolerated it while playing this game... and he begrudgingly admits that he's now somewhat "okay" at driving around in this world. Fair warning: there is A LOT of driving around in this game, you drive down to your house, then drive to see Joe, then drive with Joe to meet up with another friend, then drive to pick up a truck, then drive that truck to sell something, then drive back home and go to bed. etc, etc, etc.\nDriving isn't that bad, but if you already know you're bad at driving in video games (like me), you might want to consider giving this game a skip.... or walk! but walking would take forever, so I don't suggest walking, just crash into stuff and hide from the cops when they see you fail-driving like me! :D\n\nAchievements: The achievements are standard for most games, but there are a lot of DLC achievements that I won't be able to get because I don't own the DLC. Achievements are: "Beat the game", "Beat the game on hard difficulty", "Do this neat thing while on this chapter of the game", "Do this neat thing sometime in the game", "Do something you wouldn't have thought to do", and a few grindy "do this again enough times until we give you the achievement".\n\nPrice: Mafia II costs $29.99 I spent 25 hours in the game (09/11/14), I still haven't gotten the last few achievements that aren't linked with the DLC, so I'll probably put in enough time to average the game out at 30 hours. so the quality of the game is definitely good. I would recommend buying the game with the DLC, or getting it from a humble bundle (which is where I got mine).\n\nConclusion: I enjoyed the game, it was slow going, because I didn't like driving, but once I got the hang of it, I stopped following traffic rules and would dart around cars and get to my story location in very good time.\nI would recommend this game to someone who enjoys crime-type-games already. It's difficult for me to think of a standard demographic to recommend this game for because it has a big mix in it, you need to drive, shoot, duck behind cover, run, and like hearing a story. If you like some or all of those this game is for you.\nTo recap:  The story was excellent, The game play was straight forward, driving kicked my butt,  achievements aren't really note worthy, if you want 100% get the dlc, the price was fair for the time I spent. I recommend this game.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update December 30, 2014:\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Jimmy's Vendetta DLC\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Joe's Adventures DLC","September 11, 2014","true","229.3"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","7"

I bought it for the hell of just buying it, thinking i probably wouldn't touch it for a couple weeks. But thankfully i played it.\n\nStory:\nThe story of this game is great. It will keep you hooked on playing it until you finish the game. The only downside to it is that it is pretty short. Around 9-10 hours depending on if you want to find the wanted posters or playboy magazines. (Or if you decide to buy the DLC)\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay was great for a 3rd person shooter. Driving is actually enjoyable unlike GTA IV. The game ran buttery smooth on my rig straight out of the box and no ini file modifications needed.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics aren't exactly the greatest but they are by no means ugly. The faces of some characters will look kinda like they haven't loaded in the textures but that is their actual texture.\n\nSound:\nGreat sound track from the era. Fallout players will notice some songs from Fallout are in this. Cars, guns and explosives have great sound effects. The voice acting in this is amazing.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nFor what i paid, it was worth every cent. One of the better games i have played in a while since sleeping dogs. The only noticeable downsides to it for me was the shortness of the story and the lack of a free roam mode.","December 2, 2014","true","12.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","2"

I had to :)\n\nAnyway, if you're looking for over-the-top fun and gameplay like in GTA or Saints Row, you won't get it here. This game's main focus is the story and the characters. You'll more often than not feel like you're playing a movie and waiting for another cutscene. Mafia 2 takes place during and after the 2nd world war and follows the story of Vito Scalleta and his best friend Joe Barbaro as they get involved with the Mafia. Without spoiling too much, the game takes some inspiration from the classic mafia movies, like The Godfather and The Goodfellas. I must also admit that I shed some tears on more than one occasion throughout the game. If you played the first Mafia, you'll also find a nod to the main character in one chapter, which recreates a certain event that happened in the first one.\n\nMost of the Mafia II takes place in the fictional city of Empire Bay, which I think is based on New York and is fully explorable by the player. You are able to go pretty much anywhere with your vast collection of classic cars. The gunplay consists of using the cover-system and a variety of authentic weapons from that era, like MP40s, Thompsons and many more. The melee combat, while not on par with Sleeping Dogs or Batman games, is pretty good and challenging.\n\nWhile the game is athmospheric and recreates the 40s and 50s very well, I must say that I'm dissapointed with the inconsistencies regarding the texture quality, most of it is good, but some things look considerably worse and can sometimes break the immersion. The game also suffers from some pretty noticable object pop-in. But, this game is one of the few, that does the depth of field right, I usually don't like DOF, but in this game it was very pretty. Also, the first part of the game takes place during the winter and the second part is during the summer, so It freshens up the game a bit.\n\nIf you're planing on buying it, you can safely purchase the base game without the DLC, which is more or less the cosmetic stuff. There are 2 'expansions', one of them has no story whatsoever and is very arcady (Jimmy's Vendetta) and the other one (Joe's Adventures) only has 1 mission which ties in to the main story.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like story rich games, like The Last of Us, Grand Theft Auto IV, Wolfenstein The New Order and so on,\nor if you like classic movies about the Mafia and awesome Italian accents, then by all means, get this game. You will not be disapointed. But if you're the type that skips all the cutscenes and doesn't care about the plot, then this game is not for you.\n\n\n(By the way, don't be fooled by my playtime, I've beat this game 2 or 3 times, before I was into "supporting the developers" thing, if you know what I mean. Once I got it for 'free' on my PS+, I didn't feel the need to buy it again on Steam, so I pirated on PC. For that I'm deeply ashamed and will probably buy Mafia III as soon as it comes out.)","August 21, 2014","true","13.4"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","2"

It follows the exploits of Vito Scaletta, the son of an immigrant to Empire Bay (New York), who, with his friend Joe, slowly finds his way into the Italian Mafia.\n\nHis tale is not a classic rise the power one, more like a series of schemes and jobs to raise money to pay back his latest debt. This creates a very realistic motivation but serves as a poor game element, because the developers regularly just wipe your entire in-game account to create a reason for the “next big plan”.\n\nSince the plot follows a get rich, lose money cycle for almost an entire decade, it is very episodic in nature, divided into 15 chapters. The large time span and almost self-contained chapters were a good tool to build the world, but not so great when it came to character development. The cast does a great job, but when you see only a small glimpse of the characters’ lives, even they cannot do too much. To compensate, all the missions feel unique with just few enough GTA-like shooting sprees to not turn it into another dumb TPS.\n\nOn its own, Mafia II is an enjoyable plot-oriented shooter/driver game with a small map (that feels more like a fan-made GTA IV mod project). Compared to its predecessor though, it feels shallow. Mafia 1 was like the Godfather trilogy with an excellent main character you could relate to: a good man who ended up in a bad life. Mafia II is more like a weaker season of Sopranos: grittier atmosphere, lots of cursing, and a main character that is nothing but a two-bit thug. It is a good game with a good story, but it had the misfortune to follow up a much better one.","December 14, 2015","true","37.7"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","26","38","2","12"

The story is very engaging and interesting, full of humor, action and tragedy. The game has an amazing atmosphere and a soundtrack that really reflects the times of the game. The city is huge and is full of life but I miss the exit of the city as it was in The City of Lost Heaven. On the plus side I can add is that in the game we will play during the two seasons, winter and summer. The big downside of this part is certainly the lack of Free Ride mode in the basic version and a small number of vehicles, but the great advantage of this production is the addition of a realistic driving mode. AI is at a high level but sometimes can make you laugh his stupidity. To survive you have to use the cover because otherwise our opponents will use it against us. I like the system because of police action when we cross the speed police will only give us the mandate and when you kill someone normally or by a car then they will have our description or car registrations. The game I passed 3 times and I have a lot of fun, but for hunters achievements can be a big problem because when you collect the wanted posters which does not have to appear but the game itself is very good and I recommend it to all who like that kind of game.","July 29, 2015","true","44.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","14","17","3","0"

It was sort of like playing through an alternate earlier era version of Goodfellas. Certainly the dialogue was right in line with it as was the story.\nThe gameplay was pretty stellar. The cars handled fairly like real life cars, the gunfights were fun as hell, and the quests never really got boring. The story itself was engaging from beginning to end.\nThere were some laggy moments during some of the gunfights, but overall the game handled quite well, and considering the scope of the game, that was really pretty impressive. The choice of music was spot on.\n\nThis is one that somehow passed me by when it was released, but I was very glad to have had an opportunity to play it. There is actualy a lot of repllay value as far as collectibles and the potential to clear up missed quest variations, plau there is DLC (which I dont presently own) which I imagine ups the ante even more.\n\nJust know....with Mafia gangster type people, there are no sunny endings, lol.\n\nanyway, I give this one 8 out of 10. I also feel it is actually a must own must play. However, if you are overly sensitive and/opr dont understand the social dynamics of the 40's and 50's, you might give it a miss.

Great storyline, visuals, dialogue, and a decent combat system make this quite the experience.\n\nI didnt like Mafia 1 much, but I figured I'd give this one a shot. It does away with all the excessive police fines and restrictions that the first game nagged about. You can still alert the police through speeding or hit-and-run incidents in this game, but now you can escape the police or choose to bribe them. The game appears to be open world and controls like a typical GTA game, but in actuality, its pretty linear. This isn't realy a bad thing. Its just something to keep in mind when playing. You wont have side quests or side missions to waste away time in the sandbox environment like you would in a typical GTA game. There are collectibles, but theyre all artwork and don't add any bonuses for your character.\n\nAlso, the game does a great job in connecting you to the main characters, which was the driving factor in me getting hooked.","December 28, 2014","true","13.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

If you're fond of quoting Don Corleone and Tony Soprano, don't miss this game.Mafia II is exactly the sequel Mafia fans have been waiting all these years for.It is ambitious in its presentation, the script immerses us in the life of a gangster from the very beginning, and the missions are hardly repetitive: there is always an unexpected twist or a new situation which tests our abilities.Yes, it's full of clichés, I saw them coming from a mile away, but it's exactly what you need to create that feeling of respect and even appreciation for what really were cruel murders, blood baths, territorial fights, extortion or drug traffic. But all of it elegantly done, in a tie and suit, in fancy restaurants and luxury cars.For fans of mobster movies, Mafia II is the ultimate toybox. It has period clothes, music, and architecture that perfectly evoke pre and post-war America, and a gritty script to boot.Mafia 2 is a great old-school-action game.","June 19, 2014","true","118.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","1"

This game has very good soundtracks from back in the day and I'm talking about 1950s+, except for that one track (from what i notice) from the Everly brothers but it fits the mood either way. The game was somewhat too short i don’t know if it was because i was into it and time flew by or if its short because it is. When you wack people it feels good, the chases are nice though i must warn you, If you expect need for speed handles and 2013 Handles then you are greatly Wrong because the cars in this game are OLD as *Uck. Therefore, your handling will suck in nature BUT that doesn’t stop the game from being a great game. You can rob stores,  you can customize cars and their license etc Cool cool cool. But please whatever you do DO NOT mess with the Mafiosos in the streets because you will surely Die, I'm not kidding. Anyways as i was saying the game has good soundtrack, it looks good, and definitely lives up to its tittle of being a Mafia Game. I personally give this game an 8/10 2 points off because i wished it was Longer... Also part of me wishes you could have traveling through countries but is nothing big.","November 30, 2013","true","21.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

The storyline of this game is absoulutely AMAZING. It's possibly my most favourite storyline out of any game. You really get to know the characters in an emotional way and the action is insane!\nI may only have 20 hours on record but I've completed this game TWICE, and the only reason it's 9/10 is the ending.\nNo spoilers but the ending truly was dissapointing, the way the game ended was dissapointing. I was so disheartened when I found out you couldn't continue in Free Roam after completing the story. If you wish to Free Roam you have to restart the story which in my opinion was a massive  penisblock.\n\nThis is a must have game especially with the Steam sales, I bought this game a long time ago and for the price (now) of the low price of £4.99, BUY THIS GAME! I've also played the DLC but honestly, it doesn't beat the original storyline of Vito Scaletta. It kind of reminds me of the relationship with cousins Roman and Niko Bellic.","December 29, 2014","true","30.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The setting, story-telling and the soundtrack are extraordinary. Mafia II rests on them almost completely, because the actual gameplay is very basic. I did things because I wanted to see what happens to Vito and his friend Joe next. Mafia culture is odd, because while the people kill for profit and lesser reasons, they have friends and families. That is actually represented here well. The humor is generally black, with Vito playing the straight man to Joes antics. While they are not good people, they feel human and have a lust for life, so I rooted for them. I should not finish my positive recommendation on a sour note, but the body count... if an actual criminal did one tenth of the things in any crime game, they would empty Fort Knox of gold and store him there. Here it shows even worse because other things are realistic in comparison.","July 21, 2013","true","28.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

If you\'re expecting GTA, forgetabouit. This is a movie set in an open world, where you can choose to take the long way home if you want. I\'ve spent hundereds of hours on the Xbox 360 and plan to spend many more on PC, now that it\'s been added back onto Steam. The game really is a captivating experience that captures both the spirit of the 1940s, the 1950s, and the Mafia, rolling all three into a compelling story highlighted by well-written set-pieces and punctuated by some of the best voice acting put in a game. Graphically the game still shines, with PHYSX effects still stunning today. While the map is small compared to GTA V, it never feels small or cramped. Instead, each neighborhood has a specific feeling that includes arcitecture, pedestrian population and even the condition of the automobiles. Speaking of automobiles: no game has ever made driving so much fun in an open world. With normal steering/handling settings, the game has a very competent handling model that is both fun and approachable. With simulation settings and a controller for throttle/brake control, this becomes a driving simulation that rivals any other game. Cars have weight and handle like the beautiful barges they are. Graceful styling and recognizeable shapes make any fan of Automobiles from the 30s-50s feel right at home behind the wheel of a sport Smith Thunderbolt or an older Walter Coupe. Even with the Joe\'s Adventure and Jimmy DLC\'s, the game continues to amaze with some really nice set piece shootouts, surrounded by several extra hours worth of fun arcade-style open world missions which feel much closer to the form of GTA but without the sometimes over-the-top action sequences (you won\'t be landing a motorcycle on a train). Mafia II is my favorite game of all time because it takes me to a different time and place and let\'s me enjoy the life of Vito Scaletta.

Bought it, downloaded it, as soon as possible started playing, and got so tied up to the story that had to finish it in marathon.\n\nFirst, let me mention the soundtrack. I was yet to find a game that would reach Fallout 3's level regarding soundtrack, this was the day I found it. Great hits from the 50's and so on. It's a shame there are only 3 radio stations though, but take it from me, you won't be changing stations because of a bad song tuning up, that's for granted.\nThe graphis are great for a game 4 years old, some details better than others, but overall, it's an amazing visual time-travel.\nNow, the awesome story. If you like Mafia themed stuff, or even liked games like L.A.Noire, you'll love this one. The details in character interaction have so much immersion going on that by the end of the day you'll be wearing a fedora and yelling italian curse words for no reason.\nLast but not least, right in the beginning you meet a suicidal cat. 10/10","July 8, 2014","true","14.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

And that's all the introduction you need.\nThe storyline was pretty amazing, along with a great soundtrack (not going to give examples of artists or songs because many of them i didn't even knew myself, the music is from that specific time), I love the gameplay of this game, you have a big variety of cars, decisions to make, i wasn't very happy about the number of weapons in this game, but they are enough, this small number of weapons includes the famous Colt 1911, which is my all-time favorite gun ever made, and an MP-40 that i would love to have for collection.\nThe graphics are astonishing, yet, it comes with a price, since the game could've been better optimized,\nOn steam i didn't play this game very much, for some reason, when i tried to i kept having some visual glitches that annoyed me alot, tho i have played it non-steam a long time ago and everything worked like charm, they probably fixed the video issues.\nWhat i didn't like from the publishers/developers, they kept teasing the gaming community with this game since 2007, that is not a nice thing to do.\n\nAll that being said, i recommend this game, it had a major emotional impact on me for various reasons, but mostly because of the similarities between Vito Scaletta and myself.\nI am looking forward for Mafia III, if they decide to make it, and i really hope they will.

We know that graphics aren't from the same time (MI 2002, MII 2010) and it's so obvious that MII have better graphics and mechanics but still I think MI is more superior.\nIn MI Tommy Angelo was a taxi driver who one night was smoking a cigarette for some relax :P and then he had unexpected passengers Paulie and Sam (he helped them escape from gangsters who were pursuing them). As a taxi driver he has a great driving skills, but he wasn't experienced with guns, so how in the hell he could drive and shoot from his car with that precision, on other side (MII) we have Vito who couldn't do the same thing (he was dependent on Joe's shooting skills :| ) if he was a soldier in WW II, driving jeep and ♥♥♥♥ as he said ? :p\nIn MI you have to deal with prohibition, uncomfortable to family politics, other Mafia members and dons, collect tribute, do special assassinations, bank robbery, racing and special side missions for "bonus" cars.\nMI was also more complex for example (pursuing Don Morello as I experienced it have 2 possible endings 1: you are far away from his car, so you have to shoot his starting plane on airport 2: you are near his car that will prolong that pursue (car won't turn left to the airport), after assassination of one of the politics the next part of mission depends on (one witness who was working near sewer, if you won't kill him he'll call cops so after exiting prison stage you have Feds looking for you or if you won't drop all weapons before exiting prison you'll meet Feds who will search Tommy for weapons). Also story was more surprising.\nIn MII all you allies are indestructible they can run as human tank without hurting themselves also they won't be hurt in car (in MI you have to watch your and your allies health if you ♥♥♥♥ up  repeat mission :P). It's the developers idea to make this game easy? even the ammo is simplified in MII, like in other games, 2/6 shots in barrel? nah it will use only 4 to make it 6/6 in MI any bullet is important why? Well Tommy gun have 49/50 ammo after reload it still uses full ammo of bullets it's because you threw away almost full magazine? (I like this idea) ^^ The health bar is regenerating (hard mode is 4/5 or 3/4), but enough about MI.\nMII:\n\nimprove your car (buy new plate and personalise it, 5 letters (Polish famousK****  will fit perfectly ^^, tune up engine, repaint car, repair it (it won't look like in NFS Underground but it's enough))\n(cars) why not include mileage meter like before in speed meter thing?\nbuy uniforms, jackets, and wear them as you like\nsimplisied daily basics (wake up, eat, drink, wear) :P\nfist half quick time event fight system (that's pity that you won't use baseball bat, or knuckle-duster)\npick lock mini games\nstealth missions no not like in Splinter Cell (you can drag body, but it won't be necessary / not enough enemy who would find corpse)\nwide arsenal\nand really? no sniper rifle, or sawed-off shotgun?\ngreat retro music radio stations (it will ever contain news what happened before => mission)\ncover mechanism (sometimes very annoying)\ngood storyline (even connection between MI and MII, won't spoil that thing, play for yourself to find out :P )\nachievements!!!\nporn mags xD\nbreakable objects\nnot as long as MI\nnot free ride option? (don't know about DLCs but i will find out someday)\nIn conclusion MII is a great game but still I feel there's something missing, maybe it's because of my nostalgia toward MI (replayed it 4 times).\nI can highly recommend this game, but better start with the first one (if you can struggle those old graphics) ^^\n\n8,5/10","February 19, 2015","true","72.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mafiaguy7/recommended/50130/","mafiaguy7","Mister Maf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mafiaguy7/","235 products in account","Mafia II is an open-world adventure game that takes place in the '40s, '50s, and '60s, following the story of a World War II veteran who gets mixed up in the organized crime world of Empire Bay (New York City).  Seeing the words "open-world crime adventure set in NYC" might lead one to expect a Grand Theft Auto clone, but a GTA clone it is not.  Mafia II's focus is not so much on the freeness of its open world, so much as using the open world as the believable and immersive backdrop for its story.\n\nMafia II is organized into "chapters" - each starts when protagonist Vito Scaletta wakes up, and usually end when he goes to bed.  Everything that happens in between is the ever-advancing story of Scaletta descending deeper and deeper into the proverbial rabbit hole of the New York mafia, encountering, befriending, and swearing loyalty to a number of characters - some trustworthy, and some not.\n\nThe game isn't like GTA where there is lots to do in between missions and the player isn't really actively encouraged to participate in the story; Mafia II's story continues right away at the start of each chapter.  The end of most if not all chapters leave you riveted to your chair, eager to see what happens next - especially as the story progresses and Scaletta starts to find out just how deep the rabbit hole goes.  There's also a great tie-in moment for those who played the original game to completion (and the original is great as well, if not a bit aged).\n\nShaking the cops off your tail after they witness you commiting a crime can sometimes be a real challenge, as the police will be looking out for not just your vehicle but also your character in the clothes he is wearing.  Find a new car or get your license plate changed at a car shop to lose your car's wanted status - but unless you change your clothes, too, you run the risk of policemen spotting you in the driver's seat, starting the chase all over again.\n\nFor those interested in the early to mid 20th century culture, Mafia II is an excellent representation.  From the radio stations and car styles to the interior decor of your home and random peoples' clothing, the three decades the game takes place in are presented wonderfully.  Oldschool weapons like the classic Thompson submachine gun and the police-issue revolver are both a pleasure to see and a pleasure to use, as the combat, cover system, and potent feel of the guns are all very well-done.  Watching your character in a fedora and trench coat in third-person gun down rival gangsters with all these classic weapons feels like nothing short of totally badass.  There is also a complex and interesting fisticuffs combat system; at no point will you find the "press X a bunch of times to do flashy acrobatic combat moves" system employed by the Batman Arkham games.\n\nMy only complaint is that the DLC stories aren't nearly as well-done as the main one; you won't be missing much by skipping on them.  I did actually enjoy the Jimmy's Vendetta DLC, the story of an escaped convict in his quest of revenge and his love of driving sports cars way too fast, but it's by no means an essential purchase.  I also didn't get any of the clothing or vehicle DLCs and never really found a want for them as I played the main story.  The base game is very capable of standing on its own two legs.\n\nOverall, Mafia II is one of my favorite singleplayer games of all time.  The story kept me glued to my seat, always having to play just one more chapter, and the gameplay itself is both challenging and a hell of a lot of fun.  A+ recommend.\n\nSide note: the game has a feature that allows the player to limit the car's top speed to the road speed limit, which is a godsend for not crashing into things when you don't want to crash into things.  More games need this.","October 23, 2014","true","19.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

Really good story, gunplay, driving, and physics. The gun play is remarkable. The story progression is great.

You could be halfway through a chapter, you shut down your game, then when you load it back up you are at the beginning. Also, when you are in a huge gun fight and die in the middle of it, it usually spawns you at the beginning of it. The fist fights also can  be annoying. I found myself repeating a fight about 8 times before I knocked his teeth out. Overall, this is a great game and an awesome experience that everyone should have. Get it and play it, you will not regret it.","November 2, 2014","true","13.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The game provides users with very advanced graphics and little to no frame rate issues. You can try a Demo before purchasing to check it for yourselves. Mafia II really reminds visuals of GTA 4, but has a greater attention to detail and allows interaction with small objects.\n\nI absolutely loved that compared to GTA 4, Mafia II does not blindly follows The Murphy's Law - "if something can go wrong - it will". You may have days when you get simplistic tasks that go smooth and there are days when you are assigned to more challenging missions, which involve many natural unknowns and as you would expect, things often (but not always!) will go wrong.\n\nAnother pearl of this game is the radio - while you only have three radio stations, you can observe how the music industry evolved from 1940s to 1950s - from The Chordettes rocking the charts, followed by raise of Frank Sinatra. Equally, radio news keep you updated with all the essential events of the history - fall of Berlin, negative impacts of tobacco, arrival of the TV industry and many more topics that were relevant in the USA during 40s and 50s.\n\nThe little things are the ones that make this game so great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/50130/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Mafia II: The Movie.\n\nThe sequel to Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven, Mafia II is a third-person action-adventure game in the veins of GTA with a mafia theme instead and more story-focused set pieces. You take the role of Vito Scaletta, an up-and-coming gangster trying to climb through the ranks of the Mafia crime families.\n\nThis is without saying that Mafia II’s strongest aspect is its narrative. Whilst the story does not bring anything vastly new to the table, in terms of Italian gangster flicks, the way it unfolds from start to finish feels like a well written screenplay of a movie. It may not win any Oscars, but it is worthy of a nomination at the Golden Globes. Or maybe it is worth no awards, but a thing is certain, it is (subjectively) damn good. The characters are mature, sometimes even funny, but most importantly believable thanks to the strong dialogues and a sturdy voice acting performance from virtually every actor, making it a fairly immersive experience. It simply nails how a mafia should look, sound and act like.\n\nOn a presentation level, Mafia II is exceptional. With some really impressive visuals which even after five years still look great, its setting and atmosphere are incredibly beautiful and authentic, respectively. You feel like you are living in the ‘40s-‘50s America; from the way people behave to chilling to its brilliant soundtrack featuring plenty of classic tunes played on the radio back then. Not only that, but the physics in this game are reasonably realistic and sometimes even enjoyable to watch, whether that is debris falling off the walls from your bullets or the way your enemies ragdoll.\n\nGameplay-wise, it is self-explanatory as it plays out like any recent GTA game in an open-world with only main differences being the time period and the focus on dealing with the mafia gangs. It does have some really nice little touches such as the police chasing you for actually going over the speed limit. Mafia II, at times, really tries to aim for realism. The handling of the cars in the game is mostly acceptable although the controls for some cars could have been tuned a bit more. Surprisingly, the cover system implemented is fluent and functional as almost every wall or object can be used as a cover and there is not a moment where you feel the mechanic is broken in some form or another. However, the introduction of regenerative health might not please everyone as most of the time, from my experience, it feels like a cheap way to storm your way through gun shootouts. But the gunplay is solid as each shot you fire has certain punch to it.\n\nSadly, Mafia II has some obvious and rather irritating design flaws which are mainly due to the direction the developers decided to approach. In fact, these flaws did have a detrimental effect on my overall enjoyment of the game. You see, the biggest misstep the game takes is featuring a highly restricted, yet impressively detailed, open-world which most of the times can also feel “empty”. Firstly, there are no side-quests to try out as you are limited to completing each chapter’s story mission (which is only one per chapter). They would have been a nice addition since they could have acted as a way to take a break from the main storyline. Next, there is basically not much else to do around town aside from using the only available shops which are the ones where you can buy cosmetic items such as clothes, acquire weapons and ammo from weapon vendors and garages to repair or mod your cars; and most of the times you do not even need them. Sure, you can go and rob the shops and get chased by the police, but that is as much fun as you can have from the game outside missions. Then you have the handful of scripted sequences where the game takes away your controls in the middle of whatever you are doing and have you waiting for each sequence to finish. In regards to this, there are moments in the story where the player is forced to do the most mundane activities which just are not fun - and off the top of my mind - like spending five minutes driving to a shop to buy new clothes in the middle of the mission only because you are told to do so. The lack of ways to complete the missions is also laughable since it is always a case of going from A to B in corridor-like patterns shooting your enemies or following your radar when driving your vehicle. All in all, Mafia II might be the most linear and restricted open-world game that I personally played to date, which honestly boggles my mind on why the developers even decided to feature an open-world if the game snatches most of your freedom. I do not even know if I should call it open-world as the only thing open about it is being able to drive around the whole map or shooting civilians when you are not in a story mission. Is it schizophrenic? In most aspects yes, as it appears to have an identity crisis on whether it wants to be a game or an interactive movie. Might as well watch the entire playthrough on YouTube since it plays out as a movie really well.\n\nOther issues encountered are relatively minor, but I feel they are worth mentioning. For instance, the police AI can be silly at times as there are many occasions when they pathetically lose your track in their chase by simply increasing your vehicle’s acceleration, thus posing almost no challenge at all. The lower difficulties available are also extremely easy due to the regenerative health and the cover mechanics, making the experience less rewarding since all you have to do is taking cover to avoid any damage whatsoever. On the other hand, playing it on the hardest difficulty can be punishing at times since your health regeneration is slower and about three bullets can kill you. In a very story-driven game, you do not want to die frequently because it simply ruins the pace of the game. But more importantly, you do not want to die in a game featuring a shoddy checkpoint system. Mafia II’s checkpoint system can be poor at times as you can easily die, for whatever reason, closely to your next checkpoint (which you do not even know when and where it is) and forcing you to start all the way back from the last one saved which can be a bit farther back. Additionally, it would have been ideal if the enemy AI in general was more tactical in a way where they can rotate around their covers and make some sort of push in the battlefield as most of the times they just stand in the same position behind a cover, ultimately making themselves easy targets for the player who can swiftly move around covers. Lastly, the melee combat is pretty pointless. Once you learn the pattern of wait-dodge-punch, you can beat anyone without ever taking a hit.\n\nConclusively, Mafia II is a great interactive movie (masquerading as a game), but an average open-world game at best. However, its redeeming aspects are its strong narrative, authentic setting and atmosphere and the cast of interesting characters. Although I spent a lot more time discussing the negative aspects of the game that annoyed me, that is not to say I did not enjoy Mafia II for what it has to offer - just not fully. I only wish it were not so restricted in so many of its gameplay aspects. It is not a first person shooter, and even some of those have more freedom than Mafia II has. So it is a no brainer: if you are looking for a purely story-driven experience, Mafia II delivers it. Otherwise,  whichever copy of GTA you own should still provide you with plenty of hours of mindless fun. I do give some credit to Mafia II for not being a complete carbon copy of GTA though. Realistically, I would have given this a neutral score, but instead I recommend it mainly because I got it for free, as many others did, so I do not have any of that buyer’s remorse.","November 27, 2015","true","16.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

It's a third-person shooter sandbox game. But, at the same time, it isn't.\n\nUnlike the "Grand Theft Auto"s or the "Saints Row"s, "Mafia 2" has a strong focus on storytelling: you play as a WW2 veteran who comes back to his home in Empire Bay, and starts his journey inside the italian mob, trying to reach the top. The story is brilliantly written, and strongly resembles movies like "The Godfather" and "Goodfellas" in the best way possible.\n\nAt the beginning of each chapter, you wake up, answer the telephone, get dressed, and go where you have to go. So, the only moment when you are free is when you've left the house, before going where you have to go. However, there isn't that much to do in the city. There were going to be side missions, but they were left out to focus more on the story, and it shows. You can drink at bars, buy guns and clothes or go on a mindless rampage where you rob every store.\n\nThe songs on the radio are all great (but that's cause I like this era) and the gunplay feels really good, with pistols, rifles, shotguns, grenades, molotovs but no melee weapons.\n\nOverall, this is a great game for storytelling and atmosphere, but it lacks in the sandbox department.

I played the first Mafia game even before i played any GTA game and probably is my first open world game. I had Mafia 2 for the GFWL but for some reason it used to crash :(\nHowever, I bought it later on and wondered if this is as good as the first one and I got my answer---NO,It's Better!\n\nCategories         Details                Story        The game is set during the late 40s and early 50s.You play as Vito Scaletta a young and ambitious man who was born to a poor family in Sicily,Italy and later moves to Empire Bay(the game's version of New York).Vito and his best chump Joe carry out petty crimes in the streets of Empire Bay until a theft gone wrong results in Vito getting arrested. Vito is later offered to fight for US army during World War II and later is discharged with Joe's help.On learning that Vito's father died with a debt of 2000$,he turns to Joe for help and together they get back to their crime life,joining the Mafia and what ensues is a life of violence,greed,betrayal and tragedy.\nThe story of Mafia is very well told.You   easily become engaged in the game's cinematic Hollywood movie like experience with strong, believable characters in a living, breathing city.There is not a single dull moment in the entire game with some very well done voice acting by everyone in the story that make the story so much more interesting.Some lines are delivered really very well.The character of Joe is really funny and hilarious.\n\nHenry Tomasino: If I don't make it...\nJoe Barbaro: Hey, hey, don't go saying that, pal. It's just a scratch. The doc will give you a few stitches and then we'll all go out and celebrate.\nHenry Tomasino: No, really...\nJoe Barbaro: Shhh... you shouldn't talk right now. Helps conserve your strength. I saw that in a movie once.\nHenry Tomasino: Yeah? And what happened to the guy in the movie?\nJoe Barbaro: He died.\n\nThe story has makes you laugh,it makes you sad and keeps you at the edge of the seat.The best thing is that the game keeps the story good till the end,which a lot of games can't by messing up the ending.Although the ending was really sad :(.\n\nThe characters,as i mentioned are believable,very well done and memorable. You actually feel and care for the characters be it the protagonist joining the mafia due to compulsion(very much in line with Tommy Angelo's quote in the first game-"I became a criminal because i did not want to become a victim") or anybody else.Mafia 2's story is definitely good and one of the best stories told in a videogame.\n\nSCORE	- 9/10\nGameplay        Mafia 2 is an open world game set in the fictional city of Empire Bay.It's gameplay ranges from driving to melee fight to gun fights.\nThe city itself is very well rendered to look like the New York of 1940s and 50s.The city is divided into many sections(Little Italy,China-Town,Dock,Hillside,etc).Each section of the city feels different, China-town feels different than Little Italy.A lot of attention has been given to details in the game which makes the environment really nice. At first the game begins during a cold winter and most of the city is whitish but later on after the weather becomes better and you can see the actual beauty of the environment.It's always a delight to drive through the streets of Empire Bay.It's  different from GTA, and that in my opinion is a good thing.You will find food stores,bars,clothes shop,car mechanics but unlike GTA there will be no salon,strip clubs,night clubs,gyms(I mean they are there but you can't access them unless the main mission has you do it),but still it's good.\nSince the game is set in the old times,you won't find modern sports cars in it. the cars feel like real cars would from the 40s that is spongey suspension and sluggish acceleration, this is not bad design, it's how the actual cars behaved back then(as i told you attention has been given to details).Driving at times might get challenging due to a few factors such as the car skids when there is winter as the roads are icy and even during rainfall.Moreover if the cops see you stealing a car or entering a car when they are on your tail losing them off won't be helpful as the cops keep a note of your car's license number which you will have to change at a car mechanics's,and trust me getting away from cops in this game isn't that easy,Although at first it may seem tough but these challenges add to the game's fun.Moreover listening to real 40s and 5os music in your car radio adds to the atmosphere.\nThe game has you do a lot of stuffs such as do robberies,steal cars,chasing and tailing,shooting a person or taking down a group of your foes. Gun play is a lot of fun here consisting of a variety of guns(1911 semi automatic,Magnum,Tommy gun,Thompson,etc) and also Moltovs and Grenades.However, the pistols seem to have the same power and the grenades  and moltovs do not have a wide range,but it's still a delight to pop a bullet in somebody's head.The shooting and cover system has been done well in this game unlike some games like Just Cause(but who needs shooting in that game when you can just blow things up!).Other likeable details about the shooting is that you can pick up ammo as you walk over them and reload your gun while running and also shoot while running or walking,a feature not available in many games.If cops see you shooting at someone(or do any stuff you should not do)then you need to change your dress to get them off  your tail.The side missions are a little monotonous and people have criticised it for having too much driving that was not a problem for me as i love driving.There are collectables to be found in the game such as wanted posters and Playboy magazines(with actual pictures of nude and semi-nude models,so be sure to collect them when nobody who would take offence is around!).\n\nSCORE	- 8/10\nGraphics        Mafia 2 has got a really good graphics quality and the game really looks good.The shadow quality and the lightings just add to the environment of this game.The water effects are pretty too.As told before the city has been redered well and the overall atmosphere in Mafia 2 is really good.The places,music,street signs,cars,buildings and ideas of that time are authentic and add to the atmosphere.\n\nSCORE	- 9/10\nOverall Mafia 2 is a really good and enjoyable game which I recommend everyone who is a lover of action/adventure game to play.And if you are a fan of games set during the 40s era and mobster/mafia films(like Godfather) then this is a must have! True it's not available on the steam store anymore but you can try getting retail keys online.I do not own the DLC content 'Joe's Adventure' (which lets you play as Joe and adds around 8 hours into the gameplay) but iI am trying to.Meanwhile I am awaiting the third installment to this amazing franchise.\n\nOVERALL SCORE	- 8.7/10","April 11","true","30.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","13","20","2","2"

Let it also be known that there is no animation for walking up and down stairs, something you spend a surprising amount of time doing. However, to make up for it, the game possesses beautiful fabric physics that can be experienced simply by buying a coat. NVidia card owners with PhysX will appreciate 2K's efforts.\n\nSound: Perfect voice acting, realistic cars and gunfire, more songs from the era in the radio stations than in Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas combined, and a stunning orchestral score with a single haunting melody that will visit you both in the game's menu and the game's stunning (albeit mysterious) ending.\n\nGameplay: Aside from lockpicking and some other interludes, nothing sets the gameplay apart from GTA in terms of driving and a third-person shooter. The game does include a speed limiter on the cars, which locks your highest possible speed at the speed limit, since the cops in this game are actually smart (in a sense) and come after you for speeding. You can also customize any car you procure, including changing the plates.\n\nLasting Appeal: The vintage Playboy pinups the game uses as collectables add much to the playtime, but the game has no real freeroam. It can be modded in, as the glorious PC Master Race allows, but it does not come available out of the box.","November 3, 2014","true","13.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freshVeggie/recommended/50130/","freshVeggie","freshVeggie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freshVeggie/","705 products in account","Just a couple days ago I finally got around starting Mafia II which has been sitting in my backlog for a while now. Oh boy am I glad I did. It grabbed me from the start so that after only few days I have finished the campaign.\n\nIt's probably easy to compare this to Grand Theft Auto but both games are actually very different. In Mafia II there really is not much else besides the campaign. There are no side missions to speak of or even other forms of entertainment we are used to have in open-world games, races, mini-games etc. It does read as a disadvantage but in reality it is a big positive. The campaign is greatly paced and you always know what to do next. Wasting time with menial and most often unfun side occupations would hurt that pacing only and not add anything meaningful to the experience. What matters most is that I never felt the need that the game should have anything besides the campaign. The absent of a character leveling or mindless XP pop-ups is refreshing and fits great with the focused style of the game. Less is more here.\nIn terms of side activities you can count the collectibles probably. There are three. Playboy Magazines, Wanted Posters and Pinup Posters. Later is locked behind the Hard difficulty setting. The Wanted Posters are scrambled across the world and are a pain to collect. Collecting the Playboy Magazines is the easiest since they usually are strategically placed in the vicinity of campaign missions. These each unlock a single high resolution photo of an original playboy playmate of that period. Suffice to say it's NSFW (breasts). They appear only during certain missions and disappear later. Thankfully the devs did not opt to the stupid industry standard of making collectibles glow.\n\nThe world is done great. It's fairly big with distinct areas and aesthetics. Driving mechanics thankfully are great as well but you have to keep in mind that unlike GTA, most normal cars feel too slow and heavy. Once you get your hands on a sports-car, you will drive nothing but those.\nBesides driving there is a focus on combat and I'm glad to say that shooting feels great. There is a nice cover mechanic and it just feels good to run into a firefight and slide seamlessly into cover. Enemy bullets do take away health-points very quick so you will have to use cover constantly. One thing I have to stress is the very great use of physics in combat. Glass shatters, wooden cover breaks apart nicely and even concrete walls break around the edges. It not only serves as beautiful eye candy but also adds a new mechanic and tactic to keep in mind during combat.\nThese two things, driving and shooting will be done plentiful and no matter how fun they are on their own, they would still become a chore if the story behind it faltered. It does not. On the contrary, the story is greatly written with great, believable characters. As someone who watched most popular gangster movies I was expecting many cliche events and lines to appear but to my surprise many events and turns I did not see coming. Without spoiling too much, you will be seeing the protagonist's rise in the mafia. The ending came abrupt. I was actually believing the story would continue but it  just stopped. So think, not playing throughout the whole life of a gangster but a slice of it. An early slice at that. It mostly revolves around you, Vito Scaletta and your best friend Joe Barbaro and how you both become gangsters in the mafia. Maybe it's the cliche I am used to from movies and games but I was positively surprised at Joe not being a boring and bland character.\nSince there really is only the campaign to play, voice acting is important and for the most part it is really great. Leo's VO was exceptionally good. One voice stood out in a comical way. Vito's sister Francesca was bad. Really bad. The VO forced an usual high-pitched sound with her. No clue how that got OK'd.\nThe atmosphere of the 40s/50s America is hit nicely with old cars and music. Later comes from three radio stations. I'm not personally fond of the period's aesthetics and music but there are some catchy songs I'll listen to on Youtube for sure. The cars are an acquired taste. I don't find them appealing mostly but there's not much freedom with historic accuracy. Visually the game looks great. The city is greatly detailed with buildings and districts looking unique and fitting. Cars look great and the motion blur when driving fast is used to great effect. I also noticed that grass looks surprisingly good. Keeping in mind this is a ps360 era game, yes there are low-res textures and models but they mainly become only noticeable during close-up cutscenes.\n\nNot all is perfect though. As I mentioned briefly, the campaign feels like there is something missing at the end. It ends faster than I'd imagined Vito's story to be. Not being able to roam the city freely after the ending only adds salt to the wound.\nAs said, the world is big with many places and buildings that stand out. Weirdly enough, most of these places went totally unused without any missions taking place there (dam, skyscrapers, water). Maybe it was planned initially but it got cut.\nI think they also missed an opportunity with Vito's family. Her sister never gets much of a focus. A shame as it would have made for some nice arc to see her get polluted by her brother's money and power maybe.\nI experienced some crashes which I could not solve but thankfully never lost too much progress. Some cutscenes are also pre-rendered movies with very low bitrates that really hurt their qualities. I have no idea why they didn't just make them run in-game in real-time (like other cutscenes), especially since the assets and everything basically in them are of in-game quality. Weird.\n\nAll in all though, I have to say I enjoyed my time with Mafia II immensely. The story, characters, atmosphere, combat all top-notch. It's a better game than GTAIV for sure even if it does not offer a similarly detailed world with many side activities but maybe because it is a very focused game that uses the open-world not only as a selling point but only as instrument for the campaign. I like this method better than GTAIV's bloated unfocused hodgepodge of menialities. Not even gonna compare story, writing and characters of the unbearable mess that GTAIV is with the greatness of Mafia II.\nMafia II is a great game and everyone should give it a try. It blew me away and will do for at least some others as well for sure. Now I am more interested in Mafia III than before. Hopefully they manage to bring over the strengths of Mafia II.","February 27","true","15.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

(make of this what you want, is it a drawback? yes and no, but the story doesnt really need the free ride option)\nThe radio stations got it right too, the music fits well with the game, and the commercials are just great (and accurate too, as they were like that in those days)\nOnto driving, with keyboard is ok, can handle just fine, but a controler will be better (yes the game supports controlers) anyway, driving is fun.\nThe city itself has a good layout, it feels like a city, it has landmarks you can navigate by when free riding and it feels alive, weather changes too.\nI do recommend the dlc too, eventho that is more gta style.\nBoth dlc have decent storylines, and 1 does adds to the main story of the game itself in a small way, as they take place in the same time era (joe's adventures)\nThe rest of the dlc only adds a few cars and such, but no story lines or missions, still good fun to get when on sale tho ;)\nTo me, the replay value has been great, sure you know what is coming, but like any good movie, do you only watch it once? i dont, if the movie is good, i can enjoy it time and time again, just like this game.\n\nIn conclusion, eventho i feel this game is worth full price, i would buy it when its on sale, simply because of the dlc that will be on sale as well then, so getting the entire pack will be more affordable then.\n\nWell, thats my 2 cents on this game, hope you'll enjoy it as much as i do :D","March 5, 2015","true","385.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Which is not necessarily a good thing, mind you, but most certainly something different from the usual. Even after completing the game you are not allowed to just freely wander around, unless you install a mod, but it has an open-world map none the less. Which has just about as much as nothing to explore, but still an open world! The game is apparently set in 40-50's, but if not for the cars and the music I would honestly just never know, because the city looks so oddly modern and there's not a lot of the atmosphere from that era in the game.\n\nStill, though, you don't even have to explore the city, because you are mailny there for the story and story missions, which are, in my opinion, quite good. There's something quite satisfying about going to a shop, dressing into the best suit and coat with a fedora you could afford, grabbing your Thompson and driving to shoot some gangsters. It's good to play it in small bits, like two chapters at a time, like you would read a book.\n\nIt's basically a game about a young man climbing in the hierarchy of a mafia family and learning that being a "Made Man" is a lot different from how he pictured it in his dreams. Also, remove any comparison of this game to GTA from your head right now, because you can compare them only in a way that there are cars and guns. That's it.\n\nIf you like GTA or Just Cause-like freedom then forget about it. And don't get this game for a full price, either. But if you're interested more in a story than ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around then that's the one for you.","August 22, 2015","true","13.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uskro/recommended/50130/","uskro","uskro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uskro/","418 products in account","If you are a gamer that enjoys proper storytelling and great stories and character backgrounds and development, then this is the game for you. If you enjoy running over hookers and roaming around, you might not enjoy this as much. I first played the pirated version right when it came out, and it is the only game that I have ever played in one sitting, not leaving the computer until I saw the end credits. I also recommend playing the original before this one as you'll miss out on some things.\n\nStory: 9.5/10 :: Visual design: 9/10 Gameplay: 8/10 :: Difficulty: 4/10 :: Recommandation: Buy\n\n:: STORY ::\nAs a big Mafia franchise fan, I might be a bit biased. However, I find the stories of both first and second game to be compelling and maybe, just maybe, two of the best stories in gaming history. I will not bother to compare the stories in the two games. It's pointless to me, as I did not except a remake of the original, so the fact that the second game's story was different and even intertwining with the first game's story was more than enough.\n\nUnlike the first game, the focus of the story is around only two characters Vito and Joe, and their quest to becoming financially successful by unlawful or questionable methods. The relationship and chemistry between the two characters is what matters, and the fact that, no matter what difficulties you may encounter along your paths, you two will have each other's backs.\n\nThe side characters are also interesting, and the one who I found most interesting was Henry, one of the made men who you end up working for and working with, who later turns out to be an informant for the FBI. This is one of the characters that deserved a DLC along Joe and I hope we'll be seeing him in future games.\n\nI have seen and read many complaints regarding the ending. However, I do not feel the same way. The uncertainty of the ending seemed justified and much more bleak than the one in the first game, where it shows you how the events will turn out. Not only does it leave room for your imagination to kick in and choose your own ending, but it also leaves room for future installments to link to events that are still unclear.  I am referring here, obviously, to the fact that, you do not know if Vito did something to save Joe or not.\n\nThe story can keep you playing just by itself, and without a doubt it will keep me coming back to replay the game, just like I did and still do so very often with the original.\n\n:: VISUAL DESIGN ::\nThe location where the game takes place is visually impressive and diverse. It captures the feel of the era with great fidelity, and the grim, sad aspect of the city in full winter is a vivid representation of the World War II period in the states. Unlike the first game, the entire city is open for exploring since the first minute you gain control and a set of lockpicks.\n\nThe character designs are very well put together, with few exceptions. However, you can tell the difference between main or recurring characters and episodic ones. The recurring cast has much more effort put in detailing their appearance, expressions and eye movements.\n\nVehicle design is, just like in the first game, a strong point. It's not your regular open-world driving simulator. The cars have responsiveness according to the era and the state of the car, not to mention, just like the first game, progressing the story and in time gives you access to newer and better cars, with a wide variety to choose from.\n\n:: GAMEPLAY ::\nI would like to praise this game in terms of gameplay, however there are aspects of it that clearly bugged the hell out of me.\n\nCar NPCs are one big steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥. I have no idea where they learned how to drive. Their collision detection is way off. If you steer to avoid them, they will just steer towards you. If they notice you in the way, they accelerate. If they come in an intersection, without traffic lights, they won't give right of way. If you stop to avoid them and they stop as well (usually in corners), they'll start driving right away. If they change lanes, they won't check if somebody is coming on the other lane, they'll just change it right in you.\n\nPolice NPCs are again a big issue. Cars bumping into me, I get fined. Police cars bumping into me. I get fined. Level 4 police chase? Easy as pie to escape.\n\nThe pros of the gameplay are the variety of activities you can do in game to get immersed in the universe. Buy clothes (tho' very limited options), get drinks, get food, go to car shops, gun shops, get gas for your car (if you'll go for achievements, you'll need it), upgrade your rides. For a 6 year old game, these are very good features. I hope that fore the future we'll get more of these "little" aspects.\n\nAlso, for the future, I'd like to see more immersion in the city itself. Like more starter missions (to not be confused with side missions, I don't want Mafia to become GTA), where you have to walk or use public transportation (taxis, buses, trams, trains), and not just jump straight to a car. Also, progressing in a game through different area missions (low-end missions in bad neighbourhoods, medium-level missions in downtown or residential areas, top level missions to send you to the luxury areas), gradually, giving you a chance to truly learn the streets and the areas, territories and landmarks. As a game that focuses a lot on the driving, I kinda felt annoyed that I constantly needed to use and pay attention to the radar to see where I was going, and not enough attention to the visually impressive environment.\n\n:: DIFFICULTY ::\nWhen it comes to difficulty, I couldn't call this game difficult. Even on the "hard" difficulty setting, the game is more than accessible. As there are 2 achievements that get unlocked by finishing the game in the hard difficulty, I recommend you go straight to that. This is not a difficult game to play and finish.\n\n:: ACHIEVEMENTS ::\nMost of the game's achievements (excluding DLC) are story related. You can get them in one go if you pay attention. Then agains, there's the pain in the ♥♥♥ achievement which requires collecting the 159 wanted posters around the city. The top side is, you get to actually explore the city. The downside? 159 posters and a few hours of gameplay just to get one achievement. Splitting this in 4-5 different achievements would've made this achievement much more... digestable. All the other 48 achievements (excluding DLC) are easy to get even in Hard difficulty.\n\n:: CONCLUSION ::\nIf you decide to skip on this franchise, you're missing out. This isn't a Godfather replica, although it does have easter eggs and influences from the genre. That said, this isn't necessarily a game for mobster enthusiasts. This isn't a GTA replica. I dislike seeing people complaining about the lack of "open-ness" in this open-world game. You have plenty of opportunities to free roam. It's just not in the style of GTA. This game's focus is more on the story than on the open-world. That being said, I strongly recommend buying this game if you enjoy good story-telling and movie-like presentation with plenty of cutscenes and plenty of gameplay and also replayability value. Worth the full price, but it's a rather old game so you should get it on sale or discount.","July 30, 2014","true","75.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","3"

You can't forget the view of this city. Empire Bay is a fictional city on the East Coast of the United States of America, based on a combination of New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Detroit with elements from other US cities during the '40s and '50s, that serves as the setting for Mafia II. It features a completely open-ended map of about 4 square miles. The city also features sights based on famous landmarks such as the Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire State Building. And that's only the city! Well there's a lot to tell about main character- Vito Scaletta. Vito is the strong, smart, silent type, the opposite of his best friend Joe, who is much more flamboyant and loud. This quality is admired by his many bosses. He has seemingly strong morals, and doesn't kill because he wants to, but because he knows he has to. Vito doesn't aspire to be the Don, he just wants a bit of money and a bit of respect so that he can help his family out. Vito seems to really care about those who have helped him out but when he is released from prison, he seems to get colder. For Corporal Scaletta's bravery and participation in Operation: Husky - he recieved the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC for short) and for being injured in the service of the United States Military - he received the Purple Heart. One of the medals was handed over by General Patton himself. Although it is never mentioned, he received the World War II Victory Medal which all U.S. combatants of the war received following the victory, as well as the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal which was awarded to all U.S. combatants in the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign of World War II.\nWell, you'll ask me: About what is this game? Well, the storyline for Mafia II is a gritty drama and chronicles the rise of Vito Scaletta, the son of Sicilian immigrants. As the game progresses, Vito joins the Falcone crime family and becomes "a made man" along with his best friend Joe Barbaro. What happens next? Buy this game and find out!\nTo be honest, I don't know why this game is so under-rated. It deserves 10/10 and I'm give that 10. Mafia II is a must-have.","March 8, 2014","true","21.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Every other aspect of this game is perfect. The car sounds are amazing, the car designs were the best I've seen, and the story, characters and plotline all felt real. It intrigued me until the end. The one complaint I have of this game is the lack of free mode with just the game itself. I later bought the DLC (Joe's Adventures and Jimmy Vendetta) because I wanted to have free roam, so I could use the cars, and just screw around. Luckily, the DLC was on sale. If you're gonna get this game, and you want to also feel the free roam, sandbox part of the game, I suggest at least getting Jimmy's Vendetta.\n\nOverall, 9.5/10.","November 8, 2014","true","40.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game reminds me of Godfather's Movie plot at the beginning of the game, family migrated to America, Sicily and War.

Mafia II turned out to not be the kind of game I was expecting it to be, I was expecting something like GTA and Saints Row but set in the 40's/50's. Turns out I was wrong, Mafia II took a different approach on the "open world genre" by not having side quests or side activities per say, you could drive around the city but there was only one mission at a time which followed the storyline and I have to say I find that to be more appealing than what I thought. The driving on the game felt pretty solid but still challenging along with the company of a great soundtrack that really made me feel like I was alive back at that time. The shooting is pretty competent, not very inovative offering the usual cover system from a 3rd person shooting game. I found out the story to not be really great during the first ours but after reaching a certain point I saw how each character started changing as the story unfolded and that really kept me interested on how things would end up, ending up changing my initial opinion about the story in the end. The ending was not really what I was expecting though but I respect the developers decision to make it this way and I think it adds a certain "touch" to each player final feelings about the game. In the end Mafia II ended up being an amazing experience for me, I really really liked it and I highly encourage any fans of games like Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto to give this one a try, being set on a different timeline than most games in the genre it really makes itself unique.

The takes place in the fictional city of Empire Bay, inspired by the look of major U.S cities like New York and Chicago during the 50's, including some of the major landmarks from the real world and combining them with a unique map design that makes Empire Bay feel like a real place in space and time. The map here is enormous and with that comes the main problem while you're out exploring it as it feels empty for most parts, and to be honest during the story there are lots of well-made locations that you'll probably never visit unless you're just into exploring without actually doing missions or challenges. The lack of side missions or challenges is clearly felt in this one, and that has nothing to do with the story being organized in chapters whatsoever, but it feels disappointing that even after you're done with the amazing story there is nothing else to keep you roaming on the streets of Empire Bay. On the brighter side, this is probably one of the best stories you've seen in years, and 2K does a great job introducing you into the world controlled by the Mafia in the late 40's all up to the 50's. Everything about the atmosphere of that time period seems right and this is one of those stories that will probably remain in your mind for a very long time. You play as Vito Scaletta, a veteran finding himself back into Empire Bay after suffering an injury during the war and being sent back home for a while, time which extends permanently once he gets in touch with some old friends. The menus are easy to browse and the loading screens will get by you pretty fast; in addition to that you can view all your collectibles in the game from the main menu. The characters are well-made and have personality in every single aspect, although having the ability to change certain decisions would've been nice, adding to the replay value, but the story is awesome enough to be worth your time as it is.\nRating: 7.5\n\nGameplay\nThere's not a lot of diversity in gameplay here as you'll probably spend most of your time in cover, trying to aim a headshot towards an enemy who is also hiding in cover or getting him while he's advancing for another place of cover. There is nothing wrong with that as the game is fun to play and the controls work well in that environment, but don't expect to rush into a group of enemies without strategy and succeed, because it probably won't happen. There are a few moments in the story where the basic cover shoot-out will be replaced by activities like lockpicking cars, throwing molotovs and so on, but those are few and easy to forget. On the bright side, the range of weapons that you have at your disposal and new ones that will constantly keep showing up as you advance the story forward will keep making things more interesting, starting from basic things like pistols and later moving on to epic mafia weaponry such as the Tommy Gun. Even with the shooting mechanic as basic as it is, the environment in which it takes place changes the strategy every time, as lesser cover spots will require you to stay longer in one place and snipe out everyone in your range, while plenty of cover will give you the opportunity to move more freely and surprise your enemies from behind. Driving around the town is fun and there are plenty of cars to try out and upgrade to make your collection bigger, but unfortunately those services are only meant to provide a few minutes of extra fun after you've completed the main story as you'll probably ignore those features at all the first time you play through the campaign since you will be too preoccupied following the story, and since there are no additional missions apart from those following the main plot, there is little reason to take a break from the story. The thing that will keep you going in this game is the motivation to see how the story unfolds, and even if there's nothing much else to do after completing the story, robbing stores, evading cops and challenging achievements will keep you going for a while.\nRating: 8\n\nGraphics\nThe landscape of Empire Bay looks amazing, leaving you drooling over the beautifully detailed buildings and admiring just how authentic everything looks, despite areas being so empty due to the lack of side missions or challenges. There is detail to everything you'll find in the city: the cars look as they did in the 50's, the city features old landmarks like The Brooklyn Bridge or The Empire State Building combined with other digitally created locations that make the city feel alive. The main characters certainly look like they're out of the 50's and the one thing this games does best is to keep you attached to them. Throughout your playthrough you'll encounter lots of different characters from different families in the Mafia, each one being unique and keeping you interested in their personal stories as well as their own part in the main story that the game wants to tell. Unfortunately this realism of characters will often be interrupted by bad facial animations and even worse lip syncing.\nRating: 8\n\nAudio\nThe voice acting is well done, having Italian accents specific to the time period and the birthplace of the characters, and combined with the amazing dialogue and the lines that never get old, including Mafia classics, the experience doesn't get any better than this. The soundtrack is amazing including hit tracks from the 50's divided into 3 radio stations that you can change whenever you want while in the car. The use of certain tracks during mission makes the sadness of someone getting shot feel authentic and make you experience what being a gangster really felt like. With very few exceptions, the sound effects are a blast for the ear and a pleasure to hear over and over again, especially those classic Tommy Gun shots that you're already familiar with from Mafia movies.\nRating: 9.5\n\nExtras\nThere are lots of collectibles in the game, some which you'll have to find across the city and others awarded for completing a mission on a certain difficulty level. If you're hunting for achievements or simply want to see all the playboys, this will keep you occupied for a while, however the lack of multiplayer or leaderboards for missions is felt, and after collecting everything it will take you a while to jump into the story all over again. The difficulty levels on the other side are well done and it's a good addition if you want to replay the story on a higher difficulty level.\nRating: 7.5\n\nVerdict\nThis is an amazing experience if you like killing people and Mafia related stuff; too bad the game does suffer from the lack of extra content to keep you engaged into the game even after completing the story. If you are looking for a brilliant story this is a must buy no doubt, and with the price being lowered since its release it's probably worth your bucks.\nRating Overall: 8.1\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Mafia II at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=328","April 9, 2015","true","78.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You play as a gangster in the 1940s-1950s and you feel like you are in the world. Everything about the cars, buildings, stores, and even the radio convinces you that you really are in that city. When you drive around and hear about the remote control being invented or see more powerful and modern cars as time progresses. The attention to detail is very nice with the speedometer being time correct, the radio tuning in on actual music from that era, and the cars being ♥♥♥♥ to handle and not going very fast. I have a HD 4000 and I can only run the game on the lowest settings but it still looks good enough to soak in the atmosphere\n\nThe story of the game revolves the typical mafia story of a guy who "started from the bottom" and grew his way up until he did something that made him realize that crime never plays. Its cliché but it’s a very good story here. The characters in this game feel real with you feel emotionally invested in your character hoping they make the choices you do.\n\nThe mechanics are OK with standard 3rd person shooter stuff. The game relies a lot on realism so you die faster. There is regenerating health but each time it recovers to a lower degree. There are stealth mechanics but you utilize them in maybe 2-3 missions depending on how you count them so they are kind of worthless. You get cool time period weapons with the classic Tommy being the weapon you rely on the most. You almost never have to buy any because you just pick them off the dead guys in missions with shooting. You have to use cover in the game and it feels fluid except when you want to go into covers along walls because Vito can’t figure out which wall (of a corner) to stick to.\n\nA MAJOR issue with the game is that the sandbox is a lie (sort of). There is a large map where you can go and explore but 1) there isn’t anything to do and 2) there is no free roam. Normally, in sandbox games, you explore the world until you choose to start a mission but here, the moment you wake up, you have a mission to do. You can (in certain levels) go out and explore but the problem is that there isn’t anything you can do with that exploration except soak in the atmosphere. There are no side activities and two guys you meet who can give you work never have work for you. You can rob stores but all that happens is that it gives you money. The missions are all linear and they have zones which limit you. Mostly you just drive through the city doing... nothing. There is a mission where you are wanted and you have to get home without being spotted and that is where the city comes alive. With you having to create your own path through a live city trying to avoid the cops. But most of the levels is simply go here, shoot this, go here, shoot this, and drive home, sleep, and repeat. Also, there isn’t a free play mode at the end so you can’t experience the city without the missions.\n\nThe story also seemed rushed at the end. There were a lot of betrayals and twists and at the end I was like, "that’s it?" It honestly left me disappointed because the story had been pretty god so far. Speaking of the story, it kind of renders the point of money useless. You use the money to buy clothes and... More clothes but halfway through, you lose all that and you start over... Kind of renders the point of money useless.\n\nIn other matters, the cars handle like ♥♥♥♥ but that’s probably on purpose. The police are more real meaning that you can hit something and not raise your wanted level if a cop doesn't see you but they are kind of stupid because you can rob a store, steal clothes from the store and walk out without them recognizing you. The character animation is good but they look really plasticy. The camera has trouble in narrow spaces and I only had one bug.\n\nOverall, it’s still a good game. Good mechanics and atmosphere but it lacks in execution and flutters out in the end. I still think it’s a good game but it could have been an amazing game.","November 3, 2014","true","13.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's not a perfect game by any means, but the action and story kept drawing me in.\n\nLet me tell you the negative things I thought of the game first.  You have a massive city to explore with tons of little shops and distractions to keep your interest for a while.  However, I will say that the inhabitants of the world don't feel very "alive" to me.  Normal citizens only have a few actions they can go through depending on your interaction with them.  It won't take long to get exhaust all the different scenarios that can play out with basic NPCs.  Also, as I mentioned earlier, there are a ton of little shops and restaurants to be found, but you will notice most of the shops all have the same items in stock with very little variety from store to store.\n\nThe combat in this game is pretty basic shooter stuff.  You can take cover, shoot, rinse and repeat.  It's fun, but it's not really anything innovative.  I did like with the cover system that you were able to attach your character to a wall/blockade/whatever and then peek around the edges to take the perfect shot.  Once again, not innovative, but I've only seen that type of cover system in a few games.\n\nThe story in my opinion is where the game truly shines.  I loved the story.  It was interesting with interesting characters.  There weren't any real major twists in the story, but I was never bored with how things played out.  The voice acting for nearly every character in the game is some of the best I've seen in a video game....EVER.   The actors portrayed each scene so brilliantly.\n\nSo should you buy this game and give it a shot?  I have to say yes, however, I think gamers who aren't a fan of sandbox or heist/criminal-type games can avoid this one as it didn't bring anything revolutionary to the table for the genre.  If you are a fan of this genre or of the first Mafia game, I highly suggest giving this game a shot.  Hopefully you'll enjoy it as much I did.","January 12, 2015","true","24.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The characters are well-made and have personality in every single aspect, although having the ability to change certain decisions would've been nice, adding to the replay value, but the story is awesome enough to be worth your time as it is.\nRating: 7.5\n\nGameplay\nThere's not a lot of diversity in gameplay here as you'll probably spend most of your time in cover, trying to aim a headshot towards an enemy who is also hiding in cover or getting him while he's advancing for another place of cover. There is nothing wrong with that as the game is fun to play and the controls work well in that environment, but don't expect to rush into a group of enemies without strategy and succeed, because it probably won't happen. There are a few moments in the story where the basic cover shoot-out will be replaced by activities like lockpicking cars, throwing molotovs and so on, but those are few and easy to forget. On the bright side, the range of weapons that you have at your disposal and new ones that will constantly keep showing up as you advance the story forward will keep making things more interesting, starting from basic things like pistols and later moving on to epic mafia weaponry such as the Tommy Gun. Even with the shooting mechanic as basic as it is, the environment in which it takes place changes the strategy every time, as lesser cover spots will require you to stay longer in one place and snipe out everyone in your range, while plenty of cover will give you the opportunity to move more freely and surprise your enemies from behind. Driving around the town is fun and there are plenty of cars to try out and upgrade to make your collection bigger, but unfortunately those services are only meant to provide a few minutes of extra fun after you've completed the main story as you'll probably ignore those features at all the first time you play through the campaign since you will be too preoccupied following the story, and since there are no additional missions apart from those following the main plot, there is little reason to take a break from the story. The thing that will keep you going in this game is the motivation to see how the story unfolds, and even if there's nothing much else to do after completing the story, robbing stores, evading cops and challenging achievements will keep you going for a while.\nRating: 8\n\nGraphics\nThe landscape of Empire Bay looks amazing, leaving you drooling over the beautifully detailed buildings and admiring just how authentic everything looks, despite areas being so empty due to the lack of side missions or challenges. There is detail to everything you'll find in the city: the cars look as they did in the 50's, the city features old landmarks like The Brooklyn Bridge or The Empire State Building combined with other digitally created locations that make the city feel alive. The main characters certainly look like they're out of the 50's and the one thing this games does best is to keep you attached to them. Throughout your playthrough you'll encounter lots of different characters from different families in the Mafia, each one being unique and keeping you interested in their personal stories as well as their own part in the main story that the game wants to tell. Unfortunately this realism of characters will often be interrupted by bad facial animations and even worse lip syncing.\nRating: 8\n\nAudio\nThe voice acting is well done, having Italian accents specific to the time period and the birthplace of the characters, and combined with the amazing dialogue and the lines that never get old, including Mafia classics, the experience doesn't get any better than this. The soundtrack is amazing including hit tracks from the 50's divided into 3 radio stations that you can change whenever you want while in the car. The use of certain tracks during mission makes the sadness of someone getting shot feel authentic and make you experience what being a gangster really felt like. With very few exceptions, the sound effects are a blast for the ear and a pleasure to hear over and over again, especially those classic Tommy Gun shots that you're already familiar with from Mafia movies.\nRating: 9.5\n\nExtras\nThere are lots of collectibles in the game, some which you'll have to find across the city and others awarded for completing a mission on a certain difficulty level. If you're hunting for achievements or simply want to see all the playboys, this will keep you occupied for a while, however the lack of multiplayer or leaderboards for missions is felt, and after collecting everything it will take you a while to jump into the story all over again. The difficulty levels on the other side are well done and it's a good addition if you want to replay the story on a higher difficulty level.\nRating: 7.5\n\nVerdict\nThis is an amazing experience if you like killing people and Mafia related stuff; too bad the game does suffer from the lack of extra content to keep you engaged into the game even after completing the story. If you are looking for a brilliant story this is a must buy no doubt, and with the price being lowered since its release it's probably worth your bucks.\nRating Overall: 8.1\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Mafia II at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=328","April 9, 2015","true","78.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maddyline/recommended/50130/","Maddyline","Combined Syndicates of America","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maddyline/","112 products in account","So before I get into this, it should be noted that Mafia II is no longer available on the Steam Store as I write this, if you already own the game you can install and play it, but if you don't, you're going to have to wait for a bit, it should be noted that Mafia II just turned 5 the day of its takedown, because the game uses licensed music tracks in the in-game radio stations, it's possible that the digital takedown is a direct result of this.\n\nButtttt to the review of the game, starting with the backstory:\n\nMafia II is a Third-Person shooter where the player takes control of Vito Scalleta, an Italian-American who immigrated to Empire Bay, United States from Sicily, Kingdom of Italy in 1931, Vito being born in 1925, Vito's family is thrown into debt and economic difficulty, the great depression hitting them hard, eventually Vito and childhood friend Joe Barbaro form a close relationship in their teenage years, Vito's father drowns in the docks he works at so Joe and Vito have to turn to a life of crime to make ends meet.\n\nAfter Vito is arrested for attempted robbery in 1943, he is given two choices: Jail, or fight for the US army in Operation Husky, the allied invasion of Sicily, Vito being fluent in Italian and Sicilian as well as English. It is here when the player takes control of Vito, as he and his band of US marines help liberate a smal Sicilian town, San Celeste, from Fascist Blackshirts loyal to Benito Mussolini, Vito is eventually injured later during the war and is temporarily discharged after being healed up, but is due to return to the front in a few months, after meeting up with his family, and finding out his younger sister still has to pay back debts of their father, Vito also meets up with Joe, who finds a way to get Vito fake papers to get him out of service. Vito, wanting to pay back his father's debt, decides that honest labor won't cut it, so he turns to the Mafia families in Empire Bay to get him enough cash to pay his late father's debt.\n\nThe game is great, a great plot with great characters, voice actors, music selection, and dialogue, Mafia 2, even if it can be beaten quickly, provides for hours of content and excellent gameplay, however, there are some things you should know about it:\n\nThis game, while being an open world game, doesn't have a "free roam" mode (however there are mods that add this), and the game doesn't function like GTAV or Red Dead Redemption, where the game is in Free Roam all the time an you travel to missions in the world, this game functions more like L.A. Noire (another excellent title) where missions are the only way to access the world, as there isn't a free-roam mode. The game is still excellent regardless of the free-roam, and it's able to provide an excellent story with plot twists, betrayals, and surprise plot developments, Mafia 2 is an excellent purchase and once it is available on the Steam Store again, if you haven't gotten if already, you certainly should.\n\n\nAlso the game runs great but I'm too lazy to include a section about that.","September 5, 2015","true","49.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The sequel to the original Mafia, taking place in the classic NYC. There's a lot to say about this game.\n\n+This game has an AMAZING ♥♥♥♥ing story, even though its linear. It's very in-character with the mafia theme. The writing is great and you'll find yourself wanting to move on to every next chapter to see what happens next.\n+The characters are very developed and memorable. Vito, Joe, Marty, and Leo will especially never escape my mind when I return to think of this game.\n+The dialogues are very realistic, entertaining, and well-written. Wheras most games have this nonsense where only one person is ever audible at one time, you'll be having conversations while some guy is screaming in the background or a drunk friend is singing random nonsense. It's just amazing.\n+The city is fairly big and great fun to explore, with no real loading screens, but there are some second-long transitions between larger buildings and the city.\n+The graphics are still great even for today's standards. The lights of the cars, the ground after the rain, the view in the distance in daylight. The character models are fantastically done.\n+The sounds are phenomenal. Every aspect of them. From the cars on the streets to inside of tunnel systems. From gunshots in a building to outside. They are realistically done and a pleasure to listen to.\n+The cards feel right. If I'm driving a truck, it's not as easy to control as a sports vehicle. If I'm driving a sports vehicle, I can hit amazing speeds. You can even upgrade and customize your car, keeping 10 vehicles of your choice in your garage to be accessed at any time.\n+The combat is great. This is a third person cover based shooter at its core. Cover works realistically and the guns play quite nicely, you even have a nice selection of guns to pick from.\n+The AI combat performs strategically in most situations and friendly AI are not useless in combat, they actually contribute, hell they could win for you on the easier difficulties.\n+-The radio stations are great and play classic songs from the eras of '45 and '51, however they seem quite limited. You'll be hearing the same era-based songs across the entire game on the same 3 radio stations.\n+-Due to the linearity of the game, you don't get to enjoy the open world of this game as much as you would in other games like Saints Row, but in my opinion that was a good thing for the way this game works, yet some may take it badly.\n-The AI do NOT know how to drive. They seem to just wish you didn't exist. The moment a light turns green you're being honked at. If you try to go straight, the jackass on the other end making a left turn suddenly thinks he has the right of way and will honk and scream at you. If you're cruising through a green light at high speeds, that jackass also doesn't think you exist, because he gladly swerves right into you, only to get out of his car and blame you for it. The AI drivers were easily the WORST part of this game and the largest irritant of it as well.\n-Pedestrians on the street would stand on walkways staring at your car refusing to let you get by, and even walk in front of it when you honk the horn at them when you're oncoming.\n-Most cars and pedestrians actually ignore your horn flat out. But they sure know how to use their horns on you.\n-The way the "law" in this game works is stupid. Speed? Get a ticket. Give a cop an accidental love tap? You're under arrest. Run a red light? Drive in the wrong lane? Do donuts in an intersection? Crash into another car? Cops don't give a ♥♥♥♥. BUT DON HELP YOU, oh boy..don help you if you run a red light in front of your mafia friends that kill and sell drugs for a living, they will annoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of you for what the cops don't care about.\n\nThis game has some kinks but honestly I don't think I'll ever play a better game with the Mafia theme unless Mafia 3 comes out. This game gets a 9/10 without a doubt. This is a game you can't afford to pass on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freedomark/recommended/50130/","freedomark","FreedoMark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freedomark/","284 products in account","Mafia II is the second part of series by 2K Czech so it is a Czech game. But it is not the only reason, why I am writing this recommendation. The story is very good and shows how can you become a criminal from a honest person. The environment during and after the Second World War is credible. The combat system is common and doesn't bring anything new. But the potential of the city Empire Bay could be exploited better. There are not many things to do, there are only a few unimportant shops. That's why the game doesn't motivate to play again. Despite of those problems I think that this game is quite funny and definitely worths playing.","January 18, 2014","true","15.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Graphically it's a beautiful game probably one of the best for its time and it runs great I only had one crash but that was caused by something else outside of the game to cause the game to crash, controsl are easy and gameplay was great the story is fun for the most part but towards the ending it started to feel rushed and then all of a sudden boom it was done. All in all the game was great but the ending was kinda lack luster, I do understand the ending but I don't really like the ending, it would probably make more sense if there was a connection to Mafia 3 but that doesn't look to be the case and now for whatever reason it is not avaiable to buy at this time.\nI'll give the game up to towards the ending a 8.5/10 but towards the ending it dropped to about a 5/10\nI do recommend it because I think I was just dissapointed in the ending where most people would love the ending.","October 29, 2015","true","25.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Bought it here just to support the devs and test the PC port (which holds up).\nShort review: Mafia II isn't a great example of an open-world game. Well it certainly feels like a believable city with diverse locations and different districts, and wonderful radio, and decent lore, there's barely anything to do. This is probably ought to all the cut content. There's nothing outside of the main story, just nothing sadly.\n\nThe reason this comes recommended is ought to the story. Christ, this is probably one of the better crime related stories in video games. While the plot is simple, the character interactions and voice acting in this game just sell it. We have believable goals, a friendship that has some incredible writing behind it, and the game gives characters enough time that we may feel some sort of emotional tie to them. That being said, it occasionally drops the ball, but it was mostly a well-written story.\n\nThe gunplay and driving tight, even if one is using a controller. The AI isn't particularly advanced, but the game steadily raises its challenge which keeps the gunplay engaging. The driving just has enough depth that there's some sort of skill involved.\n\nOverall, this is a game to play almost entirely for the story. Well the world is engaging while one is in the main story, don't expect much outside of it.","June 4","true","2.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unfortunately its no where near as good.  But fans of Mafia movies (who isn't) should enjoy the game and its often on sale for a good price.  Its a good 3rd person action shooter.\n\nPros:\n-Graphics are reasonable, albeit a bit aged.\n-Controls, movement, and aim all work well.\n-Will keep you occupied for 10-15 hours.\n-Car driving sim mode is actually fun; unfortunately it makes the game much too hard.  Car driving is much better than it ever was in GTA IV.\n-Cars are somewhat upgradeable and can be stored in your garage\n\nCons:\n-Story is kinda laughable, not very well done IMO.  The stories in other games are MUCH better.\n-Its not really an open world in the way that GTA IV is.  You can drive wherever you want but the story is actually VERY linear.\n-The cars can be very slow, although this is realistic for the time its not very fun.\n-The city is huge and there is no quick transport option, so you will spend a lot of time slowly driving around.\n-The police' AI is horrible.  If you hit someone (or they hit you) any nearby cops immediately want to fine you for a hit and run; even if you get straight out of the car.\n-Cut scenes always show you with a 1911 even if you have been using a Thompson for the last 20 minutes\n-The M1 Garand is very underpwoered.

The game really has a great tailored experience but in the end after all is said and done. I felt that it did not belong as a open world game. The open world aspect is very unexplored by the developers unless you buy DLC but as a stand alone game its there with little to no purpose. You see there is no side missions or anything that would involve requiring you to really go out of the linear path from Mission A to mission B. The game would have done better if it took a bit of extra time to flesh out the city with side missions like assassinations,racing, and other activities.\n","June 15, 2014","true","60.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RebeccaGabrieleTyrell/recommended/50130/","RebeccaGabrieleTyrell","Princess Rebecca Gabriele Tyrell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RebeccaGabrieleTyrell/","122 products in account","PLEASE NOTE: I was playing this game on a laptop with Intel Celeron Quad Core at 1.7ghz, and idk if it has a graphics card, though i believe it’s an intel HD one. Either way, my point is i was by no means on high graphics, and often i encountered lag. This does not affect the storyline, but it does affect the gameplay, so this review will be based MOSTLY on MY experience of the game. Please enjoy.\n\nIndeed not the most popular game ever, and it doesn't compare to games like GTA or COD. Mafia 2 will take you through a story, in the shoes of an Italian by the name of Vito Scaletta. Starting out as a teenager who commits mild crimes, you are captured and used in the army for the invasion of Sicily, as you speak the language. You are heavily outnumbered and outgunned, but you hold off the enemy force long enough before someone to come to your rescue. Having served your time in the army you come back to the streets in a hope to lead what you could call a life, but naturally, life bites back. His family are in debt, he needs to earn money for himself too, and due to the fact he doesn’t know what to do, he runs to his oldest mate, Joe, and starts a life of crime.\n\nI tried not to give too much away there for the purpose of spoilers, but in this review i endeavour to cover at least enough of the game to either make you hit purchase or cancel.\n\nSo, where do i start?\n\nStoryline:\nThis game has a brilliant story line, and it is one that you will really enjoy playing. The idea of playing as one person through his life is something rarely seen in games today, it's normally just a character that you decide to kill people as. There are highs and lows in Vito's Life, and some moments are quite emotional, but it is not the story line that makes the game, but it is indeed a good foundation. i do not want to give too much away, but if you are sensitive to spoilers, do not read any further than the end of this sentence, but skip to the next paragraph. The storyline is very powerful, and while i was playing it i could not help but feel for Vito, especially due to his bad childhood. He sets out as a very poorly educated man, the only thing he knows how to do is kill, and he needs a job. The story creates some nice side-missions, and you really feel the desperation and pressure that Vito is living in. He is naive, and stupid, and lunges at the first chance he gets to earn megga bucks. Morally 'right' and 'wrong' never came into it. 0It is definitely more fun to play the path that Vito took, than a more peaceful one, which will be why the designers did it, but at the same time it is very repetitive, and this is what annoys me. You start killing people in the army, then you do it for cash, then for the Mafia. Each shootout is very different, but in another way they are almost identical. Weapon choices are not very good, the most interesting come off the people you have killed. Gunfights are not as satisfying as i would like, and it is really annoying when you kill a load of enemies, and loads more randomly appear. The worst scene i found for that was the last one, before the end of the game. That leads me on nicely, the end of the game.....what a disappointment. When the game finishes there is not really much to do, due to the fact it was a story, when the story ends...it is over. There is no option to free-roam, but if you read on in the review i will tell you why that is probably a good thing. You can but a DLC named Jimmy's Vendetta, where you get to play as another guy, and it does offer more free roam Later i will talk about the DLC's, as i have them all, and the difference they really make to the game. If you enjoy just screeching tires and shooting, this will be a game that requires thought, as it offers both, but i believe it is too unbalanced.\n\nI rate the story 9/10 for its creativity and sheer emotional impact. I was quite sad when i'd finished it, but at the same time i was glad because it had taken so long and at times been quite boring.\n\nSounds:\n\nWell, there are a lot of these. Good voice acting does make this game very enjoyable to listen to, but maybe that was it, it should have been listened to. People do swear, especially in combat, which is nice really, because all Total War games have little speech at all, and no swearing. I was taken back really by the quality of sounds in this game, and they really add to the atmosphere of the scene, making it very enjoyable. I can't remember if there were things like birds and wind that you could hear, but nonetheless i think the sound is to a good quality. I also like the touch of the radios in the cars, and they play authentic (♥♥♥♥) songs. I only ever found about 2 that i liked. Dreeeeeeeem.......dreem dreeem dreeem.... that one was catchy. (Spelling dream was wrong on purpose for those that care, that is how it sounds in the song). Anyway, back on track. Main characters in the game all sound different, making it feel more real, as in some games like Total War, they all sound the same. The civilians have got a sense of humour, they ask you thinks like 'Are you a pedo?' etc. if you 'invade their personal space. I do not really know why, but i think they are funny.\n\nOverall, 8/10 for the sound, everything considered, the engines are a bit annoying over the radio.\n\nGraphics:\nAwesome. Blood sprays off people when they are shot or punched, and pools of blood lie on the floor next to them. Snow looks really realistic, as does grass. Really the graphics make the game what it was, even down to the cut scenes. There were parts that looked a bit cheap, but it was still believable, and that’s what you have to do to play Mafia 2, believe, because none of it is true. I cant think of a lot to say about the graphics, from dust to textures on houses, by my standards its all there.\n\nGameplay:\n\nWell, shooting it satisfying, though gets boring for the long extents of time you end up doing it. Mafia 2 includes 2 moves everywhere you go, there is a good/Peaceful move, or a bad/violent one. The whole game works around this basis, and though the choice is limited, it works well. O n a good, fast computer I find that shooting it all too easy, a bit too light, same with fist fighting, and rarely is the desperation there to kill the enemy and leave. It is always something you seem to enjoy, but get too much of, and because you enjoy it, it loses realism. You follow a story as I said before, and in the time between missions all you can really do is yet again…more shooting. You can steal cars, but getting the money to upgrade them is impossible unless you do the next mission, or scene in the story. It is annoying how things would go wrong all the time, and in some cases would never be put right. The gameplay is basic, and sometimes there is a long boring, and un necessary drive from one end of the map to the other. Despite a lot of time and care being put into the city, I don’t need to see it again and again every 5 seconds of my life. Most missions are very similar, and towards the end of your journey you just do the missions as a job, and you get to the point where you just want to see the next cut scene. In all fairness, that was the best part of the game, and I think with some good actors, it would have made a better movie.\n\nOverall I rate the game 7/10. The quality of it is generally good, but you really wish there was a fast forward button for all the wasted driving, and more to do in the free roam world. Vito never gets Hungry, so really you never NEED to eat, until you are injured. Personally I liked the game, a lot, but even with the DLC which provides a more ‘free roam’ experience, there is little to do, consequently I have no desire to play it again for a while. It’s like watching the same film 10 times in a row, it’s just BORING.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this review, or at least I hope it helped. Thanks for reading, and Bye for now ;D","April 15, 2015","true","78.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","13"

The story, whilst excellent is fairly short; I beat the game in about 10 hours at the hardest difficulty setting. If you don't enjoy cutscenes or slow moments, this game isn't for you. For example, the game has a section where you have to clean a toilet; you're forced to do this as an unskippable event which adds to the emersion but it's certainly not fun. The game also tries to be emmersive as there is a lack of fast travel which does get tiresome after some time, especially if you die in a crash and get sent back across the map.\nThe game tries to add in some realism as your car needs fueling after a while and if you crash too hard, you need to get out and repair it. You can only take about 3 bullets (on hard mode) so most of your time in combat will be spent waiting in cover for enemies to pop up at you. The combat is fun but it feels like whack-a-mole at times.\nThe checkpointing is what ruins the experience for me. One mission tasks you with going through a building to find one guy - the mission is about 20 minutes long and there are about 4 checkpoints with cheapshots everywhere and a cross map drive. This is probably my biggest gripe and lost this game a point /10.\nSoundtrack fits the time period well, songs are not to everybody's taste but will appeal if you're in to older music or jazz and blues.\n\nBuy it on sale - it's a good game but too short for £20. 8.5/10","June 5","true","11.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Characters are enjoyable and the story is solid. Sadly there is no free ride mode (It was in the first game and its basicly a free roam mode that you can explore the world without any mission icons that want to make you go to them.)\nI got the game for free but i have to say the money is worth it. The map is quite huge if you ask me because there are 2 versions of it Summer and Winter. When i said above for free ride mode there is a mod that fixes that. Anyways the game is quite realistic and i would actually prefer this instead of Grand Theft Auto IV (badly ported PC game) And the performance is quite smooth and playable.\nWhen i said the game is realistic if the police get a good look at you they will know who to get so you must change clothes or   car's licence plates at the customasation store (Yes you can customise cars and the customasation is quite around medium and high.) You can change rims, licence plate letters, repaint your car and make it faster.\n\nI'm quite sorry this one is long but it's impossible to say about the game in short.\n\n\n","November 26, 2013","true","15.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Now mafia 2 provides an awesome combination of combat, action and storyline, all of which a gamer would even become emotionally attached too. You are Vitro Scaletta an italian immigrant coming to the USA with the rest of your family in order to chase the American dream, until you find there is none. Mafia 2 fully emerses you as a gamer into the world of 1940-50s. If anything it reminds me of a combination between the Godfather, Goodfellas and Scarface, all of which are AAA titles.\n\nThe AI within this game are intelligent compared to other games, they know when to move and contain interactive features with the gamer. The driving mechanics are also one you'd hate so much you love it. It provides a feel of as to how cars behaved back then featuring heavy steering and long rev changes, for advanced users it also provides a simulation mode in which would take time to master, but for me... I'd prefer the normal driving. ;)\n\nThis game does not at all lack action, driving or a unfufilling storyline, to sum it all up in one sentence, one of my all time favorites.","April 5, 2014","true","10.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/50130/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Mafia II is an interesting game. While initially one would say it is a "GTA set in the era of mafioso" you immediately notice that this is a linear game. It is not necessarily an issue as the story told by the game is very good. It's just a shame that you are provided with a breathing, living city, yet, there's really nowhere to go as there are no side missions. You can always visit the shipyard or the junkyard if you are low on cash - selling cars is always a possibility. Other than that free roaming has really no point. So, completing the story in roughly 12 hours is nothing compared to the 30-40 hours offered by GTA or Saints Row or any game similar.\n\nProbably that is why the authors released some DLCs. One provides another perspective for Vito Scaletta's story while the other two follow the story of Jimmy. These DLCs offer extra missions and now we have an evaluation for each so that friends can compete with one another on various leaderboards. The only downside with these is that usually a mission is introduced by a text instead of a cutscene.\n\nMaffia 2 offers a great story here. You play a criminal and follow his journey climbing up in the criminal corporate ladder. Some missions are fierce and everything you liked Godfather for returns here: you have assassinations with Tommy guns, violent robberies, betrayal and of course what is most important always, the family. This is a great game and bundled with its DLCs it is of great value, especially at a discounted price.","March 21, 2014","true","26.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

As you can see, I had a great time while playing Mafia 2 for more than 100 hours. Some can argue about lack of content "forcing" you to play this game for such a long time, but Mafia 2 offers you as much playtime and enjoyment as you allow It to.\n\nMain story is based on well known cliche, but still engaging if you cut away a few nonsense and plot holes. What outshines most of the other aspects is Empire Bay - beautiful lively town and I've enjoyed discovering It's every corner and building.\nOnce you finish quite short main story, you can do some achievements with collectables or If you have DLCs, go ahead and play them! Joe's Adventures outshines the other DLCs in my opinion.\n\nI would say Mafia II is very good game and you should sure play it, especially if you're interested in this type of games.","July 15, 2014","true","128.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ukisash/recommended/50130/","ukisash","UkiSash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ukisash/","86 products in account","One of the best Games I have played in a long time. It has been a while since I last played this game however I did play it at least 3 times on the PS3 and about 40hrs on PC(with a terrible setup).\n\nThis game for me at least puts alot of pressure on GTA to perform. The physics of the game make me feel like im in the 1940s and 50s. The cars dynamics are superb and since the first MAFIA I have always thought they were far superior to GTA.\n\nThis game has done so much with a small team.\n- AWESOME Story. I felt worried for the two main characters, I wanted them to win at all times. With a game that focuses  mainly on its story to reel gamers in this one does NOT dissapoint. It gets an A in my book. Only reason why it isn't a A+ is just because its predictable. You can kind of tell whats going to happen next. Even so, it still manages to surprise you once in a while and deliver an experience that will keep you coming back for more and more.\n-The game physics are some of the best of any video game I have ever played. While its not need for speed status for vehicle or battle field for character controls and firefights, this game managed to get the feel just right. Since I started playing, to the point where started re-playing this game almost immediately is a pleasant experience going trough the game. The weapons feel good to weild and at no point was I ever bored or annoyed by the controls.\n- The city. With a huge map and so many roads to drive on I was a little dissapointed in this title, however not upset. The only quarral I had with it is that to me the first Mafia felt more real some how(perhaps because it was the first, perhaps its because thats when I fell in love with the title) All in all the city is rather dead, there aren't too many NPCs and when you do see them, they arent really that interesting to look at. They just go on their own business like you arent a homocidal crazed mafia hit man running around their city.\nOver all the game play is TONS of fun, the missions are quite entertaining, and the story it self makes you care for the main characters. Its deep, and rich with plot twists and ofcourse this is mafia so quite alot of brutality.\n\nFor me this game is definitely a MUST OWN. I found my self going back to replay missions at the hardest setting and trying out different things whenever possible. If you were ever doubtfull, stop, and pick this game up. At the time of this review its 30 bucks and a bunch more DLCs. I personally hate that we have to pay for DLCs, I believe games are already over priced but thats just me. You'll go trough the main story line and will definitely want more.","November 11, 2014","true","49.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The developers wanted to take a lot of time to make this game right. The original Mafia was one of my favorite games of all time. Top 10. Mafia II features excellent graphical fidelity, sound design (amazing contemporary music) Immersive voice acting and pretty damn good shooting and general gameplay.\n\nThink of it as a more serious Grand Theft Auto title, with a better story and more realistic gameplay. To be honest if you like Grand theft Auto, or a 3rd person open world this game is going to be a win for you. If you want to messa round with 30-60s cars and weapons, and enjoying a stroll through that time periods lively streets then Mafia II is going to be a win for you.

The lingering disappointment of other open world games being horrible abominations of their console brethren when ported to the PC is not something you have to worry about here. The PC version of Mafia II has just as much love as the other SKUs - great controls & optimal performance allow you to get immersed in the game, it's story and the characters. This isn't a "play a hundred side quests involving mundaine tasks" open world game so expect the open world aspect to be present primarily to compliment the story missions. Not to say there isn't replayability - just a package shed of unncessary excess to strengthen the story and progression in a good way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/telopots/recommended/50130/","telopots","telopots garg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/telopots/","404 products in account","Mafia 2 is a good game that could have been amazing.\n\nThere is a lot of good, a lot of inexplicably bad, and a lot of wasted potential.\nFirst, the story. It's decent, but there's rarely anything going on, and when there is, it's either near the end or doesn't last very long.\nA lot of events have no impact on the story whatsoever, and most characters are pretty bland, particularly the main protagonist, whose only personality trait is his complete lack of care for his actions, he just does whatever he's told until the final missions, and most of what he does before getting into the mafia is just busy work.\n\nBusy work you'll have the privilege to experience for yourself.\n\nThis leads me to my next point : the gameplay.\nFirst of all, the missions. Some of them are, as I said earlier, busy work. You drive a cigarettes truck for a bit, park it, give cigarettes to people, go somewhere else, and do it again. Sure, after that you'll get to shoot some greaseballs in the face for burning your truck down, but the first half of this mission is terrible, and stuff like that happens pretty often.\n\nAnother problem with mission design is that the game forces you to drive everywhere. And I mean everywhere. Drive to Carlo's, watch a cutscene, drive to get someone, and then drive to the mission zone. When the mission is done, drive back to your place. This is really annoying, despite the game's fantastic physics. Driving is fun, but being forced to drive accross the map quickly turns driving into a tedious task.\n\nCheckpoints are very scarce, but missions are short so this really isn't a problem, except in the DLC, where you have to start all over again (including the lenghty driving sessions) if you fail.\n\nDespite their lazy checkpoints, DLC missions actually fix a lot of the game's issues, and most of them involve you shooting bad guys. A lot of them. The car stealing missions in Jimmy's vendetta can get a bit boring at times, but it makes up for it by having a lot of shootouts, most of which are surprisingly well designed.\n\nNow, one of my favourite aspects of the game. The marvellous physics engine! It makes driving incredibly weighty and fun, and makes shootouts really intense. Wooden crates get torn apart and send wood flying everywhere, bottles explode, glass shatters, lights go out, bullets leave giant holes  in conrete walls and send dust flying everywhere.\n\nWeirdly enough, you can't shoot from your car. Some might see it as a big problem, but the game doesn't need it. Besides, it makes car chases more challenging.\n\nThe APEX physics option doesn't seem to do a huge lot, but is completely brokens and halves the framerate of the game (your mileage may vary).\n\nFinally, the best part of the whole game, the gunplay. The game lets you carry a metric ♥♥♥♥ton of guns, and they're all very fun to use. They sound good, they look good, and they feel good. The recoil is very nicely done, and makes automatic weapons particularly fun to use.\n\nThe game uses health regen and a cover system. But have no fear! They don't impact the game in any negative way (which is a miracle). Your health only regenerates to about 75% and you'll need food to replenish it. The cover system is extremely basic and only useful to get you out of spicy situations when you're about to die. The game actually lets you run around the place and shoot people without forcing you to hide behind a wall, and doesn't even force you to zoom in (!) to be accurate at medium range!\n\nMafia 2's big problem is that you don't get gunfights as often as you'd want. Some missions even rely entirely on you using your fists, and the melee combat system is really bad. It's basically impossible to lose as long as you're holding your block key.\n\nAnother very good aspect of Mafia 2 is the atmosphere. The cars look fantastic, and so does Empire bay. It's colorful, it's flashy, and the radio is amazing. All the characters naturally have a cheesy mafioso accent, which may or may not be great, depending who you ask. (it's great)\nIt's nice to have a shooter that doesn't look completely dull.\nDespite its open world, Mafia 2 doesn't have anything for you to do in it outside of the storyline.\nIt serves as a beautiful backdrop, and driving in the streets while dodging traffic at 100km/h is fun, but secondary missions would have been welcome. The cops don't do a whole lot, but will come after you if you exceed the speed limit or bump into another car. They can get mean if you start to shoot at them, and they won't hesitate to pull out the tommy guns.\nThe game's wasted potential comes in the lack of secondary missions, which could have easily fixed some of the game's biggest problems by adding more gunfights and introduce car races (it's a shame they didn't implement any, because the car physics are some of the best around, and tuning your car isn't very useful).\n\nTo sum it up, Mafia 2 is a good game despite its flaws. Sure, some missions are uninteresting, and the story and characters are somewhat disappointing, the melee combat sucks, but it makes up for it with its incredible gunfights and delightful atmosphere.\n\nIf you've been looking for a good PC third person shooter, look no further. I heavily recommend it if you can grab it on sale, especially the DLC missions, which fix most of the main game's issues.","June 25, 2014","true","24.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

C'est un jeu que je n'aurais jamais osé testé s'il ne m'avait été offert et grave erreur, il vaut son pesant de cacahuètes (une vingtaine d'euros encore aujourd'hui).\n\nNous incarnons un jeune mafioso en devenir : Vito Scaletta. Le jeu nous pousse vraiment à faire partie intégrante de la Mafia et nous pousser à être craint par sa ville. Le scnéario -bien que trop court- nous met bien dans l'ambiance, et propose même de vivre des évènements annexes et ça c'est quelque chose de vraiment appréciable, car bien que le jeu étant très court nous n'évoluons pas que sur un seul environnement donc pas le sentiment d'avoir fini le jeu d'une traite. Bref, on développe en même temps que le personnage la raison du pourquoi il était facile de finir mafioso dans les années 50.\n\nEt tiens, quid des années 50 ? Le jeu nous propose en effet d'évoluer dans un open-world à la sauce 50's, et nous sommes remarquablement servi : des décors parfaits, des clins d’œil de l'époque (pin up, blagues, avis de recherches etc), une narration au top et ne souffrant pas d'anachronismes, une ribambelle de véhicules de l'âge d'or de l'auto (et c'est LE point fort du jeu tant la simulation automobile est poussée), et également une bande-son au top.\n\nEn terme de difficulté le jeu est assez corsé par moment, mais il n'y a pas besoin d'un skill monstre pour en venir à bout, et pire il est très simple quand on prend le temps de réfléchir et de ne pas se jeter corps-et-âme dans les nombreuses fusillades que nous offre le jeu. Doté d'un système de sauvegarde automatique le jeu peut s'avérer frustrant par moment, ça arrive souvent qu'à 95% d'une mission un ennemi déboule de nulle part et vous one-shot au shotgun, ce qui vous fait recommencer depuis la dernière save auto...\n\nBref, Mafia II nous projette d'une main de maitre dans le monde de la Mafia, le scénario n'est pas ultra transcendant mais nous met vraiment dans la peau d'un mafioso en devenir grâce à son atmosphère travaillée aux petits oignons : vous allez être confronté à l'indécision en vous demandant qui sont vraiment vos alliés.\n\nAvis aux amateurs de GTA-likes vous allez peut-être être déçu car bien qu'évoluant dans un open-world Mafia II est très scripté, le jeu est coupé en 15 chapitres, chapitres qui parfois ne vous laisseront pas la possibilité de vous promener comme nous laisserai faire un GTA, et en promenade à part braquer quelques magasins nous faisons vite le tour, qui cela dit reste tout de même un joli tour.","October 12, 2013","true","35.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For the entirety of my first playthrough I was completely enthralled with  the mid-twentieth century mobster thing. I found myself really trying to slip into the story rather than running around capping civilians and robbing businesses, as is commonplace in similar titles. The time spent playing Mafia II thus far has been some of the most gratifying I have had while gaming within Steam.\n\nI highly suggest this title to any fans of the GTA - esque genre and also to any individuals who enjoy immersing themselves in an entirely different era.\n\n3 Thunbs Up!","January 10, 2015","true","15.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is good but all the most interesting parts take place during timelapse cutscenes, the game basically taunts you with these constantly.

Vito and his family had moved to Empire Bay in hopes of rebuilding their lives, only to discover they were no better off there than they were in Sicily. While still only being a Schoolboy, Vito gets involved into a life of crime with his best friend; Joe Barbaro. Vito is arrested during a botched robbery and is provided with two choices; Be drafted into the military, or go to prison. After serving his time in his Sicily, Vito returns home after being shot only to discover that his family now resides with large amounts of debt due to his Father borrowing money off a loan shark.\n\n+ Top notch voice acting for all characters.

REAL music.\n+ Medium sized map. Although does not compare to competitors.\n+ Ability to interact with Enforcment. Providing the option to bribe, pay the fine, or to resist.\n+ Cover system. Although it may be linear, it is essential for your survival and would be impossible to operate without it.\n+ Sound for all weapons sound amazing and have a kick to them that is appealing.\n+ Great port. All controls are fluid and function perfectly.\n\n- Lack of free roam.\n- Color palette. Although the color palette is vibrant, I feel as if the city itself possesses too much blandness. Don't know if the Developers had intended for that, but it bothers me.\n- Cliff hanger ending.\n- Derpy AI. At times the opposing faction Gangsters or Police are linear and don't process their environment.\n- Houses. I found that since you are always wound up participating in the story, your house doesn't provide as much use as I had hoped.

He was a soldier in the army and due to a bullet that hit him, he gets sent back home and he gets caught up in a life of crime, and that's where you start. That's about enough of the backstory. Where is the review?\n\nStory: 10/10\nThe story is excellent. I've seen stories that just make me feel what the protagonist feels. This game is one of them. With so many confusing and heartbreaking moments, as well as the great and memorable moments, you get a well-written storyline in the Era of the Mafia.\n\nSound: 9/10\nThe sound could be a little better (ahem, music). The gunshots, ambience and other noises sound pretty realistic, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the people back in the day had a pretty bad taste in music, if I do say so myself. If you like the music, great. I'm not trying to offend anyone. But, if you don't, join the club. We got jackets!\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nTruly elite graphics that are perfect in (mostly) every way. There's a flaw where you slide into cover and your jacket gets all glitchy... but that's no matter. The cars look spectacular, and there's a variety of them. Blood looks meh. It's amazing and gory in the cutscenes, however, while playing, the blood looks... I don't know how to put it... gooey. I think it's a great graphics game, overall. Despite some flaws.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nThis game has great controlling and mechanics. It handles well, there are a few stupid, annoying incidents when you're driving a car on the rails at full speed ahead and you slam into some protrusion that instantly kills you. This game would get a better score had it had more open world features. Once you complete the game, you don't get a free-roam mode. That's going to be explained in the Replay Value of this review. Note: I'll be as vague as possible, but you lose all your things 3 times within the game, so don't expect to keep all of your weapons, clothes, or cash even. Cash is easy to get back, relatively. Weapons and clothes, you can just steal from shops. It's no big deal, but it's a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\n\nReplay Value: 4/10\nThere are some missions where you can ♥♥♥♥ up, but there's not much of them. You can replay chapters, that's a step up, but when you complete the game, there is absolutely no free roam mode. Again, you can replay chapters that have free-roam mode available, and don't get me wrong, there's alot of times you can free roam, but I wish they'd just make a feature where after you complete the game, you get to do whatever you want.\n\nOverall Rating Value: 8.2/10\nThis is a great game overall, but don't expect it to be too much of Grand Theft Auto... because it's not. There's one DLC for this game, and it's just 2 new clothes with different colors. I'd recommend this game to anyone craving action, and can take the annoying moments that are in Mafia II. Again, it's one helluva game and it has a lot of things in it.\n\n###THIS GAME IS CONTROLLER SUPPORTED, AND I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE ONE OVER THE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD###","January 24, 2015","true","50.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I always wanted to play a game version of Goodfella's and Mafia II is just that.\n\n+ Graphics still hold up today. The character models and expressions are great.\n\n+ Old 50's music, i personally love the period and setting.\n\n+ The Story has so many twists and turns, its better than many movies. Keeps you playing to see what happens.\n\n+ The gameplay is also fantastic, its unforgiving unlike many shooters you need to use cover or you die.\n\n- It comes to an end a little after 10 hours.

There's little to do and even less incentive to do it (aside from listening to the great soundtrack). It is, instead, a very linear, narrative-focused cover-based shooter - and thankfully a good one.\n\nAlthough the open-world trappings lead to annoyances (tedious driving, with increasingly flimsy excuses for you to drive someone else's car, searches for collectables in the middle of a tense mission, etc), the solid atmosphere, writing, voice acting and graphics make the game a worthwhile experience overall.\n\nThe plot features some neat twists and is surprisingly adult at times - that's not necessarily a good or bad thing, but at least it is pushing the boundaries further than many games dare.\n\nI didn't find it as memorable as the original game, but it's definitely a solid follow-up. It looks and sounds great, runs smoothly and offers a reasonably compelling story. Worth a go.","October 2, 2015","true","13.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jenim/recommended/50130/","jenim","ITS JEN❤","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jenim/","107 products in account","Such a great game that I am more than happy to have invested time in. Not only is the story great and driven, the characters are substantial, witty and comprehensible with voice overs that are simply over the top. The game itself is beautiful, and very enjoyable. The cops do tend to become really tedious with all the speeding limits/tickets and minor hit and runs, but the interactive choices in the game is realistic in a sense. To dragging bodies so you can dispose them to pick locking cars. Which is never a bad thing for these types of games I guess.\n\nHaving company with the likes of Joe throughout the game is also extremely enjoyable. Beside Vito (who is the main character) Joe, Vito's pal - is my favorite. He's uplifting, loyal and funny. He made this game much more enjoyable for me to play. The game does give you a L.A Noire and GTA feel, but it's also original and satisfying in its own way too. You don't have as much freeroaming as GTA and RDR though. With a bunch of money in the game that's useless to spend. Of course you can upgrade your car and buy a few outfits, but that's pretty much it. Not many fun spots to visit either, other than food joints, gas stations and shops.\n\nBut you're so focus on the main story that you end up not caring. This game certainly had a lot of thought on the story and is for sure a worth playing game to buy. Also, has one of the best stories in a game in my opinion and definitely improved itself from part one.

He was a soldier in the army and due to a bullet that hit him, he gets sent back home and he gets caught up in a life of crime, and that's where you start. That's about enough of the backstory. Where is the review?\n\nStory: 10/10\nThe story is excellent. I've seen stories that just make me feel what the protagonist feels. This game is one of them. With so many confusing and heartbreaking moments, as well as the great and memorable moments, you get a well-written storyline in the Era of the Mafia.\n\nSound: 9/10\nThe sound could be a little better (ahem, music). The gunshots, ambience and other noises sound pretty realistic, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the people back in the day had a pretty bad taste in music, if I do say so myself. If you like the music, great. I'm not trying to offend anyone. But, if you don't, join the club. We got jackets!\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nTruly elite graphics that are perfect in (mostly) every way. There's a flaw where you slide into cover and your jacket gets all glitchy... but that's no matter. The cars look spectacular, and there's a variety of them. Blood looks meh. It's amazing and gory in the cutscenes, however, while playing, the blood looks... I don't know how to put it... gooey. I think it's a great graphics game, overall. Despite some flaws.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nThis game has great controlling and mechanics. It handles well, there are a few stupid, annoying incidents when you're driving a car on the rails at full speed ahead and you slam into some protrusion that instantly kills you. This game would get a better score had it had more open world features. Once you complete the game, you don't get a free-roam mode. That's going to be explained in the Replay Value of this review. Note: I'll be as vague as possible, but you lose all your things 3 times within the game, so don't expect to keep all of your weapons, clothes, or cash even. Cash is easy to get back, relatively. Weapons and clothes, you can just steal from shops. It's no big deal, but it's a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\n\nReplay Value: 4/10\nThere are some missions where you can ♥♥♥♥ up, but there's not much of them. You can replay chapters, that's a step up, but when you complete the game, there is absolutely no free roam mode. Again, you can replay chapters that have free-roam mode available, and don't get me wrong, there's alot of times you can free roam, but I wish they'd just make a feature where after you complete the game, you get to do whatever you want.\n\nOverall Rating Value: 8.2/10\nThis is a great game overall, but don't expect it to be too much of Grand Theft Auto... because it's not. There's one DLC for this game, and it's just 2 new clothes with different colors. I'd recommend this game to anyone craving action, and can take the annoying moments that are in Mafia II. Again, it's one helluva game and it has a lot of things in it.\n\n###THIS GAME IS CONTROLLER SUPPORTED, AND I'D RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE ONE OVER THE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD###","January 24, 2015","true","50.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Vito Scaletta (the main character) has just returned from serving in the army to meet up with his freind joe. Just like GTA, Joe hooks Vito up with multiple "dirty work" suppliers. Which is how you progress through the game by doing multiple action filled missions. There are many collectibles spread around the map for hours of fun, and the map itself is HUGE.

Exceeded my expectations for a game produced in 2010 and I logged more hours than I intended too. Worth the while and money. Beautiful visuals, amazing plot, atmospheric, game play, always driving you forward to find out the next bit.\n\nVito Scaletta; An Italian immigrant in which emigrates with his family from Sicilia only a few years after\nbeing born in 1925. Vito and his family had moved to Empire Bay in hopes of rebuilding their lives, only to discover they were no better off there than they were in Sicily. While still only being a Schoolboy, Vito gets involved into a life of crime with his best friend; Joe Barbaro. Vito is arrested during a botched robbery and is provided with two choices; Be drafted into the military, or go to prison. After serving his time in his Sicily, Vito returns home after being shot only to discover that his family now resides with large amounts of debt due to his Father borrowing money off a loan shark.\n\n+ Top notch voice acting for all characters. Characters demonstrate emotion and personality.\n+ Atmospheric, Story rich.\n+ Excellent plot and development of characters.\n+ Beautiful, sleek vehicles in which respond accordingly to the environment.\n+ Vehicle handing is realistic and smooth.\n+ Suave apparel.\n+ On point rag doll physics.\n+ Destruction physics.\n+ Accurate, and detailed reloading animations.\n+ Detailed character models.\n+ Beautiful music with out most integrity. REAL music.\n+ Medium sized map. Although does not compare to competitors.\n+ Ability to interact with Enforcment. Providing the option to bribe, pay the fine, or to resist.\n+ Cover system. Although it may be linear, it is essential for your survival and would be impossible to operate without it.\n+ Sound for all weapons sound amazing and have a kick to them that is appealing.\n+ Great port. All controls are fluid and function perfectly.\n\n- Lack of free roam.\n- Color palette. Although the color palette is vibrant, I feel as if the city itself possesses too much blandness. Don't know if the Developers had intended for that, but it bothers me.\n- Cliff hanger ending.\n- Derpy AI. At times the opposing faction Gangsters or Police are linear and don't process their environment.\n- Houses. I found that since you are always wound up participating in the story, your house doesn't provide as much use as I had hoped. It seems to me that your house is provided basically to access your phone.","May 24, 2015","true","133.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But Mafia II is overall, a decent experience. The story is really nice and intriguing, the graphics are pretty and the gameplay is fun enough. I can't say though that the game is really anything all that special. I mean... I liked it, but I can't help but feel there's something missing in it. Maybe it's the fact that besides the story missions there's pretty much nothing else to do in this game. Or maybe that I expected some more variety regarding the missions we have to go through.

But Mafia II is also one of the greatest games I have ever played. A here's why.\n\nMafia II is your basic Italian steroetype mobsters versus some other gangs flick. The gameplay is fairly simple, shoot and cover and make your way from point A to point B, nothing special. However, Mafia II is beautifully directed, acted and designed. The attention to period detail is fantastic, and the character interactions and story are absolutley fantastic. Mafia II would suit much better as being a movie or TV show, because all in all it is a cinematic experience and I would even go as far to say a cinematic masterpiece.\n\nMafia II has such a heart-pumping and wrenching narrative that really makes up for the sub-par gameplay mechanics and the lack of a traditional "free play" mode. At face value, this game may not seem much to you. But I assure you the sale price it is at right now is WELL worth the price and is an absoloute steal. Since it's release, Mafia II has never really left me and the announcement of Mafia III is just as much a reason to pick up this game than any.\n\n- Lackluster gameplay\n- No free roam\n\n+ Cinematic experience that is golden\n+ Beautifully executed\n+ Fantastic story and acting that would expected to feature in a AAA Holywood Blockbuster\n\n9/10","July 28, 2015","true","20.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The rest of my review still applies, but I was in such an enamored mood I completely neglected to point out the fact that this game crashes CONSTANTLY. In an average session of play, I will have to force close and restart the game around 3 or 4 times. The gameplay (when it works) is still as great as I describe below, but the crashing may be too much for some people.\n\nSo very awesome, but don’t expect GTA 1942.\n\nI don’t quite know how it happened, but I wanted to play Mafia II the instant I saw the very first trailer for it yet never picked it up because I was waiting for a really strong sale. Fast forward to about a week ago and as I was browsing my Steam Library getting organized something caught my eye: Mafia II was right there! Hanging out in my inventory just begging to be played!\n\nI don’t know when I got it or where I got it from but to be honest I’m actually glad that I didn’t play it until just now. Mafia II (contrary to my initial impressions of it) is not just a 40’s gangster skin over a GTA clone, but I think it serves it really well. While it is true the world is entirely open and you’re free to do as you please for the most part, the game itself is entirely linear. Rather than banking on a robust sandbox, Mafia II tells a fantastic narrative and allows you to live through your own mob film. With GTA V still going strong, I didn’t need another sandbox crime game, so Mafia II really filled this awesome sweet spot between a 100 hour sandbox mayhem binge and a 4 hour third person spunkgargleweewee.\n\nDon’t expect Grand Theft Forties, but definitely play this game!","December 11, 2014","true","28.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

But this game is filled with litle niggles which on their own wouldn't bother me, but there are so many of them that it really bogs down the experience. The sparsity of checkpoints is easily the worst problem, the number of times i've been killed while behind solid cover is a joke and the car controls are far too twitchy, making a complete mockery of the game's fantastic physics model.

Great music, decent graphics that still hold up for todays standerds, and wonderful gameplay. The story starts off a little bland, but progressivley gets better. Unfortunatley there's no free roam, but fear not because someone made a mod for that! All in all, get this game while yous till can. It's even on a massive sale right now, so it's truley a Steal.

The soundtrack and cars lend an authentic feel to the 40s and 50s as you play through the game. You can follow the story on the rails, or go off the rails exploring any time between objectives (except the one to go home each night and sleep). Even with several years gone by, the graphics still hold up relatively well, and the experience is great. The story is exceptional, and those who are following Mafia 3 may recgonize a certain Lieutenant from that game in his much younger self in this game.

I only played in the simulation mode and at high all speeds it was quite terrifying.\nControls... there 3 mouse sensitivity settings and only medium worsks as it should so I gave up, rented an excavator, and digged out my Xbox 360 controller unused for ages. Shooting with a controller wasn't that bad, aim assist is just pointing crosshair at ememy's head when you pull the left trigger, but it isn't following him / locked onto him.\n\nStory is short, there is an achievement for driving a 50 miles with a single car and I barely managed to get it even after doing 15 laps of long, straight bridge, rest was just playing the game with not always my car being available. Won't write anything more, won't spoil, even though it's a 6 year old game.\n\nWeapons. There is a Tommy Gun in 2 variants, M1A1 (clip mag - 30 rounds) and 1928 (drum mag -  50 rounds). Anyway, it features a Tommy Gun and that's everything you need to know about weapons in this game. Everything apart from it, M1 Garand and the bolt action thing is garbage (exluding pistols)... I found Tommy Gun spray more effective than a shotgun, especially against multiple enemies.\nCars, with all the DLCs there is almost 50 of them and all of them can run out of fuel - I love it, but not everybody might like that. In simulation mode the slides are terrifying - I was actually able to drift with a truck at 40 mph (in the summer, no snow).\n\nLack of free roam kinda sucks... all you can do is ignore the objective and go do some stuff.\n\nThis game... isn't worth it's price. I grabbed it at -80% on sale and with all DLCs (Aside from Jimmy's Vendetta and this other one), it was 8 Euro well spent. Nice game.\n\nSome things that happened to me when playing the game...\n\nThey're quite funny, although reading about them may not be as funny.\nAfter finishing the chapter, going home, I drove into a tree at a speed of 30 mph, and somehow it accelerated to over 125 mph in 0,5 sec, because I got Pedal to the Metal achievement then. And, of course I died and had to drive there again.\n\nAfter I sold gas things on gas stations, I drove through a long and straight bridge, 100 mph... snowy road... hit the wall... you have been killed... start the whole mission again, because this game lacks checkpoints a bit. 11/10 would drive into a wall again.","June 3","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I played the demo back when I had an Xbox 360 and I've wanted it since then. When I saw it on sale for like 7 dollars and all the dlc for an additional 7 or so, I immediately bought it all. I literally played the game for 9 hours yesterday when I bought it. It plays like a movie and the story is really involved. The driving takes a bit of getting used to since the cars of from the 40's and 50's and since the first part of the game takes place during the winter. The game does really well with teaching you things, there are no ugly pop up windows with hints. For example, in the very first mission, you walk to Joe's house and hear a wife yelling at her husband as he tries to fix their car. Eventually he gets mad and leaves, at which point you can fix the car for the wife. It's not like a cut scene, and if you had stolen a car instead of walking there, you would have never even seen it. Like I said, this game is like a movie that you play. I don't know if there are choices you can make, like at one point there was a prison fight that I lost, and I don't know if that had any affect on the story. Definately buy the DLC if you buy the game, the cars in game are really slow and not much fun to drive, but if you get the Greasers pack you get a few hot rods that are a blast to drive. Overall, this game is an absolute masterpiece and I can't wait to play Mafia III.","June 4","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Luckily, it was on sale for €5.99 instead of its original €29.99 . Needless to say that the price I purchased it for was a steal. The game features great 'car-feel', shoot-outs, interesting characters and story. Let me explain each one in detail.\n\n'Car-Feel'\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDriving a car in this game was beautiful. It made me feel like I was actually in the 1940's and 50's. Cars are also a big part of the story as well. Since you can't take a taxi and the map is not too big, you get the great pleasure of driving everywhere, this may be in the finest of sports cars or the most beat-down piece of crap you can find, its your choice.\n\nShoot-Outs\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs there was in real life, there are plenty of shoot-outs or gang wars which occur throughout the story in the game. Each shoot-out is unique because you are in a different area every time and if it is not in an area you are familiar with, you truly feel like you can die at any moment, and you can! Although it does use the classic 'Stand-behind-cover-and-all-health-regen' mechanic, one shot to the head will kill you! Shotguns one-shot you and Tommy guns ♥♥♥♥ you!\n\nInteresting Characters\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThroughout the game you meet a very wide array of characters, bad guys and... good guys? It seems like every character in the game is a nice guy to the main protagonist, Vito, in the beginning but then they turn into real snakes :(\nEveryone wants to climb higher in the mob and will do anything for it. Besides snakes, there is also Joe. Joe is the most loyal friend you will ever encounter... Even more than real life :) :) :/ :(\n\nStory\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe story in Mafia II... is the best story I have ever seen in all my time of playing video games and I genuinely think it should be the sole reason someone should buy this game. There are plenty of memorable characters and moments. The story follows Vito Scaletta, an italian American man who comes home from war and gets himself involved with all the mobs in the city by doing work for them and trys to make a name for himself.\n","June 4","true","15.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is very story driven so despite the fact that you can drive all over the city, you can’t really “do” anything (no significant side quests or minigames). Still, it’s definitely worth playing.\n\nYou play Vito Scalletta, a World War 2 vet come home early from the Italian front, with connections to organized crime in the city. You don’t want to break your back working for chump change like your father, so you turn to petty crime, making friends in low places. The story takes place over at least a decade so you experience the various highs and lows of joining a criminal enterprise, though interestingly I don’t remember the word “mafia” being used significantly. Instead, you throw your allegiance behind one of 3 “families” running the crime in the city of Empire Bay. As you’d expect among a bunch of crooks, the families aren’t satisfied with sharing the city, and underworld war is coming.\n\nThe game is played in third person perspective similar to Sleeping Dogs or Grand Theft Auto, and just like those games, you’ll be spending a lot of time in cars driving around the city. Being that the game takes place in the mid 1900’s the cars aren’t that fast so it actually takes some time to travel around. Also, the city’s main highway isn’t very well developed, so once you get on, you kind of have to follow it to the end (no exits along the way). As I mentioned earlier, the game city isn’t all that large, and there’s not too much to do other than search for collectibles. Unlike the Saint’s Row games, there are very few diversions to spend your time on, although you can rob the few stores in the city for some easy money (don’t bother). Causing trouble (like robbery or running people over) will get the cops on you, but most of the time you can just outrun them and they’ll forget you exist.\n\nCombat in the game uses a regenerating health meter and you only have a few guns to choose from. Generally I found the semi-auto pistols easier to get headshots with, and you hide behind cover for protection while waiting for your health to refill. There is a little hand to hand combat, but it’s very simple (light punch, Heavy punch, and Dodge) and mostly used for story based fights. Most of your regular fighting will be with guns.\n\nPros:\n+Very interesting story, with characters you can get invested in.\n+Spend some time with the collectible nudie mags\n\nCons:\n-The game has an unusual check point save system where it doesn’t really save your progress unless you progress on the main story. That means if you spend a lot of time out in the city trying to make money and get killed by cops, you’ll very likely lose everything you gained since the last story checkpoint.\n-The game DLC’s are no longer being sold on Steam at this time.\n\nOverall, the game is definitely worth a playthrough. Don’t bother trying to hoard up money because you don’t really have anything to spend it on other than a couple of car upgrades.\n","May 9","true","25.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To be honest, as far as story goes, I liked this story better than, I think, any other story in a game I've played. I truly believe it's that good. I could actually get attached to the characters in this story. There were a couple parts in the game that actually got me pretty good (and I most generally never get emotional in movies, let alone video games). Please, if you're thinking about getting this on sale, don't think about it, just get it, I believe it's more than worth it. Now, there were several graphical issues I encountered, as far as technical stuff goes. I was getting lower framerates than I should have (I'm running on an Athlon X4 860K and a Radeon R7 260X) and I was also getting some glitchy textures as well. I think this must have to do with the game being optimised for Nvidia, but there are several fixes out there for these problems, none of which worked for me, but I toughed through it, and was glad I could get past it.","June 5","true","20.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game features classical cars, weapons, music and a various of other things from the 1940's - 1950's era. The game has a variety of cool features, like feeling your car up with gas, opening and closing windows, robbing stores, modifying your vehicles, stealing cars, lock picking locks, climb through windows and various other things like that nature. Mafia II mainly focuses on the story driven gameplay rather that petty side missions that distract you from the story (like grand theft auto.) so people that love a good story I strongly recommend picking this game up. I love mafia games and mafia films, and this was just perfect and I am hoping they release another one. If you get bored within game you can collect some Playboy posters (which actually show nudity, I think their are 50 of them.) you can also collect wanted posters and other collectable items to keep you interested, I managed to collect and play as it was fun anyway and I did not get bored. I have played the game both on consoles and PC and love them on both, obviously I had a better time on pc since the higher frame rates and better graphics but it was still an awesome experience on console.\n\n\nGraphics:\nMafia II; now this game just has overwhelming graphical aspects and visuals(especially for the time the game was released.) The game features awesome dynamic lighting, 3D Rendered models and high resolution textures. When playing the game my breath was taken away with the graphics. It included amazing reflections, no frame drops and feels like a solid build. I can't really explain the graphics other than they are some of the best visuals I have seen in a sandbox game; I'll prove that later on when I post some screen shots. The game runs of the Illusion Engine with PhysX, even though I have an AMD graphics card the game still did it's job and created an amazing experience. The game also uses real time cutscenes which are created by the Illusion Engine so they are not pre-rendered cutscenes, so if you have a half broken car, it will show that in the cutscene which is pretty awesome if you ask me. Some scenes are pre rendered such as the hotel explosion.\n\nRatings:\nGameplay: 10/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nControls: 10/10\nPlot: 9/10\nOverall: 10/10\n\nConclusion:\nMafia 2 is one of the best game I have ever played; it's definitely worth buying and I would advise you buy it on pc, if you have a good enough pc that is... but console still gives an amazing experience nonetheless.","July 8, 2014","true","63.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It has good anf fun missions with a deacent variety, that always pushes the story forward. But the most fun part of the gameplay for me was defenitly the vast, open world with incredible 50s style cars, weapons and surroundings. I must admit that I am a huge fan of mafia stories in general, so I might be a bit biased, but I've had more fun with this open world than I've had with any other game of this type that I can think of (althoug I have yet to try out GTA V).\n\nThe game also has a good amount of comedy thrown into the writing, thoug it mostly stays a serious crime drama. There are no major bug that I encounderd during my multiple playthrougs. The gunplay is nothing special but I never really got bored of it, and you get to chose between more guns than you would expect from a 1950s game, with multiple guns, assult rifles and other types of weapons. A molotov cocktail is also always a big bonus in my book.\n\nCombining the deep story that kept you on the edge the entire time with a great payoff with the fantastic shooting/driving gameplay that you would expect from this type of game, it is most certenly a really enjoeble ride that will provide hours of gameplay even after the story is finished throug the open world.\n\n7/10\n\nFeel free to check out my other reviews.\n\n","November 26, 2013","true","43.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Suspect that after waiting 8 years for the sequel of amazing Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven everyone was expecting something truly special. And in my opinion the game lives up to the expectations: the story line is great, the characters are believable, the scenery, cars and music really take you back to 1950's. Less positive reviews read that the game is too short - I disagree. I believe that the concept of the game was to be more of an interactive movie rather than typical shoot'em-up. Of course, if you set the difficulty to low and lock yourself in the room with a bag of microvawable meals you can finish the game in one sitting, but that's not the point. This game is not for blood hungry kids who shoot before they think all day long! It's very thought through, well composed piece of interactive software that mature gamers with limited gaming time can enjoy for good couple of weeks. I myself finished it in a month playing one chapter every other day. And I enjoyed every moment of it!\nFew people try to compare it to GTA IV. I played GTA IV, and it is far more complexed game with larger world and loads more missions, but I would not put them in the same category. Playing GTA you can easily loose track of the main story line engaging in other "side missions" - Mafia focuses strongly on linear story which is far more gripping. The only negative thing I can say about the story is that the main twist isn't too convincing and happens far to abruptly.\nSome other negative things are:\n- driving any car is quite a task, but all the cars of the era were RWD and had no ESP so it would be pretty difficult turning corners at speed,\n- police are somewhat inconsistent i.e. when you jump red lights or are wanted and some of them ignore you totally.\nOverall the game is almost perfect. Few niggles here and there, but it is great! I recommend it to any mature gamer.","February 15, 2014","true","23.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I dont think the stories are related.\n\nThere are 3 "big" DLCs [The Betrayal of Jimmy (was only avaiable in Russia) ] [Jimmy's Vendetta] [Joe's Adventures], and 4 "accessories" DLCs + 1 preorder and deluxe [Made Man] DLC , containing cars, clothes, ...\n\nThis game has 3 levels of difficulties : easy, medium and hard. However, for casual players it could be renamed normal, hard, very hard.\n\nThis game is a 3rd person free roam type game. It's a GTA like, but in the 50's.\nThe gameplay is interesting, the graphics are great, the 3d models are detailed, and the game has a great optimization and is very fluid.\nThe storyline is quite long, and the main DLC's add a few hours of gaming.\nSome of the achievements require intensive grinding. You can probably achieve 100% including DLCs achievement in about 60 hours.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately you cant buy it anymore on Steam, but you can use the CD keys from the retail boxed copies, or purchase CD keys online. Buying the Director's Cut edition would provide you all the DLCs minus the Made Man one.\n\nI bought the Deluxe edition a while ago, and I enjoyed playing again recently. I still need to complete some achievements because some are pure grinding. It's a great game at an affordable price, and I would recommend you to get it before it becomes hard to find.","December 27, 2013","true","56.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Please go into this game understanding that it is very story driven and does not have a lot of open world side quests or activities. The open world is very well realized and has a great 1940\'s/50\'s atmosphere and look. The graphics balance style and realism and the cinematics and voice acting really help make the story convincing. I highly recommend this game!

You get so immersed into the drama and storyline more than how you got immersed into the episode of Degrassi when Drake got shot. I mean lord... it's so beautiful....

Maybe it was the power, the families, the tuxedos or the tommy gun blasting away as they slowly walked down the hallway. The overall badass-ery of the Italian mobsters is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe game revolves around Vito Scaletta and Joe Barbaro, best friends who work their way up to the top of the Mafia. The story is great, with what you'd expect from a mobster game. Full of obstacles, pain, suffering and betrayal. The game itself feels depressing and it really suits the mood, plus I really felt conflicted with the ending.......\n\nGameplay is just a breeze. gunfights look amazing, with realistic destruction as the bullets hit concrete, tiles, blocks, wine bottles and stuff. The cover system is also top-notch, although sometimes I'll run into the wrong cover, which causes me to die -_- Driving is ok, since the cars handle heavily and cops will fine/arrest/kill you if you do a number of traffic violations.\n\nOverall Experience: I love this game, but it could have been better. The main menu music is honestly one of the best I've heard and absolutely fits in with the theme. It's definitely worth a look if you love a good story and fantastic open-world gameplay.","December 22, 2013","true","17.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The plot follows young World War II veteran Vito Scalleta and his buddy/sidekick Joe Barbaro. It chronicles their rise and fall through the hierachy of the American Mafia. The narrative is very good and expertly structured despite the fact it relies on mobster movie cliches a little to much. The game features a wide cast of characters almost all of which are incredibly rich and interesting. Of particular interest is the Walter White esque character arc of Vito as he finds himself forced to abandon his morals as he becomes further and further entrenched in the underworld.  When it comes down to it Mafia II is a story about choices (despite the fact the player never makes any) and consequences. And there are many for Vito and his family and friends.\n\nBut the real star of the show is of Empire Bay itself. It is incredibly detailed and a quite simply extraordinary recreation of 50's New York city complete with steaming manholes, coffee shops, towering office buildings, and a wide array beautiful era faithful cars blaring 50's tunes. The interiors are just as meticulously detailed looking just like sets ripped straight from the TV series "Mad Men".  it is a tour de force in world building and arguably in the benchmark when it comes to open world cities. (Yes despite Grand Theft Auto V)\n\nEmpire Bay is an open world yet features no fast travel mechanic. Whenever you need to get somewhere you drive, which is where the aforementioned cars come into their own. Some players will no doubt find this rather tedious but I personally enjoyed it and used it as an excuse to see the sights and explore. The driving mechanics are slightly more finnicky than othr games but that can no doubt be attributed to the period setting. The shooting and brawling sequences are all handled with aplomb but are curiously few and far between, with only the occasional burst of ultra violence to please action junkies. Interestingly despite the open world setting there is actually next to nothing to do outside of the main storyline. In a game like GTA or Saints Row this would be a calamity but in Mafia II it only serves to put the focus on the excellent central narrative. Mafia II is excellent, brilliantly written and crafted game.  A game with real heart and soul. Highly recomended.","December 2, 2013","true","16.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Asians and Irish people sometimes play into the story, but the famous Hong Kong gang known simply as "The Crips" are only featured in a brief segment near the final act.\n\nVito has a wide range of weapons at his disposal, such as a pistol, another pistol, a third pistol, a revolver, a slighly longer revolver, one shotgun and about fifty thousand machine guns. He sometimes has grenades, too, but those appear about as often as my feet when I try to look past my beer gut.\n\nA lot of people die, except for Vito, and many people simply want to go about their business, who Vito kills. This makes up the majority of the linear story without any free roam because there was no time to code the game completely in the weekend that 2K Czech had.\n\nGrand Saints True Crime 3 is the best open-world third person shooter game since Barkley: Shut Up and Jam Gaiden, although the story in this one is worse. It's okay if you enjoy fighting fat prison inmates in shower rooms. 2.86/900 -IGN","June 13, 2014","true","12.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

Still robust by the graphics, 5 years after release. Cruel and unjust, exciting crime story. Yet in general it's just a questionable good game about bad guys. Good, but not astounding and fascinating, like was the first Mafia game.\n\nSee, Vito Scaletta - is not a person you'll feel sympathy to. While in the first Mafia the main character was not bad or broken, and became a made man just in the occasion, Vito becomes a gangster with the very purpose to be one. Where Thomas Angelo (the 1st game guy) kills to not be killed, Vito kills to get rich, "to made a quick buck".\n\nSo, overall rating of the Mafia 2 depends of your own consciousness. If you are ready to story-driven action game where you'll be killing whoever got in your way, no matter what... game is fine. Drive, shoot, smash, rob and destroy - such are amenities of a gangster.\n\nIf you do feel a bit of uneasiness about how the story proceeds and what exactly are you doing... game's still a good one - for its unique atmosphere and original game engine. But it's not a number one game in your pocket. It's not a piece what you'll want to taste again and again. Just a good looking product for buying when you've already bought everything else on the sale. 6.5/10 mark.","October 20, 2015","true","120.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","5"

Essentially, your given a mission and half way through something goes wrong and you have to deal with it. Rinse and repeat.\n-The Mofia itself feels lazy and generic, lacks personality.\n-even though your in the mob, you never get a sense of the mobsters being good people, most of them are just kinda creeps. Unlike the godfather in which the characters can feel good, at least to some extent.\n-A ton of flat one dimensional characters. Even while some of them are quite likable they aren't really that flushed out, with a few exceptions.\n-There can be some game breaking bugs, ones that were never patched. You may not get them, but I got one once and dealing with it was just awful. A door that was supposed to lead me to the next main mission just wouldn't activate, and I checked youtube videos to see if I was doing anything wrong, I wasn't it was just completely broken. The map marker was telling me to go to the door, but going in the door didn't start the cut scene it was supposed to start and thus I just couldn't continue. This was one of the way last missions in the game too.\n\nThe Worst-Hand to hand combat- I've actually seen people praise this combat system, saying they really liked it. Obviously people have different opinions  but even so I'm not sure how people came to that conclusion. While you won't see the combat for the first several hours of the game, later on it forces you to learn and use it quite a bit. It's slow, its clunky, it takes forever to fight a few people, and its really really not fun. When I think of good melee 3rd person combat I think of the batman series, of asassins creed, of gta, well of a lot of games that aren't this. When I get to these combat sections I feel like I've gone back several generations of consols to times when game mechanics weren't great. But this is an Xbox 360 era game, there were a ton of great brawlers from this generation. If it wasn't a mandatory part of the game it wouldn't bug me so much. But there are many times where you have to slowly fight through several guys one at a time in this way, you can't use guns or anything else, as if they were really proud of this system and wanted you to use it. I was litterally groaning wanting to skip these sections every time they appeared. It happened wayyyyyy to much considering I thought it was bad, and to me the fights felt like they went on forever.\n\n\nThe ok-\n\nAnimation-Somtimes very nice looking, other times a bit lacking\n\nDriving - not much to say(seen better and seen worse)\n\nFinal Verdict-5/10- unfortunatly I felt that the bad really outweighted the good in this game, to make it not horrible but just pretty mediocre. For a cheap steam purchase it may be worth it, but to be honest to me there are just simply a lot of better games out there to be played. A shame to me as there aren't really that many mafia themed games in existance.\n","December 24, 2015","false","28.8"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","18","34","0","0"

Mafia 1 was my alternative to GTA 3, which had a more linear (and shorter) storyline, with darker and more realistic themes. Mafia games seem to always nail it when it comes to story and atmosphere, as Mafia 2's story, atmosphere and the player experiences it offers match and in most cases surpass the original Mafia game. Pair that with beautiful graphics, awesome gameplay mechanics and a more open world and Mafia 2 truly takes the series a big step forward.\n\nVito Scaletta, the main character of the game, is present in many "Top 5 protagonists in video games" and he is often accompanied in those top 5s by his friend Joe, who is probably my favorite supporting character in a game to date.\nMany games which resemble movies and have awesome stories might fall short on their gameplay (I'm looking at you, Remember Me!) but Mafia 2 certainly does not. As you are exploring the immersive city of Empire Bay, you will meet different organized crime syndicates, some of them Italian-American (which Vito & Joe may join) and some of them Chinese, Irish, etc. In the game, you will get to experience the "American dream".. while also inevitably misery, family problems, corruption, among other things. The game is immersive, serious and well-written, with comic relief from Joe and other characters which really gives you a couple of good laughs on your first playthrough.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, the gameplay is great, the graphics are great alongside the destruction effects of the engine, the story is immersive, the characters are rich and interesting, and the game also has a fair share of replayability. The only shortcomings of the game I may think of is the lack of a real open world (which might be intended, a linear game does not by any means translate to a bad game), the length (It's not that short, and as you might see I've managed to put a lot of time into it, but for people who want to do everything as fast as possible, it might end fast too)\n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend Mafia 2 for anyone. A great take on American organized crime which many might recognize to be inspired by Goodfellas, among other things. Just my opinion, but it is definitely a more enjoyable and immersive experience compared to GTA IV and some others, a must-buy!","July 24, 2014","true","145.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hours of fun, hectic firefights with destructible objects (The game even comes with PhysX options) and lots of detail. Window panes shatter and shards fly out with each bullet, with wooden chips flying about as they fire at you and miss and hit the wall causing tons of little pieces of wood and plaster to fly off. The aftermath is crazy, floors covered in shards of glass and other debris, bullet holes everywhere and objects torn apart, window blinds swinging slightly in the wind with cop sirens heard in the distance... It's a shame that the main game was relatively linear and only allowed for SOME exploration, but when you're not on a singleplayer mission, the experience of freeroaming is like drinking eggnog after that long wait... The problem is if you die you restart at a checkpoint and there's no safehouse saving so don't expect any GTA stuff right out of the box, you'll have to either buy the Jimmy's Vendetta DLC, Joe's Adventure DLC, or install the working Freeride mod which is not as good as the DLC but it kinda works...\nYou can vault over certain objects and climb onto cars, you can pick the locks of parked cars or just smash their windows which creates some of that fancy PhysX glass shard debris which gets on your hood and falls off nicely as you turn and narrowly make it around the bend to continue your wacky spree.\nYou can become wanted and you have to change your clothing or you'll probably be shot on sight, your current vehicle can also become wanted and you'll have to bail, or just be careful and sneak past the patrolling cruisers and on-foot police officers. There are also gang members that if you gun down one of their buds, nearby gangbangers will retaliate and fire upon you, you can also simply provoke them and get the cops to arrest them while hiding out of sight.\nYou can purchase items from stores and even rob the cash register of 90% of stores except for the 2 special vendors and vehicle modification shops (Which I forgot to mention can remove the wanted variable by changing your plate and repainting your vehicle).\nThere was also this one store with 2 entrances and big ♥♥♥ windows and you can drive your car through the entire thing, like it was straight out of a film or something.\nThis game features a great story and it was the first time I actually gave a damn about any character's problems (in a game).\n\nIt looks just as good as GTA 5, and...

The gameplay is practically perfect, the story is somewhat cliched but engaging nonetheless, and there are tons of collectibles to find on your missions and in the city. The game looks amazing, the city of Empire Bay is beautiful and somewhat massive, if a bit bland, and the soundtrack for this game is one of the best I've heard in awhile.

Joe ran but Vito was arrested. He was sent to work as a Soldier in Europe. Vito got hurt and was sent back, to New York. Now he and he's friend Joe will "search" for money, respect, cars and 'girls'. This is the most realistic Third-Person open world shooter (Yeah even more than GTA V). Now pro's and con's:\n\nPros:\n1. The game has a really good story line wich will make you feel what Vito feels (as happened to me). The story has sad / funny / dumb / confusing momments wich will make you want to know how it ends. In the story, you will get knowledge on what's happening, who's the bad guys and who's the good.\n2. The voice acting (russian, in my case) are really good and the developers perfectly connected character's personality to their voices.\n3. Graphics are really good and the location (New York city) is beautiful.\n4. Realistic, this game is one (if not the most...) realistic game I've ever seen! firstly you'll notice how the snow starts to slowly disappear after you drive the car, to the most little things like people's mimics / reactions.\n\nCons:\n1. You cant do a thing more than story line's, no side missions. :(\nThere's actually no cons.\n\nThis is one of the best games I've played so far, and worths a try!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PCGenesis/recommended/50130/","PCGenesis","Jonezy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PCGenesis/","53 products in account","I did a review on this game on a site a couple of months ago so here we go:\n\nGameplay:\nMafia II has some of the best gameplay aspects in a sandbox game, and is by far one of my favourite games. The game features classical cars, weapons, music and a various of other things from the 1940's - 1950's era. The game has a variety of cool features, like feeling your car up with gas, opening and closing windows, robbing stores, modifying your vehicles, stealing cars, lock picking locks, climb through windows and various other things like that nature. Mafia II mainly focuses on the story driven gameplay rather that petty side missions that distract you from the story (like grand theft auto.) so people that love a good story I strongly recommend picking this game up. I love mafia games and mafia films, and this was just perfect and I am hoping they release another one. If you get bored within game you can collect some Playboy posters (which actually show nudity, I think their are 50 of them.) you can also collect wanted posters and other collectable items to keep you interested, I managed to collect and play as it was fun anyway and I did not get bored. I have played the game both on consoles and PC and love them on both, obviously I had a better time on pc since the higher frame rates and better graphics but it was still an awesome experience on console.\n\n\nGraphics:\nMafia II; now this game just has overwhelming graphical aspects and visuals(especially for the time the game was released.) The game features awesome dynamic lighting, 3D Rendered models and high resolution textures. When playing the game my breath was taken away with the graphics. It included amazing reflections, no frame drops and feels like a solid build. I can't really explain the graphics other than they are some of the best visuals I have seen in a sandbox game; I'll prove that later on when I post some screen shots. The game runs of the Illusion Engine with PhysX, even though I have an AMD graphics card the game still did it's job and created an amazing experience. The game also uses real time cutscenes which are created by the Illusion Engine so they are not pre-rendered cutscenes, so if you have a half broken car, it will show that in the cutscene which is pretty awesome if you ask me. Some scenes are pre rendered such as the hotel explosion.\n\nRatings:\nGameplay: 10/10\nGraphics: 9/10\nControls: 10/10\nPlot: 9/10\nOverall: 10/10\n\nConclusion:\nMafia 2 is one of the best game I have ever played; it's definitely worth buying and I would advise you buy it on pc, if you have a good enough pc that is... but console still gives an amazing experience nonetheless. I know the review has already been made but I felt like he did not do it justice; also thank you for your feedback and thank you for reading my review, I am really trying hard to achieve that Game Reviewer Badge and I also love playing games and going over them it's really cool to express your feelings on that game.","July 3, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's telling a great mafia story. Here are a few reasons I like this game. 1. It has solid and smooth gameplay. It varies between mainly driving, shooting, and excellent hand to hand combat. Though there are a few glitches that can vary from small bugs, into a glitch that prevents you form completing a mission. This has a nice open world with plenty of places to either shop at, or rob. Which brings me to another point, there are quite a few ways to earn money outside of the main story. The police system in this feels very authentic: if you drive past the speed limit, they fine you. If you get caught with a gun they arrest you, etc. The missions can give some tedious objectives but I didn't mind so much because it was relavent to the story and it felt all the more authentic. There is a large number of cars that you can slightly customize (license plate, paint job, handling, rims). There are also usually a number of collectables to find throughout levels and the world. There is also a good soundtrack that fits the era well and sets a good tone. I just wish that you could explore the world after you complete the story. 2. The Story in this is a memorable mafia story that takes inspiration from films like Goodfellas. It has alot of good characters. The story is presented through good voice acting and interesting cutscenes. The only real problem I have with the story is how nabruptly it ends, of course it is in true mafia movie theme so I can either say the ending was abrupt or brilliant. 3. The graphics may be this game's weakest point, not to say they're god awful, but some parts are just sub-par while other aspects look good and bad. Character models for people like Vito and Joe (the main characters) are pretty good while others look mediocre. I saw a few background characters that almost looked like they were recycled from the first Mafia game. The world looks great, with a decent sized map. Cars look very good as well.\nSo overall I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of mafia movies or action games or period pieces. If you don`t care very much about graphics then you will find that this gets the job done. The gameplay doesnt really add much but it works well and keeps the game above being generic.","January 21, 2014","true","138.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mafia II is a "fake" sandbox, meaning you can go and drive around all you want around the city, but you won't have much to do (selling stolen cars and whatnot). Mafia II doesn't have any side missions either (base game). Its strong point, and a really strong one if I might say so, is its main story. It's a story with its ups and down (like every single story out there) but in general a really great mafia experience, with an ending that will anger you. Nevertheless, that ending will grow on you, and you'll realize, all in all, Mafia II was meant to be that way.\n\nSummarizing: Charismatic story with charismatic characters. More an interactive movie than a game (because of linearity), but that works in Mafia II. If you like mafia stories and the noir film genre, this is for you.\n\n8/10.","February 17, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now the authors were greedy and cut a lot of content out and then put some of it back repackaged as  DLCs so: the city is empty, no side missions, some unique locations just lie there with no purpose, the story has holes and falls apart in the later game, clearly some missions are missing, people behave out of character, it's a big cluster♥♥♥♥, doesn't make any sense up until a VERY underwhelming ending. Many aspects are annoying - cars are frustrating, psychic police attacks you all the time, enemies tend to randomly head-shoot you which is game over, some boss fights are frustrating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

It's telling a great mafia story. Here are a few reasons I like this game. 1. It has solid and smooth gameplay. It varies between mainly driving, shooting, and excellent hand to hand combat. Though there are a few glitches that can vary from small bugs, into a glitch that prevents you form completing a mission. This has a nice open world with plenty of places to either shop at, or rob. Which brings me to another point, there are quite a few ways to earn money outside of the main story. The police system in this feels very authentic: if you drive past the speed limit, they fine you. If you get caught with a gun they arrest you, etc. The missions can give some tedious objectives but I didn't mind so much because it was relavent to the story and it felt all the more authentic. There is a large number of cars that you can slightly customize (license plate, paint job, handling, rims). There are also usually a number of collectables to find throughout levels and the world. There is also a good soundtrack that fits the era well and sets a good tone. I just wish that you could explore the world after you complete the story. 2. The Story in this is a memorable mafia story that takes inspiration from films like Goodfellas. It has alot of good characters. The story is presented through good voice acting and interesting cutscenes. The only real problem I have with the story is how nabruptly it ends, of course it is in true mafia movie theme so I can either say the ending was abrupt or brilliant. 3. The graphics may be this game's weakest point, not to say they're god awful, but some parts are just sub-par while other aspects look good and bad. Character models for people like Vito and Joe (the main characters) are pretty good while others look mediocre. I saw a few background characters that almost looked like they were recycled from the first Mafia game. The world looks great, with a decent sized map. Cars look very good as well.\nSo overall I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of mafia movies or action games or period pieces. If you don`t care very much about graphics then you will find that this gets the job done. The gameplay doesnt really add much but it works well and keeps the game above being generic.","January 21, 2014","true","138.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mafia II is a "fake" sandbox, meaning you can go and drive around all you want around the city, but you won't have much to do (selling stolen cars and whatnot). Mafia II doesn't have any side missions either (base game). Its strong point, and a really strong one if I might say so, is its main story. It's a story with its ups and down (like every single story out there) but in general a really great mafia experience, with an ending that will anger you. Nevertheless, that ending will grow on you, and you'll realize, all in all, Mafia II was meant to be that way.\n\nSummarizing: Charismatic story with charismatic characters. More an interactive movie than a game (because of linearity), but that works in Mafia II. If you like mafia stories and the noir film genre, this is for you.\n\n8/10.","February 17, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not the best open world game, but I really enjoyed my time playing it. The DLC is a must buy unfortunately, because free roam is very fun though not possible without DLC. The moment this game really got me is when the world changes - I don't want to spoil it - but you'll know what I mean when you see it.\n\n-Story is decent, though ends on a very weak note. It is quite convoluted at times, however. Some plot points will leave you scratching your head\n-The world is gorgeous\n-Mafia II has the best driving mechanics I've ever played in anything that isn't a racing game\n-Gunplay is reasonable\n\nUnfortunately, some people will be expecting the city of Empire Bay to be more sandbox-y, and that is not what Mafia II is about. It's story is very linear and allows you to explore 'on a leash', if you will; either before or after a mission begins. DLC rectifies this, but you don't get to play as Vito. The DLC is also very weak compared to the actual campaign. You don't pay for small additions of what you'd see in the campaign; the DLC has no cutscenes for the missions, at least in Joe's Adventure. Everything is told to you via text before you accept or decline the mission. Very weak.\n\nOverall, highly reccomended game, even though it has flaws - and it has many. Exploring and soaking in the world the developers have created is enough for me.","July 21, 2014","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now the authors were greedy and cut a lot of content out and then put some of it back repackaged as  DLCs so: the city is empty, no side missions, some unique locations just lie there with no purpose, the story has holes and falls apart in the later game, clearly some missions are missing, people behave out of character, it's a big cluster♥♥♥♥, doesn't make any sense up until a VERY underwhelming ending. Many aspects are annoying - cars are frustrating, psychic police attacks you all the time, enemies tend to randomly head-shoot you which is game over, some boss fights are frustrating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This is a good game but boy did I hate it at the end...","September 3, 2011","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Sure you can customize your clothes and cars, but never drive your cars with custom license plates, you will have to change them if you commit certain crimes. Also, weapons are hard to come by until the middle to the end of the game.\n\nIf only this game was more free roaming and had time for players to do what they liked, it would have been a hit.\n\nThis game also has a few bugs, one is only load one car at a time in the car crusher and  one I encountered was for mission 14. Only crush cars, don't rob any stores, or else the game will be loading forever during the transition to chapter 15.\n\nThe story is good, but overall leaves much to be desired.\n","January 6, 2015","true","25.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really loved the way the game changed: (without spoilers) when you are 'away' for a few years, everything is different when you come back: the cars are more advanced and faster.\n\nThe missions are fun and engaging, with a lot of variation and depth.\n\nI adored the way the police were set out, very unlike GTA where they shoot on site for the smallest things, the punishments the police inflict are much more suited. E.G. If you are caught speeding (You have to be going very fast over the limit for them to pick up on it) you will be fined, same as if you were brawling on the streets or ramming other cars. But say you attack an officer, then they unleash their rage!\n\nThe only comaint i have about the game is, there is NO oppurtunity to have fun in the world and explore, yu are always on a mission. I assumed that you would be able to explore at the end, after you had got a lot of money and had a nice house etc. But, alas, no. Yes the ending was very powerful, but the game just ends. When you are in the villa, splash out and have some fun before continuing with the story, as that is proably one of the only times you will have an oppurtunity\n\nDespite the drawback, i would rate this game an 9/10. Brilliant.","April 9, 2015","true","36.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes you can drive and walk nearly everywhere, but there is little or no interaction between you the player and the open world.\n\nPlay Mafia as a Story driven shooter and it suddenly becomes a much better game. It does what it predecessor did at times better and sadly at times worse.\n\nThe looks, driving mechanics and gun play are a step above Mafia I. I enjoyed Mafia 1's game theme more but 2 has an great set of radio station music. The most glaring ommssion is the lack of free roam at the end of the game which Mafia One had out of the box; yes it is possible to buy a DLC to unlock free roam but that is really unfair\n\n\nThe ~10 hours or so I took to complete the game were thoroughly enjoyable as i was not expectnig a GTA clone, I was expecting a sequel to Mafia and I got what i was looking for, with the possible exception of free-roam","June 4, 2014","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I cannot praise the immersiveness and evocativeness of the period recreation highly enough. Just driving around nighttime 1940s New-York style streets listening to old-time jazz, blues and other wartime music and seeing all the old-fashioned cars and the snow-covered streets is a wonderfully enjoyable treat, particularly on the PC version with its superlative, realistic graphics. It really gave me enormous joy and pleasure to just drive around listening to the radio whilst completing the early missions, I found the period setting superbly evocative, and the snowy nighttime setting of one of the missions and the music really evoked a lovely wistful feeling as I drove around, it really was very emotionally engaging indeed just from the visuals and music. The design of the city is very convincing, you see lots of realistic-looking streets and sights as you drive around, you almost feel you are watching a film, it's terrific. I loved it. Also the shooting is great in this game, the reaction of the enemies when you shoot them is very realistic, and the ragdoll physics are better and more realistic than in any other game I've seen. So I thoroughly enjoy the shooting also, I find it fun and immersive and satisfyingly convincing shooting the enemies. I rate this game very highly for these three reasons, the visuals, the music, and the shooting. Fantastic.\n\nAs to the story,  game's plot like is basically a mixture of the Godfather, and Goodfellas, you're a war hero, come back from the war and fall into a life of crime with your friend.

The story is a bit too short, and there aren't any side missions to do, so this is a one-way ticket. The story is engaging most of the time, but what really hit me hard, without spoiling much, was the last sequence of the game. If a short gameplay session bothers you, and you want more of a challenge, I highly recommend playing on hard mode with simulation driving on.

But, I am going to reccomend this game again becuase it was worth every penn, that I didn't pay. I got this game for free in a promotion. I thought it would be mediocre, as I got it for free. Never have I been more wrong in my life. This game sucked me in, forcing me to play it over and over again, and again. I would buy the DLC for tihs game, but I don't think I can go through it again, as this game has no point to replaying it. There is no way you can get different outcomes, or even continue playing after the storyline is over. If you can grab this game for under $20, I would tell you to go for it. However, if you are looking for a gang shooter that you can play over and over again, without boredom, go get GTA IV or Saints Row 3. Though it has its downsides, this will forever me one of my favorite games, next to Bioshock: Infinite, for having amazing storylines. This game, by far, has the saddest ending to any game I've ever played, don't just Google it to see what it is, playthrough the game and you will be so sucked in, a tear will come to your eye as you finish it. I rate this game an 8/10.

Mafia II is a "fake" sandbox, meaning you can go and drive around all you want around the city, but you won't have much to do (selling stolen cars and whatnot). Mafia II doesn't have any side missions either (base game). Its strong point, and a really strong one if I might say so, is its main story. It's a story with its ups and down (like every single story out there) but in general a really great mafia experience, with an ending that will anger you. Nevertheless, that ending will grow on you, and you'll realize, all in all, Mafia II was meant to be that way.\n\nSummarizing: Charismatic story with charismatic characters. More an interactive movie than a game (because of linearity), but that works in Mafia II.

The same enthusiasum carried over to this one as well.\n\nThe first part of this game really sucks you in and is very immersive. However, after about half way through, I felt as though I wasn't in a Mob. Instead it felt like it was just me and Joe doing random things, sometimes for no reason. In the end I almost felt as though this game should of been called "Joe and Vito's adventures"....\n\nThe car "upgrades" are a nice touch, however there was no real need for them, or an expansive open world to enjoy it with. Honestly, I didnt really notice any diffrence between the "stock" car and a fully upgraded one.. Unless you are in one of the few slow cars, any car is capable of outrunning the police or catching up to a fleeing rival. IF there is a Mafia 3, I hope they expand with upgrade options, give a fully open and explorable city with side quests and side jobs. Also add in much more cars, I swear there are only 10 diffrent cars tops....if that. Same with the weapons.\n\nThe open world system cannot hold a candle to games like GTA etc. No real reason to leave the story and "free roam" as there is not much to do if anything. Rob a few stores or crush a few cars to get your money up (if for some reason you need it?). I went through the whole game without doing anything "extra" to gain money. Guns, ammo and cars are aquired in every mission so no need to buy anyhting other then 1 suit and maybe crush a car or 2 to pay off a Loan twaords the end.\n\nI still reccomend this game, I just wish it was more about being a Made-man then doing pitty missions that seem like side-quests to satisfy Joe or Vitos issues, rather then the Mob itself.\n\n6/10","December 7, 2013","true","47.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It really gave me enormous joy and pleasure to just drive around listening to the radio whilst completing the early missions, I found the period setting superbly evocative, and the snowy nighttime setting of one of the missions and the music really evoked a lovely wistful feeling as I drove around, it really was very emotionally engaging indeed just from the visuals and music. The design of the city is very convincing, you see lots of realistic-looking streets and sights as you drive around, you almost feel you are watching a film, it's terrific. I loved it. Also the shooting is great in this game, the reaction of the enemies when you shoot them is very realistic, and the ragdoll physics are better and more realistic than in any other game I've seen. So I thoroughly enjoy the shooting also, I find it fun and immersive and satisfyingly convincing shooting the enemies. I rate this game very highly for these three reasons, the visuals, the music, and the shooting. Fantastic.\n\nAs to the story,  game's plot like is basically a mixture of the Godfather, and Goodfellas, you're a war hero, come back from the war and fall into a life of crime with your friend. The open world nature of this game is not the same as GTA. 10/10","November 2, 2013","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get a fantastically looking game with a great physics engine set in a big diverse city, you get intense action sequences with guns that feel great, you get believable, living characters who put GTA4 to shame, an engaging story with beutiful music and quite nice outfit/car pimping system. Now the authors were greedy and cut a lot of content out and then put some of it back repackaged as  DLCs so: the city is empty, no side missions, some unique locations just lie there with no purpose, the story has holes and falls apart in the later game, clearly some missions are missing, people behave out of character, it's a big cluster♥♥♥♥, doesn't make any sense up until a VERY underwhelming ending. Many aspects are annoying - cars are frustrating, psychic police attacks you all the time, enemies tend to randomly head-shoot you which is game over, some boss fights are frustrating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

I followed this game a lot running up to its release and I ended up being both disappointed and not...\n\nThe game should have been longer regarding its story and ambitions. Running towards the end of the game it just felt rushed, like it had to be wrapped up which is a damn shame. The story got both ups and downs, and I would be lying if I said it did not grip me at some point. It's well written but it's everything leading up to the ending and the ending itself that kills it.\n\nIt still looks great if you ask me. The only thing that disappointed me when it comes to graphics is the damage on cars is not anywhere near the quality of GTA IV which came out 2 years earlier. The gameplay is pretty good and you're punished if you go for a run and gun tactic. The soundtrack for this game is also one of the best I've ever heard in a game.\nOutside the story there's not much for you to do in this open world and that takes away from the experience as well. But if all these things are taken under consideration, then the next game, if there's going to be one could be amazing!\n\nNevertheless it's a really good experience that I would recommend you if you like me, are fascinated by the mafia.","May 2, 2015","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mafia 1 was my alternative to GTA 3, which had a more linear (and shorter) storyline, with darker and more realistic themes. Mafia games seem to always nail it when it comes to story and atmosphere, as Mafia 2's story, atmosphere and the player experiences it offers match and in most cases surpass the original Mafia game. Pair that with beautiful graphics, awesome gameplay mechanics and a more open world and Mafia 2 truly takes the series a big step forward.\n\nVito Scaletta, the main character of the game, is present in many "Top 5 protagonists in video games" and he is often accompanied in those top 5s by his friend Joe, who is probably my favorite supporting character in a game to date.\nMany games which resemble movies and have awesome stories might fall short on their gameplay (I'm looking at you, Remember Me!) but Mafia 2 certainly does not. As you are exploring the immersive city of Empire Bay, you will meet different organized crime syndicates, some of them Italian-American (which Vito & Joe may join) and some of them Chinese, Irish, etc. In the game, you will get to experience the "American dream".. while also inevitably misery, family problems, corruption, among other things. The game is immersive, serious and well-written, with comic relief from Joe and other characters which really gives you a couple of good laughs on your first playthrough.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, the gameplay is great, the graphics are great alongside the destruction effects of the engine, the story is immersive, the characters are rich and interesting, and the game also has a fair share of replayability. The only shortcomings of the game I may think of is the lack of a real open world (which might be intended, a linear game does not by any means translate to a bad game), the length (It's not that short, and as you might see I've managed to put a lot of time into it, but for people who want to do everything as fast as possible, it might end fast too)\n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend Mafia 2 for anyone. A great take on American organized crime which many might recognize to be inspired by Goodfellas, among other things. Just my opinion, but it is definitely a more enjoyable and immersive experience compared to GTA IV and some others, a must-buy!","July 24, 2014","true","145.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was released on 23 August 2010 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows;[1][2] a Mac OS X port was released by Feral Interactive in December 2011.[3] The game is the direct sequel to 2002's Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven.[4] Set within the fictional Empire Bay (based on New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston and Detroit), the story follows a gangster and his efforts to climb through the ranks of the Mafia crime families.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Players control Vito Scaletta, a war veteran who becomes caught up with the Mafia when trying to pay back his father's debts. The player character's criminal activities may incite a response from law enforcement agencies, measured by a "wanted" system that governs the aggression of their response. Development began in 2003, soon after the release of Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven. At release, Mafia II received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise particularly directed at the story.","March 28, 2015","true","201.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, I buyed Mafia II Deluxe plus/+ All DLC's in last week (It was on Sales!). I buyed all for like 14 Euros and If I didn't buy it without discounts, probably I would spend more than like 70 Euros so It was a good buy. Well let's get into the game. As you can see my name is DonVitoCorleone and why? Because I simply love Italians, Wiseguys and Mafia.\n\nSo, Vito Scalleta arrived at Empire Bay with is sister and parents, in hope of finding a new place to leave after they lefted Sicilia, Italy. An interesting fact in this game is that this game is very related with some Mafia Movies that have been made before this game launched. For example, the fact that Vito's father worked and earn money, that money was allways spent on Buzze (Alchool) and for me this is a Cliché of "Goodfellas" Henry Hill father, because he did the same thing. Well I cant spend my all time giving you cliches on this game but I can tell you the movies that could be related to the game: The Godfather I & II and Goodfellas.\n\nMy Rating for Mafia II::: 10/10 ::: Perfect game with a lot of history about War in Italy and Mafia origins;\n\nIs it worth buying it?::: Yes :::\n\nI hope I could help you guys giving you a reason to you to buy this amazing game.

I followed this game a lot running up to its release and I ended up being both disappointed and not...\n\nThe game should have been longer regarding its story and ambitions. Running towards the end of the game it just felt rushed, like it had to be wrapped up which is a damn shame. The story got both ups and downs, and I would be lying if I said it did not grip me at some point. It's well written but it's everything leading up to the ending and the ending itself that kills it.\n\nIt still looks great if you ask me. The only thing that disappointed me when it comes to graphics is the damage on cars is not anywhere near the quality of GTA IV which came out 2 years earlier. The gameplay is pretty good and you're punished if you go for a run and gun tactic. The soundtrack for this game is also one of the best I've ever heard in a game.\nOutside the story there's not much for you to do in this open world and that takes away from the experience as well. But if all these things are taken under consideration, then the next game, if there's going to be one could be amazing!\n\nNevertheless it's a really good experience that I would recommend you if you like me, are fascinated by the mafia.","May 2, 2015","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cars could be customized a bit more in my opinion, but I'm sure Mafia III will take care of this issue.

Well, the story is very well done, from the beginning to ALMOST the end. The ending is one of my only complaints with this game. It is one of the worst endings I have ever seen in my entire life. It's almost as disappointing as the end of LOST, but that's a whole different beast. The gunplay is as medicore as is gets, so don't expect anything in that department. The world looks and feels great... BUT THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING TO DO IN THE OPEN WORLD. NOTHING. Oh, and when the game ends, there is no free roam. The world had so much potential but the developers did nothing with it at all. The whole game is "drive here to here and kill these people". The only saving grace for Mafia II is the story and it's the ONLY reason I recommend this game. It makes you feel attatched to the characters and really care about them. The game kinda gets GTA IV syndrome and gets really stale about halfway through and picks up a bit later.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilverChaospwn/recommended/50130/","SilverChaospwn","SilverChaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilverChaospwn/","183 products in account","TL;DR  Go to Pros/Cons, and Overall/Ratings list section.\n\nI gotta say for this game. It felt so amazing. It just blows out of my mind.\n\nAll right, let's talk about what's happening for the Storyline. It's really amazing, well conflict and kind of reminds me the old 40-50's style. As you continue to progress the story, it gets something very interesting and well beyond... until the end that was surprising (not going to tell you).\n\nThe Voice-Acting was brilliant and amazing. Especially one of the character voice that reminds me Peter Griffin from Family Guy (Hint: Main Character's best friend).\n\nThe Gameplay itself is a Free-Roam of the early 50's city. Everything. It focus from late 40's to early 50's style.\nEach Chapter has a mission for you to do the objectives which quite a bit long story, but you don't have to do it and just free-roam whatever you like if you don't feel like doing it. Unfortunately, there are no Side Missions for each chapter as you progress to move on.\nFor driving, as soon as you speed up the car, the police will chases after you, but it's quite bit of annoying to lose them. You can turn on the Speed-Limiter in order to maintain the same speed sign like in real life. As soon as you're running low on gas, it will ask you to fill up at the gas station like "same reference" (or go steal another car, lol). The only little problem are handling that causes steer too much, hitting someone else car that will halt your engine, get out and repair if your car are heavily damaged and chances that hitting someone else will give you wanted on license plate, including yourself.\nFor the Customization like Clothing and Cars, it's a good option to set things for yourself what you like, especially you lose the wanted list (for clothing) and license plate as well so you don't get chased by cops again when roaming around while being wanted.\nFor the Weapons, its pretty cool and unique style. Weapons are no problem with it, nothing bad, but the fist-fighting can be bit of awkward. Whether you are facing 1-on-1, you start to move around to get in good position and arm-fist up to cover yourself, but leaned back when the attack commenced.\n\nThe Soundtrack were great. It feels the developers decided that if they want to put the old songs in the 50's and put into this game, then this could actually work.\n\nPros:\nAmazing Storyline till the end...\nGreat Voice-Acting for each cast\nFree-Roam of the early 50's city\nGreat Soundtrack like the old 50's day\nWeapons are pretty cool and unique style\nClothing and Cars Customization Variety\nCops chases after you for having to speed up the car, but quite bit annoying to lose them. You can turn on the Speed Limiter in order to maintain speed (much like in real life).\nCars has limited gas and must fill it up if running low (same as the above reference).Cons:\nFist-Fighting can be bit of awkward\nDriving can be bit hard to handling, hitting someone else car will cause your car to halt engine and repair yourself if heavily damaged, chances for wanted license plate and list if hitting someone else\nNo Side Missions, mainly focus on each Chapter Missions\nOverall, I give it 8.5/10 for this game. Don't buy all DLCs as it was worth for nothing, especially "Jimmy's Vendetta" and "Joe's Adventure" that was a little bit disappointing.\nI highly recommended you wait until it goes on sale for 75-85% off as Mafia 3 is coming soon. It's too bad that they didn't put up on steam for the first game. Oh well.","July 20, 2015","true","20.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course steam hours says I have 3 but I spent day and night playing the story. The voice acting is top notch, and the cinematics just look fantastic. On top of that, its immersive.\n*Spoiler Alert*\nFrom coming home from war, to find out your father used some money from a loan shark. You do a few jobs, pay it back and your family is safe. On top of the story in the winter and vibe of the environment, you have news from over seas playing in your radio. You may pass a sign that says "Buy war bonds!" As you play though the 40s, you get caught selling gas bonds- yeah. The one guy ratted you out. You end up getting sent to the brig, for 10 years. Your buddy managed to get the mafia to cut 4 years off. Don't worry though, its not over quick. In the immersive prison you go from fighting your way in, and then protected on the inside and out. Once your 6 years is up you're back in the 50s. The summer sun and green grass is eye candy. The streets are loaded with all new cars, new clothing, a complete conversion. You play your way through the game earning "PlayBoy" magazines and slowely earning your way into the family. A 10/10 for sure, a must play.","July 28, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As far as I can tell it's historically accurate and is a bit reminiscent of Grand theft Auto 4 except for the lack of multiplayer and the sorta closed world. The game spans 10 years of the life of the main character and builds on a deep story of this italian immigrant as his life progresses. The game is sometimes crude and is definitely not for children due to the fact the "F" Bomb is dropped nearly 200 times and it features pornographic depictions of playboys which are close to that era. All in all the storyline is kind of short but there are several dlcs you can purchase to expand further into the gameplay and unlike GTA IV the cops do not simply ignore you for petty crimes. Be careful not to hit and run anyone with a cop around or you will face a hefty fine for that time.\n","January 2, 2012","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it's not because of the Mafia thing, it's not because of the Story, although it IS a good story don't get me wrong. Its THE CAR Mechanics and the little things you can do in town. Thirsty? Go to a bar and get a drink and get HAMMERED, Hungry?\nThe Diners were you wanna be. But the best thing (to me at least) is when yer driving. Steal a Nice car and go for a spin, take yer Beauties to a Garage and Change the paint Buffout dem scratches, make you're own Custom license plate, and so on.\n\nI think its neat that you're car gets dirty as you drive it and Honestly that hurts me. I HAVE To take it to the Car Wash and get it cleaned every once in a while at a gas station. And although i think its not Necessary but you can fill up yer gas tank with gas at a station just like IRL :D and i find that quite awesome and emersive.\n\nSo if you like cars... and Mafia games i guess :/ this is the game for you.\nAnd also when you're driving you can hit a key (its L by default) and you're speedometer will have a red bar on it and if you hit the gas you will only go as fast as the posted speed limit. To me that's quite nice in other games you drive as fast as you want takeing out mailboxes and light posts as you go, and the Cops don't do anything about it. If you speed near a cop in this game They Chase you down ... You know just like IRL.\n\nThe Car controls are a little Stiff thoe :/ But compared to all the good things about this game that's hardly worth Griping about. And The best thing YOU DON'T LOSE YOU'RE CAR (unless you drive it off a bridge of course) I stole this NICE old car in the game back near the beginning and i still have it. Its Cherry red Jefferson (the cars name in game) Scratch free, Windows intact. Im gonna see how far i can go with just that car.","June 4, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is about a young guy named Vito and his friend Joe shortly after world war 2 growing up and trying to make it in the mafia etc. It can be classed as an open world game i guess but the best part is really following the story and enjoying the plot, which is epic. The graphics are pretty cool and the whole setting and scenery make the game a joy to play. The car handling and mechanics are cool too. The story and the characters really shine and you become attached to them pretty quickly which makes you want to play the game more.

From NPC interaction depending on the season and year, to car damage and car changes from the 40's to 50's. The radio boasts around 60 to 70 songs from the era and different commercials talking about the latest technology (Televisions).  The only big flaw I noticed was the amount of driving taking place between missions.  However during each drive there are usually dialogue driving the story along nicely.  Mixed with some satisfying shootouts and DLC for added play, it's hard to not recommend it.","November 22, 2010","true","26.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(not on this account though)\n\nThe Open-World is probably not that big, but it is full of details and was created with lots of thought behind it, trying to make it as immersive as possible.\n\nThe Police for example doesnt shoot at you on the first wanted level (driving too fast, crashing into others, etc.) they actually pull you over and give you a ticket, you could decline or accept.\n\nWhen you rob a store the Police doesnt know what you look like instantly, instead they come to the store and in case your not there just interview the assistant. Only after the assistant has given them a describtion of you, you can be seen by the police. After the interview they will lock down the store and it will be inactive for a few days.\n\nIt features exactly that kind of detail I want in a game.\n\nGive it a try, its a fantastic game in my opinion.","January 4, 2014","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gripping story line and still to this day, good graphics. Many missions resembles scenes from a brilliant Mafia film The Goodfellas. Which I also recommend you check out! This was my final, fourth time completing the game, first 3 times were on console when first released, and now to this later date on PC. I give it a 10/10. Recommend everyone plays this before the third is released!","November 6, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
