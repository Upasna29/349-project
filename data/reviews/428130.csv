The puzzles in the game can be quite challenging but never frustrating. The music is repetitive but never anoying.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUlcjXjGOng\nPositives:\nChallenging and fun puzzles\natmospheric music\n\nNeagtives:\nThe UI looks horrible.","January 5","true","1.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The gameplay is very short though and the overall feeling is that of a casual title and nothing more. Pretty expensive for 9,99€, but a decent buy if you get at least 25% discount. It's fun and a mind trainer and itțs worth playing it, at least once. The mechanics are original and new.","January 8","true","2.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
