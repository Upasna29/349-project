Well, I finished the game in less than four hours, so it's more like a short trip than a full adventure.\n\nThe game has some "fun" modes which you can buy for upgrade points (which you earn in the missions) such as invulnerability, super speed and big-head mode. Those are fine, except the controls are not responsive enough for the super-speed, and it's crystal-clear the speed challenges were all designed with the super-speed active in mind.\n\nIn conclusion: the game is fun, but short, and the speed challenge does not carry it. If you are looking for an action platformer, give it a miss.","November 25, 2013","false","8.6"," 51 of 63 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","51","63","0","0"

It plays kinda like a poor man's Trine.\nCombat and movement feel rather awkward and stiff.  Limited melee range with only 1 of your characters having a ranged attack. Not a whole lot of feedback for hitting/getting hit.  Enemies bouncing on your head for 3-4 seconds or visa versa.\nThe two boss battles I've gone through have been about avoiding 1 hit kills.  The first one, who's only attack knocked you into the lava below or the second one who's two attacks caused knockback if you were close enough or instantly killed you if you were under it.\n7 Characters is a tad bit too much.  Having to remember their keybinds combined with needing to quickly switch between 2-4 characters for puzzles and some characters only being useful for a few seconds throughout an entire level leads to a lot of confusion.\nBetter off just replaying Trine or something.","November 26, 2013","false","2.7"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","28","39","0","0"

The difference here being that Party of Sin doesn’t just contain the single playable character, but instead allows you to control characters representing the seven deadly sins – Greed, Gluttony, Wrath, Sloth, Lust, Pride and Envy.Each of the Sinful characters has two abilities – a fighting move and a special move that is required to complete the puzzles. Each of the Sins are introduced individually early on in the game, giving you an indication on how each performs.The puzzles are the strong suit of Party of Sin. Early on, you are given the basics of each of the Sins and their abilities and the puzzles are straightforward, requiring the gamer to simply use the power of each Sin in turn. But as the game progresses, you are required to add the abilities of multiple characters in order to solve the problems. Each of the Sins can also have their abilities upgraded. These upgrades cost Apples which can be collected through the levels. Unfortunately, the fighting section of the game is the weak point. The combat controls are simple, but the fighting is way too easy. From a visual standpoint, the game had me reminiscing of the classic Golden Axe, albeit with improved resolutions. The backgrounds in the early are rather dull, with loads of bricked landscapes, but later on are more colourful and a bit nicer to look at. Party of Sin tries to be a decent title, but it just lacks a bit of polish. Actually, it lacks a lot of polish. With upgraded visuals and better controls and some adjustments to the dull combat system, the game could have been really good. Overall 5/10.","September 20, 2014","true","12.7"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

You control the 7 deadly sins in a 2D platformer most similar to Trine. In fact, you can argue that a lot of this game is inspired from Trine. Switching between heroes, combat, puzzles (sometimes usiing physics), and even the floaty controls are all reminiscent of Trine.\n\nFirst of, I adore the concept of the game. All seven of the deadly sins look and feel like what they are representing and each of the powers of the sins fits in well, the perhaps the exception of Envy, who supermans it up and shoots a freaking laser from her eyes. I was not aware that was a thing with Envy. However, you can tell what each character represents well and, on top of that, the game introduces you to them one by one and allows you to use their powers.\n\nI see this game as three different parts: the platforming part, the combat part, and the puzzle part. As a platformer, this game is decent. Its not terrible, but there are far better platforming games to play rather than this one. Honestly, its rather basic with not much experimentation. Nothing broken, but nothing amazing as well.\n\nThe combat part is really rough. Although each of the sins have a visually different basic attack, they all feel too similar to make in impact. In fact, I am not sure if there even was a difference. Combat is also affected by the sins; unique powers, but too often combat was too frantic to make meaningful options. I could use Sloth to slow them down, switch to Lust to charm the other, and dash in using Pride... or I can use Gluttony to one shot them and regain health, melee another while healing all the damage, and one shot the other. Why bother switching sins when Gluttony is so much better. This is the biggest issue with the game, unless I am forced to switch, I generally stuck to Gluttony for combat and Greed, with his huge hookshot, to platform and start fights. The rest waited their turn for their needed role in the puzzles spread throughout.\n\nWhich, by the way, is by far the best aspect of the game. The puzzles are well designed and tricky and had elements from across the board. Sometimes you ran across a physics puzzle, sometimes a simple mirror-reflection puzzle, sometimes a timing and precision puzzle. This is where the game shined, the sins need to work in tandem and that gave me the most satisfaction when playing.\n\nAs I said, this game is hard to review since this game is all over the place, however, given its price and inclusion in indie bundles, I will give it a recommendation. Play it if it is in your library, you can easily beat it in a play session or two.","April 11, 2015","true","6.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

In this case, the characters are the Seven Deadly Sins, with a very loose story making them relevant. There isn't anything that this game does that hasn't been done a million times before. Some puzzles require fast-swapping characters, so memorizing button commands is essential, as bringing up the character change wheel takes to long to allow you to switch in time to perform the necessary action. The button commands for swapping to various Sins don't go in order or correspond to the number of the sin, so this is more trial and error, and you'll find yourself memorizing certain buttons for segments of thirty seconds or so. This becomes tedious and repettitive, and there are many boss fights where one Sin will outshine the others, or where you'll need to swap Sins mid-battle. If you die at any point during a boss fight due to a botched jump or from one of the boss's attacks that has an incorrect hitbox, you have to start over from the beginning of the fight.","July 21, 2015","false","2.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

These are supposed to be the Seven Mortal Sins - and all wrath can do is headbutt and punch. Upgrade him and he gets some short-range boomerangs. So this became less a game of 7 inherently different characters and more of one character with 7 abilities who can punch people.\n\nThe graphics are below par.\nI bought for the plot, and it wasn't there.\nAnd the greatest sin throughout the game lies in the controls; having to quickly switch between seven different characters is dreadful yet required for the puzzles.\n\nPerhaps it was released too early.\nPerhaps funding was cut.\nBut the only thing about this game which did not disappoint was the trading card value on the community market.\nPerhaps then you can get some of your money back.","January 24, 2014","false","10.6"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","1"

It provides its antiheros (the seven deadly sins) with suitable interesting powers that work off each other well, it combines those in combat satisfyingly, and it breaks up the brawling with a few simple puzzles that apply the powers and skills of all the sins. The story is also pretty good, scrambling up elements of Christian dogma with a few new ideas to give everyone a sense of purpose.\n\nIt could definitely use polish.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/recommended/212700/","arleas","arleas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/","1379 products in account","This is a pretty interesting little puzzle platformer.  Basically the idea is that you have several characters that represent one of the seven deadly sins (sloth, greed, lust, wrath, pride, envy, and gluttony) and each one has a special power or two that will help you get past certain obstacles.\n\nGreed for example has a grappling hook made to connect to various hook areas in the level, and he can also use this to grab powerups and pull down enemies who are flying.  Pride has this ♥♥♥♥♥in armor, and sword and can do a charge move that allows him to horizontally extend his jumps.  Gluttony can eat enemies for extra healing (though it doesn't happen instantly, you have to digest them a bit first or it just vomits them back out).\n\nYou can only play as one at any given time, but you can switch between characters freely as many times as you want during a level, and there are various shortcuts to making these choices (told to you as you play).  To top it all off, apparently there's a co-op play mode where you can each play a different character, though you presumably can switch between any character at any time (so long as it's not already in use).\n\nThis is one case for sure that I'd recommend using a controller vs trying to use keyboard and mouse.  While you CAN play with the keyboard, it feels awkward and there IS combat to worry about. I assume you could just spend the time to "get good" with mouse and keyboard, but it's not going to grant you any real advantages over the controller here.\n\nThe story is mostly forgettable and only really exists to explain WHY you're playing as the seven deadly sins.  It's the most unnecessary exposition since "Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the president?".  Maybe it'll get better later but for the most part, watch it once, cringe, and then play and forget it exists.\n\nI haven't seen anything that complicated or challenging, but I've only played through the first few levels.  Maybe the story and challenge will improve as time goes on?  Still though, it's a fun game and worth the purchase if you're looking for a nice little platformer to play.","March 26, 2014","true","1.3"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

People compare it to trine because of the idea of having multiple characters with different abilities to solve puzzles, but having played them both back to back (trine first, then this game) this game has a very unique feel to it.\n\nPros:\n-7 characters to use and it is easy to switch seamlessly between them, every character is assigned a shortcut key, it will take some time to learn them all but once you do switching between all 7 becomes seamless, there is also a character wheel you can use while you get used to the shortcuts.\n\n-each character has different combat abilites, while the combat is not deep, I did enjoy it more than trine.  In trine I always found I would just hang back with the archer and shoot everyone, this game gives you more variety in how you handle combat and in later levels it forces you to use all your characters in battles.\n\n-very inventive puzzles, this is not a physics based game, and while some of the puzzles are cookie cutter a good deal of them are brilliantly done.  You will spend a few minutes trying to figure out what to do and then you will actually have to execute your plan, quickly in many cases since many of the puzzles are timed.

It is a Trine-like puzzle platformer and if you're a fan of that sub-genre then there is some value here but don't expect it to match up to Trine's level of polish. This is very much amateur hour by comparison.\n\nParts of it are definitely misguided. Particularly the boss battles which just aren't fun, interesting or exciting. The combat is also hilariously unbalanced. Envy has a beam attack that you can fire constantly and can shred anything at range and Gluttony has a move that swallows an enemy whole and recharges his health while digesting it which basically makes him a tank that wanders about the battle field almost impervious to most normal attacks occasionally swallowing people. Everyone else is basically useless outside of the puzzles and (later in the game) for breaking the colour coded enemy shields. The basic problem is that character roster is too bloated. If they'd dropped one of the powers and given two each to three characters then it would have been a better game. They'd have had to drop the seven deadly sins thing of course but honestly, I'd struggling to see that as a bad thing. Like most high concept ideas it turns out to be nothing more than a paper thin conceit once stretched out to fit over a complete creative work.","June 7, 2014","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I play this game and someone walks in my room i quickly switch to porn, because its less embarrasing. But the game isnt as bad. The puzzles are really fun and challenging. If you ask me i recommend this game because its fun to play and master, but keep in mind the story is poop and graphics arent top.

I've seen soo many before that were just flat out boring like zack zero or canyon capers, but this was just amazing from start to finish.\n\nYou switch between each of the 7 deadly sins during each  level to help fight enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nThe enemies aren' that amazing, but I loved each bossfight, even if I died a millions times like an idiot. Seriously dark souls couldn't make boss fights this awesome, with some exceptions of course. The machine in purgatory isn't really a boss battle, and in the first boss battle you can use greed's hookshot to completely avoid all attacks. The final boss battle is an intense fight and having each sin's special affects actually do something, like sloth can actually slow down the boss justs adds more to the fight as you figure out how to effectively kill him.\n\nThe puzzles are perfect, they usually only require a couple of the sins to solve and they're pretty forgiving about failures. Checkpoints are frequent enough to not cause ragequits due to failure (or in my cause falling in the lava a lot). Levels are reletively short, with a mix of puzzles and kill all enemies sections.\n\nMy only complaint is that at the end of the game angels get shields that make them invincible until you hit them with a certain sin special attack. Because they're 7 sins it gets annoying switching between them all, and most of the sin's special attacks are melee range. These shields are color coded to correspond with each the sin's aesthestics.\n\nOverall this game is just fantastic. The puzzles make maximum use of each sin's abilites and there are not restrictions on how to use the sin's during combat. There are upgrades for the sin's too, but I didn't find them that game changing.","June 12, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Puzzles start off easy then go right to the hair tearing until you remember "Oh wait....i can just use THIS sin!". word of warning, some of the boss battles are irritating. one hit kills irritating. also those who don't want to pick this up because they don't want religion shoved down their throats (myself included) trust me, the game doesn't get preachy. you can pretty much swap out the theme for anything so don't worry. also reccomend grabbing a couple of xbox controllers and plug it in for some old school 2-4 player co-op.","December 20, 2012","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the graphics, the story and the hero-changing-playstyle. There is only one big bug which keeps me from entering the 4th level.\nEverytime I start it, the game crashes after like 10 seconds. I have no idea what causes this crash. There is a hint in the discussion forum which advises to change the Windows regional settings to English (I am German) but that didn't help in my case. I already searched for other fixes but didn't find any besides that one.\nI also had some crashes after finishing the first level and in between the next two ones but I could just restart the game and then everything went fine. Up to the 4th level ...\nSo for me the game is unplayable and I don't think there will be a fix in the future because of little activity around this game in the near past. If you have a hint how to repair the game (reinstalling doesn't help) then please tell me, I feel really bad about not recommending it :(","January 9","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
