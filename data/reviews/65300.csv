After all, I've played this game for 1,000+ hours and idle'd in its level editor for a few hundred more.\n\nDustforce DX is the deepest and most technically demanding 2D platformer ever made.  It has a momentum based engine where all actions have real weight and consequence, attacks have start-up frames, things are jump and dash-cancellable, and there are tricks measured in how many frames they save.  Every level has leaderboards both for score and for raw time, and the community is fiercly competitive and still very active.  More importantly, every run on the leaderboards also has a replay embedded.  Being able to watch your run (or anyone else's) is not just fun, it's a fantastic learning tool.  If that sounds like something you'd enjoy, then keep reading.\n\nDustforce DX will never hold the player's hand.  Several people ragequit the third TUTORIAL, and a wide number of the advanced mechanics and workings of the game are never explained in-game.  To really master this game and understand everything in it, you need to know other people who play it and/or engage on the subreddit and IRC channel.  Even if you do that and arm yourself with knowledge: this game is HARD.  When you think you've finally gotten good and beaten the game, you have only just begun because you unlocked "The Difficults".  Honestly even getting that far is going to take you a hundred hours at least, because the only way to unlock new levels is to complete easier levels perfectly.  I'll explain...\n\nDustforce DX has 4 main hub areas of one large world (The Nexus).  Each hub has 4 baby levels, 4 easy levels, 4 medium levels, and 4 exceedingly hard levels.  Each tier of level above the first is locked by a key, and you earn progress toward keys by playing the levels in the tier below.  But the only way to get a full key from 1 single level is to get an SS rank.  One S is completion: for cleaning all the dust and defeating all the enemies.  The other S is Finesse: for never losing your combo from dying, getting hit, or letting it time out.  The game doesn't just reward perfection, it demands it if you even want to see all the stock levels.\n\nNow why did I say stock levels you may ask?  That's because the true magic of this game is its INTENSELY POWERFUL level editor.  Custom Dustforce Maps (it calls them maps instead of levels) are what keep me playing.  This is one of several games where the editor gives you every tool the dev had, letting you make stuff on par with, and often exceeding, the quality of the stock game.  You have 20 layers to work with, tons of cool props, almost complete RGB color control and control over the %blend of the color PER LAYER, a ♥♥♥♥ ton of props and emitters to place, several things with transparency for awesome effects, and total control over the music and sound effects at every point.  The last sentence is very important since this game has a truly amazing soundtrack.  Free control over the music in the editor doubles as a sound test, even if you don't enjoy making maps.  The nice thing about the leaderboards and replays is that you can watch everyone playing your map once you publish it.  That adds another level of enjoyment to the process, a feature missing from several other games with level editors.\n\nThere are almost no restrictions on what you can place anywhere, allowing the free mixing of themes from the 4 hubs if you have the skill to make it work.  The game is easily moddable and the community has several killer spritemods available, one even turns a character into Kirby!  There are several different classes of mods both for art and for performance, and they are all easy enough to find on the subreddit.  Sadly they aren't integrated into Steam like with many other games.  The community also has several third party tools available for more detailed stat-tracking, new kinds of competition, and even a cool TAS community.\n\nIn conclusion, Dustforce DX is a great game and one of my all time favorites.  It's not easy to get into: indeed you will struggle if you go it alone and it's still very difficult even with friends beside you.  You'll get what you put into it.  We still learn things about this game every week; the engine is just that deep.  A lot of the quirks in this game are things you just won't find anywhere else.  When I say that there's no 2D platformer with the complexity of Dustforce... I mean it.","January 12","true","406.3"," 131 of 140 people (94%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","94","131","140","11","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wasnotwhynot/recommended/65300/","wasnotwhynot","wasnotwhynot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wasnotwhynot/","1054 products in account","there’s a softness, an altogether pureness, in dustforce. it is a starkly wholesome game beyond its surface. the magnitude of how pure is even idealistic and immovable. it’s something that is hard to find in a video game that seeks new horizons. relations, though. the most amazing part about dustforce is the result of its softness. even if you lack the ability to play it - and nearly everyone does - it holds wide appeal. the art and music match the gameplay to a refined elegance. it’s a pacifist game and a performance game without being tailored to either, because it’s still clearly a platformer with all of the philosophy behind it. in motion, it’s wickedly cool and aesthetically moving. skill and display meet innocence and whimsy.\n\ndustforce is ludicrously difficult. it belongs to an elite faction of games I’d describe as harder than hard. the way it’s presented, that fact lays dormant. though loss is common in dustforce, there is no mean-spirit. nothing is out for your blood and none of the platforming is dishonest. what you need to do is nearly always set clearly ahead and it’s all up to your fingers. consequently, and not in a bad meaning, the stages end up feeling more like race tracks than levels. mind you, very stylized race tracks, or race track stages, but very laid-out and bare compared to genre tradition. this feel is accented, arguably engineered, by dustforce’s mode of progression. it doesn’t matter if you only get to the end of a stage in dustforce. you will, it’s always fun to clear a stage, it just won’t let you fully continue.\n\ndustforce’s inspiration and idiosyncrasy is speed running. platformers have always been a speed running favorite. converting art into performance and display, manifesting game and human potential. speed runs are incredible, but there’s an equally incredible entry barrier. the time expenditure needed to participate means that few will experience the overwhelming play. dustforce acts as a bridge. its ranking system enforces perfection. it does not simply weigh down your time a ranking. clear time is not relevant. to unlock levels, you need SS. to get SS, you need a perfect combo with full completion. dustforce’s ranking deals with links. dust you collect on the stage builds up links. hitting dust covered enemies continues links. they are lost when you are hit, go out of bounds, or have about a five second pause since your last link. there cannot be mistakes. speed runs contain no mistakes. though complete perfection is not required, dustforce is unforgiving to even the smallest mistake. finishing a long level from beginning to end, allowed only stylistic mistakes, puts dustforce above a precision platformer to a speed run simulator.\n\ndustforce isn’t the first platformer to demand perfection. I personally love contra for its sheer display and skill or die gameplay. dustforce’s pacifist aura and dedication to a track indeed separate it from any other perfection platformer, but what is most important is dustforce’s fluidity and sense of speed. though in plain movement it is slower than a mario game, a speed run never stops and dustforce doesn’t want you to stop. borrowing two key elements from other very fluid series - mega man X’s dash and modern sonic’s magnetlike fast-fall - and adding their own radical innovations with air dashing, wall runs, and jump refreshes, dustforce has constant varied movement. the combinations and radical changes in input keep you more than engaged, with the coolness of each character’s movement drilling in your performance. the rhythm, intensity, and constant movement translate to feeling unstoppable speed. dustforce’s core is an incredible renovation of tried mechanics with unbelievable vision in its additions. it has its idyllic goal of speed running and it refused accepted conditions. it contributes altogether on its own making both its direction and its core individual and fantastic.\n\ndustforce has a special presentation with a unique goal and altogether new gameplay, so I would be skeptic to ask: how are the levels? by my language, well, this is pretty easy to anticipate. dustforce’s levels are masterful. they allow for all kinds of different and often new naturalizations, realizations, and combinations of their gameplay. the tracks have clear and differing focuses, requiring techniques, hopefully building your repertoire while it remixes its challenges, playing on your expectations. there are huge clearings to cross, towers to climb, ceilings and floors to repel, narrow spiked corridors to squeeze through, enemies to chain your airtime, small platforms to caustically land on, expansive hills to slide through, beautiful spirals to loop around. dustforce isn’t just a very personal and unique idea, it’s a masterpiece of level design. I have qualms for the lack of linear pacing, there isn’t a way to know how difficult a level is going to be, but that’s a very small criticism, and the game still builds from easy stages to hard stages, it’s just done in blocks.\n\nplain to say, combat is not dustforce’s strong suit, and it feels relatively forced. so it is with an absolute lack of understanding that there are four small and constrained levels dedicated to fighting masses of around twenty enemies. to compensate for keyboard controls, for better and worse, dustforce ques moves. when platforming, it gives the game a sort of rhythmic and planned feel based on anticipation and expectation. in the heat of combat, it is awkward. you’ll find yourself locked into quick strikes and unable to dodge obvious enemy attacks, which is frustrating and unrewarding.\n\nanother actually affecting flaw is how much singular input influences the character. slight adjustments are impossible. this again compensates for the difficulty to make smalls presses on a keyboard, however it removes from dustforce’s most important aspect: its fluidity. an obvious expression of this is a single block-wide hole with ground on either side of it. pressing right or left will walk over the hole and onto the terrain on the other side. there is no possible way to enter the hole from the ground, you must jump and make the adjustment. yet even if there is slightly more control in the air, it still involves much too large movements, and makes landing on small blocks or falling down in a specific direction imprecise and very much out of your own control, which is somewhat of a deathblow. the hideout is an infamous stage that brings this flaw to light but also serves as a great way to learn how to make the flaw work for you. the keyboard-tailored control is impossible to ignore, and while it is a noble effort, it sadly stains a perfect formula.\n\ndustforce is performance art. the fluidity feels like a dance. the speed feels like superimposed mastery. unlike a rhythm game, there is pure and awesome actualized design depth existing in-addition to the performance. unlike a perfection platformer, dustforce is rarely stressful, instead being meditative, being conductive, being pointed, being beautiful. it doesn’t demand perfection, it encourages it. as dustforce opens up, grows and evolves, so do you as the player. it shows that difficulty can be symbiotic to achieve fully wholesome results. dustforce isn’t do or die. it’s be or don’t be.","February 2, 2014","true","43.9"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","33","35","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019205444/recommended/65300/","76561198019205444","sitebender","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019205444/","1546 products in account","Dustforce is a beautiful, traversal style 2D platformer with a lot of parkour, wall running, ceiling hanging with some light combat. If you're the sort of person that likes exploration and collecting in platformers, Dustforce is right up your dirty alley. First is its beautiful art style that makes it stand out from a heap of other platformers. Then you have a great sense of movement control. You can double jump, dash, run up walls for a brief time, wall jump, cling to a ceiling and move along to it before you ultimately fall off.  You can slide down slopes and Yaba-Daba-Do your way off inclines at the end to launch yourself.\n\nThe game introduces you to all these incredible mechanics via three tutorial levels. One for traversing, another for combat and the third for advanced techniques such as dash jumping into a double jump to run up a wall. I had to return to the advanced techniques 2 hours into the game to complete it. You are never forced to do anything in the game, but there is definitely a need to perfect these skills.\n\nAs a member of dust force, your goal is to clean the world of dirt by touching it. Its easy enough to just run across dirt, making it disappear, but the challenge becomes getting up walls, onto ceilings, and beating the dirt from enemies that gives harmless things a sinister new life. The object of each level is to dust trails of leaves, green glop and other forms of dirt all the way up to defeating a few enemies at the end. There's nothing to differentiate these enemies, one dead end full of enemies might not be the dead end full of enemies you're looking for.\n\nCombat gets relegated to two buttons, a weak attack and strong attack. The strong is only good for larger enemies, because defeating a smaller enemy will only scatter the dirt covering them and you'll still need to clean it. Light attacking enemies in the air gives you an extra jump, so you can double jump, hit an enemy and then jump a third time. As you play, you're also building a meter. When it gets full your character will color trail and pressing both attacks will give an automatic beating to enemies and dirt on screen. Assuming your character will be able to reach them.\n\nThere are a few different types of enemies, big hopping heads, angry bears. There are more mundane hovering types either balls of leaves or gargoyles. Green balls of goo that will punch you back, hovering barrels dumping goo beneath them. Even a sort of porcupine that shoots quills or sharp leaves at you. The biggest threat is spikes that cover large areas in later parts of the game. Each spike death or pit in the Nexus or in a level will respawn you.\n\nWhen going through a level, you don't have to sweep every bit of dust or leaves, but at the end you're graded on your completion and finesse. For everything you clean, enemy or trail of dirt, you build a combo. Finesse gets determined by how high of a combo you score in each level. Getting hit or taking too long to clean something new will break your combo and hurt your finesse grade. Each level is also connected to a global leader board. Getting a "S" rank in a level will give you one of three colored keys (copper, silver and gold) to unlock new levels.\n\nThe problem is you need to find every level in the game via a hub world called the Nexus. This hub world offers. a real sense of exploration and challenge even to get to these level doors. Some doors are clustered in easy to access areas, but others are for more skilled players. You'll need to slide down ramps and vault over pits, or double cling to ceilings to make it across a bed of spikes. There are even areas that you'll need to time jump, dash, jumps to make it through and then do it again. For every path you take in the Nexus, you'll need to make your way back. Its never as simple as doing the same thing a second time. You'll need to figure out a way to do it or take a different route and hope that it circles back. Other doors are completely hidden and you'll need to get into every nook and cranny to find secrets.\n\nIts not like Metroid where you unlock a new ability, getting there relies completely on your skill. After the first two dozen levels, everything gets a lot more difficult. Its this difficulty that some may love, but it hindered my enjoyment of the game. This Nexus is big and it has to be to fit over 70 levels in it.\n\nEach level starts by letting you select from one of four members of Dustforce. They're all color coated with different looks and ways to clean, but they all play the same. No one has any ability over one another. These characters definitely give the game character and charm. An old man wearing green carrying a vacuum, a brunette in purple with pom poms as dusters, a blue clad janitor with a humble broom and a female version with red overalls.\n\nIn fact style summarizes the game as a whole, from the beautiful world with rich backgrounds in a washed out color pallet to the movement and flow of your character. Even the soundtrack has a style that fits the art. Its tranquil synthetic ballads fit perfect into the background of the beautiful cityscape, caves and laboratories.\n\nOutside of the Nexus is a different sort of hub. Its a place that lets you visit the tutorial levels, and even go through previous levels you've beaten. These tomes come in four different books, each for different themes of each level. There's the cityscape, the castle, laboratory and. I'd much prefer flipping through a book to find a level rather than exploring the Nexus, but whatever.\n\nFor anyone creative, there's a level editor that lets you make levels in game as rich and beautiful as you'll find in Dustforce. You can even go online to download levels from your web browser. It seems like an extra step that should just be in the game. These levels all have ratings, difficulties and keywords tagged with them so you can find whatever you have a mind for.\n\nThere's even local multiplayer survival and king of the hill for up to four local players. I didn't test this or anything so I can't review it until I get a party together on my wide screen to play Dustforce.\n\nNow for the bad stuff, by default there is no controller support, but you can rebind the keys to support your controller. The only problem with that is you still need to hit the ESC key to bring up a menu. Having a menu bind would have been nice, but its hardly a big issue. I've managed to get myself stuck outside of the screen and the camera just wouldn't follow me. Are these enough to ruin a game, no certainly not.\n\nWhile this is a beautiful game with a lot of fun mechanics, it just feels needlessly difficult to get to levels. Some may like the exploration to find a level or get to a door they see high up above, but it feels like extra padding. Even with all these mechanics the game still just didn't feel like fun. It felt like a chore to go into a level and touch every place with dirt, dust and leaves. Sure I didn't have to, but if I wanted a key I'd have to. In the later hours of my play through I spent more time just getting to the levels.","April 1, 2015","true","4.0"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","40","47","3","3"

The janitors in Dustforce can jump off walls, run up walls, run up ceilings, and perform multiple double jumps by defeating enemies.  Gameplay consists of mastering the route through a level to sweep up all the dust while continuing one's combo (which can be done by running over dust or hitting enemies) and avoiding spikes, pits, and enemy attacks.  The game employs a ranking system that judges based on completion (how much dust was ran over and how many enemies were defeated) and finesse (how few hits and restarts taken).  This game is perfect for those who go for perfect ranks in modern Sonic titles.\n\nHowever, later levels in the game approach unfair difficulty, spamming spikes and requiring jumps and dashes to be timed down to the millisecond to succeed.

Considering there seems to be a trend for games that confuse challenge with stress and difficulty with laboriousness, this game is kind of a miracle.\nFor starters, it has a learning curve. Yes: an ACTUAL LEARNING CURVE. You have some brief tutorials to help you get the hang of the controls, with are fairly complex and prety tricky to get right, and soon you're in a "nexus" which you can traverse and unlock levels. These levels come in different difficulties, and you hve to beat a certain number of easier levels to get keys and unlock the harder ones.\nAs usual, the controls define about half of the playability and the fun of the game, and they work quite well here. It strikes a balance between fast, fluid, complex and challenging. Yes, it can get annoying and a little innaccurate at times, but those flaws seem to be more due to the natural limitations of keyboard controls rather than the game designers letting them suck deliberately because "that makes it HARD!!!". The only thing that does annoy me is how the gravity works: within a millisecond, you'll switch from "gently floating down" to "plummetting like a stone". I don't think this adds anything to the game.\nThe levels are good, and range from flowing and pleasant to devilishly hard. So far, I've played more than half of the levels, and only one was seriously beyond my skills. The others, at their most difficult, are reasonably doable. Also, you're not expected to simply reach the end of the level: the more dust you clean up, the higher your "Completion" rank goes up, and the higher the combo you get at the end, the higher your "Finesse" rank (it took me ages to understand what that meant). The higher your ranks, the sooner you get keys to unlock the harder levels. Also, if you're really perverted, you can try to improve your time and improve your rank in the scoreboard. If you like speedrunning, you'll have a field day.\nFinally, I really enjoy the art style. The visuals are pretty, cartoony and slightly dreamy. The music is nice, and whomever wrote it did a pretty good job at imitating Tycho. Also, you get to choose from four different characters: the guy in blue, and... er... four others. (another gripe I have is that you have to choose your character EVERY TIME you start a level. Sheesh, why not choose once, at the beginning of the game, and let me change it later if I want to?)\nI'm glad I got this game, and I'm glad for the time I spent on it. I still have quite a lot to play, but I'm already satisfied. Fans of platformers should definitely take notice.","July 24, 2015","true","7.1"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

I had watched a few speedruns on YouTube and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of experience provided by Dustforce DX.\n\nIf you like cleaning, artsy and smooth platforming gameplay, a stellar electronic soundtrack, chaining combos, score attacks, and challenging mechanics, then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are great - the detail in the different levels is very high and well-done. The music and sound effects are awesome, and I will provide a link to the OST here because it is that good; I think the only other game OST I ever linked in my review was NEOTOKYO's.\n\nDustforce DX OST.\n\nThe controls are a bit tricky to learn, but the tutorials are very helpful and will ensure you get a firm grasp on the game's mechanics before you start your janitorial runs. You can try using a controller, but the keyboard bindings work just as well. The learning curve is minimal to moderate - one of the most difficult elements of the game is combining the different actions in order to achieve a smooth run. Combos are also essential for reaching many areas in each level and progressing deeper into the game. For example, you may have to wall run upward, double/wall jump several times, and hit a dustball/enemy at the top in order to reach a higher level (and if you do everything except hitting the object at the top, you will not be able to make the climb). Practising and repeating levels will really hone your skills.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is very quick and technical - chaining the proper actions is critical. Once you can achieve a seamless run, the visual aesthetics are so satisfying and rewarding. The main hub will allow you to access the options and all the levels, however, you must unlock new levels by completing preceding ones. There are a good number of levels available for you to test your skills, and the game offers a lot of time value if you are really into speedruns and 100% completion. During your playthrough, you must complete each level in a set amount of time, while maintaining a smooth (finesse) run. If you can finish the stage within the time limit and maintain a good combo bar, then you will achieve a double S rank (best possible score).\n\nFor the achievement junkies, there is only one to collect, and this requires you to complete every level by performing the most perfect possible run. I really, really love this type of achievement system in a game, and not the stupid, meaningless artificial-game-lengthener types found in games like Lucius (which I will be reviewing soon) - where you need 20 and 40 game hours when the game takes ~10 hours to complete. No, in Dustforce DX there's just one, challenging achievement that involves you spending quite a bit of time refining your skills and experience so you can obtain those perfect runs.\n\nThe game can get a bit repetitive once you've invested a large amount of time, however, the variety in level layout and different enemy types adds lots of playability. There are also different characters with slightly different attributes, allowing for a unique playstyle depending on who you select (ex: one character has quicker drops and longer jump range).\n\nIf you like challenging platformers with an emphasis on finesse and score attacks, then you must give this game a try.\n\nDefinitely recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","November 18, 2014","true","3.6"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","0"

The difficulty ramps up quite a bit as you make your way through each level, and the seemingly simple controls open up to some fantastic speed tech once you learn a few tricks. With a replay system that allows you to watch anyone's play through of a level, you'll want to go back and improve your time trying new techniques you see other players use. It can get quite competitive between you and people on your friends list as you try to one up each other. The music is absolutely glorious. The OST itself is a great buy, definitely have that on rotation in my playlist.

Surely this is a bug...\n\nDustforce is, and most likely will be, my favorite indie game of all time. I've never really even been into speedrunning platformers, but I absolutely loved this game.\n\nThe visuals. They're so simple, and are perfect for this game. It has a lovely look that never gets tiring to look at.\n\nThe flow/feel. Dustforce just feels great to play. Whether it's on keyboard or controller, this game has a flow that feels like you're riding through a musical masterpiece.\n\nThe soundtrack. Naturally, achieving flawless runs is what you aim for in this game, and naturally, it can get frustrating as the difficulty increases. Thanfully lifeformed (the artist) has created the absolutely perfect soundtrack for this game. The calming tunes are insanely catchy, as well as soothing to the soul as you unfortunately realize you missed a piece of dust 20% through that track you've never SS'd.\n\nThe devs. They just seem like awesome people who love making games. They've released their financial information on Dustforce after all it has been through (steam, humble bundle etc), which is a rare thing to do. They also created a level editor and website for people to share! They are currently developing a new game called Spire, which will be an instant purchase for me =]\n\ntl;dr - If you have the tiniest spark of interest after seeing some screenshots or gameplay, buy it and play.

I'm one of the best active players in the game atm, and as you can see that my hours reflect the dedication needed to be among the of the best.\n\nHowever, as a casual game, while the mechanics take some getting used to, they start feeling fluid and cohesive. There are 4 action keys along w/ the arrow keys (I use keyboard), which take a ton of time to get into muscle memory. But as the difficulty increases and the game keeps teaching you different mechanics, the satisfaction from beating a difficult level is immense. The soundtrack, composed by one of the devs of the game, is simple and elegant IDM, creating a calmer atmosphere, even in the middle of spikes.\n\nI'd highly recommend this game to fans of technical platforming and those who enjoy a real challenge and have real patience in gaming. If you want to achieve a really good time, or complete that really difficult level, it'll take a while to get there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Erlog/recommended/65300/","Erlog","Erlog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Erlog/","224 products in account","I do like this game, but I have a lot of trouble recommending it to anyone. The decisions the developer made here seem actively antagonistic to new players. I would have to link the game along with 3-4 different guides just to make sure whoever I recommended it to had a decent chance of enjoying it. If you have all the information it really is quite good. It's just that the game never bothers to give you the information you need in order to enjoy it.\n\nHere are the things wrong with this game.\n\n1) The tutorial is too hard. Instead of spreading the 3 tutorial levels out over time the game requires you to be able to execute even the advanced mechanics right from the beginning. I imagine some casual players may not even be able to complete these 3 tutorial levels. These levels also lack any kind of flow, and so they're also just bad levels in general.\n\n2) The tutorial is too short. The tutorial doesn't explain some very key movement mechanics that are profoundly unintuitive to the point that they are literally the opposite of reality. There's a hidden "charge" system the game never explains that allows you to either dash or jump in mid-air. Not all of the cases where the recharges happen are explained and so the player is left without enough information to even begin to tackle anything past the first 15 courses. The player is forced to look up a guide online or spend a lot of time randomly button mashing in order to progress.\n\n3) The "overworld" is dumb and confusing. Instead of the devs bothering to figure out which order the levels should be in the game has you exploring these 4 zones between the worlds in order to find new levels. Sometimes this requires executing extraordinarily difficult platforming tricks as well as a key obtained from doing really well on previous levels. The layout of this zone is very confusing, and it is very very very very very frustrating having to deal with a dumb mini-game just to get to the next course. The courses are hard enough on their own. I already did well enough on the courses in order to get the key. Just let me pick them from a menu, and don't lock content behind meaningless redundant skill gates you didn't think through properly before you implemented. It's very easy to get stuck.\n\n4) Keys aren't explained. The game doesn't explain adequately how to obtain keys. This leads to being stuck until you look up a guide online that explains how to get more keys.\n\n5) Key colors are difficult to differentiate. I'm a little bit color-blind. The game has like 5 key colors. I can only differentiate between silver and "the rest of them." They bothered to make the key icons look different, but not the locks. So good luck being able to figure out where to take a key you just obtained because a) the lock colors are all very similar and b) you might not even be able to get there due to point #3.\n\n6) Character differences are not explained.  2 of them are quite similar while the other 2 are quite different from all others. It would have been nice to have been told by the game why I should ever choose a different character than the default.\n\nIn conclusion, I do like this game, but don't be afraid to look up guides on how the mechanics of the game work. It's really not fun if you don't do that.\n\nI also want to reiterate again that the entire concept of The Nexus feels very much like the dev fell in love with their own "clever" idea, and never bothered to think through the ramifications of what they were doing. I'm sure it took a lot of time to build and design, but it only ever serves to frustrate and impede player progress to new courses. Just save yourself the trouble and look up a YouTube video that shows how to navigate to all the courses along with a map of door lock colors. You will have a much better time of it.","July 31, 2015","true","61.2"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

It's slick, beautiful, and most importantly the movement feels perfect.\n\nThe gameplay is what you expect it to be - you progress from level to level, attempting to complete it as fast as possible (with global leaderboards on time). Additional depth is added by the inclusion of your broom, used to sweep 'dust' as you run and hit 'enemies' with, building up a combo which you are rated on along with the time. Although initially the game may seem laggy or unresponsive, within a few hours you become accustomed to how the momentum and motion works in the game and begin to understand that the opposite actually holds. The game gives you perfect control, and punishes the tiniest of your mistakes.\n\nThat's really where the beauty lies. The skill ceiling is incredibly high, obvious to see if you watch a speedrun of this game. The game encourages you towards this perfection, and indeed the only achievement in this game is one of completing it - a feat few people (myself not included) have achieved. There's no RNG in the game, it's just you and how you play. This is certainly not for everyone, but for those few who don't like grinding and obtaining perfect muscle memory, the game hits all the right buttons\n\nIt is also worth mentioning the soundtrack. Some games have terrible music. Some games have good music for the game. Some have soundtracks that are amazing standalone, and this is one of them. It's (largely) calm, electronic stuff that's perfect for relaxing or concentrating too. Look it up on youtube - Fastfall by Lifeformed is the album.\n\nFor me, it's one of my favourite games ever, and I haven't even put that much time into it.","September 23, 2014","true","244.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Instead of simply jumping from any ordinary platform to the next, it takes some sort of pseudo-Sonic approach of fast paced, all-surfaces high-octane super-platforming.\n\nLet me be frank: this game is hard. Sure, it does a good job of easing you into it, but this isn't just some casual romp. Be prepared to put all your effort into getting constant SS ranks if you want to explore all the game's content.\n\nThe visuals are pleasing and colorful, just a nice view for the eyes. The music is likewise calm and soothing techno, which is just as well to ease you from the rage that will transpire.\n\nThe game controls butter smooth, and has a lot of depth from a rather simple means of traversing the maps. I did have one complaint about the controls, namely the lack of complete controller support. Most basic buttons are there, except the menu button. I can't even count how many times I've had to restart, and I have to do it all from going to the keyboard to press escape. Is an extra respec option too much to ask for?\nEDIT: Though there is no option to respec the escape menu in the controls, I found that the "instant restart" key in another menu is able to be bound to a controller button, which is quite swell.\n\nAnother complaint I have, though not with the game, is the lack of community attention. When exploring the nexus, it is entirely up to me to find the one bronze door that I still have a key for, and it still eludes me because no one has a nexus map uploaded.\n\nAll said, it's crazily addictive to the right people, namely: twitch-reflex, practice-based skill games that never stop the action.","October 31, 2014","true","15.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Each character has a different "Style" of moving about, not really sure how to describe it, but there is a slightly different feeling between each of the characters.\n\nPlatforming: Not much to say here, you jump from platform to platform, however i will say the platforming isn't very repetitive and just feels right.\n\nParkour: Not Minecraft-Style "parkour", we're talking runing up a wall to jump to the next wall, then jump off of that wall to reach a platform, dash to get speed jump and RUN ON THE CIELING of the next platform to procede to the next section of the level, it's incredible and you feel like a champ for pulling off these stunts.\n\nSpecial Gague: As you progress through each level and clean up dust, a gague at the bottom of the screen will slowly start filling up, once this gague fills completely, you can use a special move. This move is incredibly useful and does not change depending on which character you are (in one way I am glad that that's how it works, however in another way I am slightly dissapointed...) when you activate your special move your character will flash across the screen cleaning up all the dust within a certain radius of the character. It looks very much like a scene from a typical fighting anime show, but it's funny cause it's just them cleaning up dust.\n\nLevel Evaluation System: You are graded on two criteria after completing a level: How much of the dust you clean up in a level (Completion), and how many times your combo meter gets set back to 0 (Finese). S is the highest grade you can reach and D is the lowest (at least I think, it's the lowest I've gotten...). Once completing a level you will be awarded points towards different keys whih will allow you to complete other levels in the game.\n\nEasy Controls: At the begining of the game you are bombarded with lots of information that seems a bit overwhelming at first, however the levels in each area ease you into learning the controls and before you know it, it's like second nature to you and you're pulling off nice fluid parkour tricks.\n\nSemi Open-Environment: Each actual level is actually not connected to another, however, you don't choose the level from the menu, instead you're navigating your character to the next doorway wich will take you to the level. It would be like the old Mega Man X games met Super Metroid. Even the game menu is navigated this way.\n\nOther Features: Hand painted graphics and a really nice "chill out" styled soundtrack. Reminescent of an old Sega Genesis or SNES game.","October 26, 2014","true","44.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This game is hard as hell. Unlike many other precision platformers, Dustforce works on your ability to react to situations quickly, and to excecute button combos correctly, rather than to have pixel-perfect timing with ice physics and infinite wall jumps. If you're a hardcore gamer, you have plenty of challenges awaiting you in this game. If you're more of a casual player, you will enjoy the easier levels and their atmosphere without a doubt. The soundtrack is something to write home about.

It's very pleasant to the eyes and ears, which is something you'll need to soothe the frustration that come from this game's harsh difficulty.\n\nThe gameplay is superb. When most games of the genre give you simple controls and requires you to press them at the exact timing, Dustforce has a vast array of traversal techniques for you to choose from. The game also put more emphasis on momentum. Which is why (outside of the tutorial) the game has 64 levels to train (and test) you about the more complicated techniques.  Even the overworld itself is designed in a way that requires you to perform difficult techniques to reach harder level.\n\nOne last thing, you will want to have the game run at stable 60FPS because any drop in frames can spell doom to your run.","December 18, 2014","true","223.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Instead of just going from point A to point B, here you must travel and clean dust along the levels, while being consistent to not lose your combo. Each level can be beaten "normally", but only by getting SS rank on them you'll unlock keys to be able to unlock harder levels. Speaking of difficulty, the controls are a bit clunky and hard to get used at first, but soon you'll get better at basic movement which will allow you to clear the easy levels, while getting better to beat the normal levels, and with enough practice you'll be able to beat the hard levels. And this progression works well, because when you unlock the hard levels it means that you are ready for them. And once you beat the hard levels, you'll unlock the hardest levels, which are easily harder than Super Meat Boy (even some hard levels are). You'll also fail a lot, but there's some things that will keep you invested: the art and music are great, and a checkpoint system that will allow you to practice sections of a level instead you starting from the beginning every time. There's also 4 characters, and they feel different from each other. Also, the developers keep the leaderboards clean from cheaters, which is something rare. Lastly there are plenty of easter eggs to find, and only one precious achievement, but getting it displays true skill. And there's plenty of custom levels included for extra gameplay.","October 8, 2015","true","58.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","1"

I'm pretty sure that I'm capable but haven't gotten what's called SS score on the last level so I'm technically not even done yet.\nThe level design is amazing and blends perfectly with the soundtrack. And the best part of the game: the leaderboards. Every level (including custom maps) have a leaderboard for the best SS time (cleared everything in the level) and the fastest time just to finish. And every run has intant replay so you can see how the best player does or how the worst player doesn't :P\nMany may compare Dustforce to Super Meat Boy but I would disagree mostly because of the controls but also because of the fact that dustforce has some brawler elements. At first glance you may feel that dustforce has floaty controls where meat boy feels more slick but dustforce's "floaty" controls imo Allows for more precise maneuvering. A thing to mention on controls is that I recommend using a keyboard or a controller with a good D-pad (instantly ruling out 360 controller) like PS3 or 4. You could use analog sticks... but you're gonna have a bad time if you do that.\nSo my honest opinion: The best platformer ever made. A very hard but fair challenge.

It's a speedrunner's dream. The basic moves are simple: run, jump, dash, attack. But  check out what the most talented players can do with them.	 There is a path laid out for you, and it's up to you to decide how to traverse it. Mechanics like dashing at the end of a slope or boosting downward to increase momentum illustrate how the gameplay is meant to be experimented with, and it feels awesome.\n\nWhile I consider those features to be most admirable, my personal favorite part of this game has to be the atmosphere. It is superbly displayed, I think. It's self-aware, but not "I-am-self-aware"-self-aware; there isn't an attempt at a story, there isn't any humor, there isn't even any characterization beyond some subtle win animations (without the internet, the only way we'd even know the names of the characters would be looking through the game's files). It's just the ever-so-video-gamey premise of acrobatic janitors sweepin' up and down the walls, and it's done well. The controls are easy to get used to, the animations are smooth, the environments are beautiful, and the music is soothing, composed by the awesome  Lifeformed [lifeformed.bandcamp.com].\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the awesome community surrounding this game. The subreddit is a pretty active place, and with replays being attached to every rank on every leaderboard, the best way to learn how to get better is by watching and learning from others.\n\nIn short, if you like platformers, you should try it. If you like speedrun-able/"perfect run" type games, definitely try it. If you're a janitor, it just might change your life.","May 26, 2015","true","18.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is essentially a speedrunning game, in which you play an acrobatic broom clad hero (there are four playable characters with varying stats). The goal of each level is to clean as much as possible as fast as possible. Completion and Finesse (which is your cleaning combos) are both graded, and it's oh-so enticing to shoot for an S rank. It's a simple idea, and executed quite well. The movement system is precise and interesting, and all of the levels are designed the system in mind. This creates a really strong gameplay experience which can be missed in a lot of games. The soft visuals and calming tunes create a very warm and pleasant mood.

If you can enjoy the precision and timing involved in such endeavors you won't be disappointed. If you enjoy watching other players' speedruns you won't be disappointed (and in a sense, this is your reward for at least finishing a level).\n\nI think Dustforce stands out in the design more than actual gameplay (you can get a similar challenge from e.g., Super Meat Boy). The game is distilled in the art design, character design, and level design. That's not to say it's sparse, the levels are often beautiful, but there is very little that doesn't directly serve the game. There's very little narrative. There's not a lot of moving parts and gimmicks. It's simply: here's an obstacle course, find the shortest course and execute perfectly (with a few exceptions for arena stages; here's a room full of enemies, flawlessly defeat them).\n\nThe soundtrack to the game is excellent, and one of my all time favorites. Definitely check out the composer's web page.\n\nThis is a game for all ages and abilities. I often play this with my 2.5 year-old son. He likes to watch the colorful characters run around cleaning and making the animals and people happy. In the hubs he will just make the people sweep and jump around and narrate the action. He likes the music, too. Older kids will be able to finish a lot of the levels and have fun doing it. Parents might be interested to know there's next to no violence in single player, since the sweeping "attacks" are really cleaning off the inhabitants of the stages and they are largely greatful for it.\n\nThe biggest drawback to me, is that progression is entirely linked to perfecting skills. Most of you will eventually reach a plateau where you've unlocked every level you can and you're stuck trying endlessly to improve your times and combos on the hardest levels. There's no "grind" to "brute force" your way forward, you either get good or accept defeat. Judging from the global achievement (there's only one) stats, around 90% of players will not unlock the highest levels. Less than 1% have perfected every level. You can't see everything even as just a tourist.\n\nI'm disappointed there isn't a wider set of achievements to build some meta-game around.","December 10, 2013","true","79.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's basically Super Meat Boy with some sort of janitors as main characters. You defeat enemies by slamming them with your broom while running/jumping/gliding/sliding around the level (Meat Boy style !) sweeping the leaves that lay around. You get scored for speed and effectiveness and it's actually extremely difficult. Especially if you want to earn S ranks for every level.\n\nThe thing is... the controls just don't feel right. Controllers aren't automatically recognized and configured so you have to do that yourself. A controller definitely works better than a keyboard, I can tell you that, but if you don't know how to properly set it up it's still really hard to play.\nI did finish Super Meat Boy, but I won't be able to finish this until they succesfully implement controller functionality without the player having to mess around with it.\nController issues aside, this is a great game that just needs to be experienced.\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","March 3, 2012","true","4.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But after about four hours of play time and not one minute of fun I gave up on this game. Here are the reasons for this.\n\nInstead of moving smoothly you kind of "trigger" fixed movement schemes (e.g. pressing right ones makes about two or three steps to the right). Because of this your input does not always have an effect on the movement. This means that precise timing and reactions are less important than pure mezmorizing and in the worst cases playing felt more like a long boring quick time event. Personally I can't stand QTE's.\nIn order to progress you have to collect every single piece (!) of dust in a level. To me this feels like a goal that should clearly be optional. Suppose some Mario game that says: "Oh, you didn't collect every coin in the level. Go back to the beginning." Another problem is that this completely breaks the flow of the gameplay. So instead of going for a quick smooth run you turn around and do backtracking to collect the last pieces of dust. In most levels this acutally seems to be what the level-designers intended.\nIn order to progress to must also make sure that your combo-chain does not break, whichs happen if you didn't collect dust for some time. I think this is supposed to force the player to make a "smooth" run, but it doesn't. The problem is that usually there is dust in so many places that messing it up first try and clumsily turning around is a valid option. I really don't understand what the developers were going for with this. Why is going through a level fast not rewarded in a game that (I think) is basically designed to be a speedrunner-heaven. Also it should be way better indicated when the combo-chain breaks.\nAnother minor complaint is that the tutorial just does not give you enough information to play the game. You have to figure out  the details of the gameplay-mechanics yourself, it is never explained what the finesse-ranking is based on and neither does the game explain that you actually need double-S ranking in order to unlock all levels (which is by the way stupid as (insert insulting word here) anyway).","June 4, 2015","false","4.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It was difficult, but in a way that let me put it down and step away from it, knowing I could always come back at a later date and defeat it. The music was good, but I don't know that I could hum a tune from it right now. The level design was well thought out, but often times only allowed for one method of play.\n\nDustforce takes every one of these (admittedly small) complaints and addresses them: the technical skills required to beat some of the levels that ensure you can't set it down and come back to it without having to remaster things, the decision to design the game from the get-go with speed-running in mind, and a soundtrack that is as catchy as it is lovely...the list goes on and on.\n\nWithout gushing on for too long about it, I recommend Dustforce as highly as I can recommend anything, provided that you know what you want in a platformer. This game will be hard and it will be unforgiving, assuming you attempt to play it at the highest level. The level design will keep pulling you back in, making you wonder if you could have shaved off a second or two by doing this loop slightly differently. The technical skill required will make you consider purchasing a keyboard that actually works (Apple keyboards are now my chief complaint with Apple computers). In short, if mountains were video games, Everest almost compares to Dustforce.","November 29, 2013","true","216.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Don't be turned off by that description, for each of the 4 characters you can choose from has special abilities that make them able to clean in no way seen before. You are more like a ninja than a cleaner, and you can dart through levels creating combos as you clean dust and fight off enemies to clear the level. You earn points for how well you do, which eventually unlocks keys to more rooms, etc.\n\nIn order to unlock every level though, you must eventually complete each level by cleaning every speck of dust without breaking your combo. The combo window is long enough to allow you to use differing forms of strategy, but just short enough to induce high levels of muscle tension when you are trying to keep it going over long distances. This can easily be the biggest turn off of the game, and the level of perfection required to fully beat the game is astounding when you reach the veteran levels. Some may find that frustrating and too much of a roadblock, which is understandable. On the other hand (I have never beaten all the levels, and never will) Dustforce has enough content to provide a fun playthrough to suit the difficulty level you wish to attain. More of a casual player? You have plenty of levels that are loads of fun to play. Looking for a challenge after getting the basics? Dustforce provides a good set of intermediate levels, all the way up to insanely hard.\n\nThe controls feel great, the characters move fluidly, and no 2 levels are the same. Each character can provide a different strategy, and some are much more usefel than others on specific levels. The game provides the opportunity to watch the playthroughs of any player who has completed a level, meaning that you can learn some good strategies from some very good players.\n\nEspecially for only a few bucks, Dustforce is a great game that shouldn't be missed if you like platformers.","July 6, 2014","true","39.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morelikestinker/recommended/65300/","morelikestinker","Tinker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morelikestinker/","243 products in account","I enjoy video games. I like the thrill of shooting monsters and solving sliding puzzles, I relish exploring the world and having adventures in it, I love seeing my cities and theme parks grow because I made them just so. Crawling through dungeons, directing your minions strategically to best your foe, sneaking around conspiracy theory-laden faculties – video games are a rich medium with terrific entries in all kinds of experience. And even though I don’t particularly enjoy role-playing games, I can see why it’s pleasing to build and personalize a character of your making and vanquish your enemies. Even in a world with such a varied library of enterprises, there’s a single holy grail for me: finesse.\n\nLet’s use my favorite game of 2012, Dustforce, to illustrate. Dustforce is a platformer made Hitbox Team, a group of four people. It stars four janitors (the eponymous “Dustforce”) who are put up against stages filled with leaves, rubbish, slime, and other waste that they can aptly clean up by swinging their broom (which involves walking over it). They’re not your average grumpy, unshaven, high school brutes though – they’re agile acrobats who can climb walls, hang on ceilings and traverse the most dangerous of environments. However, it’s not the dangerous environments that are the main objective of the game (though they will certainly test you, especially later), it’s finishing the stages completely clean – and herein lies the game’s greatest strength. The game measures two things, and rates you, at the end of the stage, accordingly: completion and finesse. Completion is the percentage of dust you cleaned up and enemies you defeated. Finesse is how often you lost your combo, preferably never – it’s a meter at the bottom of the screen that tracks how long it has been since you last dutifully scraped the last specks off the floor, and you lose it after a given amount of time. These two combined make for a drive to hone your abilities and learn every stage so that you sweep through it both smoothly and flawlessly.\n\nThe levels themselves are created in such a way that doing it right will give you a great flow through it, never really slowing down or losing a beat, making for a great sense of satisfaction when you finish them thoroughly. Not only that, but the stages gently go from very easy but enjoyable to an excruciating but very gratifying hard. If you happen to run into the later stages when you’re still a rookie cleaner, they will seem daunting to you, almost impossible. When you come back later, however, you suddenly realize how it’s done, and after a few runs, you will be able to beat that which looked to be so insurmountable to you earlier. It’s this “I can’t believe I did that” feeling, this ascendancy, that is so bliss. And it’s never because you upgraded your fanciful armor at a merchant, or upgraded your cannon with gems, it’s just you. You, physically, became more dexterous and skilled at this game. Your character didn’t gain any new abilities, he didn’t become stronger, you did. The realization of this is an amazing feeling, because it’s so fair – you put time into this, and you reaped the benefits by knocking out the obstacles in ways you earlier never thought possible.\n\nReinforcing this sentiment, in Dustforce, is the sleek graphic style, emphasizing the player’s action through a simple, but well animated, cel shaded style which make the janitors a joy to look at while they bounce through the environment. These environments, too, look great – while clearly being what they are (a city, a mountainous forest, a laboratory, and a crumbling mansion) they are presented in stylish, sometimes almost surreal ways, making for an aestethically pleasing journey through them. Also accompanying these is a terrific soundtrack, which never gets monotonous or annoying, even if you spend hours perfecting those later levels. It’s these elements that make mastering Dustforce a real joy, and here’s hoping many more follow its ways.","January 21, 2012","true","709.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will need to dedicate some time to mastering the gameplay, and acquire the skills nessecary to complete it. The control is unreal for me even better than Super Meat Boy's which is insane, because I thought Super Meat Boy's control was absolutely perfect this just pushes the limits of polished controls. This is what difficult platformers should be where you learn by playing one level later get to a more advanced one, and can already feel and percieve what you need to do to accomplish the tasks at hand. It has four different characters each with their own unique playstyle and feel. It's just such a rewarding experience to learn how to pick up every piece of garbage, defeat every foe, and keep your combo up in each level and perfect them bringing you one step closer to completing the game.

Well, providing you're any good at it.\n\nI'm not very good at Dustforce, but I still enjoy it a lot. I'm pretty clumsy with both a keyboard or a controller, I'm fairly certain the input doesn't matter, a skilled player can dance through the levels whilst a clumsier player like myself will find multiple ways to blame the controller whilst really it's the player at fault.\n\nCompleting a level isn't good enough, you have to go over and over, to get that S / S rating, shaving off seconds, perfecting a route, figuring the perfect peaceful and flowing pattern that will earn you a perfect and you can move on. Practice makes perfect.\n\nThe animations are beautiful and smooth, matching the gameplay style and giving everything a wonderful flow. The soundtrack is amazing, helping your mind hit that half-focused, half-zen-like concentration zone.\n\nI'll never complete Dustforce, I'll never get S / S on many of the levels, I'm not even good enough to even GET to many of the levels in the hub world (they're hidden away out of reach, requiring a certain precision and timing of skills to climb to them)... But I still enjoyed the game, and I'd recommend it to others... It's a fun way to spend a couple of hours. Providing you're not going in for 100% completion, anyway.

I hate it, but I love it.\n\nYou’re part of the Dustforce, charged with ridding the world from… dust! Go figure, right? I had my reservations about it at first, but as it turns out, it’s a really fun platformer game. The gameplay is simple (and the keyboard controls are simple, too), yet at the same time, complicated. You clean this dust by simply touching it or smacking dusty creatures. You have jumps, double jumps, dashes, normal hit, hard hit, and a few wall and ceiling grabbing skills depending on key combinations used. This requires plenty of skills, because while you’re essentially only using like 3-4 buttons at most, you have to do so in a specific order with a specific timing in order to reach certain ledges/floors/areas. And this, my friends, is where it gets difficult.\n\nThe levels are progressively difficult, requiring you to hone your button-pressing order/timing skills in order to complete them. While you don’t have to mop away every single trace of dust, you -are- graded at the end according to your performance, and you will need the keys awarded from this to unlock certain levels. The better you do, the easier to unlock those levels. There’s only one achievement for the game (which made me lol a little).\n\nThe graphics are very nice and simple, they make the game stand out and seem pretty unique, and I really loved it. The character moves around the screen with pretty amazing fluidity, and I just love to see them dash and jump and double jump, and do all kinds of parkour-y things.\n\nDustforce also has a level editor for you to play around in and fiddle to your heart’s content, and you’re able to share your levels with other users.\n\nIf you’re a fan of platformers and/or difficult games, I really recommend it!\nIf you’re not, steer clear, it’s bound to drive you insane!","August 23, 2015","true","5.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Precise timing and perfect execution are required to progress to the difficult levels.  If you want a casual platforming game look elsewhere, because this is for the people who want to punish themselves with retry after retry to get that "perfect" run.  It's frustrating at times, but just making it through one of the later levels feels like an accomplishment in itself.  First runs through levels are like platforming puzzles, and it's really fun to see the creative skills you learn to get through the more difficult sections.\n\nThere is something else here though, and I can't recommend this game without mentioning it.  This game has such a great flow to it that, along with the sweet soundtrack, put me in such a mood that hours in this game, even if those hours are re-dos all on one level, are super enjoyable.

It feels, looks, and sounds extremely smooth and pleasent.  It's a score chase of sorts, where you can race for the best time, but I feel like I'm always trying to get the smoothest run possible, not the fastest time.  It's incredible in that you can fail over and over again and yet not feel frustrated.  And when you finally succed, you are rewarded by feeling completely amazing about a run you just made that never had any mistakes and looked super grateful.\n\nOf all the platformers I've played, I like Dustforce the most.  The music is absolutely perfect, the gameplay is extremely solid and consistent, and graphics are beautiful.  It also has multiplayer and a level editor!\n\nThe replayability is great too, because sometimes you just want to go back to old maps and perform them smoother than you could before.

It is about cleaning in the way a badass would do it.( I mean look at some of the videos of this game, that in some epic stuff). This game is about cleaning a bunch of stuff in a fast and effective way. You are basically playing this game in order to complete each stage as fast as humanly possible in order to get a spot on the leaderboards. This game is very fun but because I have no multitasking skills, this is a game that I will play for 20 minutes at a time, then ragequit because I can't get a spot on the leaderboards. (or atleast the top 100.) If you have a low patience thing going on like me, then you might want to skip this game but if you are ok with ragequitting like every hour than go for it. If I were to break my computer playing any game, it would probably be this one.

The (customizable) controls are limited in number so as not to be overwhelming, yet despite this the character actions, including inventive combos, are fun and enjoyable to watch. I absolutely LOVE the overall design/style of the game -- simple shapes, visually engaging worlds, and cool graphics -- and the soundtrack alone is worth the price tag (seriously, I'd be content with just listening to the soundtrack for hours; music can be a make-or-break deal for me in a game, and this one certainly delivers). My only complaint is that it's a *bit* difficult sometimes getting on ledges because of how the up button/control works in conjuction with jump, but that's a minor, more personal, issue. If anything, it makes the game more challenging, which is welcome in itself. For just $10.00, this thing is freakin' awesome.

It's not very hard to get through a level on it's own typically but what you're really after is to get a S rank for both mainting a long combo and getting every piece of trash. As long as your attacking something or cleaning something you can maintain the combo but if you fail and lose it then you probably won't get that S rank.\n\nThere's 4 different areas; a  forest, mansion, city and a labratory. They all have the same rules at play but some have a few different things between them. Initally you only have access to levels that don't have a key required but then you'll have levels that require a bronze, silver or gold key So you have to keep doing well to get to the harder levels. There are some techniques to learn to help you go through levels.\n\nThe music is wonderful and varied. I would highly recommend getting the soundtrack.  The calm nature of it helps reduce frustration of failure. It also helps that the graphics are nice to look at and that you can retry a level very quickly.\n\nI'm not especially good at this game but I really enjoy it. But I think if you're into speed running, getting that perfect score and wanting to retry a level to get that score over again then I think you'll get a lot out of it.","October 16, 2012","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Leaves, dust and slime all coat the floors, walls and ceilings of each level and it’s your job to sweep, dust or vacuum it all away.  To do so requires precise, difficult control and levels are designed to be completed with finesse.  The game shines in its difficulty which drives the player to finish each level as quickly and elegantly as possible, striving for an elusive SS Rank.\n\nDustforce is not a game without some fault, however.  The controller support is limited, requiring some menu fidgeting to get it to work and the d-input controls override the keyboard inputs.  The game also doesn’t do a great job of guiding the player or setting a level curve, despite the door and key mechanic for some of the harder levels.  But really, those are minor gripes.\n\nDespite its minor flaws, I’ve really been enjoying this game.  The beautiful visuals and vibrant music have quite a grip on me.  The animation uses a lot of fluid animation smears and the the music presents a feeling of adventure without being over the top.  It’s very relaxing, which can be very important when dealing with a particularly difficult run.\n\nOne of the better mechanics also lies in the replay mechanic.  When looking at the leaderboard, simply click on any of the camera icons (including the one by your own run) to view a replay of that run in its entirety.  This is a cool way to see how your friends compare, how you can improve your own run and what the top players are doing to get such good runs.\n\nIn the end, this game is fantastic, and somewhat reminiscent of something like N+ or perhaps even Super Meat Boy.  If you’re into that sort of tough platforming, Dustforce is worth your time and money.  And buy the soundtrack edition; it’ll save you a step later.\n","November 26, 2013","true","10.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I suspect the developers got tired and simply published it before it was perfect, and then they never went back and fixed some of the issues mentioned below.\n\nThis is a platformer game which desperately needs controller support, but has none. You must manually configure each button in the game options, and even after you do, you can't bring up the options menu, and then you can't use the keyboard to navigate the menu. This means you still must use the keyboard to control the game, even if you want to use a controller.\n\nWant to restore the default buttons? There is no way to do it. Hope you wrote it down beforehand.\n\nThe game is missing a story or background. It's obvious that there are four antagonists to go along with the four protagonist characters, but outside of multiplayer, you can't play them. I suspect these boss fights were simply left out of the game.\n\nMultiplayer is a joke.\n\n","September 23, 2014","true","50.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have gotten to exactly one of the third tier levels, and couldn't manage to get back to where I was afterwards.\n\nAt a glance, it's a great concept, you speedrun levels while dealing with all the cleaning hotspots and keeping a combo going from start to finish if you want to S-rank it. In practice, unfortunately, I find myself wrestling with the controls twice as much as the level design. Entirely too often I'm kicking off of a wall when I was attempting to do a double-jump, clinging to the ceiling when I was trying to do a dash-jump, or dealing with the bizarre inertia that makes it impossible to just nudge yourself a half-inch in any direction when trying to set up for some precision platforming or just attempt that double-jump from a little farther away from the wall so I don't do a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wall jump by mistake again.\n\nStill recommended, but eh.\n\nIt does come with a level editor at least.","June 20, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sanjoken/recommended/65300/","Sanjoken","Sanjoken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sanjoken/","378 products in account","Dustforce is a beautiful platformer with a very high skill cap. The premise of the game is to sweep each level while never letting your combo drop; which occurs when you have not swept up any dust after a set period of time. A flawless continuous sweep gives you a 'perfect' rating, which can unlock keys which you can use to enter more difficult levels. This is not necessary to enjoy the game, though, as many levels are available without unlocks and community made levels are plentiful and just as enjoyable. You can complete levels without perfecting them, though this gives you a worse rating and no key. Earning a perfect rating on difficult levels is really a challenge as the mechanics in Dustforce take hours, maybe even days of playtime to perfect.\n\nThe game contains a leaderboard where you can watch replays of the best times to get a feel for how to perfect a level and different paths to take. Only a small handful of players have perfected every level, and I am not one of them. The challenge does not take away from the game, though, it is still a fantastic game with gorgeous visuals and a calming and beautiful soundtrack that I have listened to for nearly 3 years now. I highly suggest picking up Dustforce if you are a fan of difficult platformers and want a real challenge fit for a perfectionist.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful art style and soundtrack, both go great together.\n-Difficult but rewarding controls and mechanics.\n-Tons of levels varying in difficulty.\n-Map editor and thousands of custom made levels from the community to keep you busy.\n-Leaderboard with a replay system which helps on more difficult levels.\n-4 different characters with their own slight differences.\n\nCons:\n-Some advanced mechanics are not taught in game and are to be learned via the replay system or fanmade tutorials on youtube.\n-Multiplayer mode is local only (I have never touched it).\n-Some of the most difficult levels are possibly too hard and require a lot of time to figure out and perfect (may not be a downside to some).\n\nOverall I'd I give it an 8/10. Also I suggest using a controller when playing, though this is personal preference.","November 12, 2014","true","37.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The levels have some nice flow to them and the concept is somewhat unique.  You don't just run and jump from A to B you glide, fly, and sweep up dust in style from A to B.  Being a fan of solid platforming action I give this title a 9/10.\n\nThat being said I have heard criticism that the game demands perfection in order to continue unlocking levels and while this is somewhat true I have this to say: If you can't get an A or S rating on early levels there is no way you will even have fun on later levels.  The game eases into increadably difficult from fairly easy and the way it ensures you are up to the task is by only unlocking levels once you have cleared a previous level in style.  The goal isn't to get to the end but rather getting to the end in style.","November 23, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everything feels intentional and like meticulous thought was put into it, this caries over into how you learn to play the game as well.\n\nIn the Dustforce you progress in an spawling overworld by beating levels, gaining keys and subsequently unlocking harder levels. In reality you progress by obsessing over every fraction of a second you could have done better in order to get higher on the leaderboards. You can watch replays others playthroughs of the levels, which is a great resource for new players and works splendidly within game.\n\nYou can play as 4 characters with slightly different traits, which really wont matter initially for the casual player but can make all the difference once you are acquainted with the game and aim to shoot hundreths of a second off your speed run.\n\nThe controls felt a bit loose (or more floaty) to me persoanlly, having just finished playing several other platformers, but it was easy to adjust to and may have just been me. You have an insane amount of mobility and the levels are designed to show this off, letting you fluidly slide around walls, ceiling floors, and lay down some beatdown on enemies when they show up.\n\nThe music is mostly mellow and slow and almost seems contrary to the pressure of trying to perfect your run. It does a nice job at keep you calm after several trails on the same level.\n\nLocal Multiplayer works well and is fun to play, and is a wonderful addition.\n\nThe animations and style of the game look great, just look at dem screen shots above.","December 9, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epeternally/recommended/65300/","epeternally","Princess","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epeternally/","2703 products in account","Dustforce's biggest strength is it's movement system, which has a lot of great ideas for giving the player fluid ways to move throughout the world. Unfortunately that is also the game's biggest weakness. The idea of a precision platformer is that through repetition one can learn and ultimately become very skilled at progressing through the game, mastering the exact series of maneuvers required to get through a set of obstacles that initially seemed near impossible. Dustforce ultimately fails its precision platformer aspirations because it's movement system is simply too unreliable. The same seeming sequence of maneuvers will not consistently produce the same results, making the game frustrating, and the player's progression through the level isn't nearly as flowing as it should be.\n\nIt's hard to place what is off about Dustforce, but on some level it just doesn't feel right, it doesn't click in the way that a great precision platformer like Super Meat Boy or a speedrun platformer like Mikey Shorts do. The latter manages to have more precise controls on a touch screen than Dustforce is able to achieve with traditional controls. On top of that, there's a number of other smaller issues with the game. Levels tend to be either too short or too long, with only about one in ten hitting that sweet spot. The music is dull and doesn't fit with the fast pace of the game, which I think is a contributing factor in it not feeling 'right'. While basic controls can be rebound, you can't rebind the menu or restart functions to a controller, meaning that if you're playing with one you will still need to have a keyboard nearby. Dustforce isn't terrible, and it certainly isn't the worst game on Steam, but it's hard to recommend a game that so consistently fails to live up to it's potential at every possible turn. It's pretty to look at, but the lack of solid flow and polish kills the deal. Not recommended.","November 18, 2014","false","5.1"," 25 of 51 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","25","51","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabrecat/recommended/65300/","sabrecat","SabreCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabrecat/","166 products in account","UPDATE: I've returned to the game to earn its Steam cards, trying the DX release. My impression this time around is more favorable: they seem to have eased the difficulty curve, with a wider variety of levels available at the outset. Maybe I'm just better at it this time around, but the combo system seems more forgiving, too. My overall rating is still "not recommended for most people," but it's definitely been improved since I played before.\n\n---\n\nI obtained Dustforce as part of a Humble Bundle, and it turned out to be one of the weakest entries of the set. Having enjoyed Super Meat Boy, I thought taking on another challenging speed/flow platformer would be good fun, but Dustforce didn't measure up.\n\nIn premise, Dustforce seemed like a lot of fun. Ninja janitors! Fighting-game style uppercuts and kicks, used to navigate hazards and literally clean house! Some lovely sprite work and a fantastic soundtrack enticed me to give it a go.\n\nUnfortunately, Dustforce turns out to be one of those games where only the hardest of the hard core need apply, and no lesser player has any hope of wringing some entertainment from this sharp, unforgiving stone of a title. Unless you master the moves immediately (perhaps by some years' experience playing Street Fighter on the competitive scene?), you will fail constantly, progressing to the end of even the earliest levels only by determination and brute repetition. That in and of itself is not irredeemable--that's part and parcel of SMB's shtick, after all. However, the insult to injury is that speedrunning is mandatory. You cannot barely squeak out a level completion and advance in the game; you *must* achieve a ranking score in speed and thoroughness in order to earn keys to open additional levels. If you don't, well, enjoy replaying the first world a lot, because that's all you'll get to see.\n\nThere is something to be said for defying the predominant game design pattern of "if you just play long enough, no matter your skill, you will win." And no doubt a truly elite button-pusher would revel in it here. But if you don't consider yourself such a chest-thumping master, you would do well to give this game a pass.","June 25, 2015","false","5.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Let's start with all the things this game does right, though:\n\n-Cool theme/graphical style\n-Fun characters (all functionally identical, but visually distinct)\n-Pleasant music\n\nSo what's wrong with Dustforce? It's hard to put into words, as the vocabulary for platform video game reviewing is still in its infancy and words like "floaty", "mushy", "heavy", "satisfying" and so on are all very subjective. If I was forced to put it into words, I'd say that your character is too heavy, yet doesn't have enough inertia - it takes a while to get up to speed, and it's very easy to lose that momentum with the way that levels are designed. It's fairly fluid when you play perfectly, but it falls apart in the hands of an inexpert player.\n\nWhat else?\n\nThe overworld is directionless and confusing. There are no (threatening) enemies, so this is purely platforming for the sake of platforming. Rarely are you directly challenged - the game is clearly designed for speedrun enthusiasts.\n\nHere in the modern era of gaming, you have tons of options if you're looking to run and jump on some platforms. If I were you, I'd be cautious about this one. Check out Super Meat Boy instead.","December 21, 2014","false","3.3"," 26 of 54 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","26","54","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetankbuster/recommended/65300/","thetankbuster","JakeTheSnake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetankbuster/","78 products in account","When I first found out about the crew of Dustforce and their follies in amateur game development, I became very anxious to play this game and to support them. However, playing the actual game has shown me that good intentions do not necessarily translate into a full experience.\n\nI think that Dustforce's biggest problem is how it defines 'skill' and 'difficulty'. Dustforce has very little in the way of rewarding a player, only giving out keys which are used to unlock a handful of harder levels. When most of the game's content is unlocked from the start, the player's only remaining motivation is the scoreboard. When one takes a cursory glance at said scoreboard, one notices very long strings of players who complete the level in virtually the same amount of time, give or take a fraction of a second. Not only that, but the requirement of sweeping all dust in a level for a perfect score causes every level, regardless of size, to develop a 'one true path' that sacrifices exploration and player experience for the sake of a higher score. This makes the game extremely tedious to play, boiling itself down to memorization of a level and restarting the level at the slightest mishap.\n\nI'm aware that the game is designed with the speedrunning community in mind, but one reason as to why speedrunning is so highly valued in those circles is the fact that speedrunners interpret a game in a different manner than the developers, and play it at a much faster speed than intended, entertaining others who are only familiar with a more down-to-earth means of beating the game. Meanwhile, Dustforce's design mentality is rigidly geared towards beating the levels as fast as possible, causing the practice of speedrunning to be rendered pedestrian, and therefore moot.\n\nAside from the core gameplay, which is admittedly quite interesting despite its flawed implementation, there is honestly not much else to say about Dustforce. I did like how the game's various sprites were traditionally animated, but the artstyle itself is so minimalistic that the subtlties and quirks that normally come with such techniques are lost. The music on its own is good, but not exciting or emotional, causing it to simply blend into the background, when music should enhance the player's experience by being memorable or unique.\n\nWhen looking at Hitbox Team's upcoming Spire, I'm glad to see that the team is taking more consideration to the skill of the individual and motivating the individual to get better in order to progress further. Hopefully, it'll make for a more rewarding and engaging experience than Dustforce, which, in my opinion, feels like more of a chore than actual dusting.","November 27, 2014","false","2.1"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/essidus/recommended/65300/","essidus","Nyanta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/essidus/","618 products in account","Dustforce is an interesting little side-scrolling platformer where you play as one of four (approximately equal) characters to literally clean up various levels. To me, this game is a lot like Sonic the Hedgehog with smaller levels and more specific goals. All you really need to do is get to the end of the level and clean the 'boss'. However, to progress you need to meet certain goals: % of the level cleaned and point value, which you get by maintaining a combo for as long as possible.\n\nThe graphics are interesting but nothing terribly special- I think it could be best described as artistically minimal. The audio is there, but neither good nor bad. The story... well, a game like this doesn't really need much of a story.\n\nMechanically the game is pretty solid. There are times when it feels like the controls aren't as tight as they could be, and the objective-based advancement means you find yourself doing many iterations of the same frustrating levels. The game does have controller support, but you'll have to do a lot of rigging to make it work right.\n\nIts an interesting challenge game, but lacks a certain something. It doesn't make it bad, just... not something I play at for long periods. This indie title is still worth playing though, so consider picking it up if it happens to be on sale.\n\nIf you found this review useful, please have a look at my other reviews.[/url]","November 25, 2013","true","5.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

They say never judge a book by it's cover. Well, never judge a video game by it's screenshots. For this game appeared to have it all, but managed to fall short. Let me start out by saying that I loved the art style though, along with the soundtrack. In fact, the soundtrack is probably the best part about 'Dustforce' and is exactly what you want in a platformer. As for the controls, they are nowhere near as bad as some of the people on here make them out to be, and personally I found them to be quite good. The only thing that stinks is how they make you assign the controller buttons yourself, as opposed to just having them preset for you. I wouldn't even dream of using a keyboard to play this game.\n\nAs you may already know, this game was made with speedrunning in mind. Speedrunning is something I enjoy watching, but not performing, and had I known that beforehand, I would have skipped this game entirely. I mean, who makes a game specifically tailored for speedruns? Getting to the end of a level as quickly as possible? Where's the fun in that? No, I like to take my time, look around, really take in my surroundings. And besides, isn't the whole fun in speedrunning, coming up with the fastest method on your own? It just doesn't make much sense if you ask me. Aside from that, there's pretty much nothing else to do in this game but run from door to door playing level after level for the best time. No bosses, no enemies, just jumping from one platform to another, climbing wall after wall, sweeping up that dirty dust.\n\nThere just doesn't feel like much of a reason to continue playing 'Dustforce' after an hour or two, unless you care about posting the highest scores for all to see. Which is basically where 99% of the incentive to continue playing comes from; the highest possible score. On the other hand, I can definitely see how people enjoy playing this game. Like I said, the soundtrack is great, the art style although simplistic, works quite well, and the controls are pretty good.","January 6, 2015","false","2.0"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

The whole game is not about completing a challenging level, no there are no challenging levels when it comes to completing, no its about making highscores and comparing with the people around the world. Almost every level is accessable at the start, you just gather some easy taken keys and unlock all other levels. A level is completed under 1 minute. The real thing begins with doing a level over and over again until you know every jump inside out. This is a challenging task, but repeating the same thing over and over again is more like work than fun for me. Therefore I cannot recommend this game, unfortunately. I hoped for a cool game, because it had much potential imo.","March 11","false","0.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I really enjoyed watching speedruns of Dustforce. I had high hopes that I'd be able to do the same stunts that several of the top players displayed in various playthroughs. Unfortunately, this game has ultimately taught me the difference between watching videos of Dustforce and physically playing Dustforce.\n\n+Pros: Beautiful music (very relaxing!) and art. Fun to watch. Competitive for the speedrunning community. High replay value*\n-Cons: Stiff controls, hard to master even after brushing and practicing the tutorial several times, confusing hub world, definitely not worth the $9.99 price tag.\n\nSummary:\nWhile the gameplay looks impressive, the controls are extremely stiff and difficult to master (actions like jumping are delayed once the button is pressed, not immediate). After the tutorial, you'll have to perform the actions you just learned to enter a door that leads to a hub world; this took me a bunch of tries (I just wanted to play the game already!). There's no sense of direction in this hub world; I found myself entering harder levels earlier just because I was wandering around aimlessly. Without a sense of direction (especially on a first playthrough), casual players will find the difficulty going all over the place rather than easier--->harder levels. With an insanely steep learning curve and a non-linear flow of gameplay, I don't feel enticed to explore this game further after 5+ hours of trying to work with the game's mechanics.\n\n*Because Dustforce drives players to complete levels as fast as possible, much of the core gameplay revolves around beating your personal best time. I've had some experience with speedrunning games and personally, I can't find enjoyment from trying to beat my times if I cannot enjoy the controls and core mechanics of the game first. Dustforce isn't something I can recommend to anyone unless they find entertainment in learning every inch of mechanic possible in this game through countless repitition and muscle memory","July 31, 2015","false","5.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Nothing.\n\nThe soundtrack is a unique, atmospheric montage of skillfully crafted musical sounds. The gameplay is flawless and exciting, and can be quite the challenge to those who think they've seen all the game has to offer! With an intricate overworld, gorgeous scenery, and riveting gameplay, this is a must-have game for anyone who enjoys platformers or video games in general.\n\nThere are hidden spots in every level where you can sit and enjoy the scenery for as long as you like, all while relaxing to the fabulous soundtrack. There are hidden secrets which add to the game's depth as you struggle to find at least one in every level of every one of the four worlds. For an indie game, it does everything right.\n\nThe controls are responsive and they will not miss an input unless you put in a dash while you're in the air (as that won't happen on any game anyways). Each level is better than the last, and there's a Tome of Levels for you to visit your favorites if you choose not to run through the overworld to get to it. Please play it with a controller, as keyboard takes getting used to.\n\nAll in all, this game is wonderful. For me personally not worth 10 bucks or whatever it goes for, but you can get it every few months in a bundle for a dollar with some other games, so there's always that.\n","October 26, 2014","true","5.0"," 19 of 43 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","19","43","2","7"

Again, there is no small movement in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/65300/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Was excited to try the game, and then thurougly let down. It is an interesting (albeit kinda boring) idea you just sweep everything up. There is not story whatsoever (meh). Music seems fine. Then the problems happen. The game requires all these tricky movements and long fluid combos, but the controls and mechanics and super finnicky, inconsistent and dont work half the time. Sometimes I will be able to jump after a wall-run, while other times I won't. Sometimes I will only get a single jump and sometimes I will get a double jump. It seems stupid to me you can't double jump, wall run, and double jump again. The wall running and ceiling running is the worst crime. Sometimes I will be able to run up a wall, and other times I will hold against it and my gun will just run a tiny bit or won't even start a wallrun. One part to get to a new area my guy runs up and then on the ceiling, then just stops for no reason. I try to jump to the next area and hold over because the ledge is right there, but he just won't react to any buttons and falls down. This makes no sense. Sometimes you can run on the ceiling and then around on to the wall, and other times it won't. It just seems the people want to game to be more fluid, but the controls aren't consistent enough. The movements are also floaty and you will try to jump next to something and overshoot it or you will try to double jump next to a wall and instead it will make you run up it.\n\nSame goes with hitting, which you can hit up, but at and angle. Countless times I would be next to a guy and hit, only to go through him because I was TOO CLOSE and I wasn't at the perfect spot where the end of my broom ended exactly on his body, but thats like saying you can't hit someone with a sword because they aren't at the tip......I still hit him with the rest of my broom it should count. Very questionable hit recognition. Then there is the level design. Instead of making the levels easy to get to, like the level book, you can only look at them and replay unlocked ones, which seems dumb, because I'd rather be able to play the ones I haven't yet. Instead there is this open map with tons of different platforms and branching paths, and I am supposed to find every unlockable level by exploring....what this does is make me wonder if I have missed levels, and the only way to find out is to backtrack and try to make sense of things. Why not have the levels you created that you want people to play accessible, not in a convoluted area where people can easily miss them. Then there are levels and are like impossible to get it. I went through and played all the levels that seemed accessible and apparent how to get to them, and I know there are more but have no clue how to get to them, and then other parts I am wondering if there are other ways to get to. This shouldn't be that way this early to leave this many levels on the table like that. I don't understand why they would add the monotony of walking from door to door and retracing steps and trying to figure out how to get to this impossible looking spot, just to play the levels of a platformer, it seems counterintuitive to me. Why waste time with boring things when we just want to get to the good parts.\n\nAlso they say controller support, but it doesn't automatically detect it, and you have to manually reset all of the buttons, and even then you can't use just the controller, because you can't program start to pause or use the controller on the menus very well....for a platformer thats a mistake by them.\n\nAnd i know there are people on here that are tryhards that are like "I don't have any of these problems" and "you're just bad" but the fact is I'm not, I've played tons of platformers. I recently played a game called freedom fall that had tight controls and I had no problems with. The people that I mentioned above that will say those things, put like 70 hours into the game, and it shouldn't take that long to try and get consistency out of movement controls, they shouldn't take that much repetition and effort to figure them out, they should be obvious. I have played other games that do wall-running, air juggling, and sliding, better than this. Also there is the keys and the scores. I mentioned in my "AAAAA for awesome" that scores are cool for the tryhards like the ones that want to SS everything and spend 20 hours on 20 levels, but you shouldn't force that. I shouldn't have to get certain preset scores to unlock more levels by getting keys based on my score. Just let me play the levels you created. I do like how they included level editor, multiplayer, and the community maps, although those are just a lot of dumb ones with all spikes created by tryhards that want you to be perfect with moves and have spent 60 hours like them, so I wasn't impressed with some of the creations. 4.5/10.","March 26, 2015","false","3.4"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

It seems very very hit and miss even if you KNOW what to do and press the right controls and combos.

If you can learn to play it, then I imagine ti would be an awesome game.\n\nThe learning curve. You look at hard platform games like super meat boy or electronic super joy, these are hard games. But the learning curves are pretty good.  But this game just lacks that entirely.\n\nBefore the "DX" update, it was impossible to "get into the game" without already having knowledge of it. In the new DX update, things are easier, but they are still not perfect. I mean, for goodness sake, in order to even reach the 3rd tutorial, you seem to require the knowldge that is taught to you in that 3rd tutorial. (i.e. dash-jumping) It is very badly designed.\n\nHaving not been able to play them, I can't speak for the design of the later levels.\n\nThe control scheme for this game is impossible to use. In order to set it up to use a controller, you need to set up each button manually. And if you do set it up with a controller, it is impossible to switch back to keyboard without again manually resetting each button, via your controller. And god help you if you can't connect your controller again to do this. Also, I can't seem to figure out why the menu can't be opened by the controller. It can only be opened by pressing Esc on the keyboard.\n\nNow, as for the music and art in this game, it looks really good.  Kudos to the dev team for that. The music is very calming (which is helpful in alleviating frustration), and the art style is simplistic, but avoids feeling "flat".\n\nTo summarize, I really think this game is lacking a lot in the way of easing new players in. It is just impossible to learn how to play it. Even with help from snipppets of conversations in the forums, it just feels like it's missing something. That, or I am the one missing something here.\n\n[Incidentally, if anyone knows what it is that i'm missing, please tell me, because I really want to be able to play this game].","November 1, 2014","false","4.2"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","1"

I personally would have never bought Dustforce had it not been part of a bundle, but everything about the game was well done and lovingly put together and it really showed.\nSadly, something has changed. I booted the game back up to sweep some leaves and collect some cards and all of the mechanics are just broken. The controls are floaty and imprecise, the character seems to have a bizarre response time and beyond the fact that I openly admit I was dreadful at the game upon it’s release, whatever updates that have been put in place since then have made it completely unplayable.

In most platformers, there are usually a few different ways to approach problems. In Dustforce, however, you are forced into a single kind of "perfect run" to progress normally through the game. You can complete stages without these perfect runs, but by doing so, you lock yourself out of so many stages. Perfection is demanded of you in this game.\n\nI'm the kind of person that really enjoys a challenge, but the level of timing, reaction, knowledge, and control demanded of the player is so insane that I made it about 75% of the game before finally stopping to retain my sanity. When you can pull off what it demanded, it is an amazing feeling. But sometimes the game feels incredibly inconsistent, and I know that's only because the timing on everything in this game is on a hair-trigger.\n\nI find it really hard to recommend this game except to anyone who is masochistic about challenging games. I did actually really enjoy it myself (I am one of those people), but I also know this is not the kind of game that almost anyone else would be able to enjoy the way I was able to.\n\n3 out of 5 foxes.","December 4, 2013","false","14.6"," 16 of 44 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","16","44","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loonyedge/recommended/65300/","loonyedge","abusable critter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loonyedge/","227 products in account","For its length and number of different worlds and characters available, Dustforce offers almost no variety at all. Worlds are only thematic variations, repeating the same kind of level structure over and over with no unique mechanics between them, while the characters themselves all play pretty much the same, with some minor tweaks from one character to another (with some of the more subtle changes not even being hinted in-game).\n\nIf that wasn't enough, the game demands "perfect" double-S scores for players to be able to make standard progress. Scores that in any other game would exist only as a side challenge to those who truly want to spend their times mastering it. Here, you'll have to clear every single stage flawlessly if you ever hope to see those final levels, and there are MANY stages to be mastered — enough to make one feel like the game overstayed its welcome after only a few hours.\n\nBottom line is: Dustforce gets old. Fast. It offers almost no variety in its gameplay and the absurd requirement to progress through stages is a cheap way of stepping up the difficulty, which only helps to add to the incessant repetition the player will experience. I cleared one world + a bunch of other stages and saw no point in continuing. It offers no reason to go on beyond getting a good performance on stages, so you can move on to more stages and repeat the process in the exact same way, everytime. I felt like I had already seen all the game had to offer, and that more arrangements of the same stage elements weren't really worth stressing over.\n\nIt's a shame, really. Dustforce has tight controls and a unique core theme and aesthetics (though it keeps the same kind of mild/serene atmosphere all the way through. I got bored of it after a while). If it just presented new mechanics for each world and/or character and reduced the overly-demanding difficulty a tad (a double-A ranking requirement to get keys for further stages would be a huge improvement) this review could have been a "Yes" instead. The way it is, though, I'd only recommend this game to the most time-attack obsessed players with plenty of time to burn and that wouldn't care much for a more varied and rich experience.\n\nFor everyone else looking for an interesting platforming experience, you're better off looking elsewhere.","November 28, 2013","false","17.6"," 7 of 25 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","7","25","0","7"

This game is one of those that have a really high skill cap and you will need to play it alot to master it and get the best times and scores, its in the Super Meat Boy Platformer category, one thing that is different is that you have to platform to get to the doors, which are level entry points and some of those doors are hard to get to so you actually need to be able to traverse the "level select" in order to complete all levels. There are a fair amount of levels, I'd say it would take 5-10hours max to beat all the levels(mostly because the end ones are hard and you will need to take alot of shots at them), but after you beat those you also have community created levels which are amazing and will keep you playing if you really want more. This game is a good bit of fun if you are into this type of games and an excellent purchase on sale, if you don't like the game I would still recommend the soundtrack because it is Phenomenal!","November 14, 2014","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything fits together, it is a true masterpiece. For beginners a challenge and for perfectionists an endless pursuit. The music is excellent, the graphics are tight and the animations fit perfectly. Character design is cool as well. The concept of sweeping dust is strange indeed but that gives it the originality to lift it from other games in its category. Level design subtly teaches you skills gradually.\n\nIt is a matter of taste if you like the concept of time attack. Speed running. Split second timing, and endless attempts at perfection. But it is very satisfying once you belong to the best 1% in a level - of course you'll never beat Thor and his homies, but his replays serve as a good reference and may inspire new techniques.\n\nIf you liked the dashing in Mega Man X on SNES and don't despise the thought on a game that revolves around the moveset in the named game - while expanding it in mobility, variety and speed - then this is a title you will most certainly enjoy. No guns - but whacking bears with a mop proves equally satisfying if well performed.\n\nEvery little detail seems to be intended - even if you find out something that appears like a bug (for example keeping high momentum by dashing after a long slide) you will soon find a level that solely revolves on the perfection of this technique. This makes the game difficult to like at first, since you have to invest some hours to get used to it and to realize the little moveset combos that exist intentionally but don't appear intended. You will have to scratch off the surface if you want to see it's true genuity. I predict, you will either play this game for 10 hrs and get bored due to it's difficulty, or forever if you realize and accept the challenge it poses.\n\nI highly recommend this game either way, it is one of those games that i will never forget - and i have been playing videogames for some decades now. I know that many other people agree. It's quite cheap, for the thought, the design and the music that went into it. The level editor potentially increases gametime by many hourse  -  but in practice most people will have enough by the levels given by the creators. I myself have by far not cleared them all, but i just love beating the "noob" stages and perfecting my basic techniques.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roger_muppet/recommended/65300/","roger_muppet","roger_muppet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roger_muppet/","298 products in account","Thanks for creating this game, HitBox! Everything fits together, it is a true masterpiece. For beginners a challenge and for perfectionists an endless pursuit. The music is excellent, the graphics are tight and the animations fit perfectly. Character design is cool as well. The concept of sweeping dust is strange indeed but that gives it the originality to lift it from other games in its category. Level design subtly teaches you skills gradually.\n\nIt is a matter of taste if you like the concept of time attack. Speed running. Split second timing, and endless attempts at perfection. But it is very satisfying once you belong to the best 1% in a level - of course you'll never beat Thor and his homies, but his replays serve as a good reference and may inspire new techniques.\n\nIf you liked the dashing in Mega Man X on SNES and don't despise the thought on a game that revolves around the moveset in the named game - while expanding it in mobility, variety and speed - then this is a title you will most certainly enjoy. No guns - but whacking bears with a mop proves equally satisfying if well performed.\n\nEvery little detail seems to be intended - even if you find out something that appears like a bug (for example keeping high momentum by dashing after a long slide) you will soon find a level that solely revolves on the perfection of this technique. This makes the game difficult to like at first, since you have to invest some hours to get used to it and to realize the little moveset combos that exist intentionally but don't appear intended. You will have to scratch off the surface if you want to see it's true genuity. I predict, you will either play this game for 10 hrs and get bored due to it's difficulty, or forever if you realize and accept the challenge it poses.\n\nI highly recommend this game either way, it is one of those games that i will never forget - and i have been playing videogames for some decades now. I know that many other people agree. It's quite cheap, for the thought, the design and the music that went into it. The level editor potentially increases gametime by many hourse  -  but in practice most people will have enough by the levels given by the creators. I myself have by far not cleared them all, but i just love beating the "noob" stages and perfecting my basic techniques. Beating my own records gradually on daily basis and belonging to the fastest 1% is actually a quite low set goal, but a good way to improve.","September 20, 2014","true","84.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The animations are really smooth with a lovely style, the music is soothing and the later levels are incredibly hard and requires close to perfect precision and timing. If it wasn't for the quality of the art and music I would have quite of frustation quite early, it's really enjoyable to play despite frustation and once you get the hang of it you're able to pull of really awesome moves.\n\nThe game also saves ghosts for every players best run which are automatically uploaded and really easy to access. It's helps a lot when you aren't able to figure out how to do a close to perfect run in some of the harder levels.\n\nMy only gripe with dustforce is the limited controller support. I'm generally using a xbox360 controller and it required some fidgeting to get it to work as I liked. It's a wonderfull game and you should definitely get it if you're into hardcore platformers.","November 26, 2013","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The balls-hard platforming exists just as SMB, however, the dust mechanic adds replayability and online competition. The overworld level strikes me as a bit tedious; I would have preferred a traditional world map for easy replaying of frustrating levels.  The charming artwork and catchy, mellow chiptune soundtrack makes for an awesome experience. A fantastic first release from Hitbox Team. Once they get the level editor out, I'm excited to see what they cook up next.

No plot to follow. You have to 'SS' perfect each level to progress entirely, so you'll need more dedication than your megamans.\n\nThe thing I enjoyed the most, is due to the generally sharp mechancis, there can be room to do suave recoveries. Lower ranked ss replays on the (well-implemented) leaderboards have been more mind-boggling because of this.\n\nHowever, there's many places that require pixel perfect actions (or some tricks, which are admittedly fun to figure out,) and the level designer has a habit of placing a cluster♥♥♥♥ of awkward near the end of a level.

One of the things I love most about this game is the soundtrack, its mellow tones are relaxing and blend seamlessly with the gameplay, softening the frustration at my inept cleaning.\n\n-Gameplay is consistently challenging, but as you repeat levels you gradually learn the layout and the best/fastest way to clear each and every obstacle. There is nothing more rewarding than when you get that perfect run (well, not perfect, but as good as I'm going to do). The momentum based character movement did take some getting used to, but after much practice it allows you to flit through a level like a breath of wind.\n\n-The main area in which Dustforce is lacking would be the tutorial, it provides a good basic understanding of the movement mechanics and will make a player reasonably competent. However, to play dustforce to its full, flowing potential it is a necessity to go on youtube and watch tutorials and examine the manouvres and tricks used by the best of the best.","January 19, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are four main worlds that each hold different levels: some easy and fun, one beat down the enemies and some no-nonsence action. You can go to each of these worlds at any time you want, but some levels are locked. You get keys to unlock these locks by completing levels. The better you do on a level, the the more progress toward getting a key is made. So to unlock every single level, you have to get a perfect score (an SS in this case) on every level. That may seem very hard (and it is), but I've been having fun all the time trying to get a perfect score on every level no matter how long it takes me. I spent an hour or so trying to get one level down and I enjoyed every second of it (I still haven't SS'd that level).

The game concept is so simple yet it is executed so well. The artwork and animation is amazing and fluid. It's one of those games that if you're really good at playing it looks so cool.

Controls are nice and smooth as well; however, I recommend you get a gamepad, if you don't hate yourself (default controls on pc are pretty bad, but that can be changed). The only bad side really is the difficulty. I have beaten every level except Yotta Difficult(really game designers? I like a good challenge but jeez), and I have taken so much time. I'd be lying if I said I didn't rage when I almost got an SS rank on a hard level after 3 hours.

There's no guarantee you'll enjoy it all, but at least you'll get your money's worth.\nDustforce combines speedrunning and combat to create an intense "race against the clock" battle in each level. The basis is to clean up as much of the level as you can in order to advance on to the next levels, each one being more difficult than the last.\nThis game prides itself in its level design, and therefore also in its aesthetics. Its levels, characters, enemies, and even movements are visually pleasing, which helps when you play the game for hours on end in order to beat it. The sound design is similar, having a bit of the "fresh" element to it in order to keep you from getting sick of playing. Secrets are also scattered around levels, awaiting the player's arrival to reveal themselves--and then unfortunately yield no product. All of this wrapped in a thoroughly-vetted world makes for an overall good game, worth the buy.\n\nHowever, if you're not a completionist, I would approach this purchase with caution. As I said before, because this is an extensive game with many, many levels, you'll get your money's worth, but only if you're able to play them. You can only advance on to the more difficult levels in this game if you beat the previous level well enough, and eventually this stops your progress entirely until you return to fully complete the previous levels (which can be extremely difficult later on). Most importantly, if you're not enjoying it, then you'll more than likely quit and never return. So, again, think well before buying it if you don't want to be completionist and then waste your money.\n\n(Also, there is a multiplayer function to this game, but I don't have friends who own the game so I can't say whether that's worth a try or not. Given the game's speed-combat combination, I imagine it would be fun but can't say for certain!)","August 1, 2014","true","36.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dustforce is an indie action platformer from Hitbox Team. Let’s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nI love platformers and Dustforce made me remember why I love platformers. Everything about this game is well done and polished until it shines.\n\nFirst thing first, you’ll be hard pressed to find another game with as good a soundtrack as the one that accompanies Dustforce. It is pure, relaxing majesty and nothing could possibly fit this game better in terms of music. It makes you feel good while you play.\n\n\n\nThe art is phenomenal. Character designs are simple and beautiful, enemies are original, and the environments themselves will provide you with a good eyeful as well.\n\nThe controls are smooth and fluid. You can easily transition from floors to ceilings in a matter of seconds, all the while cleaning the living hell out of dust ridden creatures and persons. Dustforce is, essentially, 2D parkour and I love it.\n\nThere are a huge amount of levels for you to play through with four different characters, all of whom have their own play style. Not only does the core game have over 100 levels, but there are a heaping amount of user created levels that you can play through as well. The fun doesn’t have to end with this one, ever.\n\nThe Bad\n\nNothing. Nothing at all my friends.\n\nThe Meh\n\nSee the above category, please.\n\nVerdict: Yea\n\nDustforce is a lighthearted, refreshing platformer that serious and casual gamers alike can enjoy at their leisure. If you’re looking for something new to play, look no further. As always, thanks for reading.","November 14, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a large player base, many levels to choose from, a level editor and plenty of UGC. Here's a list of pros and cons I've compiled which I felt summarise the game:\n\nPros\nTidy graphics that are pleasing to the eye.\nOST's that can be enjoyable to listen to.\nA plethera of levels to choose from with varying levels of difficulty for the player.\nSolid gameplay mechanics that aid the game in differing from other generic platformers.\nFull gamepad support (Which I also highly recommend if you choose to buy this game).\nWith those positives, you may wonder what made me not recommend this game. Well, here's the list of cons that detracted from the game, mostly personal preference:\n\nCons\nSomewhat repetitive gameplay, as of many generic platformers. Gets exceedingly boring over extended periods of playtime, I had to resort to 15 minutes each session.\nCan feel extremely unrewarding at times, given the 'speedrun' feel to the game. Completing a section of a level you have been stuck on for a while does not mean success, but rather spending time trying to complete levels decreases your final score, which leads onto the next point.\nCan grind to a halt at certain parts of gameplay. By this, I mean some of the early levels can be gruelling and seem out of place, as early users as myself may find certain parts of a level too difficult to proceed on, meaning the rest of the level goes to waste as one part of the level cannot be completed. Ties in as hard parts of levels that take multiple tries to complete can be pointless in the end to complete.\nSpeed problems. Not running speed, such as lag, but rather play speed. The game at times can feel sluggish, and over long stretches of rock can feel slow. The game can also lose momentum when you make a minor slip and parts of the level such as loops are impossible to make, ergo reducing your final score and sometimes making you backtrack.\nNo threats. This one being more personal preference than the others, but every enemy I've encountered in the game so far (Around 20-25 levels in) has posed no threat, and at the most has only knocked me over for me to only recover again within a matter of a second. This makes levels seem somewhat bland, as the only enemy is the level itself.\nAgain, somewhat more personal, the dash-jump mechanic is frustrating to carry out. The mechanic intends that you dash then jump on solid ground to jump a long distance without the need for a run-up, although for many times I have found in levels it is intended to be used I cannot carry out the dash-jump. This, for me, was mostly experienced on the Advanced Training level, where the game does not tell you HOW to dash-jump and the level is also seemingly harder than the previous two tutorials by far.\nFor the points listed above, I cannot recommend this game. This game by no means is a bad game, as can provide some entertaining gameplay at points and is well made, but due to the way it plays, I would not recommend this game to a friend.\n\nOverall rating: 6/10\nTL;DR: Well made but frustrating to play at points and can be rather generic.","June 18, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heyladies/recommended/65300/","heyladies","dollarsshower","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heyladies/","200 products in account","Dustforce is a bipolar experience. Sublimely calming throughout with an insurmountable skill level.  The things that make Dustforce one of my favorite games are things that seem obvious a few years out now, but they're worth saying for someone who hasn't experienced it.  The soundtrack, by Lifeformed, is transcendent.  It has trappings of dubstep and chillwave but so much attention gets paid to cohesive textures and melodies that no song becomes just a genre-piece.  You will listen to this soundtrack outside of the game, and I've played this sountrack at work, heard it used on NPR, and my friends who have never played Dustforce have heard it.  The visuals are  better than they need to be.  They could have been retro 8 or 16-bit, which would make sense with the pizel perfect gameplay, or they could have been bulky flash graphics, or boring minimalist nonsense, or they could have been cheesy 3D graphics, or anything else that you'll find by flipping through the other platformers on Steam.  Instead, what they are are a beautiful flat colors, equally evoking 16-bit clarity and Gamecueb-era cel shading.  The game could have been a linear experience, lacking a hub-world and natural progression like Super Mario 3D Land.  But what we get is a branching, growing, player-guided progression through multiple worlds in a hubworld that is more of a sequel to Peach's Castle from Super Mario 64 than anything.  In order to access certain levels, you have to develop the skills necessary to play through those levels by traversing increasingly difficult areas of the hub world, accomplishing not only training a new player but evoking exploration and the unique atmospheres of each world.  It's these reasons that make Dustforce an experience that's larger than it's parts, a charming, sublime experience that respects the skill of whoever plays it without trying to intimidate you or restrict your experience.

It seems like one of those trial-and-error, play-til-perfection games ala Super Meat Boy that I just would get frustrated and don't have the patience for. Great soundtrack and visuals though! Just not my kind of game. It feels weird to go around recommending games that 'might be good if I enjoyed the genre' or 'its good, but its not for me.' I -can- recommend it though, for people who -like- that sort of thing; the controls are there, the mechanics, the competition and community.

Sure, it's got wall-jumping, air-dashing heroes, but the gameplay is more akin to racing around a track than trying to pass through a hostile environment.  The elegent controls let you achieve a zen that lets you almost float through a level without stopping, all while looking impressive with a top-notch simplistic art style and catchy music.\nIt's not a terribly difficult game, but pulling a double-S rank on a stage is still incredibly rewarding.  Comparing scores with friends and passing the controller is a lot of fun, but the actual multiplayer feels tacked on.  There's no co-op as promised, only a survival deathmatch and king-of-the-hill style play.  For this game, though, multiplayer really isn't necessary to make the title worth the purchase.\nAll in all, it's a hip platformer that's a lot of fun without risking a broken controller.","February 12, 2012","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the real reason this game shines is because of the platforming.\n\nThe way that you move about the environment is, for lack of a better term, beautiful. You can double-jump, dash around, slide down slopes, and run up walls and across ceilings. All of the levels test your ability to string together and combine these skills as you run through.\n\nAt first, just trying to complete some levels is a daunting task. Many of the harder stages require some pixel- or frame-perfect actions to maneuver through tight corridors full of spikes. I never became frustrated with dying in this game because I always felt like a death or a combo break was my fault and not the game's. But once I cleared a difficult stage with a double-S rating, it was an awesome feeling every time. Getting through a level on a perfect run looks and feels like an intricate dance, and it provides a level of satisfaction that surpasses any other platformer I've played.\n\nAll that said, I don't think I will ever beat this game. The late-game stages are just insanely brutal, and I'm not sure that I can spend the numerous hours needed to optimize my movement through just one of them to get a double-S. But I'm quite okay with that, and I'll definitely try anyway.","May 7, 2014","true","153.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Last year it was Jamestown for me, this year it might well be Dustforce.\n\nThis is a great looking, acrobatic/ninja-rific platformer with a chilled out electronic score and a nice scaling difficultly level.  Imagine Meatboy, but way less frustrating and soul-crushingly difficult, plus more move variety, and rewarding combat. (!)\n\nWhile levels can be beat without necessarily being an ace player, for me there's a strong, strong "I know I can do better" urge after completing a run, so there's a lot of value here if you're a perfectionist.  And the game's beautiful graphics, balletic animations and excellent level design always reward me for coming back to previous challenges.\n\nLastly, the ability to watch replays of the top players is also an excellent addition, both to help you see how others solved tricky spots and to help you improve your game.\n\nThis is a real gem, grab it if you like platformers with style!\n\nEDIT: I've enjoyed my time with Dust Force, but unforunately I feel like I've hit the skill ceiling.  I've gotten to a point in the levels where I'm just not good enough to progress further, and don't think it's worth my entertainment time to put in the hours to get better.  This in NO WAY is the fault of the game or it's developers.  I still think Dust Force is amazing, but unfortunately I just won't be able to crack open its higher level content.","March 9, 2012","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you wrestle out the way to bind your keys to your gamepad, prepare to be blown away by the insane amount of love put in to make this godly platformer. Gameplay and animation is insanely fluid, and while controls can be a bit floaty, they lend themselves well to the levels designed around it, and gives generous space failure, even when your inner speed demon does not. This game must be noted as one without any notable story, and is built solely around replay value, so if you're like me and enjoy a veil of plot to your games, you won't find it here. Honestly, with how much the game screams of personality, and with all the bear-cleaning and animal smacking, I felt like there was a missed opportunity in set up, but this is not a detractor. There is a lot of humor to be found in just the enviornment, and like any good p0rn, you're not here for the story.\n\nWonderful game if you want to feel inferior and still have a great time.","February 3, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chazesiwile/recommended/65300/","chazesiwile","Chaze Siwile","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chazesiwile/","200 products in account","Dusforce is a 2D indie platform game developed by Hitbox Team. The game is short, simple, and tells the story of four custodial protagonists who attempt to sweep away a world corrupted by dust and filth. The game was released on Steam in January of 2012 and will be pushed to the Playstation 3, Playstation Vita, and Xbox 360 consoles in January of 2014.\n\nThe game consists of roughly 50 levels in which the player has to use a number of acrobatic skills in order to clean up small sections of leaves and defeat filth-covered creatures to score and progress though the level. Some of the skills that the player will have to master to complete each level in an efficient manner are the double jump, wall jump, mid-air dash, and the ability to cling to the walls and ceiling. The player also has the choice of a light or heavy attack with which to defeat the enemies in the levels. The levels themselves are laid out very well and tend to vary from horizontal to vertical design, which pushes the player to master the controls of Dustforce (a game best played with a controller, if possible). The game tracks your progress through each level with the combo meter, which is influence by the player's ability to move through the level and eliminate both enemies and leaf piles in an efficient manner. At the end of each level, the player is "ranked" by their abilities to achieve a high combo and how quickly they moved through the stage. The game also comes with a four-player multiplayer system with some typical variants such as Survivor and King of the Hill, along with a level editor that was introduced via patch after the games initial release.\n\nWhile it's certainly an interesting way to promote level completion, the biggest problem with Dustforce's ranking system is that in order to access many levels of the game, the player is required to complete each previous level in a near-perfect manner. I found myself running through previous levels over and over just so I could access the next one. This certainly speaks volumes about Dustforce's ambitious gameplay, but also says a lot about how the game is put together. Forcing a player to run through previous levels 10-15 times will often make it feel as if the developers are simply padding out their game. It's a fantastic experience, but it would be a lot better if it were only longer and if it were easier to progress through the game. Also, the acrobatic abilities are hard to master, and it will take a lot of time with a controller in hand in order for an average player to perfect the play style that Dustforce presents.\n\nHowever, there are many things about Dustforce that makes it an indie game that you should experience for yourself. The game has a unique art style that is gorgeous to look at, especially when a player is whizzing through a level at top speed. The colors blend together in a fantastic way that makes the game visually stunning. Also, the techno soundtrack was created by lifeformed, and it is nothing short of amazing. The music is stunning, and is some of the best I've ever heard in an indie game. Since it's release, Dustforce has been compared to other indie games, such as Super Meat Boy and N+, and while it shares a similiar style, Dustforce is a game that stands alone. It's innovations seperate it from other games like it, and it's penchant towards speedrunning implies that the developers knew exactly what market Dustforce would do best in.\n\nUnfortunately, while Dustforce is a fantastic game, it is one that is more difficult than it's predecessors, and to the players that have never experienced fast-paced platforming gameplay, I would have to recommend that they play Super Meat Boy or N+ before this one. Those games are simpler, and typically will be a more casual experience than the one Dustforce provides. That being said, if you have experienced either of those games and hunger for more, then Dustforce is the game for you. Dustforce will impress and, hopefully, amaze you.\n\nA 5 out of 10","November 26, 2013","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals of the game blend with the music and gameplay of the game to make one incredible experiance. Adsd that to superb level design that not only tests the skillls of the player, but also allows for tons of strategy that will be seen as soon as you decide to take a peek at the top ten leader board. This is one of those platformers that has a difficulty comparable to other games such as Super Meat Boy, but only if you decide to challenge yourself. This allows gamers of all levels to participate in the game from the most casual player that wants to just get to the end of the level to the most hardcore player that will spend tens of hours to get # 1 on the leader board for a single level.

The feeling of  joy i got after reaching the top 100 of a leve left me a strong sense of accomplishment. Very few games have made me feel like this.\n\nThe game itself has a lot of content, with the amount of time i have there are still official levels i havent touched, And with the in game map editor, there is a lot more i can do still after completing those levels.\n\nThis game caters mostly to hardcore players, as the game's difficult can increase significantly, and many community made levels are also difficult. But there are many levels which are not too diffcult.\n\nThere is also a speedrunning element to the game ,with a leaderboard with built in replays so you can not only observe your own past attempts, but those of the top and even bottom players.\n\nTo summarise: Dustforce is a game for hardcore players that never lets you settle for being mediocre.","March 30, 2015","true","89.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The balls-hard platforming exists just as SMB, however, the dust mechanic adds replayability and online competition. The overworld level strikes me as a bit tedious; I would have preferred a traditional world map for easy replaying of frustrating levels.  The charming artwork and catchy, mellow chiptune soundtrack makes for an awesome experience. A fantastic first release from Hitbox Team. Once they get the level editor out, I'm excited to see what they cook up next.

This game pushed me to restart a level 60 times, to get a perfect rating, or playing the same level again and again to find that you're finally rank 250 out of 7500 for speed.

The smoothness of the gameplay and fun but hard technical sections make it stand out for me. And when i say "hard" then i mean it. The later levels get ludicrously hard, to the point where you can spent more than 7 hours trying to SS (perfect score) a level.

Fantastic art style and fun levels once you get the hang of the controls. One gripe I have is the low chance of a painless recovery should you mess up in a level at all. Overall it's worth the price so long as you don't mind the difficulty curve. Also, if you value your sanity, DO NOT attempt the advanced levels unless you have complete and full confidence in your abilities. That goes for the community maps too, most of which are horrifyingly sadistic to say the least.","June 19, 2013","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems simple on the surface, but you'll sink hours into it slowly improving at levels. You play as a graceful janitor who can jump from platform to platform with ease. You have to strategically use air jumps, light/strong attacks, wall runs, and dashes to clean up a level (or just make it to the end) as fast as possible. You have to carefully pick which character to use on a level, as each of the 4 characters is distinctly different and has different strengths and weaknesses. Overall this makes for a seemingly simple yet actually complex game you can sink hours into getting better at. And to top it all off, the graphics and music are beautiful (see the trailers for proof). This has slowly become one of my all-time favorite games, and if anything I've said or anything you've seen interests you at all, I recommend this game.","August 6, 2015","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh look here's one right now!\nAt first I thought it would be like a Super Meat Boy, and in a way it is, but... if you think any of your hard-learned Meat Boy prowess will help you here, you are gravely mistaken and you are going to need to waterproof your gamepad and/or keyboard because there will be a lot of tears.\nMeat Boy's approach to wall jumping mechanics was very simple, and the challenges were largely about precision.\nDustforce take a much more strict approach. Rather than simply megaman your way up a wall, you can run up it- for a short distance. Then you'll either need a facing wall, or to spend your precious precious second jump, the one you can't get back without landing on solid ground or killing an enemy in midair. You can also run along slopes and ceilings, air dash, and a number of other fancy tricks that look super cool but all add complexity.\nThe challenges here are not only about precision, but also working out how long you can save that air jump, which direction to hold (or not hold) when you make contact with the wall, or how to get that extra bit of dust up on the ceiling.\nUnfortunately, the experience is hurt a little by slightly picky controls and the rather annoying way momentum is handled when you've wall-run up to the edge of a platform (or anything treated as one, whether it has spikes on it or not).\nAll in all, I enjoy it, even though the gold-key levels make me furious.","January 25, 2013","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
