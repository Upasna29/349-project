Almost 8h gameplay I can tell it's worth the $16.\n\nFirst Actions\n- Spent 30m getting out of debt. (I suggest salvaging,  you get lucky with a merchent ship and you're good to startout)\n- Dropped my city, started getting small flow of income.\n- Starting particpating in battles with other cities vs. Pirates (don't want to choose sides yet b,c I dont want an enemy city to wreck me)\n- Got a small city and 4 sectors to my name.\n\nMoney Tip I've learned\n- I use my income/min as an upkeep. I make my real money from mining planets and selling them at my local market + friendly AI market. Doing this I get +5 relation from the ai I trade with while keeping my local  market prices high. If I'm lucky I'll find a very cheap resource at an AI market and sell it at my market if I can sell it for more.\n\nDevelopers have stated that they will be doing WEEKLY updates, so looking forward to that.\n\nIn it's current state you will get $16+ worth of enjoyment. Once more and more content gets added every week you'll enjoy it anymore in addition you're giving the devs more financial fuel to make the development better.\n\nGame CLEARLY has a lot of potential to be simplistic but at the same time complex. If devs come out with frequent updates I'll be playing this game for a while.\n\n(Note: If you pick up this game, when you buy a ship, don't click it unless you want to buy it for sure.)","June 30, 2015","true","9.3"," 39 of 50 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","39","50","3","6"

The combat is fun, the base building is shallow but fun. The missions are fun, the first 50 times....\n\nThe problem I have is that there just isn't enough of anything. Not enough variety in ships, missions, zero story, diplomacy is almost non existent. After a few hours you will start to notice so many quality of life things that are missing that you have in other games. Such as:\n\n- No minimap (the only way to see enemy fleets approaching is to open the map screen which prevents you from doing anything else)\n- You can only control one fleet and one flagship. You can't swap between multiple ones. so if you're off attacking someone and your home gets attacked you have to go all the way back.\n- The AI just grows at an insane rate. Faster than I could possibly keep up.\n- The missions become a grind. Flying around collecting things, fighting pirates, over and over.\n\nThis game needs more before I can recommend it. I hope the devs stay on it though because at its core it has a lot of potential.","October 25, 2015","false","5.5"," 36 of 47 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","36","47","0","0"

After about 5 hours, it seems like I've experienced most of the game. I can continue to grind up my city size and expand my borders some more, but it seems pointless to do that since, as far as I can tell, there is no way to kill your enemies. I had an AI city pop up a few sectors outside my borders early on, so of course I had to show him who's boss of my little area and beat him up. So, I destroyed all of his fleets, took over a couple of sectors and he surrenders, giving me a bit of cash (note: Its a forced accept surrender, you cannot decline him). I've done this now on about 4 seprate occasions, except instead of taking over his sectors, I just beat on his city because he is completely surrounded by me. He has 3 sectors left that are spread out, disconected from his city (shouldn't be recieving the tax from those then right?) but everytime I get his city pretty well destroyed, he surrenders again.\n\nSo I've gone through the process of destroying his city center and as many population buildings as possible in a mad rush to try and finish him off before he surrenders and I have to wait another 20 minutes to try again. This really wouldn't be an issue if I could subjugate him or otherwise force his compliance, but since I can't I feel the need to keep trying to kill him since he is literally an enemy stronghold inside my borders.\n\nOverall, game is incredably fun, definitely has a lot of potential. List of suggestions that IMO would greatly improve gameplay though:\n\n- Ability to destroy your enemies cities or otherwise pacify them permanently!\n- AI comanders for your fleets. Let those massive stock of reserve ships patrol your borders so you don't have to personally respond to *every* minor pirate/enemy incursion.\n- Repair option for the ships in your fleet. Right now you can ghetto it by puting them into the reserve and taking them back out, but it doesn't seem like thats intended.\n- Asteroid mining base! Lets put those asteroid sectors to work!\n- Trade convoys, you can go to distress beacons and see the NPC convoys, why not have our own going around for us to protect? Maybe have them delivering the resources mined from planets instead of them auto arriving?\n- Don't let players build their city center on a planet, or at least warn them! I thought I was being clever having my city on a planet I wanted to mine, but instead it made it un-mineable!\n\nOverall, great game and well worth the money. Looking foreword to seeing the future content!","June 30, 2015","true","7.1"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","20","24","3","5"

I knew SPAZ.  Senator, you're no SPAZ.\n\nMy main issue is the combat.  Unlike SPAZ, which is a fast dodge and shoot affair with responsive strafing and real time projectiles, Beyond Sol is basically an MMO.  Tab target, activate your spells (laser guns) then wait for the cooldown.  Even the 'fast' ship is miserably slow and can only stop or go forward, no dodging here.\n\nThe city building feels a few 'quality of life' patches behind the curve.  You'll be opening one menu to build a structure, then opening another menu to check your inventory of building material, then manually purchasing any material you're short of on the market, then finally building the structure which costs material and credits.  You initially purchased the material with credits.  Why make that a separate step?\n\nI appreciate Beyond Sol's ambition, but I feel like the team spread themselves too thin.  The city building is shallow, grindy, and not fun.  The combat feels like the mobile game version.  Maybe pick this one up if it's really discounted.","October 14, 2015","false","32.8"," 74 of 121 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","74","121","4","12"

This is one hell of a hidden Gem and easily my top 10 games of all time with only 30+ Hours put into it because it's almost everything I wanted in a Space RTS Game.\n\nWhat are some of the main features I love:\nEvent System\nOpen World\nSandbox\nBase Building\nTerritory System\nUpgrade System\nYour own personal Ship upgrade\nFleet System / Military bases and their protection expansion via upgrades.\nPirates even more so end game keeping on your toes forcing you to expand territory.\nThe entire game has almost everything I could dream of in a game like this.\n\n\nNow to make it an honest review you always want to mix some opinions into a game. Here are things I love to see or wish that were in the game.\n\nThings I like to see:\nLarger Universe, I find the universe quite small as I don't want 10 hour long games but I would like weeks worth. Clearly if they double the map they would need higher spec PC's and maybe even some other instability. That is why I wish there was a override feature for unsafe increase of the map. This way someone hardcore or crazy like me can have some real fun with of course the possibility of instability.\nIn multiplayer games when you are allied I think you should be able to piggyback off your allied radars and I also think alerts from pirate raids to their stations should be slightly more noticeable and if they are attacked by any other players/npc's that it alerts you quite boldly. Their your allies you share everything security information wise.\nIf Larger Universe was a feature down the road I would love to also see another city expansion upgrade. To help keep the expansions more balanced.\n\n\n\nOverall I give this game a 90/100 score. I don't think any game deserves a perfect score because there is always room for improvements of course but this one really hit the spot for being one my top fav games of all times. This game will have memories for myself and friends for years to come.\n\nI'm also making a Let's Play Series because I love it a lot. It's going to be every other day though I release it one day early because I could not contain my excitement.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkqLnzpfvAI","November 1, 2015","true","65.2"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","23","32","0","1"

Check.\nLike to upgrade said empire? Check.\nLike to tool around and create wicked fleets? Check.\nLike to rule the galaxy by creating strategic outposts and alliances, and then betray them at the last minute to snatch power? Check.\n\nThis game is very, very good.\n\nThis is a very good space simulator that revolves around strategy, diplomacy, tactics, managing economies and upgrading in order to survive among different AIs.\n\nThe gist of the game:\nYou are given the options to rule the game via 3 different victories: diplomacy, economy or war. You can create a world based on different variables (size of map, number of AI, learning curve, handicap, etc) and then you are placed in a hex-based map with AI. You are able to create  a city easily by following a set of arrows that point you in the right direction to build the city. Once established, you can expand the city via radar outposts, mining outposts or military outposts. The key is to create a good economy by mining nearby planets either by setting up mining outposts or running mining runs in nearby asteroid belts. By building outposts in adjoining hexes you are able to expand your overall territory and increase your economy by charing a tariff based on the territory you control.\n\nThe pros:\nThere is a very good learning curve with this game. The devs have incorporated a number of very clever responses by the AI. As you expand your territory you will likely ♥♥♥♥ off nearby AI who will declare themselves hostile to you and repeatedly try to destroy your outposts. Similarly, I've had AIs try to attack me and I've responded with my fleet and destroy them along with their outposts. The AI will then abdicate for a short time by offering you war reparations. If you repeatedly deny them then this incurs the wrath of other nearby players.\n\nYou can customize most likely ANYTHING in this game. Being extremely modular, you are able to tack on a variety of different components to your bases. Each individual component is upgradable if you have the cashs and the minerals. Similarly you can upgrade your ship, its weapons and system along with your fleet and fleet size by upgrading things like your hangar. Once you have a sizable fleet with sizable cargo bay you can advance pretty far.\n\nThe game balances itself out because neighbouring AI will fight each other, thereby preventing any one AI by leading and winning. You can easily play the same game for 5-6 hours with AI tied neck to neck.You can also lead early on and forget about neighbouring AI who suddenly declare themselves hostile and then proceed to blow your city to hell with a massive fleet.\n\nThe game's myriad upgrading possibilities force the gamer to balance creating an empire, defending it, expanding it, creating economic pathways, upgrading those outposts, creating and managing fleets and attacking, while managing alliances.\n\nThe graphics are decent and are created with the Unity engine. For most systems this game shouldn't be a problem.\n\nThe accompanying music is spacey and adds to the atmosphere of the game.\n\nCons:\n\nBuilding components to your base isn't always easy and takes some manoeuvering around. It would be nice to have it easier.\n\nIf you annihilate someone from the game IMMEDIATELY all of the other races consider you a warmonger and still send their entire fleets after you in hopes of destroying you. This is one drawback because in war people will not necessarily fight against you if you kill off another AI. This communistic aspect of the game is a drawback and I hope it gets addressed later on by the devs.\n\nStill playing it after purchasing it 40% off. I am excited to continue playing.\n\nedit:\n\nI am recently experiencing consistent fluctuating frame rates from 11 fps to 41 fps despite having a solid rig. It makes piloting ships across the map difficult given how laggy it becomes. Hopefully the devs will address this because it is starting to become a tad irritating.","December 23, 2015","true","43.6"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

I simply cannot wait for what the future holds for Beyond Sol!\n\n\nPros:\nBeing developed by, Praxia Entertainment, a Canadian team that used to work for Bioware; Beyond sol has all the elements of a great top down space shooter, combined with the hardcore strategy elements of a 4x empire building game. Throw in some massive fleet battles, tower defense and even some economic simulation, you will find this hard to put down.\n\nYou begin the game as a lone cruiser pilot in a small region of contested space and you goal is to quickly build a city where people in the region can live, shop, work etc. You will need to expand your territory by building radar and mining installations that will gather minerals tariffs for your growing empire. While your empire is growing you may also explore the universe freely and without restriction, mining, hunting, performing services for other cultures, salvaging, and even outright attacking your neighbors, if you so choose. There is no restriction on what you do.\n\nYour ship can be upgraded and customized in a variety of ways depending on what corporations you have living in your city. You can buy new corporate ships to fly with you or to defend your cities and stations as well. All things considered, Beyond Sol is amazing already, and it's not even finished yet. I can't recommend it enough!\n\nCons:\nThis is an Early access title, so it, naturally has a few issues. I have found some bugs when starting new games where some of the previous game data will carry over, creating some confusing information, like incorrect research and ship levels, more money and minerals than normal etc. The game is also incomplete and there are simply many ship customizing option that are simply just not available yet. The procedurally generated area you begin in is different every time and always interesting, however, there are no options yet to customize it. None of these issues prevent a player from playing the game and enjoying it thoroughly.","July 5, 2015","true","54.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

You can help other stations and get population, meanwhile you are hunting pirates and mining your needs for expanding your own city. When you have helped other citys, you can help or get helped by their forces, which is really nice, if you don't have a army your self.\n\nThe fighting and controls seems to be really good, and if you fire missiles it's not locked to "be 100% kill", every other weapon has a range aswell, so you need to know how to control the ship and think about the range, which gives a decent challenge.\n\nWhen a city gets attack or declare war, they close some income, and some recourses will be cheaper. This will help you out, if you are on low resources, but high on money.\n\nIf your interested in what i experienced, you can see my stream:  http://www.twitch.tv/theearlyaccess/v/6775008","June 30, 2015","true","1.5"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","4"

I soon as i saw it i was hooked, the game looked really fun and amazing. Also it had multiplayer so i could play it with my brothers and friends. Here are the pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n- Good Graphics (In my Opinion)\n- Fun\n- You get a fleet! It looks awesome to go into NLS\n- Good Combat\n- Random Events\n- City Building\n- Ship upgrades\n- Cool Explosions\n- It plays somewhat like a mix between the Spore Civilisation stage and the Space stage\n- Cool hexagonal territory capture system\n- Diplomatic, Economic and Militaristic playstyles\n- Mining\n- Money!\n- Doing Distress signals can increase you income! YES!\n- Multiplayer\n\nNow here are the cons. There is one REALLY bad one which seems to only happen to me? It has destroyed me a number of times. What happens is randomly the game will minimase itself and sometimes it wont let me back onto the game so i have to close the game and replay it again. Because of the handy save feature i dont lose any progress. I have died a number of times because it minimises during a heated battle and i cant fight back. It's very annoying.\n\nCons:\n- Kinda reptitive\n- Negative dollars =(\n- Fighting early on can be fatal\n- Death during NLS charge, lol\n- random Minimising\n- Border tension screws you over\n- Always a pirate base nearby\n\nSo to sum it up, this game is absolutuely amazing and should be bought by lovers of space, strategy games. It is a fun game and gives you total freedom to take over the galaxy! Also Multiplayer. I have only played about 4 hours but trust me, that number's gonna get a WHOLE LOT BIGGER!\n\n9/10\n\n______EDIT_______\n\nNow this is something about the game (and my limited techical knowledge and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ router) that really ♥♥♥♥ing annoys me.

Runs on low hardware.\n4) My firend was easily able to connect to me to play coop.\n5) You can transfer your ship/profile across different sessions.\nCons:\n1) There is zero community. It's hard to even figure out which website or forum is the dev's! Zero active community thus far.\n2) You cannot control any settings for your game. Wanna change the sound levels? Nope, better crank up you teamspeak volums bc you have to play this game at the vokume levels they give you.\n3) The AI is utter garbage. I get it, I settled near you. Get over it. Just sharing borders shouldn't be enough to send them into a "I must wipe you" rage.\n4) When the AI has a multi front war they get an automatic peace treaty from one of their enemies. When it happens to the player? Nope gg gl you gotta fight both those MFs now.\n5) The negotiations/diplomacy is pretty barebones in this game.\n6) The targeting for enemy ships is messed up. Those tiny ships have to be clicked on while they fly by? Really? That is awful and needs to be changed.\n\nEven with all those issues, the game is fun. Hopefully the devs will start updating it and a community will get going.\n\nEdit: They have actually fixed some of my issues in the first update. They made targeting enemy ships way better, so that is a non-issue now. They have also added settings so you can change sound!\n\nOther things they did on the first update: balanced AI aggro speed and nerfed AI starting city size.

The problem with the Artificial Intelligence is that it grows too quickly. The AI can beat you near the start of the game on the easiest level if you declare war against them. They are a huge challenge. If you are new to the game, I suggest you watch strategic videos on it. Otherwise, you might lose quickly.\n-There needs to be more variety in missions.

You don't hear any of the in-game sound effects from the store video but rest assured they are of appropriate quality.\n\nCurrently, you start off in your capital ship without a base. You roam the galaxy collecting resources via random generated events such as mining, salvaging and combat. No exploring in this game at the moment.\n\nOnce you have saved up some resources and found a suitable spot in the galaxy, you build your home base. Continue to harvest minerals and build up your empire. Make sure to have a sizable home fleet so your neighbors don't get any bright ideas about attacking you.\n\nContinue to level up your flag ship, customizing it to your preferred specifications, build a fleet to take with you, and go conquer the galaxy!\n\nCurrently there is little diplomacy, but it's there. Basically you can trade resources and help out when they are being attack by pirates to earn reputation with your neighbors. But they want your stuff, badly.

As it stands game is 6/10, and by release it will obviously be at least a little better. Some people will like Beyond Sol some will not. If there were a few easy fixes, then the game would be palatable to a wider audience.\n\nThis game has you build a city in space, mine resources, establish outposts, and fight pirates and ultimately, other factions, in an attempt to dominate the solar system. You build a fleet of ships, each which have different roles, strengths and abilities.\n\nThe game is in early access but runs smooth and there are only a few minor bugs. You can stll tell it's early access, however, because there are still missing features, such as ship systems.\n\nThe plus for this game is RTS ship fleet battles within a single solar system are not very common. Yes there are 4x games, but this takes place in a single system and you really only command one fleet, although you can set up other defensive fleets in starbases. So it's much more tactical than a traditional 4x strategy or even 4x RTS, although it does have 4x elements to be sure. So not only has the game found a niche that is uncommon, it also requires strategic thinking and advance planning. You can only build one city, so initial planning while thinking 10 steps ahead is more important here than in a game like Sins of a Solar Emprie or the Galactic Civilizations series (and really this game feels a lot different than those.)\n\nThe upgrade paths (to the extent they've been implemented) are well done and the best fleets will include a balance of ships. The game is a grind but most of the time the grind is ok as events that pop up are interesting initially, although they do get repetitive after a while.\n\nI have four gripes about the game. The first one is you can't pause the game in singleplayer, you can only exit and re-enter the game. Simple enough to do, but when you re-enter, your ships start over at home base. This is both an annoyance and an exploit - you can just exit the game and re-start to get out of a losing battle.\n\nMy 2nd gripe is zoom in/out is not documented (you use the + and - key) and zoom itself is very very limited. You can zoom in far enough, but this game really needs the ability to zoom out more. It is not uncommon for the range of your ship weapons to extend beyond the borders of the screen on maximum zoom out. This in and of itself is unacceptable.\n\nMy 3rd gripe is you can only manage your home city when your fleet is in the city. This makes no sense. Why must I dock my fleet in the city to buy and sell city commodities? Or upgrade the city. I should be able to do that independently of what my fleet does. I think it would be nice to have more than one city and more than one fleet, but I understand the intentional limitation here as the one city/one fleet rule keeps the game more tactical and intimate, instead of going the route of the more generic, 'epic' feeling 4x space RTS with multiple bases, fleets, etc.\n\nMy 4th gripe is the game is a little light on content right now. However, this will likely be solved upon the game's full release. It remains to be seen whether all the features, once added in, will be enough to flesh out the game adequately.\n\nReally, if these guys could could fix the first 3 limitations (I imagine the 4th will be fixed upon release) then the game would be solid and good. It really wouldn't be hard to fix the first 3 issues, not hard at all. If you can put up with these annoyances the game is worth it. If you can't then it isn't. I like the game overall so I'm giving it a thumbs up.","September 8, 2015","true","7.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

As you know the original review was quite negative. But that's the only way things get fixed in games like this.\n\n1.The repair problems have mostly been fixed.\n2. Fleets are reduced  in this build.\n3. Resources are an issue but it's not so bad the game is bogged down.\n4. AI is being worked on, it isn't perfect right now but the developer is making a concerted effort to actually fix the issues with it.\n5. Pirates went from a mind-boggling nightmare to a minor nuisance for those with large empires.\n\nRight now all the big issues that were bogging the game down badly have been fixed. The AI and Warp Travel still need a bit of work but it looks like the developer is actually listening and caring, which I was unsure about at first. But they proved me wrong on that issue. I'm very impressed that they fixed several of the most glaring problems in one patch.\n\nThere are still some flaws but they aren't so huge I can give the game a negative review anymore. Here they are:\n\n1. Truly huge cities bog the game down quite a bit, even on massively powerful computers (I'm running an i7, 16 gb ram and 970) this is a symptom of it running on Unity.\n2. Additional content as far as ships, buildings, new outposts and other depth still need work. That's normal for any early access title and I'm glad they worked on more pressing problems first.\n3. Basic polish on the UI, controls and in other areas still needs a bit of work. But that will also probably come with time.\n\nOnce the rest of the content is finished the game should be really great, as long as the developer continues with this trend.","July 7, 2015","true","157.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","31"

Multi player, the game gets a thumbs up but single player it gets a thumbs down. The reason for this is the 'cheating' ai. You establish a city, build a reasonable fleet, gain allies and so on but what it takes you an hour or so to do, the ai has a better more established cities with better ships within 10 minutes of popping up on the map. If you upset someone and they declare war, you just as well start over as they willl turn up outnumbering and outgunning you. Diplomacy just as well go out of the window as well as even if you start your city away from all the a.i, if they expland and their sectors connect with yours (which they usually do within minutes of them establishing) its an instant -20 brownie points or whatever they are called towards them so becoming allies with them is pretty much impossible. It's s shame really as it has so much potential to be a fun game and hopefully these balancing issues get addressed. Multi player on the other hand, i imagine would be a blast as you all have to get the resources to expand and upgrade ships etc so it would be much more balanced. If its on sale and you have a couple of friends who would be up for multiplayer then it would probably be a blast but for single player (and me personally), the hunt for a nice noob friendly 4x type game continues........","March 5","false","15.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

Definitely a very good, well-crafted effort from a small but clearly talented indie developer. I was pleasantly surprised by how fun and engaging it was.\n\nPros: The game is simple, easy to pick up and understand. There is a wide array of ships each with specific functions and behaviors, as well as a good variety of weapons and ship systems, allowing you to customize your personal vessel for whatever role you want. The city-building and economy are streamlined and simple but complex enough to require advance planning and strategy. Though taking place in a single star system, it has good classic 4x elements that involve dealing with random events, exploration, expansion, construction, resource-gathering, and research. Initial construction costs and upgrade costs are fairly affordable but increase steeply for each level gained, making the improvement process slow and gradual but satisfying at the same time. Combat is fast-paced and straightforward but engaging, requiring good positioning and timing. Once additional ships are added to the mix, the battles grow in size and intensity, and it's important to prioritize your targets so as to best support your wingmen.\n\nCons: The tutorial is fairly bare-bones and doesn't fully cover certain aspects of the game, such as fleet management. Certain features are hidden and require some tinkering to discover and utilize fully, namely the ability to organize auxiliary fleets to operate out of your military stations. The random events can sometimes seem a bit too random, occasionally spawning in areas far from where your ship is currently operating. The focus on your city and personal ship can be restricting, often forcing you to decide between management or flying off to deal with events. I think the game definitely needs the option to allow secondary fleets to respond to distress calls or battles in your territory at the very least - at the moment they can only respond to pirate attacks or wartime invasions by other cities. Diplomacy is very basic and none of the other cities have anything in the way of personality - even their cultural types (diplomatic, economic, militaristic) seem to have little effect on their behavior. Maintaining a positive relationship often boils down to bribing them every ten minutes, as the ratings decline fairly rapidly. While you can get a good boost by assisting their fleets and freighters against pirates, the game seems to spawn those events in your territory only for the most recently-established city, making it harder to maintain trade treaties and alliances with older, well-established factions. By the endgame, diplomacy often requires flying around in their turf helping them out, but again, this prevents you from managing your own empire or responding to events in your own territory. The game would be better if players were able to shift a good deal more of the active requirements to their empire AI.\n\nDon't let the seemingly long list of cons dissuade you, however - they really are lesser inconveniences compared to how fun and engaging this game really is. It is a solid little empire-builder with alot of cool stuff to do, and the process of gradually expanding your city, territory, industry, and fleets and upgrading what you've built is an enjoyable one. There are multiple ways to achieve victory and the option exists to continue playing the game on each map after you or one of the other factions has won - snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, as it were, which is particularly satisfying if you feel that your empire is simply the best, no matter what the stupid computer might say.","May 19","true","32.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A successful mix of action and strategy.\n\nPacing of real time strategy is not too rushed, so you have time to plan your goals. I love the way the other empires grow and fight each other, without one empire dominating and going for world domination. This gives the game a very relaxed, open-world feel.\n\nYou control the flagship starting a new colony in another solar system. If your flagship dies, it respawns but you lose some money. The amount you lose is just right; not so much that you'd want to rage quit but big enough to make you avoid taking too much risk in battles. Overall, this means that losing your ship does not break up the flow of the game, you just respawn and start rebuilding your fleet. This is a great idea and is implemented well.\n\nThe game does have a few bugs but I'm hoping that as more people buy the game and report bugs, that this will be addressed.","December 26, 2015","true","27.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However I have noticed that there is little replay value as there are very few things you can customize between games. Basically the only two things you can set is the number of AI and their starting size, that's it. That is not enough for giving you replay value so therefore I have stopped playing it until more variety is introduced.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis game is a stroke of genious. A hands on strategy and RTS combined with an element of RPG in the mix, as you advance your player which carries over between games. You basically are a small empire who fights over sectors of space. Getting money and minerals to build bigger defences and fleets to take out your opponents.\n\nIt is a bit rough around the edges, and the GFX does not impress, but the gameplay is amazingly addictive.

The game has a lot of nice subtle nuances that I think are great.\n\nOne thing i m pretty impressed with is the local economy of a map. It feels pretty balanced in a work to payout scale. Resources are EVERYWHERE and can be gained from a multitude of sources in multiple ways.\n\nCombat is a real simple thing and takes a bit of an MMO approach in terms of weapons/buffs/debuffs, but still satisfying and challenging enough to be fun. Loosing your ship costs heavily...which is great.\n\nThe general atmosphere of the game is really pleasant visually. It's not going to tax your system like a "AAA" title (I.E. Skyrim) will, but the details are pretty, textures are well thought out, and the general rendering is pretty darn good.\n\nMy only complaint is, at the time of this writing, the very limited camera control. Lots of things happen off screen that I would like to see. I do like the isometric feel. I'd just like to see more of the field.\n\nAll in all, I am very happy with my purchase of this title.

(although i did like discovering new game play mechanics each time)\n- Some UI elements need work, i.e. the fleet, reserve, and military base, window interaction.\n\nGame Breaker -/-\n- Sadly if you incounter an error, and are requested to send the error report, you basically cant play untill you do so.","October 16, 2015","false","48.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","2"

It's early days, I will add more as time passes. Right now I'd describe it as SPaZ with a Civ 5-lite overtone.\n\nEDIT: Having played this a lot more, I am still enjoying it as much and that's a good sign. I actually bought Drox Operative around the same time, and find I prefer this. Drox has better graphics and more fun combat, but it's really a Diablo-lite space game while this is a Civ-lite space game. That alone gives this game the most legs for me.\n\n9/10","October 14, 2015","true","24.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rusinylancer/recommended/348490/","rusinylancer","Rusyn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rusinylancer/","136 products in account","Beyond Sol is an excellent title, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. While it can be a little bit bland to witness with plain visuals and fairly standard music and sound effects, this game really shines when it comes to how it plays. The faction relations, base management and fleet building are what this game excels at. 4X fans and arcade sim lovers will enjoy this title.\n\nI'm in a bit of a rush right now, so I'll just have to paste my review outline for now. Might update later if I remember.\n\n•	Beyond Sol Review (8/10)\no	Gameplay\n	Tutorial is somewhat rushed but gets the basics across fairly well.\n	General gameplay\n•	4X/Arcade Space Sim/Tower Defense/Lite RTS?\n•	Drones used to harvest resources and salvage wreckage\n	Random Events\n•	Random events are frequent and occur anywhere, with context.\n•	If you go to the border of two warring factions, you will find them fighting.\n•	Don’t ever feel like a waste of time. While protecting merchants nets you little up front cash, they give your colony a passive income buff that lasts for ten minutes. Can be huge.\n•	Combat encounters get more difficult as the game progresses, but also give better rewards. Easily manageable if you keep you ship and fleet steadily upgraded\n	Combat (7/10)\n•	Fairly basic but well implemented. Seems balanced\n•	Fluid controls\n•	Limited armament options, but possibly for balance\n•	Seemingly no way to give specific orders to fleets\n•	Three corporations (tech trees) with different strengths, mix and match your fleet and ship upgrades to suit yourself.\n	Trading (8/10)\n•	Basic, well implemented.\n•	General knowledge of supply and demand will get you far\n•	Common sense seems to apply: e.g. if a territory doesn’t have any uranium nodes for itself, it will likely buy uranium at a higher than average price\n•	Random events can show short-lived deals on certain resources, or price hikes in certain bases. Helpful for a quick payday.\n•	Could be a bit more user friendly, perhaps allowing automatic logging of prices whenever a player visits a location\n	Base Building (8/10)\n•	More complex than combat and trading, doesn’t feel like a chore\n•	Very rewarding, gaining territories and base upgrades alike have immediate and tangible benefits, such as increased passive income and real time intel on fleet positions\n•	Has some basic tower defense elements\no	Presentation\n	Visuals and audio are very generic. You won’t see or hear anything that stands out from other games\n	Haven’t detected any real bugs, gamebreaking nor otherwise\n	Does not seem to require much to run. Could probably play this on a potato\n	Despite being generic, it isn’t hard to look at\no	Impression\n	A very interesting title with complex mechanics built on plain visuals.\n	Excellently implemented. Occasionally unsure how to progress, often resolved through a bit of menu exploration\n	AI is competent and intelligent on the macroscale, doesn’t seem too smart in direct fleet battles\n	Would love to play with friends. Fun enough to solo.\n\n\n","February 11","true","26.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

I looked at some videos and streams and it seems like this doesn't change after hours of playing. I did not see much about strategie, not in my short playtime and not in the videos.\n\nI am also not a fan of taking money and resources over to a new game. Some stats and ranks are no problem, but making two galaxies to farm in the one for the other to have a chance against the AI (that starts really strong) sounds not like fun.\n\nIts a good base and it could probably become a great game but i became unsure when i read that the devs plan to get into beta soon. As the game is now, its just not enough for the price. I will put this game on my watchlist and will maybe try again when its done.","July 2, 2015","false","1.0"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","10","23","0","0"

You build your city, you build your fleet, and try to win using 1 of 3 generic 4X victory conditions.\n\nDepth level is standard in what you would find in a game for this price, and while you are given options to play the game "peacefully", they are limited and impractical. Meanwhile, the militaristic approach is also limited, since you can only destroy a limited amount of assets of another city before you're forced to accept their surrender or sour your relations with the rest of the AI. It's not all bad though, as it works in your favor too if you get gangbanged.\n\nThat aside, you should be able to squeeze dozens of time-killing hours out of Beyond Sol, most of which will be fun. Just don't do it on a huge map or you will end up re-doing your game because of a poorly optimized engine.","May 30","true","64.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
