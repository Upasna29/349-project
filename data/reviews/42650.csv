"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/recommended/42650/","ericjdouglas","koala fish mutant bird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ericjdouglas/","561 products in account","This is one of the most gratifying things about being an older gamer: when fans of popular franchises grow up and get jobs in the video game industry. A lot of uncharitable things can be said for media culture's habit of remaking, rebooting and rehashing old stories, but when it's done from the heart like Transformers: War for Cybertron plainly is, the result is very often a damn good time. See Joss Whedon's "Avengers" or Quentin Tarantino's "Kill Bill" movies: both are exuberant love letters to their source material and it shows.\n\nIf you have fond memories of the 1980s iteration of The Transformers[www.imdb.com] cartoon up to and including the 1986 movie[www.imdb.com], High Moon Studios' first TF outing is a high-octane shot of finely-tuned nostalgia. From the minute you start up one of the game's two single-player campaigns (one for the Decepticons, and one for the Autobots - just for story's sake, I recommend you play them in that order, although the game gives you the option to choose), you will feel like a kid again, plopped in front of the TV after school watching the Autobots smash the bolts out of some Decepticreeps. Peter Cullen voices Optimus for the umpteenth time and hits it out of the park of course, and while he is, I believe, the only voice actor present from the original series, the rest of the talent is excellent and written in exactly the same style as the old cartoons. So you get the familiar banter of Megatron/Starscream, Megatron/Soundwave (the original bromance), Soundwave/everyone, Starscream/Skywarp/Thundercracker, Optimus/Ironhide, Bumblebee/everyone, but also some not-so-familiar characters like Air Raid & Warpath, both of which are hilariously scripted and voiced and really feel like they could be right out of the show. The story is a straight prequel of the cartoon: Cybertron is a war-torn mechanical planet, the Decepticons want to grab all the power they can, the Autobots kinda don't want them to, someone gets a little too Dr. Strangelove on things and oops, we have to leave the planet because we broke it. You're not gonna get Spec Ops: The Line or Bioshock Infinite out of this -- it's robots beating the crap out of each other, innit? But it is a pitch-perfect story with a delicious topping of fanboyism and if you're the target audience even a tiny bit, you'll love it.\n\nSo what about the game itself? Well... I hesitate to say too much because my inner kid loves the theme-park-ness to pieces, but it is unfortunately a rather average third-person shooter. That's not to say it's badly done, it's not. Technically it's spot-on, it looks good and plays well, but does it do anything new? Not really. It should have a cover system, it doesn't. You can transform into whatever vehicle your chosen robot is, which is awesome, but it doesn't really matter other than stretches of levels where it's either transform or run a lot (and you run slow, but okay, you weigh ten tons). The controls for vehicle mode are kind of frustrating (game devs: no one enjoys driving with a mouse. It was new and weird in Borderlands, it's old and annoying now. It really is. Stop doing it) and it's disappointing that you don't get a greater sense of speed when you're in "boost mode". The guns sound great, but they could have more variety. The world certainly looks like Cybertron, which again: awesome, however all the metal-on-metal-with-the-occasional-sky motif can be a little boring. But Cybertron is basically Coruscant with less trees, so I'm not sure what else they were supposed to do. There's not a lot in the way of exploration, either for collectibles (there are some, but they very much feel like an afterthought) or just because, and it can't be called anything but a very linear experience. But that's more or less okay since it really tries to be an extended episode of the cartoon, and in that, it succeeds. Hugely. But... all of that does sadly mean that in my opinion if you have little to no desire in watching a bunch of robots shoot each other while making snarky comments, you will probably not miss much by giving this game a pass. There are much better shooters if that's what you want.\n\nBut if you are a Transformers fan at all, grab this. Grab it grab it grab it. It's fantastic, and I can't wait to play Fall of Cybertron.\n\n(Quick note on multiplayer (and a quick note is all it is since I have no experience with it): it's supposed to be good. Fall of Cybertron is supposed to be even better. That's it! There are plenty of other reviews for the multiplayer side and the consensus is, again, "good". "Fun", even. I don't know what else to tell you.)","February 14, 2014","true","46.6"," 124 of 130 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","124","130","0","10"

It has Transformers\n2. It is amazing\n3. It uses a lot of G1 influences meaning all the characters are their loveable and awesome selves, just as you remember them as a kid\n4. The robots have all been redesigned with a modern look but still manages to capture the essence of the cartoons\n5. Peter Cullen\n6. The gameplay is awesome\n7. The transformations are seemless\n8. The shooting is incredibly satisfying\n9. The voice acting is god damn great\n10. Megatron is so gar, you can't help but follow him\n11. Optimus Prime is as gar as Megatron\n12. The world building and the atmosphere in this game is so effective that you do actually feel like you're in a war in a dying planet filled with robots\n13. You fight a boss so big and so powerful that you have to enter himself, disable him from the inside, escape his inside before he crushes you as he transforms, plummet from space to the planet below WHILE fighting the boss and then watch him crash land like a comet into the ground...\n14. AND THEN fight him again cuz he's such a badass and that crash land was apparently just a 't'is but a scratch' situation before you can finally take down this behemoth\n15. Incredible boss fights not limited to the one above\n16. Scenery Porn (especially if you like metal-themed environments)\n17. Memorable Characters\n18. Bumblebee is voiced by Lelouch vi Brittania\n19. Multiplayer Co-op\n20. Catchphrases, One-liners, War Banters and Transformer Jargon are all music to your ears as you play\n21. Did I mention the voice acting is great?\n22. The voice acting is friggin' great\n23. You can fly\n24. You can drive\n25. You can shoot stuff\n26. You can shoot stuff while flying\n27. You can shoot stuff while driving\n28. You can shoot stuff while flying, transform to a robot and proceed to shoot more stuff, transform into a jet and zoom past the baddies and into a sniping point, turn around, shoot stuff, transform and shoot stuff with your sniping weapon :D\n29. You can shoot stuff while driving, ram into the enemies, shoot stuff while reversing, transform and shoot them in the face, run up to them and melee them in the face, transform and drive away :D\n30. This game made me realise how incredibly bad the Bayformers were.","October 25, 2014","true","11.1"," 109 of 117 people (93%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","93","109","117","39","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealCaptainPrice/recommended/42650/","RealCaptainPrice","Captain Price","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealCaptainPrice/","109 products in account","If you are a true Transformers fan, then you will love the game. A  neat feature about the game is that there are 10 chapters; the chapters are LONG. The first 5 chapters you will play as the Decepticons and the last 5 chapters, you will play as the Autobots.\n\nA cool thing about War for Cybertron is when you select a chapter, you can decide if you want to be Megatron, Barricade, Star Scream or even Sound Wave and a few others. My all time favorite Decepticon to play, would be Megatron. Megtron's main weapon is a huge cannon, which knocks an autobot down in one hit! Star Scream is also really sweet to play, he is quick and has a deadly weapon.\n\n\nOn the Autobot side, you can play as Optimus Prime! (like we didn't know already lol). He is really cool. His main weapon is a awesome assault weapon. A few characters you can play on the Autobot side, are Optimus, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jetfire and a few more. Probably my two favorite are Optimus and Ironhide.\n\nThe campaign is pretty good. I read the book, "War for Cybertron" a year before I played the actual game. I enjoyed the game because it explained things better than the book. There were only a few things I didn't like; one was when you played as the Decepticons, the Autobots sometimes acted like bad guys when they shouldn't. For exmaple - autobot "I am going to destroy you!!". That seems like something Megatron would say. lol.\n\nThe graphics are pretty decent. The only downfall to the game, which is biggest issue for me, is that it's capped at 30fps so you won't be able to go past that (unless you download programs which I don't recommend). Since it's capped, it's best to keep the settings on low so it will run smoothly. There are times that my PC stuttered because of the 30 cap and it's not because my PC isn't good. My PC can run alll CoD games on High-Extra.\n\nOther than the 30 cap, my next issue is that the last chapter was a little "lame" as for it was similar to the Autobot's campaign. I won't reveal any more info than this as I don't want to ruin it others. :\\n\nAs a side note, when I first launched it on Windows 8.1, it wouldn't load. If you expenience this issue, move the Physx file to desktop and  launch the game, (it will give an error, after that,  put the Physx file back where you found it), then launch it again and it should run.\n\nOverall, good story, fun Decepticons/Autobots characters, decent graphics, = Worth it!","December 2, 2015","true","12.5"," 79 of 86 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","79","86","8","4"

Wrap your brain around that. High Moon Studios clearly cares about the franchise, and went to some lengths to include a large number of popular Transformers, as well as lesser known ones. This game is not related to the Michael Bay movies. Even if the action is a little repetitive, it's a bold move to make a three-player coop, no cover system, third person shooter nowadays. The voice acting is fantastic, and the last couple missions are really awesome. If you like Tranformers, It's a solid A. For everyone else, it's a decent action game.","November 25, 2013","true","7.1"," 71 of 75 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","71","75","0","0"

You take part as an important member of Decepticons or Autobots and have to destroy a lot of Transformers shooting at them or hitting them with your melee weapon.Thankfully, War for Cybertron impresses with an excellent single-player campaign with full co-op support, the included Horde-alike Escalation mode, and surprisingly deep and inventive online multiplayer component.After years of uninspired movie-licensed games, we finally get to run, fly and drive around with the Transformers and be happy about it. The lacking AI and unvaried fighting sections kill some of the fun, but the game does have a lot of redeeming factors and with a second player you'll feel right at home.A little bit more polish could have made this game a blockbuster title.","May 4, 2014","true","105.2"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","41","44","0","5"

Though the story and execution are not as epic as the sequel - Fall of Cybertron - the overall gameplay is still thoroughly enjoyable and well paced. WfC also offers a bit better vehicle sections than FoC, and way better and more challenging boss fights. Not to mention, being able to select one of three characters available for a specific chapter is definitely a plus.\n\nPeople familiar with the Transformers will immediatelly appreciate the amazing animations and the artstyle faithful to Generation One, but the overall graphics are impressive on their own. One drawback I can think of in that regard is that it can be too dark/brown at times, with enemies being hard to distinguish from the rest of the environment. As for the audio, let's just say it's almost flawless, featuring some great music tracks, quite powerful sound effects, and an amazing voiceover, with numerous actors reprising their roles as familiar robots from the original show.\n\nStill, even though the PC port is very much playable, it's quite lacking in many respects. From unrebindable controls, 30fps lock, minimal graphics options, to a complete lack of DLC, and multiplayer being full of cheaters. That aside though, it's still an awesome shooter, worth playing despite these drawbacks for the story campaign alone.","June 23, 2015","true","21.0"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","36","37","3","0"

The Cybertronian Civil War takes a turn when Megatron and his Decepticons get hold of an ancient power source, just as a new Autobot leader emerges to face him.\n\nPros: The story, although linear, is solid with great voice acting and writing, as you walk the grounds of Cybertron facilities, prisons and cities in a 10-chapter campaign that has you battling in squads of iconic characters from the series. Each chapter will have you choose from three characters with different class, weapons and vehicle form, a selection that varies with each chapter. Transforming is an essential part of combat, as robot form allows you to jump, do special moves and carry up to two weapons, while vehicle mode allows faster movement and alternative weapon. Graphics are pretty good, textures being higher resolution in-game than in cut scenes, while sound effects feel genuine to Transformers.\n\nCons: Besides being able to transform, combat is nothing special, as there is no cover system beyond moving your character behind an obstacle, and weapons go from generic machine gun to generic shotgun, generic missile launcher, generic sniper, and anything in between. You might think melee combat would be an alternative, but in fact it feels worst as each melee strike takes a few seconds to complete, meaning you'll avoid using it at all in tougher fights unless the enemy AI happens to come within range. The characters, enemies, obstacles and backgrounds all have the same aesthetic and look, making it hard to know what's what in the heat of a firefight. As for the campaign length, well, let's just say they could've been longer seeing the only replay value lies with what's left of the multiplayer community.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!\n\nThis isn't the Arkham Asylum of Transformers, but it's no doubt the best we'll get. Hasbro has certified it as an official canon prequel to the Transformers, so it's pretty awesome for a fan to see how Starscream came to join the Decepticon, how Optimus became a Prime, and what caused Cybertron to require evacuation. While non-fans may find this game to be a plain 3rd Person Shooter, I still strongly recommend it!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","February 13","true","10.1"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","35","37","4","0"

Very chaotic and immersive coupled with a compelling story. It's flaws are present, but not game breaking. Hail Megatron!\n\nA grand justification to the  brand. Transformers: War for Cybertron redifines the bots we know and love without straying too far from the G1 look and feel. This game is action packed from start to finish. Explosions and debris a plenty.\n\nThe graphics and gameplay are astonishing. From the opening cutscene you see Cybertron unfold like never before. High Moon Studios developed a game with a high degree for attention to detail, from fluid tranformations (that never get old) to moving to making the planet feel alive. When there was a full scale battle the player can feel like there are actual bots fighting on the allied side and the opposing side. One thing I didn't like was the scaling of the bot models. There should be a very noticeable size difference between someone like Megatron and Starscream.\n\nThe game mechanics are nice, but flawed. Shooting and switching weapons is very snappy and responsive on the gamepad and mouse. The melee system leaves too much to be desired. The animation can vary from being too delayed to being too prolonged. The ammo system can be very frustrating. Ammo is more scarce then I would have liked, but the reloading is fluid. I would have done away with the whole system completely. A cooldown method would have been more effective and immersive. Or maybe nothing of the sort at all. I also would have liked if the guns were for sci-fi like. The various weapons were too human-esque for my liking. A Bay approach to the weapons would have been worlds better.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game immensely and I am eager to play the second.","December 30, 2014","true","11.7"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","2"

It's got a variety of missions and plenty of characters to choose from in this double-sided campaign.\n\nThere's so much to say about this game and how much it surprised me when I first played it. It's smooth and polished gameplay made it very to get into from the start. You wouldn't think that a game set in a metallic world could become so immersive but High Moon Studios did an amazing job of making you feel as if you are on the planet.\n\nThe game is broken up into different levels so it's not an open world game, however, each level are a pretty decent size and there are multiple ways to go about them. Each level allows you to select between 3 characters and each has their own unique special ability.  They look different and their transformations and speed are different.\n\nThere's alot going on in the game, whether you are looking at what's going on right in front of you or maybe some space battle happening in the distance, the world is full of things for you to look at and it does really look like a war is going on. The world is made of moving parts, so it's not like the characters are the only things that transform and have moving parts, moreover the planet is alivea and waiting for you to rescue it.\n\nPros  Exceptional voice acting\nDiverse choice of characters from Autobots and Decepticons\nSmooth driving mechanics, shooting feels great\nDoesn't get boring - even though all you do is run around and shoot stuff\nDecent  story\nController support\nCons  Few graphics options\nEverything looks like metal so it can be confusing\nNo reason to play it after you've beaten it\nFinal Thoughts:\nA great Transformers game, hits all the right strings for true fans of the franchise. Easy to pick up and master and the game's not short. A great start to the Cybertron game series. Also, don't buy this for the multiplayer, buy it for the single player experience.\n\nRating (8.5 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","May 26","true","15.4"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","4"

The best Transformers show ever is Beast Wars. Nothing is even close. If Hasbro didn't interfere it could be perfect show. G1 is only "great" because of nostalgia. It was nothing more than commercial for toys in the form of cartoon – season 2 episodes are pure commercials, you can watch them in random order because they are not connected in any way! Why I mention this?\n\nWell, WfC is mix of BW and G1. It has very good storytelling and focus on handful number of Transformers just like BW, but in terms of actual story and presentation it's heavily influenced by G1. According to Hasbro, the game is part of the same aligned continuity family as Exodus novel and Prime cartoon (joke show), except in reality there are big differencies.\n\nFirst, it's a must to install the latest PhysX driver otherwise game won't even start!\nUse SweetFX to drastically enchance graphics.\n\nPros\n+ excellent story\n+ no Bay s.it\n+ Transformers mostly look and are characterised like G1 counterparts\n+ you can always choose between three Transformers before every mission and every one of them has unique specials\n+ in every mission you are accompanied by two other Transformers\n+ QTEs are almost non-existing\n\nCons\n- game is locked in 30 fps (it can be unlocked)\n- graphics is a bit dated (SweetFX fix it)\n- both campaigns are mostly carbon copy in terms of enemies and missions\n- level 8 defending Omega Supreme is impossible on medium difficulty after 75% recharging because Decepticons just easily kill Ratchet and than you\n- no Steamworks integration: it's a shame because 360/PS3 version has 51 achievements/trophies! Really devs?\n- MP is expectedly mostly dead, but there are few players in the evening\n\nAll in all, High Moon Studios did good job. Must buy for every Transformers fan.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","July 8, 2014","true","12.4"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

This game shows the lore and the war of the days of Cybertron and the Autobot's struggle against the Decipticons. It has decent graphics, since the game is a few years old, great mechanics with a controller or mouse and keyboard, and a good storyline. You start off with the Decepticon campaign, then the Autobots, but you can decide when to start off at. Transforming into a vehicle never gets old and seriously helps you sometimes. It has a campaign where there's 3 characters to play as and the Co-Op campaign makes it re-playable.

You can download an uncapper (see the game's PCGamingWiki entry) that will allow you to unlock the frame rate with no negative gameplay effects. With the uncapper, I was able to get 60 fps most of the time on my i5-3470/GTX 970 system. There were still sporadic moments where it would dip back into the 30s for a few seconds, though this happened even on minimum settings, so I have to assume this was just the result of some flaw that the uncapper couldn't fix rather than my hardware. These were rare enough to not negatively affect my enjoyment of the game.\n\nGameplay review: This game is actually the first Transformers story I've ever experienced in any medium and I enjoyed the story more than I was expecting. I think a lot of that has to do with the great voice acting.\n\nThe gameplay is generic, but satisfying, third-person shooting that succeeds because of the sheer amount of spectacle. It's quite linear but the strong pacing kept me interested regardless.\n\nThe game is split into two five-mission campaigns: the initial Decepticon campaign, which features Megatron doing generic evil genius stuff, and the Autobot campaign, in which Optimus attempts to foil Megatron's plans.\n\nWhile the gameplay between the two campaigns is mostly the same, the Autobot campaign is much harder than the Decepticon campaign. I played on hard, and despite the campaigns having the same number of levels, it took me 4 hours to beat the Decepticon campaign and 10 hours to beat the Autobot campaign. Even on hard, the Decepticon campaign is staggeringly easy, but the degree of difficulty ramps up massively in the second mission of the Autobot campaign and remains that way until the end of the game.\n\nThe main reason for this is a difference in the design of the combat spaces between the two campaigns: Levels in the Decepticon campaign tend to feature lots of linear corridors and small rooms with plenty of cover, which means you can stand behind cover and blast enemies to your heart's content. Rooms also usually only feature 3-5 enemies at most. However, in the Autobot campaign, you're frequently placed into large arena-like spaces with very limited cover, limited health pick-ups, and overwhelming numbers of spongey enemies. Dodging and pinpoint accuracy become essential for survival. The degree with which the difficulty increases almost made me give up, but I stuck it out until the end I guess through stubbornness?\n\nIf you don't like being frustrated by your games, you might want to play this one on medium. If you like a real challenge, play on hard, and you'll find what you're looking for once you get through the first five easy levels.","February 19","true","14.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Also I may not be completely familiar with the story but but I think they're using the canonic timeline and I'm glad it doesn't take place on the familiar earth setting since not one of the games that used it were that good really.\n\nOn to the actual game then. It has some solid shooting mechanics, a nice variety of weapons to use and the action sequences are broken up between sections where you have to use your vehicle form which is quite nice especially when playing the flying transformers. Also what I noticed this time round is that the lack of ammo in some sections makes you use the vehicle form in combat as well since ammo for that is separate...no idea if that was intentional but it's good to have a use for it outside the specially designed parts of the game. Bad parts being that while the overall design of the areas is quite good it also gets repetitive and the color pallete could have been better but as far as I know that and other things were fixed in the sequel which I'm looking forward to getting sometime in the near future.","January 13, 2014","true","6.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/droniac/recommended/42650/","droniac","Droniac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/droniac/","884 products in account","I liked Transformers: War for Cybertron even though I should've hated it. It's a straightforward third-person shooter that doesn't do anything particularly well. The shooting is average, the movement is sub-par, the environments are entirely linear corridor-style affairs - even when flying in space. But the Transformers save the day with their ridiculous over-the-top dialogue and voice acting. It also helps that enemies and environments are suitably epic.\n\nSo what's the game about? Transforming cars/planes fighting each other on their mechanical home planet. That's awesome if you're a Transformers fan. It's also awesome if you've never seen a Transformers movie / cartoon / comic ever. Don't bother with the details; they don't matter. Purple is fighting Red - that's all you need to know.\n\nTwo short campaigns - one each for the Decepticons and Autobots - fill in the singleplayer offering. But these are also playable in co-op with up to 2 friends. In singleplayer you get two AI buddies who tend to be in your way more than they actually help out. The game is substantially better - and easier - in co-op. Then there's a horde mode and regular old multiplayer. No one really seems to be playing those anymore, so let's just stick with the campaign / co-op.\n\nSo far it doesn't sound all that bad, so why should I have hated it? That's where the horrendous PC port rears its ugly head. Transformers: War for Cybertron fails on nearly every level a port can fail at. Every horror story you've heard about awful PC ports is present in this one. A ridiculous 30FPS limit. Non-rebindable keys with awful default settings. Terrible texturework throughout. Zero graphics options. Noticeable mouse acceleration, albeit far from the worst I've seen. Random crashing. Alt-tab crashing. You name it, this game's got it.\n\nI managed to unlock the FPS using a third party tool. Likewise added anti-aliasing using nvidiaInspector, because simply forcing through drivers doesn't work. After that it was mostly playable apart from occasional crashes. The aforementioned should've ruined the experience for me, but the insane setpieces and awesome Transformers still made it work.\n\nIf there was ever a game that deserved to be called greater than the sum of its parts, this is it.\n\nConclusion / TLDR\nTransformers: War for Cybertron is fun to play, particularly with friends. But it's a deeply flawed experience, mainly due to constant severe technical difficulties. It's worth playing, but only just - and probably better on consoles.\n\nTechnical Droning\nFPS Limit - 30 FPS\n120Hz - No\nBorderless Window - No\nGraphics Options - None\nTexture Quality - Low\nMouse Acceleration - Noticeable\nKey Rebinding - No","May 27, 2014","true","10.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Both campaign and multiplayer are outstanding and mind blowing. The campaign allows options for multiple characters each level so the variety is great between players. However the games combat can get somewhat reppetitive (especially on your 3rd playthrough) throughout the story. The game allows for a point of view on both the autobots and decepticons sides of the war on cybertron, and it allows for many playable characters on both sides. The games campaign was very amazing to see how the was was for both sides. Although the gameplay was amazing the AI enemies were mostly smart and okay but very few glitched out or just misbehaved. The bossfights for the most part were great however the final boss (not spoiling anything but if you played it you know who it is) was somehwat underwelming. After I completed the amazing campaign I stepped into multiplayer and although it doesnt allow for the best character customization, it still gets the job done. The multiplayer although somewhat empty due to how old the game is is somewhat empty. I found that the most players online at a single time averaged about 8-11. The multiplayer is outstanding and after many hours still great to play. You can choose your weapons and abilities and then use them in multiplayer. You can also choose your vehicle as either a car, tank, or plane (plane is best). The weapons have many options from assault rifles to shotguns to snipers. The maps are all very different, most are medium size to big which will allow for different play styles for all different players.\n\nThe graphics hold up well especially for a 7 year old game (or however old it is) and on max settings can even compete with some (but not many) current games coming out today. Anyway this game is amazing and you should definetly consider buying it if you havent done so already. 9.8/10","April 16","true","7.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Maybe.\n\n-=TL;DR=-\nIt's a solid, but standard non-cover based third person shooter that's  respectful to the Transformer universe and not related to the Michael Bay films. The campaign is generally well-paced (though, levels were a tad longer than I wanted) and provided a mostly fufilling insight into the backstory of the Transformers. Multiplayer is dead (0 players in any playlist), though co-op has about 30-70 regularl players as of June 2014, though I find it inferior to other popular co-op horde shooters. WFC is a no brainer for Transformers fans, and a good buy at a sale for others. It's clearly a console port with no rebindable keys, no achievements, no form of multiplayer chat (on a PC shooter? Are you kidding me?) and a 29 FPS cap (fixable with a 3rd party software)\n\n-=Presentation=-\nWFC looks last gen: many textures are blurry, especially on boss type enemies, polygon edges are clearly visible on round objects , and plays at a capped 29FPS. The game isn't ugly (except for close ups on some textures) and looks great for it's time. I love cyber/techpunk environments, so I enjoy the sci-fi look of the game. While the world does suffers from typical shooter browngrey syndrome, theres' many splashes of color thanks to lighting effects of objects and certain background features as well as the robots themselves.\nTransformers fans will like that this has no relation to the Michael Bay films. While still 90% action and explosions, you're not dealing with humans and none of the immature humor  is here. Thankfully, comedy mostly come from interactions with specific characters, but without the corniness of the orignal toon. WFC, in my opinion, provides a great insight into the Transformers origins, as somebody who has only seen limited viewings of the original and Armada cartoons as well as the Bay films. You get a better sense of why the robots are fighting, instead of "those bots are purple and bad and must be defeated by the nice, red robots" and the amount of destruction and "death" of Transformer-kind gives you context into why the war is such a big deal to them. That said, the Decepticon side seems a bit stupid if they want to complete their goal, as Megatron's philosophy boils down to "destroy everything and kill those who are weak". You don't get the ability to revive non-essential NPCs until the Autobot campaign - Megatron doesn't want to help his fellow army, but ♥♥♥♥♥es if he isn't healed. Thankfully, he isn't as stupid as he was in the show, as he wants to kill Starscream who clearly intends on betraying him, but simply doesn't have the time or the ability to thanks to the war and their locations at the time.\nIt's absolutely fantastic that they have the original Optimus Prime voice actor who is among my all time favorite voices. I don't know if any other character voices are from the original show, but most of the main characters are fit perfectly. The soundtrack isn't must-have, but there are some nice epic/rock themes and the original 80's hair metal theme in the credits is delightful to hear. The majority of the music fits the setting well.\n\n-=Gameplay=-\nGameplay here is uninteresting besides transforming. This provides faster movement and a 3rd or 4th weapon depending on the bot. In some cases, the transformation for some bots is a little OP as you might be able to constantly hover, dodge and shoot with unlimited ammo, compared to the limited ammo of ground weapons which can easily be drained if you're not accurate and using melee and abiliites.  Vehicle mode is either used to travel a long distance or to escape. Thankfully, controlling the vehicle is fairly easy - it makes me wonder why there isn't some "Transformers Arena" car combat/racing game spinoff based off this mechanic. Oddly enough, vehicle mode feels very slow compared to driving a car in most games, and is really more of a sprint for these guys. Considering their size, it probably would look faster compared to a human, but looks slow in the context of Transformers.\nThere's no cover system, so survival is mostly about killing the enemy first and hiding. As I said before, ammo is a problem in bot mode, so you must be accurate and use melee often. All bots have two abilities, one goverened by a cooldown and the other by energon pickups from killed enemies. I rarely used them due to their limited use and usually, it was better to stay at range and shoot, instead of using abilities, with a few exceptions. Occasionally, you will also have grenades.\nAlso, it never pays to be a healer player in the campaign, your two sidekicks never die and if you're the healing player, then the other teammates won't be able to heal you. Like most shooters, the majority of enemies go down faster than you, though you can get killed pretty easily if you're not careful. It's inconsistent as you watch scenes of bots fighting head to head while you must run cover to cover to fight against groups. You wlll also do 98% of the combat work and 100% of the "Press E to interact" work (except for when team mates use turrets), but thankfully, your teammates are half-decent at attracing some fire from you and killing a few enemies here and there.\nI did like that the final battle was against an albiet cliche, giant, big bad robot. But the battle itself was cheesy and annoying - the boss can kill you relatively easily with missles that almost never miss (and honestly, he should be able to just grab and crush or smash the Autobots with ease), yet, you can hide yourself in an alcove on the left side of the map and take no damage. It's very stupid to go from, "How the hell do I survive these impossible rockets" to "Let's huddle here in this spot indefinitely while the boss shoots at the cover with futility". The overall battle was a pretty lame "shoot explosive containers" and then "hit the weakpoint for massive damage" trope.\nDon't buy this for Multiplayer - even with 69 players online, nobody was playing it. The Co-op is where most of these people are at. At it's core, it's a fairly decent "kill waves of enemies you fought in campaign" while earning points. However, the point system is massively flawed - if you join a room late in the game, you will  run out of ammo shooting enemies that require tons of damage and can kill you fast. And since the ONLY way to get points is to kill enemies (that's right, no points for assists or anything else), you won't be able to buy weapons, help team mates open doors, restock ammo or even just restore health. While sharing points to open doors or purchase items is neat, it's absolutely incompetent that you can get stuck with no chance of redemption unless you start in an early round or get the last hit like a MOBA. Some of you can probably put up with it if you have a decent team and you START AT THE FIRST WAVE, but the Co-op from Mass Effect 3 and Warframe are better in every aspect.\n\n-=Conclusion=-\nWFC does justice to the Transformer universe, and I'm looking forward to Fall of Cybertron since I've heard good reviews. The gameplay is solid, though, largely unremarkable except for the transformer mechanic, in which honestly, I didn't use often, except for when I could abuse unlimited ammo. The overall presentation is pretty good and in some cases awesome. It can be beat in about 10-12 hours and I recommend medium difficulty - even though I can play well on hard, it made some sections irritating and I just want to clear my backlog. $20 would generally be a fair price, but in the era of PC game discounts and bundles, Activision should sell this no more than $15. Wait for a sale where it's often less than $10.","June 6, 2014","true","13.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Most sections are designed for robot combat and you'll strafe around shooting at the opposition but a few areas are designed for mobility in mind where transforming into your vehicle mode is required. These segments are well done and the transition from robot to vehicle feels as good as you'd expect it should. The shooting segments can get repetitive and with out a cover option you'll find yourself mostly strafing back and forth to avoid fire which feels a bit clunky. You'll often find your friendly AI companions getting in the way and they 're really only there for you to have a choice of one of three characters to choose from at the beginning of each mission and for bantering back and forth. There was never a time I felt like they did any thing to help me, and a few times where they got in the way.\n\nMultilayer is a lot more fun then I expected. You level up your class, customize skills based off your play style. Its actually pretty diverse and fun.\n\nThe game can be visually cluttered at times, as a living robotic planet with lots of moving parts is important to the setting but can get sort of messy on screen when laser battles are breaking out and you're shifting in between robot and vehicle forms but it's a minor complaint. If you play with a controller it's a bit annoying that it's only partially supported, so get used to memorizing buttons as every in-game prompt you see will be keyboard & mouse specific. I never ran into any major problems because of this but it was annoying.\n\nAll and all a fun time to be had, especially if you're a fan of the series. And it's got a Stan Bush song... What else can I say?","June 27, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But the few gems, like Batman Forever 64 and Transformers: WFC really stand out.\n\nI absolutely adore this game. War for Cybertron is an extremely well executed game. The transforming mechanic feels natural and really contributes to gameplay (unlike what other people say, vehicle mode is a great way to get around and beat bosses). The downside is that a lot of the minibosses are rather generic and can get pretty boring.\n\nBut the locations, OH the locations. Whoever was the environmental artist is awesome. The levels look amazing and are easily navigable (there's a few parts where this isn't the case).\n\nThe singleplayer lasts for quite awhile and is a lot of fun to play. The multiplayer is also good. There are a few weapons that are overpowered, but overall, it's okay. Disappointingly, there are very few people online, with the most I've seen being about 132.\n\nVerdict: BUY","January 1, 2011","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

My friends and I launched ourselves to the top of the escalation leaderboards, becoming frustrated at the bugs plaguing the PS3 version that prevented you from playing escalation indefinitely. When you made it so far in the PS3 version of escalation, the game would for some reason begin to glitch and freeze after some time, causing you to lose all your points. Eventually, we decided we would glitch through the walls and jump off the map to kill ourselves at wave 50 so we didn't lose all our points when we inevitably froze.\n\nThen the PS3 network got hacked, and I went out and bought a 360 (after the network was down for two weeks) literally JUST to play this game. I of course got the Halo games and Skyrim and other fun games for 360, but I mostly played WFC.\n\nThen I got my new job and games had much less time in my life, but this one always held a place in my heart. Eventually I made the jump to a PC and built my first rig, buying this game as soon as I downloaded Steam.\n\nThis game is the best. I love how they captured the feel of Cybertron and the feel of G1. The drop-in drop-out co-op is an excellent system to play through the campaign with your friends. Though I will say that a big flaw of that system is the limited availability of the weapons and ammo for all three players. Even more annoying is when a noob joins and dies constantly and causes you to keep replaying the same part of that mission until they either leave or somehow make it through.\nMultiplayer, while fun, is dead. Even when it's not dead, hackers are a constant annoyance. They are the worst.\n\nI mostly focus on escalation now, as I did before. The online community for this game is very limited, as there are few people who want to play a nearly six year old Transfomers game that was a "meh" port at best. Online communications are non existent. In game, you are required to make a new account to play. You don't need to register an Email address or anything, just type a name in and if it's not taken then it's yours. You add friends you meet online by typing in their names and waiting for them to accept your request. There is no voice chat, there is no text chat. The port to PC was lazily and hastily done and the online experience suffers as a result. The framerate is also capped at 30FPS for no damn reason. Thankfully, Googling "Transformers: War for Cybertron frame unlocker" will lead you to a third-party free-to-use tool that can unlock it for you. And they also chose to not allow DLC for this game which is crap. You can unlock the characters through googling "Transformers: War for Cybertron coalesced.ini" which will lead you to a guide and a new ini file which fixes a few things and allows you to play as the DLC characters, but doesn't give you the maps. The new maps were awesome, and I think that PC players are seriously missing out on those maps because High Moon was too damn lazy to make a proper PC port. After you download those two things though, the game is much more enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, it's a great, amazing Transformers experience. I love it. I've always loved it, and will play it for as long as it continues to be supported. But user beware, there is very little of the online community that once populated this game left. If you have a PS3 or 360, I would recommend playing it on either of those platforms instead, but the 360 will be more enjoyable. And you'll be able to get a used copy for the consoles much cheaper I'm sure. Still, if you must play it on PC, it's still a blast. Despite my griping, I would highly recommend this game to anyone with a soft spot for Transformers, or who enjoys a well built, fun to play, fast paced shooter.","May 8","true","52.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sinistersandwich/recommended/42650/","Sinistersandwich","-Ω-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sinistersandwich/","172 products in account","Initially, I bought the game because I was a huge Transformers fan and it looked pretty awesome from the trailer.\n\nBut, after buying this game (on disk initially, then on Steam a few months ago during a sale) I can truly say that this game has merits not related to anything Transformers.\n\nFor example, all of the gameplay you can do in War for Cybertron can be multiplayer. Now, I'm a fan of all things multiplayer, because it keeps making the gameplay different. As long as you play with other people, no one match will be the same. This game requires a high level of adaptivity and improvisation, and I can honestly say it's one of the harder games I've played.\n\nLet's break down the other aspects of this game, shall we?\n\nFirst off, the campaign.\nWhile playing through the campaign, I found myself stopping to admire the levels. Everything in this game is beautiful, intricate, and promises grandeur. Albeit at some points it's just an incredible backdrop to okay levels, but let me just put it this way: If this game was open world, I wouldn't play anything else.\nThe boss fights were interesting, and get substantially more difficult when you put the game on hard. The characters and abilities that you get to use are incredibly effective, if you take the time to learn how to use them.\n\nSecondly, Escalation mode.\nEscalation is a zombies-like gamemode in which you and at least one other person are trapped in one of two maps, one for Autobots and the other for Decepticons. Waves of increasingly difficult enemies are thrown at you and it becomes harder and harder to survive. You earn points from killing enemies, which you can spend for guns, ammo, health, grenades, anything you need to kill more efficiently. The sigils in the game can be found in the map, instead of any overlay or GUI shop. You can also spend points to open doors, which unlocks further areas in the map that you play as well as unlocking more guns, ammo, etc.\nAll in all, Escalation is pretty fun and challenging, but it does get a bit repeditive.\n\nRegular Multiplayer\nThe multiplayer in War for Cybertron will be different than that from other popular shooter games, as there are only about six maps to choose from, and four classes. The abilities and weapons are wildly customizable, and real skill and strategy are required in order to be any good. But, the fun thing about the multiplayer is that you can suck and still have fun. The multiplayer never gets boring, but it can be a little frustrating at times. Each class has a definitive strategy to it, and you will have your favorite.\nTake, for example, the scout:\nIf you have a good aim, nice reflexes and know the basics of cloak-and-dagger combat, this is the class for you.\nThe soldier, however, is different in every way. Over twice the health, more powerful and easier to use guns, as well as a devestating melee attack and a tank cannon make this character dangerous if used correctly. However, the cliche of the dumb brute also takes hold here, as the soldier is slow and ineffective against fleeing targets. In a fight, however, or gunning down weakened enemies the soldier is a complete powerhouse.\n\nThere's honestly nothing I can say that does this game justice. It's not perfect, yes, but no game is. It has its' quirks, and you're just going to have to get used to them. But, as someone who plays this game almost religiously, I must say that there is more to this game than meets the eye.","May 2, 2014","true","109.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

You can unlock the framerate and remap the controls using available utilities.  You can also, through CCC, "enhance" application AA using Morphological Filtering.  Going in I had not one iota nor inkling about the Transformers universe though I hear this game is faithful to the subject matter.  My lack of knowledge wasn't to my detriment as the game does a fantastic job of indoctrinating the player about the universe surrounding Cybertron.  Graphic fidelity is top notch though being Unreal based the look of all of the levels tends to be homogenous (see my screens).  Transforming between gun a toting robot and  a vehicle is fun.  2 campaigns included.  Choice of Transformer at the start of each level (each with different abilities) is a bonus and a nice touch.  The plethora of  innovative weaponry is great as is the gunplay.  Great set pieces make for an AA title.","July 17, 2011","true","9.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It was mildly interesting getting the back story to what happened close to right before the beginning of the cartoon I watched 25 years ago. The combat was kinda fun. The best parts are the flying levels. The campaign is one story that starts off with the Decepticons doing their dirt, then switches to the Autobots trying to undo what the Decepticons just did. Playing either side feels like the same experience. When playing either side, there's the flying ones, the foot soldiers, the invisible guys, the big  mammoth final boss. Also, it seems like every transformer changes into the same looking car. Megatron and Sound Wave transform into cars, who knew? The game falls a little flat in the weapons department and utilizing the ability to transform too. The weapons aren't very exciting and the Transformers ability to change into vehicles feels like just another mechanic and not something the game was necessarily designed around. The game looks well, but the only video option that can be adjusted is the texture settings. You're definitely going to want to dl and run the frame rate unlocker as the default is capped at 30fps and makes the game look like ♥♥♥♥. If you really love the Transformers or are just curious about the game, I'd recommend getting it when it's on sale.

I don't know, but what I know is that this is a good Transformers game. I mean if you can play as Optimus and Megatron it can't be a bad game, right? And the voice-acting is still done by Peter Cullen who has always been the voice actor for Optimus Prime (or at least in the '80s TV show and the film adaptations).\n\nYou have two separate campaigns (one for the Autobots and one for the Decepticons), each with 5 levels and 3 playable characters. The reason for the 3 characters are the coop approach High Moon studios followed for this game (I understand they skipped this when it comes to the sequel). It's OK to play it alone as the AI can focus on the other two robots and they are actively engaged in combat. Obviously, a human player is much better but the upside is that you do not need to revive them as they basically never perish.\n\n10 hours is not much for the two campaign walkthroughs but the levels are relatively long and varied. Also, there are some pretty neat boss battles where you encounter huge transformers. Ever wanted to defeat Omega Supreme? Or that annoying Tripticon? Now you have the chance for that!\n\nGameplay is pretty straightforward. Sometimes you activate switches to make further progress, other times you just shoot everything that moves. Combat is pretty fluid - your transformers have melee and two abilities that you can charge whilst fighting with the enemy. You can also transform - ground vehicles and planes are options on both sides.\n\nThe game is hard. I mean HARD. But there's a learning curve there so you should keep trying. I guess this is easier if you have friends - still, I enjoyed the single player game alone with the AI controlled assistance.\n\nThere are many references to the Transformers universe which only proves that High Moon Studios was very committed in the making of this game. Too bad the multiplayer is not played any more so I can only comment on the single player campaign.\n\nI recommend this game but for a relatively short campaign 20 EUR is a bit too much. Once it is discounted it should definitely land in your baskets.","April 16, 2014","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is an old school, third-person, corridor, twitch shooter with health packs and power ups. The budget is surprisingly high: the scripted events, animations and graphics are all top-notch and kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of the movies. The plot and dialoge are paper thin, but who cares? You're a giant ♥♥♥♥ing robot with guns for hands who can turn into a jet! The controlls are okay. They're not customizable at all making it blatantly obvious that this is a port. The soundtrack is filled with mediocre metal music with droning guitars and simplistic drums, but most of the time it's drowned out by the screams of Decepticons.

Honestly though, the game has a solid story where you get to see both sides of the war for Cybertron. And seeing the ware take place from both the Decepticons and the Autobots, it's actually easy to align your views with either faction when in the midst of battle. With the Decepticons; you have the minions bickering and often making off comments about Megatron, only to immediately apologize and say they meant someone else, and with the Autobots, you have the stoic leadership of Optimus leading the charge with the quirky charm of side characters like Bumblebee.\n\nIf you don't know the story, basically, there's a civil war going on and Megatron aims to shift the victory towards the Decepticons by taking over a station ran by Starscream and aims to gain control of dark energon. The Autobot story is set, chronologically, after the Decepticon story is over, and it's their re-organization and retaliation for what the Decepticons have done.\n\nWhat I love about Transformers, at least in this game, is there's no emotional attachment to any of the characters. It's a straight up action/3rd person shooter where the goal is to progress deep into enemy territory and win the battle. That's the core concept of it. Both stories are interesting, but ultimately, I think I liked the Decepticon story in this game more, just because of how complex Megatron can be. He's brutal but proud and wants to further the advancement of bots through evil means.\n\nThe other great thing about this game might be the options when it comes to selecting your character. On each mission, you're able to choose between three characters, some repeating themselves, but the character choices were usually different. The graphics do look a bit dated, but it probably doesn't help that the atmosphere for most of the game is dark or indoors where everything is metal or concrete with various lighting setups. Basically, the environments weren't that amazing to look at. But the scope of the outer space scenes was remarkable. Sound design is key here, it's pretty great. I liked the soundtrack too.\n\nNot a perfect game, a bit repetitive with the fighting and the story never really arced, it just kind of flowed in a straight line but I still enjoyed it.\n\n8.5/10","August 12, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It treats the franchise well and the characters have their personalities fully intact and present some great banter from time to time.... so if you're a fan of the series you'll get more out of it, but even if you're not you should have an enjoyable enough time.  Just don't expect TOO much; it's basically a product riding on the combined successes of the first Bay Transformers film and Gears of War, that we were lucky got at least some TLC.","April 24","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Somebody more articulate than I once said that “War for Cybertron” and its sequels were essentially the equivalent of the Batman Arkham games; both reinvent these franchises in the gaming world with gameplay systems that prove surprisingly effective in supporting the setting and characters. Granted, my (albeit limited) knowledge of Transformers doesn’t really include mowing down waves upon waves of nameless Cybertronians using one of three varieties of machine gun, but the core aesthetic of teamed-up, tough-talking transforming space robots is still present and strong.\n\nThe shooting mechanics themselves are thankfully varied; in addition to the existence of a sizable arsenal, the ability to transform into a vehicle and grant yourself a completely different loadout (with its own reserve of ammo) ensures that you never really stop “going” through a level. A lot of the luster in the weaponry lies in the flashy pyrotechnics they produce; it may be an Unreal Engine 3 game, but it still is quite a looker by today’s standards. The game’s excellent pacing exists also in thanks to variability in level design; sure, the concept of the “action setpiece” is an often lambasted one, but the frequency at which War for Cybertron throws different ones at you is something to be admired, at least.\n\nThat said, War for Cybertron is by no means a “Gears of War”-quality TPS; for all of the aftermentioned flashiness and particle effects, there lacks a certain gravity in how weapons effect enemies.  In other words: “bulletsponge” enemies, and a lot of them at that, especially in the late game. Also, the lack of a “hold to aim/zoom” toggle is annoying, but not as sizable a problem as the game’s biggest sin of incomplete controller support. Yes, the game is technically playable using a 360 controller, but good luck finding documentation of any kind on what actions the buttons are assigned to. I’ve also heard that certain vehicle sections are not mapped correctly, making the prospect of successfully using a controller unlikely, to say the least.\n\nFinal words: In the end however, I think Transformers: War for Cybertron is definitely worth a play, because when all is said and done, it’s still a totally competent shooter. By itself, that’s not much of a feat, but when attached to the Transformers brand, of all properties, it totally freaking is.","June 21, 2014","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's like Gears Of War with Transformers. The transform ability is a cool feature (and it looks cool as well), but you won't use it all that often. Besides transforming, you shoot. A lot. In fact, it's pretty much the only thing you'll do in this game. But I expected epic firefights (or battles) and they were nowhere to be found (in my opinion). Now I know the game takes place on Cybertron, so there isn't a whole lot of color, I get that. But after 8 hours of playtime I still have the feeling I've been walking around in circles. A little more variation couldn't have hurt this game. I just hope they'll use Earth, or any other planet with at least a bit of color for that matter, in their next game. And maybe add some cool driving segments. And flying segments. And bunnies. Fluffy bunnies.

The game takes you at the very beginning of the story, when the War for Cybertron started between the Autobots and the Decepticons and gives you the chanse to experience how their war leaded to the destuction of Cybertron.\n\nThe campaign is divided in two parts, first you get to play for Decepticons, and then for Autobots. Every new mission gives you the possibility to choose between three different characters, each of them having specific weapons / abilities and also the vehicle type they can be changed to.\n\nCo-op aka Escalation Mode is a great way to get some fun with your friends, as well as the Multiplayer Mode too, since even if four years passed from the release date - it is still pretty active.\n\nGreat story, decent graphics, awesome gameplay and outstanding voice acting! It deserves a try for sure. So, customize your own transformer as fast as you can and get into the War for Cybertron before it gets too late!","January 14, 2014","true","19.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's fairly short and I can't see it having a ton of replay value but for fans of the series or the comics it's got a lot to like.  It has a lot to gripe about for your really committed fans both in terms of story and game mechanics but it still beats the pants off anything Michael Bay is going to shovel out.  And it still manages to blow up real good too.\n\nThe voice acting is a high point and that's important--the only moderately disappointing spot here was the voice of Warpath sounded more like he was doing Hot Rod with a few "whams" and "booms" sprinkled into his speech.  The character models are all faithful to the Generation 1-leaning Cybertronian look of some of the newer toys and comics as well.  I know I said it was short but I can see the gameplay getting repetitive if it went on for a whole lot longer.\n\nThe transformation mechanic melds well with the overall feel of the gameplay and is fairly smooth and seamless.  While the weapons are a bit iffy, you'll figure out quickly which ones you want and which ones you pick up only if you have no other option.  It's unfortunate that there wasn't a bit more distinction in the guns, especially in the sense that both Megatron and Optimus Prime's weapons don't work much differently from the garden-variety peashooters you will usually leave behind.  Really, if there's one problem with this game it's that every character and every gun feels pretty much the same.  The only real difference in how they play is whether the character turns into a ground vehicle or a jet of some kind.\n\nOf course, if you're enough of a fan to still be reading this, then the similarity really doesn't matter.","January 1","true","9.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Transformers: War for Cybertron is a FPS based on events that take place before Generation 1/Prime with a few strings pulled from here and there for creative flexibility. From the unique cybertronian designs to a beautifully set up storyline, High Moon did a fantastic job here. Might I say the character personalities are amazing, the portrayal of the individual Seekers' personality really made me happy and are just how I always interpreted them. Watching the transformation of Orion Pax to Optimus Prime. I really like this game and I love the campaign.\n\nNow for the disappointing half, I played this back on Xbox 360 when it first released. I got the DLC, some of which were characters like Shockwave and the map packs. Had a good time in multiplayer leveling up my character, no problem. Now I find out WFC is on PC. Fun, right? Wrong. Not only is this game missing patches but NONE of the DLC presented on he consoles are provided here. That's about 7ish characters we're missing out on for multiplayer?\n\nSpeaking of multiplayer, don't try it. Firstly, it's just about always dead now. Secondly, the games are infested with cheaters. Infinite armor, FPS unlocker, rapid fire, etc. Does High Moon do anything about this? No. Will High Moon do anything about this? No. Do not set foot in a public game unless you want to lose because you're sure as hell not winning.\n\nHigh Moon Studios, what the ♥♥♥♥?\n\nNot only that but this game was abandonded as soon as it was dropped on Steam for their sequel game, Fall of Cybertron, WHICH IS JUST AS BROKEN AND CHAOTIC AS THIS GAME. High Moon Studios took priority over their console games rather than PC. Why wasn't there any DLC released for this game? I would have happily forked out for it but instead they left us in the dust just so they could rush on their next game and abandon it as well.\n\nI love High Moon Studios for this game, it is one of my all time favorites but the fact that there was no love or time taken to fix up and maintain the game on this platform severely disappoints me. If there was a in-between rating for games I would definately give it to this game. The only instance where I would recommend this game would only be for the campaign and escalation. Multiplayer has been ruined by a selfish community.\n\nI can only recommend the full experience of WFC on Xbox or PS3.","February 10","false","38.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The several weapons to choose from are ho hum and limited ammo can be an annoyance. The characters are visually cool, though not that fundamentally different from each other. Their are some sublte differences as you can play as a healer or scout. Transformation from vehicle and robot doesn't provide a great deal of strategic advantage aside from being able to manuever better and looking cooler.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Geoson/recommended/42650/","Geoson","Geoson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Geoson/","522 products in account","This review is based on about the hour or so of gameplay I played during a $5 sale before returning the product. As such I am limited to what I experienced. Please keep this in mind!\n\nWar for Cybertron was a game that I heard a lot of good things about. With it being Transformers (a series that I enjoyed quite a bit in my childhood, although not quite on the same level as my brother) I was excited to give it a try. What I got was less than desirable. While I initially was reluctant to review a product that I had such little time with, I felt it was important to share my feelings about the game to give others a better sense of what they should expect / recieve.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is rather interesting. The fact that you can transform SEEMS like it would offer quite a bit of variation on combat. That's not quite true. Transforming merely seemed like another gun and a slightly altered means of transportation with flying, which is actually useful, and driving, which switches between sluggish or super sonic speed depending on your actions. This just feels clumsy and really serves more as a gimmick.\n\nJumping is odd. You have a double jump, but most obstacles feel like you need to use both anyway. Not solid, but I can't say it was terrible.\n\nCamera controls. Ugh, I'm not a fan of them. Having an over the shoulder perspective is usually a hit or miss due to the fact that they often pick a side to stick with. This is USUALLY a bad design decision unless levels are built around that. This is a game that does that and isn't built for it. (At least as far as I could find control wise, correct me if I'm wrong.) Imagine hiding behind cover with a camera stuck on your right shoulder and an enemy attacking you. Due to the fact that he resides on the left side of the screen you are unable to attack him without coming out of cover.\n\nWhich leads to my next complaint. Cover is pretty much nonexistent. Sure you can stand behind things, but this feels incredibly inadequate and often leads to the damage you take feeling cheap. With a small health bar and only medkits to replenish health, it seems odd that avoiding damage is so tricky. (While I might have been bad at this game and thus affecting my view on this, I will say that I don't always suck.)\n\nAmmo feels lacking. With most enemies taking at least half a magazine of bullets to finish off unless using a weapon with more sparse ammo (and thus being more deadly.) This means that the rigid car mode is something you'll find yourself stuck using to alleviate this problem.\n\nMaking an account for Co-op and online play is actually incredibly easy and gets major applause for it. All it asks is for a name and your pretty much good to go. No hassle and I was done in ten seconds flat. (Although adding a friend seems to be a mutual process.)\n\nHowever the actual Co-op feels slapped on. Ammo and health had the biggest impact on this situation. The levels are designed to give enough for one player. When you add another robot providing support but using the same resources you start having someone (or even multiple) people in the party having to stay behind because they are out of something crucial. This could have easily been fixed by having the health and ammo work for both players, or just dropping duplicates of them.\n\nNot only that but you'll find that if your partner runs just a little bit ahead, most doors end up closing on the other(s) before they can make it through. Their solution is to simply toss the player left behind into the next room. This is very disorienting and really isn't a good solution. Still it does get the job done.\n\nThe enviroment is definitely done well and really feels "robotic" and futuristic. The problem I have with it though is that enemies are too easily hidden and indistinguishable from the background. This might have just been a problem for me.\n\nThe story is something I truly can't speak on. As I said at the start of this, I only had about an hour or so to experience it. What I did experience though in the story was lackluster. The only thing I remember was Megatron being an absolute meanace and everyone else basically saying, DARK ENERGON IS DANGEROUS! It hit me over the head again and again, and was simply too straight foward for me to care about. Now Transformers is based on a pretty young demographic and isn't really known for deep and complex story. Still, I would have wagered that a more "mature" artstyle would mean trusting the player a little bit more on following the story.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't get to try my hand on the multiplayer. I suppose it's possible that a lot of the fun to be had here is in this mode, but we are also talking about a game that's quite a few years old. While you might be able to round some people up, servers are going to be lacking a strong player base.\n\nThe game just feels lacking, and while some fanatics of Transformers might really enjoy this game, it just doesn't stand on its own AS a game. Still, others clearly seem to have found some fun playing it. At $5 on sale most people won't care about these problems or might find it more enjoyable than I did. For me, it just wasn't enough. Overall I rate the game about a 4/10. A below average game for me that I sadly can not recommend.","December 2, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The campign is very fun and if you are transformers fan (especially if you have watched TFP) then it fills a large storyline gap. However, active gamers may find that this is a waste of money if they aren't TF fans. The entire storyline lasts about 5-7 hours total, and however fun it may be, most people don't want to replay it over and over again. The multiplayer is very well designed in Escalation mode. You get teamed with 2-4 people to surive as many waves as you can. The downside of all multiplayer modes is that you CAN NOT CHAT and there are at most FIFTY players online at any time. I reccomend this game, but if you aren't into transformers overall, there are likely better shooters for you such as CoD, CS: GO, or battlefield.","February 2, 2014","true","62.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

They tell their youngest unpaid interns about this at 5 o'clock as they're packing up to leave, saying it had better be ready to air by the next morning. Already exhausted from a mid-week birthday party that lasted well into the previous night, and having never done anything like this before, the interns must write, direct, act, and produce their own made-for-TV-movie in just a few hours.\n\nThat's exactly how Transformers: War for Cybertron must've been created.\n\nThe graphics and gameplay are just Unreal Tournament skinned with a few tweaks. Inaccurate, unpowerful weapons. Dull, blurry textures. Locked in third-person mode. Extremely slow movement speed even when things are supposed to be rushed. Collecting glowing shards from defeated enemies that do absolutely nothing. All the changes make things worse, and UT did not have a strong single player campaign to begin with.\n\nThe dialogue and voice acting are so bad as to be laughable if only the game didn't take itself so seriously. The story and some of its moments just shatter any suspension of disbelief. This is a problem with Transformers in general (why in the world would a group of alien machines transform into exact replicas of vehicles meant to transport humans when they've never seen any before (this is a prequel after all)? Or for that matter, why do they even have two arms, two legs, and faces? Those things are utterly irrelevant to a machine's existence) but this game exacerbates them. Oh there's a hard terminal to hack? The solution is to reduce the power being sent to it. Because a computer's incoming power affects its security. Idiotic doesn't even begin to describe it.\n\nThe one saving grace is the boss fights. Some of them are a fun diversion for a few moments. And they're consistently the only parts of the game that can't be ignored and just sprinted through. But they are the vast minority of where your time will be spent during a play through.\n\nI bought this game to play co-op, but it's honestly one of the only games where I can't imagine co-op making it better. Maybe you'd be able to make fun of it with your partner in real time. What a silver lining that would be.\n","August 27, 2015","false","10.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","2","8","2","0"

There are many, many places that are stunningly beautiful and complex, which could have made wonderful places to creep through and explore, but end up simply being a hallway with cutscenes and gunfights. Sections of the game that would have been perfectly set up to allow for multiple paths and player creativity are left with un-passable, knee-high walls to keep you on a single platform until the story decides to let you move on.\nThe vaunted ability to unlock more transformer chassis (in truth, there are only two, and it is the only way in the game to get a female transformer) and build your own character is woefully basic; effectively a choice of an existing character with a PARTIALLY different paint job built from a VERY limited color pallete selection. The custom characters are also ONLY available if you play multiplayer against other people, which is also the only way to level up and unlock new equipment and abilities (of which there tend to be may 2 at best for any given character type).\n\ndespite actually liking the game, it is so basic and bland that I couldn't stomach putting in the effort to finish it.

I have been a loyal fan of Call of Duty for a very long time even pre my PC days. I have racked up over 700 hours on COD Ghosts and nearly 200 hours on Black Ops 2. At the weekend I randonly recieved a notification mid game during my gameplay in Ghosts to say that I had been permanently banned from online multiplayer. No reason! Just a notice. I have never cheated on a game in my life, I collect games, I achievement hunt and I have a f*cking expensive PC, all of which pretty much cements me being a solid and dedicated gamer. I contacted Activiton and went on the community hum on Steam and all I am told is it's irreversable and they say I have breached one of their t&c's for fair play. What the actual f*ck?? Why would I rack up nearly 1000 hours to then decide to cheat?! Are they F*cking stupid? I think this is absolutely disgusting and I am totally enraged by this because they have given me no explanation whatsoever other than a link to their policy agreement which is total BS. I am so enraged I am now refusing to buy anything from these c*nts ever again. How can someone or a company have the right to do this to a customer, especially when I am a loyal customer and have done nothing wrong at all. I gaurantee it's a group of ♥♥♥♥♥ on here that have complained about me in some way to force a ban on me. I have no VAC ban or nothing and never have had one.

It has great graphics and impressive set piece moments/battles coupled with great voice acting for the various iconic robots that we all know and love. The down part is that the game suffers from inconsistent pacing as you alternate between the Autobots and Decepticons' story (and can do so in a non-chronological manner) and can choose from a different 3-set of robots whose abilities don't differ enough from one another to make the combat feel very different. Still a great Transformers game if you're a fan. Play it for the story, the awesome set pieces and then play its sequel.\n\n8/10","October 26, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, if you are a Transformers fan, it's a fun experience to play as so many different characters, to have the actual cartoon voices, and to see what happened at the end of the war for Cybertron.\n\nFull review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/05/transformers-war-for-cybertron.html","June 19, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having grown up with the cartoon series and the toys this is childhood dream come true.  The control system seems a little alien at first (unless you have Res Evil 5 and Darksiders in which case it will be quite familiar), however once you get to grips with the controls, this is an incredibly fluid and enjoyable shooter.  The story mode and campaign is great, the sound and voices are G1 authentic and the cybertron enviroment is a real site to behold.  A good selection of weaponry to boot and some useful support make combat really good fun.  The muliplayer pvp and Escalate modes are very good indeed.  My Favourite is Escalate.  4 person team; co-op survival against waves of increasingly tough enemies.   I was suprised to see the meta critic rating on here is 75%.

The action packed campaign has a story that kept me interested the entire way though though the overall gameplay can get repetitive. I found myself using the same guns over and over. The fact you can switch between robot and vehicle seemlessly in battle adds a lot of choises for how to handle an encounter, especially when you are in the flying levels. The multiplayer is where this game shines for me. While now adays you will only find maybe one or two games going at any given time it is still a fats paced and fun experience. The majority of my hours with this game are in the multiplayer. The skill ceiling in the game is very high though some aspects and mechanics and classes can be overpowered. The game on consoles was patched with nerfs to the multiplayer that didn't happen on PC. Overall I recommend picking this up if you want a good third person shooter to co-op with friends.","March 6, 2015","true","107.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On one hand, you got a really juicy setting, with the Autobots on one side, the Decepticons on the other, and Cybertron with nifty feature as the frame. The combat system is cool, though it takes some getting used to, and there's more to it than simply blasting away and hoping for the best. The story is also quite neat, since it fills in a lot of the blanks left by the cartoons (do note, it has nothing to do with the movies). On the other hand however, the single player part is incredibly short. It took me a combined 8 hours to complete this game, which is low, even by my standards. That basically leaves multiplayer, and to be fair, not many people bothered with it when it shipped. That said, I don't regret buying the game, because when you get down to it, I had one freaking space-machine-transformer-with-huge-laser-canons-kicking-mother-f***ing-♥♥♥ blast of a time during those 8 hours.","September 22, 2011","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I very much like the asethetic of the game. It genuinely feels like you are on planet cybertron and comes off as a nice blend between the polished new look of the recent films, and the familiar character design from the cartoon that many of us die hard fans longed for. The voice acting for the characters is very good, and the soundtrack is very well done as well. Those being said, I do have some major issues with this game. It's not exactly a decent PC port, as the controls feel very awkward at first (especially in vehicle mode), and the game is also locked a 30 fps. Another issue I have is how the characters play. At the beginning of each mission, you are given a choice of playing as one of three transformers, one of which is almost always either Optimus or Megatron for their respective factions. The problem lies in the fact that out side of Prime and Megatron, alot of the characters playstyles are recycled, and the only ones that really feel different are AGAIn, Prime and Megatron, leaving the gameplay feeling very bland to be honest.\n\nIf you are a transformers fan, I would say this game is a safe purchase, though between this and "Fall of Cybertron", this is the clear weaker one of the two.  Ideally I'd suggest waiting for it to go on sale.","November 28, 2014","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My main concern is with the targeting and distuction of enemys, sometimes it's hard to see from where they are shooting and where to best take cover because even if you play as out favorite villain Megatron you can still get your ♥♥♥ kicked by low-ranked autobots.\n\nMy review for this game: 8.5/10, it's difficult combat and bad cover system is easily weighted up by it's action packed scenes  and the transforming into vehicle-mode and firing everything. This game is great for both fans and non-fans alike, so pick this game up, transform and roll out!","June 27, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The vast array of characters was shortened to 3 per mission which you had to choose from. And the customisation of a character could have been brilliant but was more a selection of pre-sets.

First off, the story is original and different from what we've become accustomed to. Humans are out of the equation and this game focuses on the start of the schism that separated the infamous race of robots. Even better than the campaign though is the multiplayer. The online plays a lot like Call of Duty in that your weapons are customizable and you are rewarded with killstreak bonuses. The cherry on top though, is that you can transform from robot to vehicle any time you want.

I'm 39 now, and I've waited forever for a game to do justice to the franchise.  This is it.  There are so many little things in the game that brought a big smile to my face.\n\nHalf of the game is played as a Decepticon, the other half as an Autobot.  Each mission gives you a choice of one of three characters such as Prime, Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Bumblebee and more.  The gunplay is good, and transforming is actually useful, not just a gimmick.  There are some difficult boss battles (for me at least) but nothing that should take too long to beat.\n\nIf Transformers don't mean much to you this may seem like an average shooter.

Fortunately, War for Cybertron transcends these limitations as it's neither based off a movie nor a rushed product hoping to ride the wave of passing trends. This particular game outshines the rest. First off, the story is original and different from what we've become accustomed to. Humans are out of the equation and this game focuses on the start of the schism that separated the infamous race of robots. Even better than the campaign though is the multiplayer. The online plays a lot like Call of Duty in that your weapons are customizable and you are rewarded with killstreak bonuses. The cherry on top though, is that you can transform from robot to vehicle any time you want. Needless to say, it's a blast and a must play for fans of third person shooters and the series alike.\n\nGrade: B+","January 21, 2011","true","70.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't the biggest Transformers fan before I began this game, but between it and rewatching the movies, I've become a fan for sure. This game contains plenty of action and took me a little under 8 hours to beat. There's two  campains, 5 levels each for the Autobots and Decepticons. I thoroughly enjoyed both, but the Decepticons more due to their constant yet entertaining bickering between each other. Very funny. There's plenty going on, shooting, flying, driving, massive weapons, turrets you can not only use, but remove the gun from and carry around, etc.  I could go on, but trust me: pick up this game, even if you're not a fan.

It portrays the world of Cybertron in a very unique way that no other game or movie has ever done before.\n\nThe story features an interesting tale that doesn't feel out of place in the Transformers universe. Graphics look nice although textures are a little rough. Sound effects are crisp and the music has a very energetic feel which adds alot to the atmosphere. The ending theme will bring waves of nostalgia to the original fans.\n\nThe multiplayer allows main story campaign co-op for 3 players and theres also a horde mode which allows you to create a unique looking robot.\n\nDownsides, the game is very linear with not much to explore although it does have the few obligatory special tokens for players to hunt.\n\nOverall Rating: 8.0 / 10\nA game worthy of the source material it is based on.

What I found particularly interesting and fun about this game is that you can play as both the autobots and the decepticons. The stories intertwine and are overall related so one may have fun completing the chapters alternatively by switching between the autobot and decepticon campaigns. Another amazing aspect is how simple, easy, and fun it is to switch between robot and vehicle mode at any time.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","From a purely game mechanic perspective, this really isn't anything special; it's arguably sub-par. Unlike Binary Domain or Spec Ops, the title doesn't hold a compelling storyline that excuses the mediocre game mechanics. Hell, those titles at least had some differences in game mechanics that distanced them from typical titles of their respective genres. WFC gives you the ability to transform into vehicles, which really doesn't amount to anything more than a quicker way to traverse the landscape and a third in-game weapon. They really missed an opportunity here; it was somewhat explored in a few segments where you could drive through the landscape as it was engulfed in war, but otherwise it's really the biggest let-down of the game.\n\nSo why am I recommending this; am I a Transformers fan? Nah, I've never watched it and have stayed away from the recent movies. I came into this a Transformers virgin (har har har). I guess this TRANSFORMED me into a, you know, non-virgin or something (HAHAHAHAHAHAH)\n\nI'm recommending this for the same reason I recommended Spec Ops and Binary Domain: interesting storyline. The story on this number is nowhere near the levels that BD and SO touched upon, but just because a plotline isn't ''deep'' doesn't mean it isn't interesting. WFC feels episodic; each chapter is introduced with a ''last time on Dragon Ball Z'' type of summary, and it all feels like a season of the show, like you're watching a cartoon and want to tune in to the next episode. Having no prior knowledge of the series, I feel that it does a good job of introducing newbies to the franchise and doesn't overwhelm you with the franchise's giant mythos. They also did this cool thing whereby you first play as the evil side before switching to the good in the aftermath of evil's victory. It's a really nice touch. The plotline is still simplistic, but the feel I got from it gave me a cozy saturday morning vibe that I thoroughly enjoyed. I didn't play it so much for the game mechanics, but to see how the Decepticons would strike back, or how the autobots would regroup.\n\nPerhaps I'm a sucker for storylines because I feel like I should stop recommending titles just on that alone. But just as before I'll use the same logic: nothing is inherently flawed with the game mechanics, and the plot is what keeps you reeled in. The game is somewhat easy; I played on hard mode in co-op (two players, there's an option for three) and it was still a breeze, save for a few battles here and there. There's a multiplayer mode, but everyime I boot up the title and go online to host a game for me and the broski the in-game menu tells me that there are around 40 players online, so it's dead.\n\nThis game recommendation hinges on you enjoying a simplistic plotline that plays out like a saturday morning cartoon, or perhaps if you're into the series. Cause it does the series justice (according to a different review, at least) and when it comes to cash cow franchises you really can't expect a decent video game, but here it is. If I were to place a numerical score on this, I'd saaaayyy....\n\n6/10; it's alright, but pretty fun in co-op (like all games, really). That's what probably made this really anjoyable for me, but objectively I'd give it a 6.","June 3, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's very little explanation as to who each character is, or much in the way of character development (except for Optimus). You won't even know why you're fighting this war, or what started it, apart from the very obvious fact that Megatron wants to be in charge. However, if you are a Transformers fan, it's a fun experience to play as so many different characters, to have the actual cartoon voices, and to see what happened at the end of the war for Cybertron.\n\nFull review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/05/transformers-war-for-cybertron.html","June 19, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The vast array of characters was shortened to 3 per mission which you had to choose from. And the customisation of a character could have been brilliant but was more a selection of pre-sets.

I'm 39 now, and I've waited forever for a game to do justice to the franchise.  This is it.  There are so many little things in the game that brought a big smile to my face.\n\nHalf of the game is played as a Decepticon, the other half as an Autobot.  Each mission gives you a choice of one of three characters such as Prime, Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave, Bumblebee and more.  The gunplay is good, and transforming is actually useful, not just a gimmick.  There are some difficult boss battles (for me at least) but nothing that should take too long to beat.\n\nIf Transformers don't mean much to you this may seem like an average shooter.  I bought this game and Fall of Cybertron during Steam Sales, but I would have paid full price.  The attention to detail and the shout outs to things I remember from long ago made it worth it.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","From a purely game mechanic perspective, this really isn't anything special; it's arguably sub-par. Unlike Binary Domain or Spec Ops, the title doesn't hold a compelling storyline that excuses the mediocre game mechanics. Hell, those titles at least had some differences in game mechanics that distanced them from typical titles of their respective genres. WFC gives you the ability to transform into vehicles, which really doesn't amount to anything more than a quicker way to traverse the landscape and a third in-game weapon. They really missed an opportunity here; it was somewhat explored in a few segments where you could drive through the landscape as it was engulfed in war, but otherwise it's really the biggest let-down of the game.\n\nSo why am I recommending this; am I a Transformers fan? Nah, I've never watched it and have stayed away from the recent movies. I came into this a Transformers virgin (har har har). I guess this TRANSFORMED me into a, you know, non-virgin or something (HAHAHAHAHAHAH)\n\nI'm recommending this for the same reason I recommended Spec Ops and Binary Domain: interesting storyline. The story on this number is nowhere near the levels that BD and SO touched upon, but just because a plotline isn't ''deep'' doesn't mean it isn't interesting. WFC feels episodic; each chapter is introduced with a ''last time on Dragon Ball Z'' type of summary, and it all feels like a season of the show, like you're watching a cartoon and want to tune in to the next episode. Having no prior knowledge of the series, I feel that it does a good job of introducing newbies to the franchise and doesn't overwhelm you with the franchise's giant mythos. They also did this cool thing whereby you first play as the evil side before switching to the good in the aftermath of evil's victory. It's a really nice touch. The plotline is still simplistic, but the feel I got from it gave me a cozy saturday morning vibe that I thoroughly enjoyed. I didn't play it so much for the game mechanics, but to see how the Decepticons would strike back, or how the autobots would regroup.\n\nPerhaps I'm a sucker for storylines because I feel like I should stop recommending titles just on that alone. But just as before I'll use the same logic: nothing is inherently flawed with the game mechanics, and the plot is what keeps you reeled in. The game is somewhat easy; I played on hard mode in co-op (two players, there's an option for three) and it was still a breeze, save for a few battles here and there. There's a multiplayer mode, but everyime I boot up the title and go online to host a game for me and the broski the in-game menu tells me that there are around 40 players online, so it's dead.\n\nThis game recommendation hinges on you enjoying a simplistic plotline that plays out like a saturday morning cartoon, or perhaps if you're into the series. Cause it does the series justice (according to a different review, at least) and when it comes to cash cow franchises you really can't expect a decent video game, but here it is. If I were to place a numerical score on this, I'd saaaayyy....\n\n6/10; it's alright, but pretty fun in co-op (like all games, really). That's what probably made this really anjoyable for me, but objectively I'd give it a 6.","June 3, 2014","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fall of Cybertron takes the characters we all know and love and places them into a far darker and more mature setting than any previous iteration of Transformers that I've ever encountered. The war between the Autobots and the Decepticons is everpresent, having raged on for millions of years. As I traveled across the Cybertronian landscape, I was constantly struck by the scope of the devastation. Combined with the visceral and relentless combat, this really lends the game an ominous feel. You get the impression that there isn't much left to fight over, and that whatever victory either side might achieve will be phyrric at best.\n\nThe characters and narrative in this game are extremely strong, though the combat gets a bit repetative. There isn't much to the gameplay besides very basic third-person shooter elements, and the ability to transform into vehicle mode has a lot of unrealized potential. Still, this game is completely worthwhile, especially for fans of the franchise.","January 1, 2014","true","33.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

First off, the story is original and different from what we've become accustomed to. Humans are out of the equation and this game focuses on the start of the schism that separated the infamous race of robots. Even better than the campaign though is the multiplayer. The online plays a lot like Call of Duty in that your weapons are customizable and you are rewarded with killstreak bonuses.

Its a solid 3rd person action game with transformer elements but you dont get the true transformer feel with this game.  When you play as a transformer, you are limited to a few move sets and when you become a vehicle you are a floating object in the form of a vehicle so instead of being a really fast car you are a floating car that looks fast!  Enemy AI is super exploitable and predictable, even your teammate AI is dumb as once during a sequence with pillars that crush during a tunnel sequence both of my AI teammates were crushed to death so i had to wait for them to respawn to finish the level.  The whole game spans i believe 10 levels and they are all basically the same, with the first 5 being about the decepticons and their defeat of the autobots up until Optimus Prime becomes the new leader and such.  It is recommendable on the transformer story but is not on the pretense that its a good playable game.","May 26, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Starting from the classic cartoons to the most memorable Beast Wars in the 1990s...\n\nIf I realized one thing about Transformers, it's the various stories that branch from the original one. It's like the story had so many different parts to it that you could actually see how big that Transformers storyline, no.. universe spanned. For those followers and fans of Transformers, War for Cybertron would be centered around the Generation 1 continuity which is safe to say, .. the original storyline.\n\nDealing with the Great Cybertronian War (Third Cybertronian War), the Autobots and Decepticons have been waging war over countless millenia spanned across the universe. The conflict of ideals and justice that seem to be so deeply rooted that brothers are forced to fight each other and choose sides. ... Well, at least that's my take on the war too.\n\nBut I digress. There are two story arcs to play through in T:WFC, the Decepticon Saga and the Autobot Saga in Single Player Campaign and the Multiplayer mode. The campaign mode is played from two wholly different perspectives, The Autobots and Decepticons and the personalities experienced in both are so in conflict that you'll immediately see their stances in the war.\nT:WFC gives you a choice of playing different characters throughout the story arcs so you can take the fight to the skies even. Both ground and air combat is enjoyable enough. You can even play co-op campaign mode upto a max of 3 players so bring friends if you want.\n\nWhat took it for me was playing co-op through the story campaign with my brother. Also Optimus Prime's original voice actor, Peter Cullen. No comparison.\n\nIf you're new to Transformers, give it a play through and you won't regret it.. it's the best Transformers game in years. And for the fans, you already know that.\n\nEither way, .. Transformers: WFC will be leading you to believe that there's more than meets the eye.","January 1, 2013","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It portrays the world of Cybertron in a very unique way that no other game or movie has ever done before.\n\nThe story features an interesting tale that doesn't feel out of place in the Transformers universe. Graphics look nice although textures are a little rough. Sound effects are crisp and the music has a very energetic feel which adds alot to the atmosphere. The ending theme will bring waves of nostalgia to the original fans.\n\nThe multiplayer allows main story campaign co-op for 3 players and theres also a horde mode which allows you to create a unique looking robot.\n\nDownsides, the game is very linear with not much to explore although it does have the few obligatory special tokens for players to hunt.\n\nOverall Rating: 8.0 / 10\nA game worthy of the source material it is based on.

The overall game is amazing and very hard to put down. There's co-op were people can join your game at anytime through the singleplayer campaign. It has multiplayer were mostly people play Team Deathmatch which is very active still. There is leveling for your Multiplayer character. There are 4 classes to choose from in online. You can choose to be who you want in Singleplayer. The graphics are amazing and there is so much on screen that I cam in "ah" as to how beautiful it was all laid out. The voice acting is awesome and sounds exactly like the voice from the movies. Use a Xbox 360 controller to play this game because It felt more natural doing so.

Believe the high reviews, this game is hours of Transformers shooting and smashing each other to bits with a fairly decent storyline.  This game is often on sale and dirt cheap for the amount of entertainment you get.

Where the game fails, however, is the multiplayer. While I did enjoy it and it does offer some customization as advertised, it really feels like the player is in chains the entire time and we're not allowed to have our fun.

Transformers : War For Cyberton offers a great single player which you can play in the coop mode with more two friends of yours also it offers an amazing multiplayer which in my taste never gets bored. the storyline will be intresting for those who like the Transformers series and the graphics are great but what really impressed me was the gameplay.

This game sort of leads up to the Transformers Prime series, but not perfectly.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, just a third person shooter with a decent variety of weapons and a bunch of Transformers to play as. You can transform to go quicker and use that weapon, and in robot mode you have 2 different perks you can use to damage enemies or buff your teammates. The voice acting is incredible, with Peter Cullen as Optimus, Johnny Yong Bosch as Bumblebee, Fred Tatascoire as Megatron, and Sam Reigel as Starscream, just to name a few.\n\nThe multiplayer is pretty simple, just a bunch of basic modes like deathmatch or capture the flag. The best part of it is the character customization, where you can use the chassis or any playable character, along with Arcee if you've finished the Autobot campaign, and Slipstream if you finished the Decepticon one. You can color them any way you want and choose from a set of weapons and perks for each class, which is decided by vehicle type. The only problem is that I've found the multiplayer to be mostly abandoned today, though it is fun if you can get some opponents.\n\nThe story follows the titular War for Cybertron, before the Transformers came to Earth. The Decepticon campaign comes before the Autobot one, so to get the full story, just play in level order, though you can play Autobot first. Overall, an amazing game. 9.5 out of 10, not totally perfect, but pretty great.","September 11, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Combat is pretty fun and basic, while melee attack is quite over-powered. You can easily find youself clearing a floor with only melee kills. The character designs are a tribute to the generation 1 designs, unlike the Michael Bay bots. You may find the AI to be abit stupid/hilarious. Your allied AI bots can get themselves dead very easily by missing a jump, but fortunately they will respawn infinitely and immediately beside you.\n\nAn average game.

It's exciting from start to finish and yet it just keeps getting more and more epic as you reach the later levels. The inclusion of all of the different, classic, transformers is simply fantastic, they did a really good job of re-creating our old heroes (and villians), breathing new life into them whilst maintaining their original image along with A+ voice acting that just keeps you constantly immersed and hooked in. Also they got the perfect balance between making a serious and sad setting but at the same time making characters loveable, banter-y and entertaining.

Everything about this game is brilliant so long as you don't mind playing on a console.\n\nIf you didn't; so much wasted potential.  Single player is great fun but if you bought this for the PC then sadly the multiplayer is a huge let-down.  Connectivity is atrocious and matches are often full of people using hacks.  No effort seems to have been made to improve this.  It's like the PC version was "fire and forget" with Activision and High Moon after release.\n\nThe thin end of the wedge for big name publishers and/or devs going "console crazy" as independents become more and more competitive on PC.\n\nEDIT (Dec 2015):\nSo the single player is still awesome.  Multiplayer has died to about 20 people across the entire planet and there's still one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ exploiting hacks.  I can't understand where the satisfcation lies, it's not like there's a community left to climb the ranks of, even with the cheating.

Its a solid 3rd person action game with transformer elements but you dont get the true transformer feel with this game.  When you play as a transformer, you are limited to a few move sets and when you become a vehicle you are a floating object in the form of a vehicle so instead of being a really fast car you are a floating car that looks fast!  Enemy AI is super exploitable and predictable, even your teammate AI is dumb as once during a sequence with pillars that crush during a tunnel sequence both of my AI teammates were crushed to death so i had to wait for them to respawn to finish the level.  The whole game spans i believe 10 levels and they are all basically the same, with the first 5 being about the decepticons and their defeat of the autobots up until Optimus Prime becomes the new leader and such.  It is recommendable on the transformer story but is not on the pretense that its a good playable game.","May 26, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Right off the bat you can choose  between the autobot campaign or decepticon campaign. If you want to go in order of events then play the decepticon campaign first with the autobot campaign taking place after the events of the decepticons. The stories of both campaigns are very well done with you tearing apart the autobots as the decepticons then trying to fix things as the autobots. Each campaign offers a variety of characters to play as all being veterans of the transformers series. The missions in the campaign are each about an hour long or more offering plenty of playtime throughout the entire game. there are two types of levels, the normal ground missions where you play as the vehicle transformers like optimus or megatron. Then there are the air levels where you can play as characters like starscream and jetfire. Both are very fun and challenging in their own right. One of my favorite things to do in this game is transform which is something you can do just about any time you want and really gives it a transformers vibe to it. Another aspect I really enjoyed was the designs of the characters they still held their trademark appearances, but at the same time had a cybertronian style as well. One thing that is slightly annoying is the framerates are a little slow around a 30 benchmark. This could be due to not changing settings on my end, or it could be that it was locked at 30 either way it isnt too noticeable. There is a multiplayer and coop section, coop being for the campaign or escalation gamemode however I did not try either as there are not many people who still play the multiplayer of this game. Overall this game is a great transformers game that can appeal to hardcore fans but also be something for new people to enjoy that is well worth the 20$.","May 9","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
