I enjoy this game; The characters, the writing, the combat - all held up to what I was expecting when I purchased this game believing it was a full game.\n\nThe fact that Ghostlight cut content from this becuase 'Steam said too' rings false and sounds like trying to avoid the blame of their own actions when their customers starting getting mad. They have provided no proof of this conversation, and have gone silent on why they didn't do an off-site patch like many other games have done for the past year to put censored content back into the game for their customers.\n\nI would normally recommend this game for those that enjoy Disgaea-like characters and stories, but I can not in good faith put any more money into the pockets of Publishers who ♥♥♥♥ their customers over what they told them they were buying, then going silent when pressed for answers on why they didn't inform them or fix it back to the quality they expected.\n\nTLDR; Don't buy ♥♥♥♥ from these hack ♥♥♥♥♥♥.","November 15, 2015","false","50.1"," 227 of 312 people (73%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","73","227","312","7","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zurarara/recommended/389870/","zurarara","Aruz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zurarara/","308 products in account","I'll start off by saying I'm personally enjoying the game. However I'm pretty tolerant of issues, but I understand many people won't be, and so I've listed some of the biggest below.\n\n1 (and in my opinion, the biggest con): There is no help menu. The game has a lot of complex features in it, and these are all explained exactly once during their tutorial. This means if you forget anything, good luck finding it again because that information isn't available anywhere in-game as far as I've been able to tell.\n\n2: Many of the strategic elements in the game are pure guesswork. Enemies have moods in addition to their Moe preference (both of which affect Moe Kill), and yet you can't really ever figure out how to take advantage of these, it's always a guess. Small crystals in the game can affect stats in a small radius around them. Figuring out what these crystals do is tedious, as you have to go to the free cursor and slowly make your way to every crystal you want to read about. Monsters also have elemental types that you'll also have to guess on, and damage from skills is based both off Moe affinity and these elements, so once again, all about guessing if your skill will do optimal damage or not.\n\n3: Linked attacks. Characters close enough to each other and whose turn is next will cause your current character to do a linked attack. Currently these not only do less damage than my normal attacks, but there is no way to do a normal attack if the linked attack is an option. You're either forced into that or using a skill/item/defend.\n\n4: Peon Ball. It can reach critical mass and blow up your whole party. I have no idea how this happens, so far the only contributing factor I've noticed is killing things with AOE will cause that mass % to increase, and as far as I can remember the only way to lower it is to do random commands during battle that only become available a chapter or two after first getting access to the ball.\n\n5: Mugen Field. Many other people have talked about the DLC breaking the game balance, well going into the Mugen Field can also overlevel you way past the story if you're not careful. On the flipside, this can save you quite a bit of time grinding later on. Not only that, but I get noticeable frame drops in that area every so often, which is most likely an optimization issue since my rig isn't exactly weak, nor is this game demanding.\n\n6: Making your own Peon. Very minor complaint, but unlike the major characters, Player-created Peons don't have a default costume. This means making one will have them be in their underwear until you equip them with clothing, thus temporarily ruining my dreams of having a maid in my party.\n\nBeyond those issues, the game is pretty nice. It's an interesting setting, the dialogue and situations are quite humorous, story so far is ridiculous but enjoyable, models are cute, and guesswork aside, the battle system isn't all that bad. I'd say get it if you enjoy jRPGs and the cons I listed above aren't a big deal to you, otherwise I'd suggest avoiding it.","October 26, 2015","false","12.1"," 137 of 181 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","137","181","5","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Souperzombie/recommended/389870/","Souperzombie","BOSH BOSH BOSH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Souperzombie/","517 products in account","It's not good.\n\nWhile the port is very good, the game itself is just a bunch of vaguely interesting ideas thrown together and executed poorly. The basic combat is essentially a poor man's Hyperdimension Neptunia/Fairy Fencer F, only with bland animations and boring, uninspired enemies, with too many additional game mechanics for it's own good.\n\nFirst off, you have some kind of "moe" ability, which you use to 'recruit' enemies to your side, or convert them into items. This system is the most vague combat system I have ever seen in any game, and almost completely luck-based. When executed you choose 3 different words which are supposed to represent something the opponent... likes? I've no idea. If you're successful you get peons which probably do something but I havn't got that far, and if you're not then they frenzy and get stronger. Early in the game you get an ability which lets one of your characters change into different forms which supposedly helps in converting enemies depending on their preferences but it doesn't seem to make any difference at all. I can only assume that the affinities or whatever they're called are supposed to be come kind of comedic replacement for elements, but it's just confusing and never works how you'd expect. Sometimes they're converted almost immediately, sometimes the bar only increases by a third. No matter what affinity you choose, no matter what the enemy's affinity is, there's no rhyme or reason to it.\nThere's also a different kind of combat entirely, which I assume becomes more commonplace the further you advance into the game. In essence, it's rock paper scissors where one of your allies just ♥♥♥♥ing tells you what move the enemy is going to make. It's simply not worth talking about, but the game makes a big deal out of it during the start of the game so I guess it's a big deal?\nYou also have something called "blast off". When you execute a skill, you can choose to use Blast Off, which knocks the enemy around the map into other enemies for extra damage. While this sounds like a fresh, innovitive combat system, it's comprimised by it's own self-imposed limitations. When you select an enemy to attack with your skill with Blast Off enabled, an arrow appears showing the complete trajectory the enemy will go, which is fine and helpful. However if you want to hit another enemy with it (which is the entire point), the arrow changes into a much shorter one, showing only the vague trajectory the first enemy and the hit enemy will go, making chaining up hits very difficult, as you can no longer tell if the enemy you attack is going to have enough power to knock back or even reach additional enemies. The Blast Off meter itself is charged by using skills, and skill points are recharged with I Don't Know, and if you smash a Crystal during battle with blast off which is supposed to do something to change the battle rules but never ♥♥♥♥ing does then you enter fury mode which...\n...♥♥♥♥ this, I give up.\n\nThe game is slower than a dying sloth and there's far too many game mechanics to care about, keep track of, or even bother to understand. I'm not even two hours into the game yet and I'm already bored out of my mind. I usually enjoy these Idea Factory JRPG-type games, but this one is just so slow-paced, boring, tedious, and vague that I just can't find any fun in it. The world is completely uninteresting and the dialogue is utterly bland and unfunny, which is a shame because I at least get a small chuckle out of other IF games.\n\nOh, and you'd best pay very ♥♥♥♥ing close attention to the myriad of tutorials because if you don't get something then there is no way to view them again.\n\nThere's a reason this game is cheaper than all of Idea Factory's other games, and a reason why it's the only Idea Factory game I'll be refunding.\n\nAnd that's because it's not a good game.","October 23, 2015","false","1.3"," 90 of 142 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","90","142","10","4"

I'm going to finish it at least, even if it kills me, which it might. After a long kick of Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 and 2, I decided to pick this game up, too since it was made by the same developers, thinking it would be a lot like the other 2 games (as well as Fairy Fencer F.) Sadly, compared to those 3 other games, this one feels very lacking. Not in content mind you, but in direction and I guess you would say "composure." This game has so many "gimmicks" that just get in the way of gameplay it's rediculous and they just pile it all on top of you in the first hour of gameplay.\n\nThere's peon capturing, where you use your 7 "moe forms" to match the enemies moe preference, then you have to choose from a group of random words to form some kind of sentence. Oh, did I mention which words you choose also need to match up with what mood (there are 7 seperate moods) the enemy is in, or else the enemy flips its ♥♥♥♥ and goes berserk, regaining all HP and getting an increase in attack and defense.\n\nThen they throw these crystals into the mix that emit auras that do certain things (Some boost EXP, some decrease HP, some lock you in place so you cant move.) You can also go all Moe on the crystals to destroy them and cause another power up.\n\nFinally, there's knocking the enemies around, where skills that you use can be toggled to knock an enemy back into other enemies, friendlies, or crystals to damage them like some kind of demented game of pool. After smashing a crystal, it goes into frenzy mode where you need to use certain skills to knock enemies into the air to break floating crystals.\n\nYou can make your own characters and customize their appearance, class, clothing, etc, but they're woefully underpowered and there's really no point in using them so far. They dont start with skills and they hardly learn any skills. Why use them when you can just dominate everything with your storymode characters?\n\nThen there's the graphics, which pale in comparison to Rebirth 1, 2 and Fairy Fencer F. There's a weird fog that kind of hangs in the distance and the game needs some kind of Antialiasing because the staircasing on the sprites is brutal.\n\nFor me, this game is one big headache and I'm only able to play it a little at a time, but I am gonna finish it just to say that I have mastered the game of 100 gimmicks.\n\n(I'm actually kinda glad they removed the hotsprings washing minigame, just cause it would be another gimmick on top of a huge gimmicky pile of gimmicks. Gimmick!)\n\nEdit: See, there's so many minigames in this that I already forgot about one. The ship battles, which are kind of neat but essentially come down to a kind of rock paper scissors game where the amount of Peons you have somehow govern your powers and attacks for your ship. All these features are explained once, and so far, I havent found a help menu to explain them again. They pop up right before it needs explaining, then it just assumes you understand all of it and send you on your way without much of a demonstration. Then there's the Peon ball, which is sort of a ticking time bomb that can get bigger the more of something (I really have no idea) you do, and it can also reach critical mass and wipe your entire party for also doing other things (still, I have NO idea why it gets big, or why it blows me up.)","October 28, 2015","false","14.8"," 39 of 54 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","39","54","3","2"

Everything about the game is over the top, get used to the word 'overwhelming' however Its really a mixed bag of some good elements, and some which plainly don't work.  But I'll get to those later in the review,  for anyone interested in Mugen Souls - This is a warning, this game was originally shipped with an abhorrent amount of DLC which can break the game completely for the actual story mode, however on the flipside - the DLC is practically required for high level Mugen field exploration so be warned about the hefty DLC that will cost 4 to 6x the cost of the base game if you buy everything, and believe me the the DLC is fairly unbalanced and will more or less ruin the story mode, but if your the typical 'trophy hunter' type of player, then it will be required.\n\nMugen Souls is based about the undisputed goddess of the universe Chou Chou and her ability to turn practically anything into her peons,  she has various different personalities that she can change into to perform these tasks, each one massively different from the next,  she is accompanied with many different Heroes and Demon Lords, each with their own quirks, often humorous dialogue to said quirks.\n\nSome of the biggest problems Mugen Souls has, besides the awful DLC is the fact the game can turn into a significant grindfest quite fast if your the trophy hunter type of player, if you don't care about unlocking trophies and just want to experience the story, then don't invest in any of the game breaking DLC, and turn off several of the free DLC which significantly unbalances the storymode to the point of making it a cakewalk.   The DLC is more or less designed for the Mugen field which is, honestly the core mechanic of the game allowing 100 random battles vs ships/enemies and slumbering bosses,  the problem with the Mugen field is this is where all the game unlocks are earned, and progressing through the field gets extremely difficult without mugen point packs to boost your equipment, sure the early stages of a low bet are easy and you can level up extremely fast (again, breaking the story mode) but upon reaching certain portions of the field monsters become extremely overpowered,  this significant imbalance issue was fixed in Mugen Souls Z but it problem for Mugen Souls, and earning points/gold without the packs is slow, the cost of upgrading equipment gets overwhelmingly expensive fast with high level upgrades costing millions per point, bear in mind you can upgrade your equipment to 'overwhelmingly' high levels here.\n\nAnother poor mechanic is the G-Castle battles, honestly - they don't work.  They tried to copy the Skies of Arcadia method but didn't make the battles interesting enough,  the biggest problems is the A.I cheats against the player, your co-pilot will occasionally give you hints/clues about what your opponent is going to do next, and 70% of the time, it'll follow a set pattern, but then occasionally break that pattern so usually the best method to win these g-castles is to cheese the fight by using a certain attack constantly and never deviating.\n\nFinally, while the sale is on I definately recommend the game for the story alone plus its a fairly long so its good value, if you can overlook some of the obviously problems then you'll enjoy Mugen Souls.  Also, its really a minor detail but for some people its a deal breaker,  Mugen Souls is signficantly censored over the original Japanese version, to the tune of over 100+ CG and a mini-game - the latter isn't really a problem since the min-game itself was fairly boring and didn't really do much except for fan service.\n\nOverall 7.5 // 10\n\n+ Great Story\n+ Great Characters/Character Dialogue\n+ Great Music\n+ Character Customization\n+ Moe\n\n- DLC can break story mode\n- Excessive DLC that isn't required/but recommended for Mugen Field\n- Can be very grindy\n- Airship battle mechanics are poor (These battles are better in Z)\n- Censorship","October 25, 2015","true","26.5"," 35 of 51 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","35","51","0","23"

This is very important for making the grind go faster.\nNOTE 2: The free DLC is nothing but OP items that make the game impossible to lose. Disable DLC in the title screen menu before you press New Game if you want to enjoy playing through it vanilla.\n\nNow, onto the review!/Mechanics Summary!\n\nThe story can be described in two words: Galactic domination. You play as (say it with me now) a loli heroine who has amnesia, but instead of saving the world you're going to 7 different planets subjugating each one along the way. This is done by finding the strongest people on every planet and forcing them to join you. Like all Compile Heart games you'll  end up with a large cast of different personalities who are all hilarious to see interact with one another. Sounds fun? It is. Until the grind.\n\nThe gameplay for this RPG is surprisingly unique, so I'll try my best to cover all of the different mechanics because many people seem to get confused by the decent yet fairly terrible tutorial.\n\nInstead of elements all characters have "moe" attributes (read: kinks) and it is your job to use this knowledge to either turn them into your peon, turn them into items, or anger the enemy so jpop will play. During battle the main character is allowed to "moe kill" by switching forms to one of 8 kinks (Masochist, Sadist, Terse, Bipolar, Ditz, Ego, Hyper, and Graceful) and then choosing 3 of 7 phrase options that appeals to the target's current emotional state (If they're happy they will react exactly as you'd expect, when sad instead of being slapped by a sadist maybe they want a hug etc.) and kink. While this may sound insane at first (it is) the naming convention is really the only thing that may throw you off, but there are element based attacks tied to the moe attributes that will help you distinguish what is weak to what. (ex. Masochist is Water and Sadist is fire)\n\nAside from that kink paradigm there's also an entire billiards-esque mechanic called "blast-off" at play where you can set your non-standard attacks to blast enemies around the battle-map smacking into other enemies causing the whole board to be mixed up. If an enemy is giving you a hard time you can keep smacking it back into a corner while your healers stay far away and safe. If you have enough blast-off energy you're actually allowed to shoot enemies in the sky too, and in the sky there are around 10 or so random items in every fight that can be gotten if an enemy smacks into them.\n\nThe final battle mechanic are the crystals. In every battle there is a large crystal in the center of the stage that produces an AoE spell random each time, and along with the large one there are also a number of smaller crystals with smaller AoE spells which also all effect those that stand in them. Both forms of the crystals can be broken with the aforementioned "blast-off" system by smacking them all around the map. When they shatter they also produce an effect that is as wide as their AoE. All of their buffs/debuffs can be easily read by simply hovering over them with the in-game cursor.\n\nThe final general gameplay mechanic ties back in with the "moe kill" battle mechanic where if you can successfully defeat enemies with it they will transform into your peons. When you collect X amount of peons your charm level rises (how easy it is to moe kill) and your Peon Ball "read: Spirit Bomb" gets that much larger. The more peons you have also increases the amount of workers you have on your space airship.\n\nTHAT'S RIGHT. SPACE. AIRSHIP. Eat your heart out NASA. This game does have airship battles, and they're actually pretty decent if you're not cheesing it. The airship battles are similar to rock, paper, scissors. You have 3 different attack styles, 3 different shield styles, and buffs. The standard attack deals the most damage, but it gets blocked by every shield type. The pierce attack goes through every shield type, but it is a fraction of the power of the standard attack and can get weakened more by the quick-attack. The quick-attack deals about as much damage as the pierce attack, but it lowers the damage received by the enemies attacks and gets blocked by the shields. During the fight the enemy/your ship's pilot will make remarks that help you guess what they are planning to do and 9 times out of 10 it will be the same, but to keep things interesting they sometimes mix it up. If that annoys you spamming pierce usually works if you're a high enough level, but if you decide to not peon often then you will definitely have to learn the airship mechanics fairly well.\n\nItem Upgrades: You can upgrade your items to ridiculous levels if you're only playing the main story. Basically you can pump money into any weapon/armor you want to increase the stats for it. While not really limitless for all intents and purposes of those who are playing for just the main story it may as well be. If you absolutely adore the rusty sword and old moldy panties everyone starts with for armor (yep) you can scale those to late game easily, but if you want to get to level 9999 while grinding through Mugen field getting better equipment will be a requirement. (all the free DLC will be actually) Speaking of Mugen Field...\n\nTHE GRIND. This game has it. There will be times that you're skipping through so many fights and doing just story that you'll engage an enemy they will all move before you and suddenly your party is wiped. There are also times where the game may force you to complete X amount of kills to continue (though you're given other options too, but if you can't do those battles are required) of which also involves grinding if you haven't been beating a lot of enemies. When that happens you can either: A) spend a decent amount of time grinding the previous area or B) Head back to your ship and enter the Mugen Field which is a battle-rush zone where the enemies start out weak (strength based on size of your bet) but get progressively stronger the farther down you go. The longer you stay in there the larger your experience multiplier gets as well. Completely cheap? Yes. A fantastic way for a JRPG to make THE GRIND a bit easier? Also a yes. Grind responsibly.\n\nOverall: A fantastic JRPG with lots of character. 8.5/10","November 9, 2015","true","50.7"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","25","40","3","0"

HOWEVER, the game is amusing enough to make you wonder if it really matters.\n- Moe kills are almost entirely useless. Not only that, it's annoying to check every enemy's affinity, when killing them normally is faster.\n- The animations are ridiculously long. It's better to just turn off animations completely. At least you don't have to mash the skip button like in the first PS3 Neptunia.\n- Peon balls are confusing. It seems like the way to go is to use your ball attack whenever you get the opportunity to minimize the damage it can do. Why? Because there's a growing chance every turn that your own peon ball will become unstable and explode on your party, dealing massive damage and possibly one-shotting your party. I had an awkward moment where I saved right before the ball was about to explode, so several times I'd start a battle completely screwed.\n- The names of Chou-Chou's forms are weird. Did they really translate "Tsundere" as "Bipolar"? It bothers me a little.\n\nI really like the game's character interactions and story events though. It also has a similar battle system to Neptunia. I'd recommend getting this game when it's on sale. The release date price of $12 is the value I'd attach to this game.","November 20, 2015","true","39.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I find the characters and voice acting great, in games like these (I'm throwing Disgaea in this category as well) the story is never really that great, so its never been the reason I like these sort of games. Instead its better to judge the mechanics, did the battle system give me something different and unique? Yes it did. Was there customization? Yes there was; as far as DLC it doesn't cost a whole lot for what you get so if you're on those people that like extra things up front more power to you, but it doesn't seem necessary for completing the game, just extras like costumes or mugen points. For the game itself the price is very fair. It runs fairly well on my computer, I don't have a high-end graphics card(an NVIDIA GEFORCE 940M) but I don't get framerate drops often if at all, and the ones I have had didn't make the game unplayable, albeit temporarily annoying. I recommend going in with an open mind, things will be weird, but you can get through it, experiment, and maybe you'll be able to embrace this quirky little gem.

Additional Battlesystems keep strategic factor high. Battles can be extremely short, thanks to being able to jump animations. However, using the strategic component is rewarded arcordingly. (You get one "recruit" if you do the battle normally, but 5+ if you "moe" them to be your serva... i mean recruit, for example)\n\nBattleship Battles, which depend on how many enemies you recruited and work with classic Rock-Paper-Scissors, but with clues.\n\nHumour is high up the list, first world is parody of classic JRPG. (Bikinis giving high defense, etc.) Sexual references are high up aswell, insert witty comment here.

It's a decent port from what I could tell(60FPS, high resolutions, but sadly no real graphics options other than resolution). The problem with this is the game itself.  Immediately you are given access to some amazing one hit KO weapons due to this including all the DLC(which is awesome, but they should have made them unlockable items as you went on, NOT available from the get go) I know you can disable them, but when you give a player the option for something that's better than everything else, you're going to take it. That's just how it works. And then we go on to the combat which is taught to you using giant low res JPEGs with walls of text on them. There's tons of neat ideas within it, but no real substance to any of it, it just feels like an incredibly generic JRPG with fancy sounding and looking moves. The only part of the game that seemed like it had some promise was the airship battles, which were pretty fun, not gonna lie.\n\nSo if this type of generic JRPG is fun to you, you can't really go wrong because it's not that expensive. But if you want a more well fleshed out game, then look elsewhere.

Yes, it has over-the-top humor. Yes, it makes you laugh a lot. Yes, it has likeable characters. It should be a must-play for every anime fan. But unfortunately it fails as a game.\n\nStory-wise it fails to follow the important paradigm of "show, don't tell". The most interesting events which happen during the story are never actually visible in the game. Often you only get a still-screen while the characters talk about the awesome stuff which is happening offscreen.\n\nGameplay-wise the game bombards the player with a myriad of badly explained game systems. The game is often criticized for not explaining these well. In the internet age you can help yourself by looking up some guides. This is of course not an excuse, but I thought this would rescue the game at least for me. But in this case many of the complexity doesn't work well even if you have a guide to explain them. Take the moe-kill system, for example. It is essential to the game and without looking up the response chart on the internet it is practically impossible to grasp. But when you get the chart, print it out and hang it next to your monitor, exploiting the system just boils down to looking up the correct response, which soon gets dull.\n\nBy the way: IF you really want to give this a try, better have a gamepad. While the game does have some mouse support, controlling the game with keyboard and mouse is really awkward.","October 31, 2015","false","27.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

The DLC which add cosmetic stuff is fine but a lot of the other DLC gives you VERY op weapons and armour. Even if you sell it you will have far too much gold for that point and lose track of what kind of strength your supposed to be.\n\nAll in all it is a very fun game and I would recommend it to anyone who's a bit bored of your typical turn based RPG game.","October 26, 2015","true","20.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

That being said, I think I've enjoyed this one the most of their games I have played.\n\nThe premise of the game is absurd from the beginning and that actually really helps how silly the dialogue is and the overall seriousness of the game. It's not overly ecchi either, which is a good thing in my opinion. Now, for the actual game mechanics.\n\n-Similar to star ocean in overall combat I suppose, you move around to an enemy and either capture it or kill it provided it's within your attack range. The capture system is gimmicky as hell (Moe Kill), but it's really simple once you understand the affinities and rarely does it seem you need to moe kill in the actual story.\n-This game scales up really quickly, I do not have a character over level 260 right now but as I understand it the level cap is 9999, so that should be interesting for those who are interested in smashing monsters as chibis with outrageously large numbers for damage. If you aren't the sort of gamer that applies to, then I would recommend not using any of the dlc weapons at the start of the game because it casts aside any challenge the game might offer at the start.\n-There is a story mode as well as a challenge tower sort of thing, known as the Mugen Field. It's 100 levels that you can try at three different difficulties that change what sort of fights you are likely to get (standard monster, boss monsters or ship battles). Also, this game has ship battles. Which is awesome.\n\nOverall thoughts:\nThis is not a complex game. The core combat mechanics all rely on a slightly more complicated rock paper scissors system and once you understand how it works you can begin to enjoy the game. That being said, this is also a very fun game; the most fun I've had playing any Idea Facotry game actually. I have a hard time imagining that a fan of HDN;R or Fairy Fencer would not enjoy this as well.","November 3, 2015","true","49.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In my opinion this is a fairly good game. It's has a unique style to it not seen elsewhere. What Mugen souls is, is a turn based tactical RPG. While other Tactical RPGs may have areas designated for special field effects, this game uses circles and crystal-like objects to designate them. These can be broken for a variety of more effects and bonuses. The game allows you hit enemies around like hockey pucks on an ice rink. The initial concepts can seem overwhelming at first but aren't extremely difficult to learn. The hardest thing to learn in this game for me was the Moe Kill system. This is a system where you can use the main characters personaility type along with some phrases to turn enemies into loyal subjects or "Peons" as the game puts it. What makes this difficult is there is no guide or help in game to tell you what phrases match with the 7 personailities or what ones are effective against the other. The game could of had a library where as you use phrases and test out the moe system it unlocks and lets you know what is and isn't effective. I personally am a big fan of NISA and own many of there games, one of the biggest draws for me personally is with this game you can create your own custom characters. While Disgaea has some nice color palette swaps, in this game you can go in and actually alter and dress up your characters. I recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of long grindy RPG games.\n\nIn regards to the censorship. I did some research and appearantly this game is in fact censored. They removed a bathining mini game where you wash the female characters in game. For me personally I could care less about it. Quite a few characters look underage and I don't really want to see them nude anyways. The title recieved what would be considered an M rating in Japan and a T rating here. The censorship does not just end with this mini game though, the translations of certian characters have been toned down as the team felt they were too vulgar for this type of game. Personally I found most of the characters dull and lacking of common sense. That compiled with the underage look of several of the female cast makes the story rather lack-luster and obviously pandering to a niche. The censorship in no way really effects the game or takes away from it.\n\nMy final thoughts are if you look past the story and characters what you have left is a decent tactical RPG, with some overly complicated portions. If your a fan of grindy RPGs and can look past the story and characters this is a worth-while title that will have you busy for a long time to come.","May 2","true","24.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While the graphics and artstyles are definitely outdated, for those who love grinding, and roleplaying, you may like Mugen Souls.\n\nPros:\nCute designs, very moe.\n\nInteresting usage of puzzles to progress.\n\nAble to change your character to different characteristics makes the game unique.\n\n\nCons:\nVERY REPETITIVE!!!\n\nAs Mugen Souls is a turn based game, the core gameplay relies on storyline, fancy moves as well as difficulty. While there are some fancy moves, it quickly gets boring as there is no punishment for making a mistake, every move you make doesn't matter as the enemy can barely do enough damage to affect your decisions.\n\nThe entire playthrough gets very repetitive for you to stay long enough to play through the entire game.\n\nThe only challenging part of the game is the endless waves which gets very repetitive due to its lack of variety in enemies.","March 7","true","13.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game, as others have already pointed out is what you might get if Disgaea and Neptunia had a child, which sounds pretty awesome if you love those games.  However any game that forces you to spend the first hour reading through tutorials is immediately off to a very bad start.  The music that plays in the background as you're reading was just awful, to the point where I had to mute the music to stop my ears bleeding as I tried to read through the tutorials.  The pacing is ruined right out of the gate, the games it is trying to imitate do a much better job of letting the player play the game and slowly introducing more intricate parts of the game as you progress.   If you can get past that initial hump of information overload maybe there is an actual game here to enjoy.","December 24, 2015","false","14.4"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","0"

Nuff said\n\nI will admit that the gameplay is nice. The cute characters and such. I love how the game mechanics work even with less FPS. However, I just could not recommend it. Here are my reasons.\n\n1) Too many content has been cut off.\n- As if censoring is not bad enough, the game developer mentioned about how the mini game does not affect the gameplay. I am sorry, even though it is censored but saying it will not affect the gameplay is really lying\n\n2) Struggle to keep 60 FPS\nThis not a deal breaker for me, even though I can tolerate with lower FPS. However,\n\n3) Overpriced DLC\nSeriously, I was going to keep this game because I thought it was reasonably price. Until I saw the ridiculous DLC scheme. This is the deal breaker for me\n\nFever Point Budle:\nThis is ridiculous. A DLC that will give you more in game credits. This can be achieved through cheat codes in the olden games. I am not going to pay for cheat codes.\n\nUltimate Unlock Bundle:\nThis really hurts me as this is the one true thing makes me refund the game. This is supposed to be with the game. The Ultimate Unlock Bundle feature ALL VOICE UNLOCK (seriously???!!!), ALL PHYSICAL PARTS UNLOCK, ALL CLOTHING UNLOCK and FULL GALLERY SCENE UNLOCK.\n\nSeriously? How is this even justified as DLC. This in my opinion is the stuff should be in the game but they ripped out from the game and sell as DLC.\n\nAt the current price. I really cannot recommend this game, If you want to play a better game than this. I recommend Trails of the Sky. It is much better balanced and does not contain (in my opinion) extortive DLC. If you really want this game. Wait until it goes on a discount more than 40%.\n\nAt the moment, not worth it, even with the price reduction, it is not worth it as we see how much content (120 sets of CG and etc) are cut and extrotive DLC.\n\nEDIT for grammar and spelling error","October 26, 2015","false","0.3"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"
