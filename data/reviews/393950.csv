"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spodamayn/recommended/393950/","spodamayn","spoderman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spodamayn/","4649 products in account","NOTE: The online multiplayer in this game is 100% broken, and the online portion is the reason I intended to play this game. The lag I experienced was so bad that you can't even move around without a huge delay. There is a warning when you access the online mode telling you that it's experimental, but you'll only realize this after playing the game. They don't mention it on the store page or anywhere else as far as I know.\n\nAVOID the game at all costs if online MP is all you're looking for. Now, onto reviewing the other parts of the game.\n\nPros:\n\n- Cool original character designs, nice animations and sprites. Good overall graphics.\n- Some of the levels were more challenging than I was expecting and work well with the scorpion "get over here" move.\n- The AI for the bots is pretty good if you plan on playing the game alone, and in certain game modes provide a good challenge.\n\nCons:\n\n- Scorpion gimmick gets old fast, providing maybe an hour or so of gameplay before the fun runs out.\n- Bots sometimes don't attack you after they've stunned you, which makes overcoming them a little too easy occasionally.\n- No real incentive to keep you playing, there's no campaign or rewards for winning. Would be nice if they added unlockable characters, costumes, or literally any kind of reward for progressing. It doesn't even have achievements.\n- As stated before, the online multiplayer is completely broken. I'm willing to try almost any game, no matter how bad it is in online MP so the lack of it is very disappointing.\n\nFor a local multiplayer game, it's probably not too bad but there are much better multiplayer arena games you can play and the scorpion gimmick isn't really adding anything you can't live without. Not worth the $9.99. If you're intent on buying it, only get this if you can get it for $0.50 or in a bundle.","December 2, 2015","false","6.0"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","25","26","0","1"

Gave it a try with my sis and we both agreed that it's a bit too simple. There should be more to the fighting .. perhaps a bigger map/smaller characters/free aim because right now you can just jump or move near enemies and use your kill move (sometimes even if you are stunned).\n\nSo yeah, the idea is good but It needs something more to be enjoyable. I would recommend the game only if you can get it for a discount and if you are looking for a easy co-op game for the younger.","January 24","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/agw_ottawa/recommended/393950/","agw_ottawa","Sheep!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/agw_ottawa/","420 products in account","Get Over Here is long on art assets but short on design.  It looks good and sounds good, briefly, but it won't hold your attention long at all.\n\nThe first thing you'll probably notice is that the menu is poorly designed.  It accepts mouse-clicks as input, but doesn't acknowledge the pointer, so you'll likely confuse yourself greatly until you realize that the menu must be navigated with keyboard commands.  Don't take your hand off the mouse, though, because you'll need it in play.  And try not to lose track of where the pointer is, which will be tricky, because the pointer is rather small and bland against a very vibrant and cartoony playfield.\n\nYou will have a choice from a rogues' gallery of a dozen goofy characters.  It doesn't matter which one you pick, for gameplay purposes -- they perform identically.  Assuming that you actually play more than once, you might want to find one whose attack phrase you find the least annoying.\n\nGameplay is very simple, and more strategic than it appears at first glance.  Four characters with identical abilities run around in an arena full of hazards.  You want to kill each other in a manner consistent with the match goal (most kills, highest kill streak, whatever) and have only one attack with which to do it.  Your attack is a slow-firing "special attack" that kills everyone in a small radius around you, but is interruptable.  You also have a hook-shot weapon, a la Scorpion from Mortal Kombat which targets with the mouse (that's why you're trying not to lose the pointer) and can be used to pull an enemy to you, or to pull yourself to an enemy.  Either way, the hookshot stuns enemies, giving you an opportunity to get your attack off.  The hook can also pull your enemies into hazards.  You also have a dash move that's good for avoiding hooks -- CPU-controlled characters don't use it much.\n\nBecause your attack is so slow, strategic play tends to involve prowling around looking for opportunities.  Running up to an enemy and attacking will probably result in a stunning hook to your face, breaking your attack and making you vulnerable to a counter-attack.  Hooking an enemy while he's in the process of attacking someone else, however, will give you easy prey.\n\nWhen you die, and you will die often, since this is a one-hit kill system, you respawn somewhere on the playfield.  Find yourself quickly, because spawn protection is fleeting, and it's possible for someone to have killed you again before you even see where you are.\n\nPowerups appear on the screen from time to time.  Some change the game briefly but significantly, like the item that puts a temporary moratorium on hooks.  A sword that fills your screen with text is a trap-item.  Other powerups have an imperceptible effect.  I collect them anyway, because grabbing a powerup is a long-conditioned reflex, but I still don't know what half of them do.\n\nThe simplicity of the gameplay suggests that Get Over Here is trying to be like Divekick, a game that is deliberately simple and short on tactical options, to invite the player to really master range and timing.  Unfortunately, I can't see much reason to do so.  NPC opponents are pushovers, and on the rare occasions I can manage to schedule friends to multiplay something, I'd prefer to spend the time something with more depth.","April 16","false","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boxudo/recommended/393950/","boxudo","Boxa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boxudo/","1482 products in account","This is one of those no purpose/play only with friends kind of game where you have a set up to only play it for a while and not waste much of a time here. Although the game can last longer than you wish.\n\nI explain. The game has a system where you'll play these top-down 2d "fighting" game where a single attack will automatically kill the enemy. It is like one of those minigames from the M***o Party series, where you need to achieve the most amount of points, or kill your enemies the most, until the time ends or the adversary lives end. But, sometimes, you'll play the same stage for a full 5 minutes, which is a lot of time and it shouldn't be like this. It can become tedious after a while.\n\nWell, the game is actually funny in some aspects, the characters are pretty good and memorable, and each of them is pretty unique in its attack and presentation (like their lines and movement). But, still, It feels like it is missing something, it is not really that fun to play.\n\nThis one is pretty trick, as if I should recommend it or not. I will say yes, but only if you take it for a pretty cheap price. And here I'm hoping the developers will actually improve the game over time. If this game maintains as it is, as of this date, I can't say it will be really successful. But that is something that my review is not responsible for.","March 25","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't cost much (occasionally available for just a buck), has a bare-bone interface and options with very few game modes. Don't expect too much going in, and you should be pleasantly surprised, because what little is there is very well polished.\n\nIt's a good party game, with very good design, good graphics, and good sound. The gameplay is smooth and simple while still having some depth to it. It's good for some quick simple fun, especially with friends.","December 1, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
