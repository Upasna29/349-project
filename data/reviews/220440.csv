DMC3's difficulty was fiendishly difficult and the combat intricate, DMC4's Nero was not really interesting to play as (though Dante was decent).\n\nThen I came to DmC. Threw myself into Nephilim (hard) difficulty at once, and could cope rather well (except with those Rages, argh). So, the veterans are right on one count, that the difficulty has been watered down significantly.\n\n(EDIT: I have played through all difficulties on my friend's copy, and Dante Must Die mode wasn't even as hard as Son of Sparda on DMC3.)\n\nBut the gameplay itself is fun, mainly because of the PC-port controls which are pretty decent (as PC ports go). One gripe I have with DMC3/4 is that the PC controls are awkward and clunky as opposed to DmC's. Combos and such were far easier to pull off with DmC's controls, and combat felt smooth.\n\nStory-wise, I actually prefer DmC.\n\nStow thy pitchforks and hear me out.\n\nIn DMC3, you have a brash, young man who has an unexplained grudge with his twin brother, who raised a gigantic pillar/castle/machine down the street from his shop. Said gigantic pillar/castle/machine was to be used to open a portal to the Demon World, and Dante set off to meet and fight his brother following a rather violent invitation. Dante proceeds to slaughter his way past tons of demons, deals with a backstabbing secondary antagonist and clashes with his brother several times before culminating in a battle in the Demon World itself. He realizes that he actually does care somewhat about his brother.\n\nIn DMC4, you have a brash young man who has an unexplained glowing demon-like arm, who arrives late to church, listens to music during a sermon and tries to leave the ceremony before a mysterious man appears and assassinates the head priest. Demons start popping up everywhere, and Nero begins his journey to track down the assassin, finding out that the church isn't as saintly as he thought, and eventually has his love interest kidnapped by the church. He then tries to save her, willing to kill all the demons and church members in his way.\n\nIn DmC, you have a brash young man who doesn't give a used fig about anything other than himself. A girl shows up, warning him about demons who have found his tracks, and manages to defeat said demons with the help of the girl. He still doesn't trust her, but gives her the benefit of the doubt, following her to her headquarters where he meets her boss, who happens to be his twin brother. He slowly finds out things about his past by a visit to his old home, and helps his brother's terrorist organization bring down the demons who are behind humanity's unknowing enslavement. Along the way, he begins to care for both his brother and the girl who helped him, moreso than his brother realizes. After they successfully defeat the Demon King, they have differing opinions and go their separate ways.\n\nPlot-wise, DmC's is far more complex than DMC3/4.\n\nIn 3, you have an enemy castle. Go in, kill everything, deal with a secondary antagonist who obviously was going to betray everyone, and fight the predictable final boss in the form of your twin brother.\n\nIn 4, you have demons and a mysterious assassin, and you kill everything while hunting for the assassin. Then your girlfriend is kidnapped, and the people responsible for it are the ones who gave you your mission. Revenge, save your girlfriend, etc. etc.\n\nIn DmC, there is actual character growth (only in Dante, admittedly [and to an extension, the girl]), where you have demons hunting you down, an actual backstory and a motivation to hunt down the demons themselves that goes beyond 'I have your girlfriend come and get her >:)' or sibling rivalry.\n\nMusic-wise, I was initially apprehensive of the song choice. Dubstep/electronica is NOT my kind of thing. But as I played, I found that the pulse-pounding beats actually suited the combat very well, especially one boss fight in a strip club against a baby (no, really).\n\nVisually, I find the over-the-top displays of Limbo tearing into the real world really interesting, as how even the city itself swears at Dante alters to impede his progress. The enemies are quite varied too, with the grunt 'Stygians', the 'Knight'-class mooks, beautiful yet deceitful 'Witch' and brutish 'Tyrant', and cool, teleporting, dual-katana-wielding ninjas to name a few.\n\nYou may disagree with me; feel free! This is merely my opinion, and if it does not sway yours, that's your call.\n\nAs a conclusion/TL;DR, I would like to make one thing very clear.\n\nThough this is a Devil May Cry game, go into it as if you were going to play a completely different hack-and-slash game. An open mind works wonders.\n\n(This is the same for Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, for veterans of Metal Gear)","September 14, 2015","true","10.6"," 208 of 244 people (85%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","85","208","244","18","17"

Unlike the other games, this one was created by british developers, not japanese. You can see it when you compare it to DmC4 - Dante isn't that cool anime guy anymore - he looks more like emo kid that disrespects everything in the beginning. Vergil looks more like in DmC4, but still, he looks younger. The another difference - gameplay style. You fight against hordes of demons, while you would be happy If you have beaten 5 enemies in DmC4. And I could compare here more things...\n\nThe main plot hasn't changed, it wouldn't be a DmC anymore. Dante and Vergil, children of extraordinary parents, fight against demon king Mundus. But both of them has different opinions what will happen if they'll suceed.\n\nThings I like:+Combat style\n+Weapon arsenal, angelic and demonic weapons (Sword, guns, gauntlets, sickle and more...)\n+Good story\n+7 difficulty levels (very challenging)\n+Combo unlocking\n+Jokes\n+The way Dante changes during the story from disrecpectful kid to kind man\n\nThings that didn't seem satisfying to me:-Short story\n-Some fights are boring\n\nAlso, there is a DLC called "Vergils Downfall" - It explains what happened after the ending and gives you Vergil as playable character\n\n8/10 "In the end, we are all satisfyed, and you are set free"","July 25, 2015","true","35.9"," 128 of 167 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","128","167","9","4"

The games hold a special place in my heart and memory, they were the most cathartic way to get rid of frustration and anger in my angst-filled teen years. Now even as an adult I enjoy popping in one of the originals and battling demons for an hour or two with the wise-cracking Dante. I was in love with the story, riddled with holes as it was, and helplessly in love with Dante.\n\nUpon hearing that the current DMC universe was being abandoned you could not find anyone else more upset about it than I was. I was angry and felt betrayed by Capcom, who were cutting short a story I had spent years in. The new Dante character design was bad, his attitude was at best childish. Stubborn as I am, months turned into a year and I began to realize that change was indeed needed. Ninja Theory seemed to be at least listening to what the fans were saying and with the release of the first player footage my mind began to slowly turn from general hatred of the game to feeling that maybe it would not be so bad.\n\nI personally feel this game to be somewhat of a prequel to DMC3. There's a lot of interaction between the brothers in this game. And in the end I believe is the reason vergil despises his brother dante in the classics. Now the game revolves around propaganda and a group of revolties. Very similar to the antics of V of V for Vendetta. Mundus makes an appearance as once again the antagonist of the game. They even gave him the 3 eyes just like his DMC1 counterpart as a reference. If you played DMC1 than you know Mundu's wants to rule the world and our hero has to stop him, but it's more than that. All this little things really help build up the story till the very end. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that.\n\nThe gameplay is awesome, very smooth transitions from the sword swings. You only get around 7 weapons, 3 guns, 2 angel, 2 demon weapons which is a downer for us who like to have more in our arsenal. If you are expecting dante to give us a little exhibition like he did in DMC3 when he acquires new gear than think again. Now for the DT (Devil Trigger), you do more damage, are faster, get white hair and a vibrant red coat. To me it's not as cool as the other DMCs but again this is a reboot so it's expected.\n\nThe sound for the most part is pretty much what you would expect. Voice acting is top notch, music is metal and screamo. It's alright imo.\n\nThere are a few little things that could have been done better, but when it comes down to what's important, the game was extremely fun. Alot of negative comments have been said about this game, even before it was released, but I say that if you have been a fan of this franchise or good games in general, give this game a chance. This new Dante isn't emo, and even though he appears to be much different than the Dante of old, he really isn't. If Capcom decides to make a Devil May Cry 5, that'd be great, but I personally hope for a DMC sequel. Ninja Theory has crafted their best game yet, and I can't wait for what comes next.","December 22, 2013","true","14.5"," 410 of 605 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","410","605","0","14"

Fans of the original series should look at this game as a prequel, after all, the main characters are different at first, but in the end they are the characters old fans loved or loved to hate. That said, this game is a good way to introduce new fans to the franchise, even though some things won’t be the same, like some plot details and the gameplay.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=377337741\nThis is the story of the rise of Dante, from being a junkie that has supernatural potential but decides to use it to fool around to the demon hunter, protector of humanity. He fights in a world where a Demon King controls humans through debt, who controls the mass media and has a line of products that gets its consumers docile. Dante is introduced to the truth, by his brother, Vergil, the leader of an organization that seeks to free the world by killing the demons that enthrall it and by merging the human world with Limbo, the surreal place where you’ll face your opponents and whatever the environment changes.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=379366582\nThe gameplay is what makes the game shine. There is a variety of moves to take down a variety of monsters. Combining heavy with light attacks followed by ranged attack, then pulling some other poor victim with a red chain to do your personal pattern on him is your fun and their bane. Three ranged weapons and three swords, along with the characters abilities is enough to make you love killing demons and enough to make you replay the game just to get all the moves.  Aside from the standard powers, the angelic and demonic ones are what make you feel most in control, by using the former to get to the enemies and for crowd control, and the later to pull them to you and deliver them heavy blows.  There are many types of difficulties; while the typical three are present(easy, normal, hard), after completing the game you’ll have a harder mode that serves as a new game plus, followed by one where everyone(including you) dies from one hit and the last one, where only you die from one hit, difficulties that present another reason to replay the game for those who enjoy the combat or hunt for achievments.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=377340539\nThere are keys in secret places that open specific doors in the game, doors that lead you to secret levels, which can be challenging, depending on their tier. Aside from keys, there are lost souls that need to be killed for the sake of being a completitionist.\nThis is one of those games I wished I’d bought earlier, because it was definitely worth the price. It’s entertaining, stylish and the story, although it seems to be made for the teen audience, is engaging and by the end of the game, you’ll know it’s a memorable game\n","January 22, 2015","true","11.9"," 88 of 130 people (68%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","68","88","130","8","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/recommended/220440/","bashfulbritishboy","Schmoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/","121 products in account","DmC Devil May Cry is an action-adventure, hack and slash hailing all the way from the brainchilds of Ninja Theory. Being the fifth installment into the series, yet serving as a reboot, this game received a wide, negative reception from those who are bound tightly around the original series, due to the strong character and story re-telling. Either way, I'm not one of those fans, as I accept this game immensely and greet it as its own beautiful reimagination.\n\nThe game's protagonist, Dante; a young, rebellious and hot-headed nephilim, (A hybrid of angel and demon.) who has no memory of the haunting and rather unfortunate past that had happened to him quite a while back. After a heavy night of clubbing, excessive drinking and rough sex, Dante awakens the next day with a hangover and is briefly warned by a young, psychic woman named Kat who hastefully warns Dante in her own words, that ''the demons are after him.'' Speaking of the devil, Dante is subsequently fazed into 'Limbo', a place where the demons are present, powerful and crave Dante's blood. After a few ruthless scenes of both unraveling family revelations and major story plots, you pair up with the twin brother-nephilim you never thought you had, and with his intelligence and propaganda sophistication along with Kat's strong knowledge of Wiccan spells, they'll lead Dante to plunge deep into Limbo and face off a number of demonic threats such as a roundabout circus fight with the baboon-faced Hunter. Taking down a Succubus, who's main job consists of human control through producing the world's most popular soft drink, firing off a middle-aged demon puppet of a TV reporter, and even having to dance with the devil's mistress and their demonic spawn. All of this will depend on the ultimate test of encountering the all-powerful demon king, Mundus. Or Kyle Ryder, if you're wanting to know his human-form alias.\n\nThe game's engine is near to being absolutely perfect and intense. Playing the role of Dante, you have a strong and calculative arsenal; such as performing combos by the slice of his sword, Rebellion. Keep the enemies stunned and juggling with his twin, ammoless pistols, Ebony & Ivory. As you progress through the story, you are granted more weapons, each with their own abilities and strategic modes. New to the series, has got to be the inclusion of the Devil Mode and Angel Mode. Dante's sword attacks change to the Osiris, a speedy, long-ranged scythe type weapon, whilst Devil mode uses the slower but more powerful Arbiter. These modes also alter Dante's mobility. Using Angel mode allows Dante to pull himself towards enemies and various points in each level, whilst Devil mode lets Dante pull enemies and objects towards him. With all of this aside, there are still a few more weapons to discover, but I'll leave the unaware player to discover.\n\nIt's all worthy to note and check out this games DLC, Vergil's Downfall, which allows you to play as Vergil, in his own side story, which just adds fuel to the fire of satisfying those fans who crave more. I would definitely recommend getting this game around the time everything is on a special deal, as it's only worth buying at that time.\n\nThe only thing that I find a problem with this game is the fact that the game lacks a lock-on mechanic, which all previous Devil May Cry games had at it's disposal. You only lock on a specific target automatically, depending on the third person camera angle as well as being in the correct vicinity, as you can fire your guns at targets from quite a mile away if you're standing in the right place. But this also adds to some few minor problems, such as glitching out if you accidently latched onto a target, while a short cutscene is playing.\n\nAs a massive fan of the previous, original Devil May Cry games, I still consider this reboot a new step in the right direction as well as a new breathe of fresh air. Negatively looked down upon fans of the original series, due to the story flaws and late and contrasted character development, aswell the differences it has when compared to the original Devil May Cry games that fans cherish so much, Capcom gave their development rights to Ninja Theory for the correct reason; Their originality is absolutely sensational and I have every right to say that Ninja Theory delivers. I honestly prefer this game's visual style, as it's much more surreal, hollow and darker than the previous 'Anime'-esque originals, not saying I hate the originals, as I love them equally to this reboot, but in a different way. By all means, this game is both for the casual and intense gamer, so it's a win-win situation. It's a massive recommendation from me, to everyone.","September 1, 2014","true","40.6"," 141 of 222 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","141","222","3","0"

This is accomplished mainly through the addition of a grappling chain taken almost straight off of Nero's mysteriously unexplained arm in Devil 4.  Unfortunately, the combo system is somewhat limited in scope.\n\nSadly, a decently built combat system does very little to dress up the glaring flaws present within this game.\n\nAfter playing through the game on the hardest initial setting, the incentive to return and replay is very small as the range of potential enemies to combat is almost as limited as the weapon options you are provided. Difficulty is measured by increasing numbers rather than by the skill of the opponents unfortunately.\n\nFrom a story perspective, DmC falls into the trap of cliche that numerous hollywood movies and games have also been victim of recently. The main character of Dante is a stereotypical rebellious jock / punk teenager who has enough power to ignore the expectations of society and so chooses to live a hedonistic existence and cares only about satisfying himself. Rather than the calm, intelligent and slightly crazy demon hunter that has been presented in the original series, Dante is here presented as a hotheaded brat whose intelligence is often mocked by those around him and whose only interest is in serving his own interests. In short, this new Dante is representative of the common college frat boy or high school sports jock mixed with enough rebel punk to attempt to appeal to both crowds without truly identifying himself to either.\n\nWhile the supporting cast makes an effort to increase interest in the overall story, an element of the game that has supposedly been more heavily emphasized during this reboot, they add hardly any appeal overall. Truthfully, only one or two secenes through the game and the ending scene posses any real depth or character development or even intrigue to draw you in.\n\nFrom a graphics perspective, you can immediately tell the game is a console port, with limited graphical tweaking available and a bland, washed out color palette that will instantly have you wondering what happened to direct x 11 effects. In some cases players may even begin remembering the blurry days of the first Gears of War and Unreal Tournament 3. In almost every respect Devil May Cry 4 has a crisper, better looking graphics engine than this game does.\n\nAll in all I would strongly reccomend Castlevania: Lords of Shadow over this title in almost every aspect but especially in regards to storytelling and artwork.","December 26, 2013","false","12.6"," 136 of 216 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","136","216","3","8"

And let me follow that up with reminding people that this is a WESTERN RE-IMAGINING OF A JAPANESE GAME, thus things will change including character motivations and designs.\n\nIf you look at this game as EXACTLY what it is (Re-imagining) and NOT what people want it to be (apples-to-apples remake and/or sequel/prequel), you will find that while it does have it's faults, it's still a good game. Gameplay while easier than the original, is much more fast-paced and still presents it's share of challenges. Story admittedly isn't terribly deep, but I kind of found the idea of the world interesting and while the satire of American cultural ideas is anything but subtle, it is satisfying to play with the idea that some of the things wrong with the country are headed by demonic powers and thus correct them in an over-the-top way.\n\nLastly, I want to say that with some of the things people seemed to have lost their mind over (namely a very short cutscene in the first level), I want to say to them FINISH THE GAME. Dante changes throughout the game, growing as most young people do. In the end, I could sum up almost all complaints about this game as being a over-blown case of "Judging a Book by it's Cover". Do I reccomend this game to new fans of the franchise? Yes. Do I reccomend it to old fans of the franchise? Yes, if you're willing to see what this game is, rather than what it isn't.","October 4, 2014","true","16.3"," 89 of 137 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","89","137","0","0"

I will review this game without any comparison to the older titles.  Plot  – The game is a total reboot, retelling the story of Dante whom is a Nephilim; half-angel and half-demon. It is set in a modern-day city controlled by all-powerful demons, manipulating humanity through a parallel plane called Limbo. And being a Nephilim, Dante is being hunted down by the demons who believe that he is the only one who can defeat the Demon King, Mundus. With the help of his long lost brother, Vergil, and a human with ability to see through Limbo, Kat, they take on a quest to end the Mundus’ reign over humans.\n\nGameplay  – You have the Rebellion, Dante’s trademark sword and his trusty high caliber twin pistols, Ebony and Ivory. In addition to these, the game showcases the ability for you to switch to Angel Mode or Devil Mode, modifying the weapon you are holding. For the Angel Mode, you have the Osiris, a speedy scythe weapon and the Aquila, a shuriken-like weapon. While in Devil Mode, you get the Arbiter, a huge axe that deals huge damage and the Eryx, a set of gauntlets that can charged up for greater effect. For the two additional firearms, you have the Revenant, a powerful shotgun which will be useful for clearing crowds on a closer range and then the Kablooey, firing explosive needles that stick to the enemies and detonates at your dispose. Featuring five (5) different melee weapons and three (3) different firearms, players are bound to get massive combos to finish off the enemies thrown at them.\n\nThe game also offers different types of enemies that will surely give you a challenge and test your ability to the fullest on harder difficulties.\n\nEnvironment and Design  –  The design of Limbo is what I find interesting from start of the game. How the world transition from a modern-world into a demonic scene is something that I don’t see often, and I like it for a change. The environment are well made, the cutscenes are entertaining to watch. I also think that the soundtrack of this game is awesome, especially when you’re on a combo, somehow it goes with the beat and that really keeps me hyped up.\n\nControls  –I started playing this game using a keyboard & mouse, and then switched to a controller when I finally bought a new one. And personally, I think this game is best played on controllers as you’ll be able to hold the button for either Angel Mode or Devil Mode, making it easier to deal damage in many different ways. Though I had tons of entertainment slashing my way through enemies, there is one thing that ticks me off, and that is the camera angles. Almost all the time, the camera is lowered to the level of Dante’s back, making it harder for me to anticipate whether the enemy behind me is about to attack or not. And this problem got me killed a few times.\n\nConclusion  – Being the first Devil May Cry game that I played and completed my entire life, I would say I had a great time even though the story is quite short. But if you are a hardcore gamer and a huge fan of the franchise, I think you’ll enjoy the different difficulties this game has. Or whether you’re basically a fan of hack-and-slash games, then this game is a must try atleast.","December 17, 2015","true","13.5"," 38 of 51 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","38","51","3","4"

To be honest, the past Devil May Cry/s were dark and scary. I remember, when I was still 10, I played the first Devil May Cry on my ps2 and it scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. Whenever I played that game, hairs all over my body started to stand and my heart raced. I don't know if the game was horror, but to me, it was. And there, I found my childhood crush, Vergil. To me, Vergil was cooler than Dante.\n\nDmC: Devil May Cry is a totally new game. It's not that dark anymore compare to the original series but it still has it's (dark?) humor. I finished the main story on my ps3 in 18 hours, now, I finished it within 10 hours. Talk about short. Still has the repetitive gameplay and fighting styles and collecting the must collect to achieve that "SSS" rank. Though it's the same gameplay from the original series, but it became your typical hack and slash game that's easy to finish.\n\nIn this reboot, they added new female companion, Kat. Dante and Vergil has a new look and started to be really close within the story until the last. The redesign of both two main characters were actually spot on. Dante became rougher and Vergil became more sleeker.\n\nOverall, I like it. 8/10","January 13, 2015","true","81.4"," 88 of 147 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","88","147","7","2"

The level design is truly excellent. Inspired. Different. Likewise, the writing is solid. Its not world changing, but compared to other video games, its pretty good. The characters are intriguing and the satire is obvious enough to be appreciated whilst not so heavy as to ruin the tale.\n\nPity then, that while this game makes major improvements to DMC's world and characters, is does absolutely NOTHING innnovative in terms of game play.\n\nEverything you expect from a typical brawler is here. Gradually escalating enemies, in both number and the tedium involved in defeating them. Gimmicky bosses and mini-bosses whose continued reappearance as part of later waves goes from challenging to annoying with a speed that is mind numbing. Cumbersome and tedious platforming sections that far overstay their welcome, and crop up far, far too often to be fun. Tell me, if the only thing I lose when falling from a platform is tiny bit of health, WHY BOTHER with the platforming AT ALL? It's never been fun in these games, and that has not changed here.\n\nDMC tries. It really does. It has all the marks of a developer determined to do something new, relevant and different - constrained by a Publisher terrified of making even one single, meaningful change to what has become the brawler's too-formulaic design. As is typical of brawlers, the first few levels are fun, with single bosses and mini-bosses and relatively simple platforming. As things ramp up and the mini-bosses are combined as repeating waves while the platforming sections become longer and more complex, the fun fades fast.\n\nMy recommendation: Check out the cutscenes and ending on line. This would have made a fantastic movie. Pity then, that it ends up making mostly a terrible game, in the end.","December 29, 2013","false","4.2"," 55 of 89 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","55","89","0","1"

Enemies, bosses, ♥♥♥♥ing outstanding in my opinion and it goes so well with the refined combat system. You have weapons, Demon and Angel, alongside your usual Rebellion and Ebony & Ivory.\n\nDemon weapons give you a slow, damage based attack and the angel doing the opposite. With these comes the enemies that require you to use a specific type, and will deflect your other attacks.

Fans of the series will feel for sure since the first moment that the game feels different - DmC Devil May Cry is made by British studio Ninja Theory, only published by Capcom. Is that a big damage for whole series? While I've seen many angry DMC fans, I don't think so.\n\nThe story feels really cheesy and you can't expect anything specially entertaining from it. The main character, Dante, makes this fact even worse, since developers made Dante a stereotypical teenager with badass powers who is there just to kill every bad guy and say a gag, in good old Duke Nukem style.\n\nAt this part, I believe, many people would consider DmC being a trash compared to other games but that would be wrong. The game actually offers a great gameplay mechanics, combining many types of weapons and motivating players to swap weapons few times per fight. With balanced difficulty you can expect getting into flow state without problems, enjoying variable combat styles. Controls felt good with Xbox 360 controller, it was a new key combination set for me but I got into it quickly without any problems.\n\nThough levels are mostly linear, you will get opportunity to find secrets (and secret challenge levels) in every level. Some of secrets are not accessible for the first play, to give the game a replayability for achievement hunters.\n\nEnvironment of the game is beautiful, there's many places that will make you stop and just look around how beautiful it is. The soundtrack might ruin the atmosphere of the game for some people because it's mostly in electronic/metal mainstream music (something between Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie) to increase the action parts impression.\n\nOverall, if you don't mind the cheesy story and teenage brat Dante, you'll get a portion of good gameplay for about 10 hours (per playthrough) that you'll enjoy.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 19","true","13.9"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","24","34","5","2"

It's flashy, combat is decent although seems kind of slow paced and awkward at times, and the game makes you feel cool. The level design is probably the best thing about this game; some of the environment aesthetics and boss fights left me thinking 'this is pretty awesome'.\n\nAs a Devil May Cry game, DmC doesn't hold up to it's predecessors. I understand it's supposed to be a reboot, but they took away so much from the original series it hurts. The fact that certain enemies can only be killed with certain weapons is disheartening. Switching between weapons was very fluid, I'll give it that, but the weapons coolness factor was undermined by a very small moveset compared to the previous DMC games (style moves, I'm looking at you).\n\nGranted Devil May Cry games are not known for their plot or writing, but DmC's is just atrocious. I found the new Dante's favoritism of swear words and punk attitude a little overbearing and annoying when compared to the old Dante's cocky, happy-go-lucky overall badassery. All in all, I give the game a solid ♥♥♥♥ YOU/10.\n\nPlay the other DMC games instead, except 2.","February 6, 2014","false","8.2"," 46 of 74 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","46","74","0","0"

It takes a once great character action franchise and dumbs it down for the lowest common denominator. Not only is DmC willing to destroy the foundations that had brought the series the recognition that it had, but it's willing to insult its old fanbase over and over again.\n\nDmC's story and writing are laughably bad, almost as if a prepubescent boy had written it while reading Playboy magazines. The game can never decide whether it was to be taken seriously or not, and the shifts of tone are always jarring.\n\nCombat has been dumbed down significantly. No longer are you required to know your enemies and manage the way you maneuver your character; instead, the game very "kindly" maps all of your directionally sensitive inputs to seperate buttons. Instead of having to push the analog stick (on a controller) in the opposite direction of an enemy to send him to the skies, all you have to do is push the B button. Not only that, but almost all of Dante's moves can be dodge cancelled, which means you no longer have to think about whether a certain combo or move is going to land you in trouble at th wrong time. Just keep mashing the Y button until you win, and if you get into trouble, just keep mashing Y (because then you might parry them with the MASSIVE parry window you have), or just hit LB to simply dodge out of the way.\n\nThe music is garbage. It's dubsteppy nonsense mixed with guitar playing that is akin to that of a mouse climbing up and down a fretboard while a man slaps some strings. Nothing is memorable about the game's soundtrack.\n\nProbably the only good thing about the game is its visual style and graphics. The colors really pop and the environments are pretty creative, even if the level design is lazy. They might've just taken a few islands and strung them together to make the world feel big, but at least it looks pretty while you're running around. The character models don't share the same positive light, however. Everyone looks like a big man-baby, and it's ridiculous.\n\nOverall, DmC is a game you should avoid. Please, do not pay for this game. Borrow it or share it from a friend, if you REALLY have to.","December 26, 2013","false","1.2"," 55 of 91 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","55","91","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DiceeciD/recommended/220440/","DiceeciD","Never Let It End","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DiceeciD/","173 products in account","DmC: Devil May Cry\nTears will be shed\n\nWhen you think of Devil May Cry you think of the iconic character that stands at the front of it, the nonchalant protagonist who remained a core part of the franchise and its image. A lot of gamers would see his white hair and red jacket and know it was Dante, from Devil may cry. Dante as a mascot could be considered more prevalent than the series he originated from, with several crossovers including a role in Marvel vs. Capcom 3. DmC: Devil may Cry does away with all of this, rebooting the entire franchise, all of its characters and it’s universe to try to appeal to more gamers, with a contemporary storyline written by the guys at Ninja Theory, you know, the guys who made Enslaved: Odyssey to the west, an amazing game. Unfortunately, while DmC: Devil may Cry may have some of the looks of a DMC game, it’ll never have their fire.\n\nDmC: Devil May Cry is a complete shamble. Something went wrong at Ninja Theory when these designs came together, and it’s unclear how such a mess could’ve occurred, but at least there’s something salvageable here, it’s just a question of whether that something is enough.\n\nYou start off with a pretty off taste main menu, with Dante surrounded by near naked Angels, where-in you can start a game in a few difficulties, with more unlocked later down the line.\n\nThe opening cutscene is more than enough to make you sick. To put it into simple words, Dante goes to a club, picks up two girls, and takes them to his camper van to have sex with. Classy, Ninja Theory, Very Classy. After this, the first main game cutscene starts off with a naked Dante in his camper, waking up to a disturbance as he’s pulled into Limbo, a Plot gimmick that allows Dante to fight Demons in broad daylight while unsuspecting people go about their day. When gameplay starts after a brief cutscene with the forgettable love interest, you’re taught some basic combat moves as you fight some lesser demons, it plays well, it works and looks good. At 60 FPS it definitely fills its role as a spectacle fighter. Unfortunately it doesn’t get any better.\n\nThe games story progresses in a linear manner as you’re introduced to characters like Vergil, Kat, Mundus and the other antagonists. The Dialogue ranges from acceptable to messy. When the best your character can follow up a ♥♥♥♥ you with is a ♥♥♥♥ you, then followed by a successive ♥♥♥♥ you, you lose a lot of my respect for the integrity of your story and it’s writing. Also, “You can call me Dante the Demon Killer” sounds like an 8 year old in a playground, which is pretty much what our new Dante can be equated to. Vergil is also a disgrace of his former self, but I don’t think you need to look further than his fashion sense to know that.\n\nGameplay consists of the usual combo fighting expected from a DMC game and it plays very well. From my experience it felt robust and fun to play, and using the weapons was fun, unfortunately, even the best parts have their issues. Most enemy designs are well made and fit with their roles, but the main problem comes from the inclusion of Demonic and Angelic weapons, and the inclusion of enemies that can only be hurt by specific weapons. Limiting your arsenal to specific weapons (Until you get 2 of each weapon, which can be quite late in the game, this limits you to literally one weapon) in a game about performing a variety of combos makes no sense to me.\n\nLater into the game you also acquire abilities such as a chain to pull yourself to places and pull things to you, which seem to provide a similar function to Nero’s arm in DMC4. The utility of these in combat makes it quicker and less frustrating to engage enemies as quick acquisition of an enemy is no more than a chains pull away. Along with a glide, these mechanics make movement and combat a lot more exciting and streamlined than previous instalments, and they don’t take away the depth of it either. Some ‘hardcore’ players will argue though that the game doesn’t provide enough weapons or combos to suit their tastes, and this is a valid argument, but for those who aren’t interested in the ‘hardcore’ aspect of the DMC games, the combat in DmC:DMC is good enough to entertain most players looking to do one, maybe two playthroughs.\n\nThe accompanying soundtrack to this game is questionable, employing such talents as Noisia and Combichrist, one known for making Dubstep and the latter for making “aggrotech”. One or two tracks are acceptable and give a good fighting feel, but a good majority of it resides in the realm of sounding like every other Dubstep track out there, or some loud vocals partnered with unfitting techno.\n\nDmC: Devil may Cry features really beautiful environments, some of the best of its generations of games. Not once did I see a texture and think it was stretched or low res, or a model that looked a bit jagged. The Art style for most of the assets is really nice and colourful which is a contrast to previous games in the genre, and although some of the old, dark and spooky areas from previous games are missed, the new ones are a welcome addition. It could be argued that they take away from the atmosphere of the game but it’s a hard argument to make considering the plot surrounding that atmosphere.\n\nOverall the plot and handling of the characters is the most controversial topic here and needs some going over. There are some serious issues with the way the reboot was handled, including the defacing of the franchises main character. Many would argue that it's a small price to pay for a good game, but a lot of what made DMC good was the connection with Dante as a nonchalant cool character that broke a lot of normal story telling conventions. Dante wasn't a mopey protagonist who hated being a half demon who had to kill people and had a burdened past or whatever. He was cool, he didn't care, and he was having fun doing what he did and the players were in on that too. At the same time, there was a sense of delicacy with the plots of the original games, which was not taken into account here. The plot feels scrambled together with names taken from the original but not much more care put in past that. Mundus is some kinda weird Corporate Boss that doesn't fit his original representation, Vergil is the new Anonymous ringleader and the ending twist is poorly done and easily predictable.\n\nDmC:DMC has some issues and is an insult to the original fans who craved for another iteration of their beloved franchise. It's not bad though, and it has some appeal and fun aspects, but don't expect a DMC game. Expect a game with a poorly mashed together 'contemporary' plot, some awesome spectacle fighting gameplay, terrible Dubstep music, and gorgeous environments.\n\nIf you're still interested buy it on sale but don't pay more than £10/$20 for it. If you're a fan of the original series and are interested in similar games that could scratch that itch, try Bayonetta or Metal Gear Rising Revengeance (Slated to come to Steam in the near future).\n","December 1, 2013","false","20.3"," 297 of 538 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","297","538","0","10"

Having never played any of the previous games in the series, all I knew was this being a hack and slash game and that it was a reboot of the series. I know this game received a lot of hate when it was initially released, because of it being a reboot, having a brand new Dante, and that sort of stuff. My review can't really speak on that as I haven't played any of the other games in the series. So my review will be based solely on this game itself and my experience with it. That said, I can definitely say I really enjoyed this game and had a lot of fun with it. The soundtrack is a pretty wild one, with some crazy music, but it definitely suits the atmosphere of the game and makes the battles and fights rather exciting. The atmosphere of the game was really great, as it didn't take long for me to be immersed into the world of Devil May Cry. From the level designs to the art style of the game, Devil May Cry's visuals definitely impressed me and just added to the amount of fun I was already having with the game. It also further impressed me as well. The fights themselves are smooth and fast-paced, with the music just really adding a lot to the fights. It definitely got me really into the fights. There's also a lot of stuff to do in the game as well. The main game consists of 20 missions, but it's more than that. There's lots of collectibles, side missions, and more. With storyline, I thought it was pretty good for a hack and slash adventure-action game, It definitely kept me interested until the end, and even wanting more. Fingers crossed that this game does get a sequel. But yeah, adding onto the game's content, there's definitely a lot of replay value, with the various difficulty modes of the game, which can be unlocked by completing other modes. Or going back through levels to collect missed items, find hidden secrets, and more. As I said, a lot of replay value. To be honest, I think at the beginning of the game, Dante was someone you could have mixed feelings for, but I think he had some great character development as the game progressed, developing into a hero that made me proud to have played.\n\nOverall, I found DmC: Devil May Cry to be a great game that I had a lot of fun with until the very end, and yet still wanting more. From an awesome soundtrack to interesting storyline to impressive visuals and atmosphere, this game impressed me in many areas. I had my doubts about this game before going into it, however after giving it a chance and playing it fully through, I can definitely say my initial doubts where proven wrong. I'm glad I took the chance on this game, as I had a lot of fun with it. I've got no problem recommending this game to any of my friends. It's well worth two thumbs up from me.","February 20, 2015","true","12.8"," 49 of 83 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","49","83","0","4"

Camera gets lost too often, controls are more loose compared to previous DMC titles. The weapons are fun (though not guns) and chaining combos with various weapons is enjoyable. Some opponents and most bosses are not fun to play against. They're not difficult (finished on Nefilim/Hard equivalent, hardest difficulty you can get on first playthrough), just super annoying. The art design of the levels is occasionaly very good (one of the levels mid game is amazing), but the actual layouts and traversal are uninspired. Platforming elements are very weak.  Altogether gameplay is ok at best.\n\nWhat is truly terrible is the story. DMC series never made much sense and was always cheesy, but at least it was amusing most of the time. This game takes itself very, very seriously. Characters make fun of Dante for being an emo kid, but it actually is a spot on description. 90% of the cutscenes are cringe worthy and/or boring. At least you can skip them even on first play through. I did in the final third of the game once my patience ran out. I doubt it picked up in quaity.\n\nUltimately, not a terrible game, but average/decent at best and does not kick ♥♥♥ like the previous young Dante. With so many cheap, good games available, do yourself a favour and spend your time playing something else. If you really want to play a good DMC game, buy DMC 3 Special Edition.","December 30, 2013","false","10.8"," 83 of 146 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","83","146","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryukthecreep/recommended/220440/","ryukthecreep","Xuchilbara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryukthecreep/","462 products in account","I'm one of those people that have been following the Devil May Cry series since its debut in 2001, that loved the first game to the point of obsession and that, in the following years, have been more and more disappointed with the way Capcom managed the franchise and let both the characters and the basic plot of the series go to waste. Hence I wasn't surprised when this reboot was announced, and I have to admit that at first I was amongst the screaming mob that instantly dismissed this game as utter garbage, resulting from a sleazy marketing operation. But instead of stubbornly clinge to a first impression I wanted to try it first hand so that I would've been able to express a complete and reasoned judgement. And well, after watching the credits the overall verdict that I can give to this DMC is actually quite positive.\n\nLet's say first of all that the protagonist is a pain in the ♥♥♥, it just has to be admitted. Instead of the good ol' Dante we have this teenage prick that tries hard to be edgy and acts like the typical street thug, spitting out lines that sometimes are really cringe-worthy, especially in the early parts of the game. But if you think about it, it's not so different from the young Dante that we had to bear in Devil May Cry 3. And guess what? Contrary to the latter, the kid we see in this game actually experiences an hint of character development. That's because the plot, while obviously not particularly remarkable in terms of depth, is still written decently and is surely much more consistent than the awful mess we saw along the years in the various sequels of the original Devil May Cry. Even if don't personally like much the more "urban" aestethics of the setting, I appreciated the fact that the developers tried to give it a bit more depth with the whole "New World Order" mood, which is not exactly the top of originality (it's actually clearly inspired from the movie They Live) but it suits well to the purpose. So pros to that.\nThe gameplay, which is the primary aspect for every DMC, is pretty solid, level design and platforms are not particularly remarkable but are still well made and the different interactions with the surroundings made possible by the new weapon system are an interesting and fun to use addition. Those who are familiar with the series will notice that the difficulty is rather below its standards, but thanks to the aforementioned new weapons making combos is still fun and the new game modes add an extra challenge to everything. Of course you don't have to expect anything nearly as hard or deep as Bayonetta, which IMO has set the new standard of excellence in this genre. However, If you never played a DMC before and you're not very accustomed to action games this one is an excellent entry point.\nThe biggest flaw I've found in this title is the enemy design: they look dull, unimpressive and generally lack diversity. I don't recall a single boss battle that really troubled me or that left me with a strong impression, except maybe the final battle. That is a big lack for an action game and doubly so for a Devil May Cry. I also felt the abscence of enemy lock-on during combat: to attack an enemy you have to face towards him with the left stick, it generally works well but sometimes you can't hit the precise enemy you want to at the first shot, and that can be really annoying. Aside from this couple of things, this DMC is a good action game that can certainly be considered way above the average of similar titles. Could have been even better if it wasn't for the flaws I pointed out, but it's still good.\n\nOn technical level the PC version looks flawless and runs perfectly smooth, always still at 60fps without a single hiccup while running at maximum settings (on my rig I currently have an i5-2500k @3,60 Ghz with an AMD Radeon HD 7850). So for once, we don't have to complain about the porting - yeah yeah I know, there are very few graphic customization options but I don't care, considering the average quality of console ports that I've seen during the last years I absolutely cannot complain about this one.\n\nA side note about the "Vergil's Downfall" DLC: I don't recommend buying at full price, it's very short (only 6 missions) and the story adds very little to the plot, it looks more like a tentative to include a playable Vergil due to popular demand and nothing more. It's not all bad, though: I appreciated the fact that Vergil has its own combat style with some features directly inspired by the Nelo Angelo boss (aka Vergil himself) in the very first DMC as well as the whole atmosphere of the levels, much darker and oniric than the ones from the base game, which fits very well to the completely different personality of Vergil and sometimes makes it all look like a whole different game. Playing with Vergil is also harder than Dante, partly due to the limited move set and partly to the very "technical" (yet extremely powerful when mastered) combat style, so expect having to swear a bit if you plan to get an SSS on every level on every difficulty mode. So all considered I suggest to buy this DLC when it's on sale, buying the complete pack on discount would be the best option.\n\nAs a final and personal note I have to give my congratulations to Ninja Theory, because having to deal from scratch with a series that had such a troubled background and that always brings extreme expectations is not easy, and managing to do so while at the same time giving a new consistence to its plot and characters is a proof of talent. Not many people could have done that. Bravo.","March 4","true","70.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This is a bit odd since the completion stays between levels, so once you get all the collectibles, you will always get SSS (x8) multiplier for 100% completion on a level. This artificially affects the score because it means any player wishing to get on the leaderboards must first play the level to 100%, then replay it "for score" (since time is also a factor, you want to go fast). Very very minor issue.\n\nCONS:\n-The platforming is AWFUL.  Long stretches of just running from point A to point B with little to nothing happening. The direct jumping sections are extremely shallow and the "hookshot" components play out as a glorified flash game (you just hook when the target lights up...)\n\n-Only about half the cutscenes can be skipped (BACKSPACE since it never tells you). The other half cannot be skipped for some reason...\n\n-TERRIBLE FORCED AUTO AIM. I assume this is the result of poor porting. There is no aiming reticule and the game will often aim at random things, sometimes not even on the screen from where you are looking. However, this is a very minor problem (I beat the game on all difficulties except Hell & Hell with only minor issues).\n\n-There are skins for the weapons apparently....if you pay real money?

I finished this game in days after i got home from school. Really excited to playing this game. Ok here is my review:\n\nDevil May Cry is Action Hack and Slash game developed Ninja Theory and Published by Capcom released on January 2013. We are playing as Dante. Dante is a Nephilim; half-angel, half-demon. Dante have a mission to kill King Mundus who kill Dante's mother. He partnered up with his brother Virgil.\n\nGameplay\nWe are playing as Dante who uses his power and weapon to beat enemy. Like the previous series, in this game Dante can perfrom combo using Rebellion sword, ivory and ebony pistols, and more. There is new feature in this game: Angel mode and Devil mode. This new feature can be activated by using trigger. In Angel mode, Rebellion sword change to Osiris and Devil mode changes to a powerful weapon, Arbiter.\n\nPros\nNew features: Angel and Demon Mode\nMore Dante's mobility in Angel and Demon Mode\nGreat visual\nBloody palace DLC is free and the others except Virgil Downsfall\nAttacking combo looking good\nCons\nDante's hair.... I love the previous Dante hair\nDamte looks like a badass teenager\nBoss battle isn't fun as a regular combat do\nThe ending. Oh my god. I dont know why it's so sucks i think. It doesn't fit up the rest of the story\nSummary\nWell i think this reboot of DMC is still a good game. The Angel and Demon Mode is a good addition to the game meanwhile the ending isn't good as i think. But, this game is still very good for DMC fanguy.\n\n8.5/10","November 15, 2015","true","0.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

So shocking that a lot of fans cried foul and screamed blood murder. Was it for the best? Perhaps it was, DMC 4 was undoubtedly a step backwards after all. Capcom took a chance with outsourcing the IP and surprisingly it paid off.\n\nMeet DmC: Devil May Cry, a young fresh reboot by the team that brought you Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West. With a slick, stylized re-imagining of the world home to the Nephilim Dante. Born of the Angel Eva and Demon Sparda, he possesses the power of both. Hunted down by the Demon king Mundus, Dante is dragged into the parallel plane called Limbo at every turn.\n\nWhile the initial combat impression and the new look might seem jarring at first. After a few minutes you will find that DMC is very much alive under the hood. The intense high level combat gameplay is still there with some interesting new additions to mix things up a bit. Once mastered you will be able to perform the dazzling acrobatic slashing we all know and love with ease again. I say with ease but do not mistake this for the difficulty having eased up. The challenges are still very much there, though I would recommend people familiar with the series start on Hard.\n\nAll in all the reboot manages to be fresh, engaging and most of all fun. It will be jarring to some but that is the case with any reboot. If you've enjoyed DMC in the past or enjoy action hack and slash games, give this a shot.","February 7, 2014","true","30.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

This is one of the best Devil May Cry games available. The criticism against it mostly centers on Capcom's decision to transform the iconic character of Dante. I promise, it's just a cosmetic change. No, he does not look like a gothic anime villain and he does not spend his time hunting demons in medieval castles. Aside from that, he's the same Dante he's been since DMC 3. Yes, he has attitude, but it's not as over-the-top as it used to be. DMC 3 let Dante perform ridiculous stunts like using a motorcycle to pulverize demons and wielding an electric, bat-shooting guitar, all while spouting off catchphrases straight from the Ninja Turtles. While that was campy and lots of fun, DMC shoots for a different tone. This is a serious game with a Dante that is more human than action hero. He's traded his anime garb for something along the lines of urban anarchist. But the game is GOOD. The combat is nearly flawless. Controls have been streamlined, so no more cycling through different fighting styles or trying to decide which weapon to take into battle. This isn't Resident Evil with swords anymore. It's a fully-fledged brawler and it can be legitimately challenging. The storyline is also a vast improvement over previous installments. The voice acting is no longer outrageous. Dante's demons don't haunt dark dungeons anymore. They live all around him: in the media, in junk food, in human lusts and appetites. These are the Seven Deadly Sins personified and Dante embodies them as much as he wants to destroy them. There is internal and external conflict going on, all blending seamlessly with brutal and satisfying combat. Dante's hits shake the earth. His enemies wield chainsaws and katanas. Fans of Nero will be happy to find that Dante's sword now has a grappling function to pull enemies close. Does it look like a Devil May Cry game? No. But all the familiar faces are there (including Vergil, whom you can control in the DLC); Dante's attitude hasn't changed, and there's a LOT to love here. Don't let the negative reviews discourage you. This is a truly phenomenal fighting game that pays homage to its predecessors. As someone who has played the heck out of every DMC game and even suffered through the terrible anime, I can say this is a worthy reboot of the franchise. 9/10.","October 9, 2015","true","57.2"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

I am very happy to say that there is so much fun to be had in this game. The gameplay is fast-paced, but rewards players for taking the time to study all the combos. The boss battles in this game are some of my favorite, and really do see who took the time to learn all the moves. It's also very fun to compare your score with friends after beating certain levels. Coming in, I wasn't expecting much from the story, but I was very pleasantly surprised by it. The game builds a very interesting world and concept, with character developement from both Dante and Virgil. It even has a great and shocking end bossfight which makes me hope that when the developers are done with Hellblade, they'll get to work on a sequel to DmC. Unfortunetly, the campaign is very short, but it'll make you want to replay levels again on higher difficulties to get the best possible score you can. Theres also a "Bloody Palace" mode that has you fight off against hordes of enemies, which can be fun and is a great time killer. The voice acting most of the time is good, but there are sometimes where it tends to get a bit sloppy. The music is also very fitting for the character of Dante and the situations he is in. You'll mostly be hearing Rock, Metal, and Dubstep. Something else I really liked about this game was the platforming. Platforming is fast and fun, but it isn't mindless. In the end, DmC Devil May Cry is a game that provides alot of fun especially if you know a friend who also owns the game and wants to compare scores, but the storyline is very short.","December 28, 2015","true","13.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DevilsArrow/recommended/220440/","DevilsArrow","Asiimov Angel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DevilsArrow/","54 products in account","This Review focuses on DMC: Devil May Cry as in individual game, rather than one attached to the previous Devil May Cry series created by Capcom.\nPersonally, I like the old series better, however I had to try my best to stay impartial when giving this game a review.\n\nContains Spoilers!!If you want a short version of this review, please just skip down to the “Overall” section. If you want to read the in-depth information, feel free to read my whole reviewTechnical\nI personally enjoyed the games updated graphics and texture features. The textures on the enemies and spawns fit the demonic theme of the enemies perfectly. The detail in the environment added to the overall emersion of the game and the missions, making the plot easier to get dragged into. My only argument about the graphics and textures is that in some points,  such as the fight with Mundus’ mistress , the backgrounds can be somewhat distracting and disorienting to the fight at hand.\nThe mechanics fit the game quite nicely, however on a PC the controls were a little bit whacky. It is hard to make these types of controls for the PC, and I think the game creators did a good job of trying to make it so that you could access all of the skills and combinations for all of the weapons you acquire with this game. It can be hard to remember all the massive amounts of attack combos, but they make it so that the game doesn't require every single combo in order to succeed. Some of the combos are just clicking patterns with your mouse, but others require you to knock an enemy into the air.However, if you’re not good with aerial combos, the game creators made combos and chains on the ground that are just as strong. I know that I survived the game without even realizing that I was using certain combos that I’d unlocked. However, if you’re picky about combos and chain attacks, the game gives you plenty, if not almost too many, combos to practice and learn from, and the game doesn’t make you practice them in the middle of the story, and you are able to revisit them in training mode. Lastly, if you’re big on combos and chains, you can earn additional points toward your missions overall rating. (D-SSS), through your chains and combos.\nThe addition of "style points" and rankings based on impressive chains and combos makes it a goal to hit combos, and not a necessity. I personally enjoy all the different chains and combos that they made possible with the game, even if they are tricky to remember. It gives the game a bit more flavor. The best part of this, in my opinion, is that the combos are optional, meaning that the game doesn’t make you learn and master every combo on a dummy a million times, to be able to continue with your game. You can do that on your own time.\nThe unlocking of these skills and combos with rank-up points is also another thing I think that adds to the games flavor. Being able to unlock combos that you think you'll use, and the option to chose not to unlock ones that you don't think you'll use adds the feeling of customization to the game. Even though you'll probably need to unlock everything by the time you finish the game, there are several combos and skills that I didn't know I had prior to visiting the training area. The training area allows you to practice different combos and chains, and I like that as well about the game. It came in handy for me to figure out which set of skills works best with my fighting style, and which ones to avoid.\nThe music choice was a bit edgy for my liking, however the old DMC games contained heavy music similar in style to that used in this game, so I can at least say that element is consistent with the previous series.\n\nCharacter/Plot Development\nThe character development for the main characters is solid, and you get to know the main characters the best-as in any game. However, the development of the supporting characters wasn’t as strong. (Such as Virgil, Dante’s brother. You get to know general information about Virgil, but there are still a lot of questions that players may have, assuming that you didn't play the older games.) The development of nemesis characters and boss characters is solid, in that you get to know why you’re trying to kill them, why they are against you, and how you get to the point of facing them. I think this is very important in a game and it’s character development, because why spend the time fighting a boss if it doesn’t have a purpose?\nIn some games hordes all look the same, but some enemies are stronger than others with different skill sets and stats, and it’s important to make stronger Horde enemies stand out. DMC does a very good job with this. The horde enemies have different looks based on their attacks, and the stronger a Horde enemy is, the bigger and nastier the creators made it look. This made it easy for me to tell who to focus on first, and who to shred through at the end. The last aspect of the horde that I think that DMC did a good job of showing, is that each part of the horde is important. If you forget to kill something in the air, it will continue to hurt you and make itself noticeable to you until you get around to it. Nothing really goes unnoticed in the horde, and I appreciate that every enemy has a purpose.\n!Spoiler Alert! The development of Dante as a character (not related to the Dante used in previous games, but rather looking at him as a completely different person) made me very pleased. You’re as “in the dark” as he is about who is is, and what he is, at most points in the game. Personally, I just assumed that he was a full demon based on his portrayal in the opening scenes, but I was surprised to find out he was a nephilim, and I was pleased with the way that the story carried through with the information. The stories of Dante’s parents are told through several little hints and clues, but it all comes together nicely, and it fills in the blanks that many games tend to leave open. Flashbacks are properly used to portray Dante’s past, and they’re interactive. The makers used the idea of “limbo” in a great way in order to show Dante’s history.\nMy one complaint however, would be the immaturity of his character. He seems like an attractive man♥♥♥♥♥ at the beginning, but we find out (or at least I did) that he's got the attitude of a 12 year old, which was a major turn-off for me.\n\n(I'm trying my best not to compare this DMC with the old ones, but if I had to say anything, old Dante is witty and cool and this one is edgy and annoying.)\n\nThe development of other characters, such as Vergil and Kat, was a bit weaker, but you could see how they tied into Dante’s success. You learn about their history through working with them and their stories are revealed through little hints.\n\nOverall\nIn general, I give this game a positive rating, and on a scale of 1-5 I'd rate it a 4 as an individual game, but in comparison to the old DMC series, it would be a -1 (again, that's my bias talking).\nThe mechanics fit the game, but can be tricky to master, and some mechanics must be mastered in order to complete the game. The game gives you some degree of customization with skills and perks, but since the main characters are set, the lack of player customization is appropriate. There are DLC packs and unlocking features that allow you to change the appearance of Dante and Vergil, however they don’t add much to the game, nor take away from it. The plot development is solid, but sweet and short, and I wouldn’t say this game has much replay value. There are a variety of difficulties, making it so that you could focus on the mechanics and battles, or the story. But in all game modes, if you can handle it, the story development is worth playing through. The main character development is solid, but the supporting character development is a bit","May 19","true","16.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Due to the nature of the gameplay, the background is consistently changing as you progress. This was no lazy task, my friend. The atmosphere immediately immerses you into the world of DMC the second you turn it on.\n\nSound: 10/10 - Every slice, every shot, every dodge, & every grapple have their own unique sounds. I did not find one recycled sound track throughout the entire game. They are all loud, pronounced, and crisp.\n\nGameplay: 11/10 - You have five weapons to play with and upgrade: A sword, an axe, a scythe, two guns, and a gauntlet. You have the power to switch these out seamlessly, connecting different weapons for different combos to decimate your enemies. It is fun and easy to get innovative. This game has new game plus, as well as seven difficulty settings to play through. On top of that, there is another game mode called Bloody Palace Mode where you fight hordes of enemies as long as you can, eventually facing each boss as long as you can survive. Points earned in that mode carry over to the normal campaign.\n\nYou can compare this game to it's Eastern counterpart if you want to, but why butt heads just for the sake of butting heads?\n\nNinja Theory took an already developed franchise - some argue not yet fully developed - and rebooted it.\nThey changed the look, they changed the feel, they changed Dante - they changed Devil May Cry.\n\nDoes that automatically make it bad? To some it does, and for those people they can negate it's existence all they want. But for the other curious brains out there I can tell you that whether you're a fan of the original or not, this is one solid hardcore hack and slash.\n\n\n\n","November 12, 2014","true","18.7"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I was incredibly sceptical going into this revamp of the franchise as would any fan of a series if the main caracter got a facelift but after playing through the entire story 3 times I have several things to say:\n\n- Gameplay was both familiar yet edgy, the new weapon switching system flowed faster and as hard as it sounds made the combat even more engaging.\n\n- Story, The story was great if you put aside your complaints about his looks Dante acts no different to any other DMC with his smartass comments and his edgy moves and if you hardcore fans can make it to the end you will be pleasantly suprised.\n\n- The art style was different and if you actually notice the HD options in the menu (sadly I only found it on my second play through) you can clearly see that it is not just a simple conole port. The level design feels a little too straight forward for my tastes but the secrets were fun to find.","February 10, 2013","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/93juantheone/recommended/220440/","93juantheone","Neutron John","http://steamcommunity.com/id/93juantheone/","785 products in account","DMC: Devil May Cry Review\n\nI never had the pleasure to play the previous Devil May Cry games. They came out during a time when I was not allowed to not even touch an M-Rated game. Once I was older, I never sought them out and soon forgot about them. I regret that...slightly.\n\nDMC is a prequel/reboot to the Devil May Cry series. It follows the spawn of an angel/demon relation as he tries to find out where he fits in this world and what a world it is! Ninja Theory may not be so subtle in their approach here, but it does go a long way to making DMC's world feel unique among its contemporaries. It's an entire satire on modern capitalism and political ideologies, but it's cool to see the developer have the guts to stick by its presentation and not skimp on it's more obvious satire of more popular people like the infamous Bill O' Reilly.\n\nThe gameplay is immensely visceral and very complex albeit I believe not as much as previous entries. Nonetheless it's a good starter point for anyone interested in the series. The combos, while there might be many, end up becoming quite simple to memorize after a while since every weapon has the same combos with some slight variations. Overall, it's very refreshing to play a melee combat game that has a bigger move-set than it's contemporaries. Be warned, while this game is easier than previous Devil May Cry iterations, those iterations were known to be pretty difficult. This leads to Devil May Cry being a tougher game than usual and a game that requires your full attention at all times. This might be one game that you should be able to start on Easy instead of Medium without making you feel like you suck. Thankfully the game makes it simple for you to remember combos and times to dodge by using creative visual cues. The gameplay is the main reason to play DMC and trust me it does not disappoint in that department.\n\nAs for the story of DMC, it ends up being kind of a mixed bag, but overall a much more compelling narrative than most titles released today. While sometimes you might wonder why the developers didn't just make a film, you'll quickly grow accustomed to the slick cinematography and intriguing story. Without giving any spoilers away, the game has some detours in the story that feel more like padding to artificially lengthen the game and ends up messing with the pacing of the story. The main bad guy is intriguing, but unfortunately is not given time to grow to feel like he is a menacing, credible threat. Towards the end a subplot is thrown in with very little flair and is never given enough time throughout the story to be believable. It makes the characters involved in this scene do things that are kind of uncharacteristic, and contradictory to their established personalities.  Overall the story is compelling, but is filled with many tropes and other maladies that bog it down a bit.\n\nYou may be wondering if I like this game? I’ll tell you this much. I love this game, and while my critical eye is quick to catch where it falls short, as a new fan I must say that I loved being in this world and following the characters on their respective journeys. So it pains me to say that it is a damn shame that we may not be getting a sequel to this game. Being the lowest sold in the series, it makes the prospects of a sequel highly unlikely, which is really unfortunate. From the slick presentation, intriguing story, compelling characters, to engaging combat; DMC will alway remain on my mind as a what if. A series with great potential held back by mediocre sales. One thing's for sure though...I’m going to go back and see if I can play all the old Devil May Cry games. I need more Devil May Cry!\n\n8.7/10","July 31, 2015","true","14.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's mostly their terrible attempt at Americanizing their games (I always loved Onimusha 2 becuase it's Japanese and feels like it. It doesn't feel like it's forcing itself to be Japanese). The original Dante was less likeable than this guy, mostly because he didn't have a personality to like. While the new Dante doesn't start off too likeable and if you go by just his appearance (which I imagine most of the Devil May Cry-babies have done) he does come off as a bit of an arrogant prick. In fact that doesn't really change but as the game goes on you get to see his human side as well as the devilish side, I didn't think I'd say this when I started it but he is a great character. His brotherly interactions with Vergil are amusing and I imagine quite familiar for anyone with a brother.\n\nThe story itself isn't earth-shatteringly amazing but it is good and more importantly it's well done. The graphics are nice, especially if you can handle Ultra which you should be able to do, my pc is currently a hunk o' junk and can pretty much run it. The whole Limbo thing is pretty awesome and the level design in general is good. Certainly better than the previous Capcom titles as it features no backtracking whatsoever which I hate with a burning passion. At no point did I get bored of this game. The story mode is kinda short I guess, it took me about 14 hours but I think that's acceptible, especially if the game has good replay value. There's a New Game+ mode so you can go back and get some of the secrets you couldn't the first time round (I think you can do this at this at any point just be redoing a level after you've aquired the right stuff) with you're fancy new gear and give yourself a bit more of a challenge at the same time. Some people argue that they've "dumbed down the combat" but the way I see they've simplified it to make it more intuitive and fluid and the bosses are much less of a grind/colossal pain in the ♥♥♥♥ that take all the fun out of life.\n\nThe soundtrack is just awesome, Combichrist and NOISIA (Vision backwards/upside down, you can thank me later) make the action sequences feel so much more electric and even the tense or mellow parts. It's just the perfect soundtrack to this kind of game, although that's probably debatable but then what isn't?\n\nAll in all this is a good hack'n'slash with good acting, a decent story and character develpoment, an awesome soundtrack and good gameplay. Don't listen to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off fans, they just hate because Dante. I sincerely hope this game gets a sequel.","September 30, 2015","true","15.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","8","14","2","0"

It has an involved and complicated combat system - much more so that the Batman games which are basically "press A for awesome".  Even as a newcomer to the series and relatively inexperienced character action gamer, the combat was intuitive and rewarding to master.\n\nThe plot was somewhat standard but was done well even so.  The game is beautiful and has a great deal of variety in enemy design, combat scenarios, and bosses.  I kept thinking I would put it down, but I ended up finishing it in 2 settings.  The difficulty gradually increases but does so in a more or less fair manner.\n\nIt has all the nice Steam features (cloud, trading cards, etc).\n\nReally an excellent game all around and well worth the (discounted) price I paid.","January 21, 2014","true","9.5"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","0"

In my 20+ hours of playing this game I only see 1 or 2 down side. First one is If you're a fan of an old Devil May Cry don't expect this one to be the same It has some resemble but not the same, in term of story  you have Dante, Vergil , Mundus blah..blah...blah It has some resemble but not the same(it a reboot what do you expect). There is a characteristics change in this game some good some bad( and some of them ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off - -*) that i won't spoil it for you.  Second one is If you have played original Devil May Cry series you will find this game is easy and not as challenge as the original one.\n\nThe final verdict for this game is 8/10\n"it is a very good action game, If you not cosidering it as a Devil may cry"\nNow is time for my personal opinion "I think the new Dante look...STUPID!

However, those problems are offset with the overall combat system, as you can easily switch between the Angel and Demon weapons simply through pressing the left and right triggers respectively, which I felt held the game together.","June 22, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Graphics are very good with everything set to "ultra".  Frames never dipped below 60 (check my PC specs in my profile).  The story is interesting, and the dialogues are pretty cool.  Gameplay is very good, combining a ton of weapons, abilities, and moves.  It takes a while to get used to switching between all of them to fit different monsters and environment interactions.  Finding items and collectibles is also fun, although to gain 100% completion you need to go back and replay levels because you won't have every ability needed the first time you tackle most levels.  I'm not into playing games twice (Skyrim and Mass Effect are sole exceptions), but if you do, this game has replayability value.  Finished in 13 hours and gets an A in my book.","November 13, 2013","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It retells the story of the origins of Dante, Vergil, Sparda and the iconic Eva, in a twist that breaks the cadre of the story from the previous Devil may Cry series.\n\nReview: The story was a (bit) half-♥♥♥♥♥, character development was shallow, and as such, the previous touch and flair that Dante is known for ( Balls, bravery, awesomeness, cool dude) and Vergil's nature ( Loyalty, skill, distaste for firearms, etc) have neen washed away and in their place, are shallow, under-developed and uninspiring characters for whom no fan of devil may Cry series can connect to easily. The fabled Sparda, and his legend is gone. So if you're looking to reconnect to the awesomeness that Devil may Cry used to be, this is not it. It may feel a bit insulting to the series' die-hard fans.\n\nGameplay: Acceotable. Fluid mechanics,  and the camera can get glitchy at times. For the love of all thats' awesome, why did they leave out Lock On to targets out of a hack and slash game? This makes combat cumbersome, especially in Boss Fights (Mundus, anyone? ). The game also has a short learning curve, and as such, new players to the series will be at ease hacking and slashing demons at the comfort of their seats.\n\nGraphics: Pretty average. Nothing spectacular. Runs in DirectX9, powered by the Unreal Engine 3. If you're on catalyst (Running an AMD/ATI GPU/APU), ensure you're using the latest driver. The game is known for being glitchy with old versions of AMD Catalyst, and micro-stutter is  relatively common in CrossFire-based systems. Your mileage may vary.\n\nThe music is great,m if you're into industrial metal. Noisia and CombiChrist worked up quite the charm here, so you'll be in for a blast if its' your kind of thing.\n\nOverall rating: 88% in my personal opinion. Despite its shortcomings, this is a great game with excellent gameplay and many hours of fun, especially when you throw in the Vergil's Downfall DLC and the other mode similar to Devil may Cry's 4 Bloody Palace. Again, your mileage may vary. This is a personal opinion and as such, is subject to personal bias.\n\nPlay the game, and be the judge.","September 19, 2014","true","32.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was sceptical about this game at first, but it's really great. It offers adrenaline pumped soundtrack, crazy level design, and hundreds of possible combos. The combat system is better and more complex than combat system with Nero in DMC4, although probably not as complex as combat with Dante in DMC4. I recommend playing it with a Xbox360 controller, but it's also relatively fine playable with keyboard and mouse. The PC port is very well done and well optimized, without any annoying DRM.

Theres interesting combos that you unlock and different weapons you hold a key to use, similar to God of War, but less inconvieniant. It doesn't just throw health at you either which keeps it from being too easy.\n\nThe levels are good to explore, really nicely designed. The collectables in the environment attract you to them in a really unique way, and fit perfectly with the art style.\n\nThe platforming sections aren't exactly challenging but they're entertaining enough. The fast paced sections really keep the action flowing so long as you know what you're doing. I find alot of games never quite get a good balance, though this one is leaning towards the easy side.\n\nThe art style suits the game and the cinematography complements it brilliantly. The music (which is actually the reason I bought the game) also matches really well and makes the experiance a whole lot more fun. The animations flow really well with both the environment and enemies. Final kill shots, using your last attack on the last enemy, always seem to look great. The characters (which I thought were terrible at first) each quickly show they aren't ♥♥♥♥. Even with the cool guy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the start and that occasionally surfaces, Dante's a pretty cool guy that doesn't afraid of anything. Oh and the facial models and animations are pretty flawless I'd say, not quite HL2 but better than any AssCreed.\n\nI am so pleasantly suprised with this game, fun as ♥♥♥♥/10.","January 3","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/recommended/220440/","zombkraken","THE KRAKEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/","453 products in account","I had heard of this franchise over the years, but I hadn’t ever played it myself before. DmC – Devil May Cry is an action adventure platformer from Ninja Theory and Capcom. Let’s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe first thing that really struck me about DmC was how good the graphics looked. I was playing on lower graphical settings (for the sake of performance) and the game still looked better than a good handful of games that are brand new. They were seriously well done.\n\nAfter gawking at the graphics, I next came to the actual animations. Everything is incredibly fluid: combat, walking, jumping, everything. Even if you’re the laziest, most pathetic mortal on the face of the planet, you can’t help but to feel badass while you’re playing this game. That is just how good the animations make everything look.\n\nThe next thing that I came to that just impressed the hell right out of me, was the upgrade system. While you are in the store upgrading your abilities or your weapons, I discovered the best upgrade system I had ever seen in a game like this. First of all there is an option for you to try out the upgrade before you commit points to it. That’s right. The game let’s you try out the ability or upgrade before you buy it. Secondly, once you’ve purchased the ability/upgrade, if you end up finding out that you don’t like it or you don’t ever use it you can take the points out (free of charge) and immediately put them into something else. Every game should have this.\n\nThe music is pretty good. I recall seeing Combichrist being mentioned in the credits and another band, but I can’t remember who. That being said, Combichrist was an excellent choice for this game as their contributions to the soundtrack really went well with all the action.\n\nEnemy design was pretty cool. Normally, when I think about demons, I’m thinking about big, fleshy, horned monsters that run amok and torment everyone in their path. This was not even close to the case in DmC however. Demons (while some do have fleshy bits) are mostly made from what looks like metal, ceramics, and bone. It was a very interesting take on demonic entities (and, albeit, a refreshing one).\n\nBoss design (with the exception of Mundus) was also really cool. Let’s just say that the Succubus is not going to look like your expectations in the slightest.\n\nThe Bad\n\nDmC started out with a great story. There were great cutscenes, dialogue, a giant Hunter Demon with a ridiculously cool voice. However, as the game went on, the quality of the dialogue and the story went steadily downhill. By the end of the game things had become so predictable that I felt like I was watching some edgy 90’s teen movie.\n\nThe Meh\n\nThe game is pretty short. I blazed through it in right around seven hours.\n\nThere is a marked lack of gore in most of the game. I suppose this makes sense as (I mentioned above) most of the demons you fight are made from materials other than flesh and blood.\n\nVerdict: Yea\n\nDmC is a great game and a great addition to any collection. If you’re a fan of the franchise, you’ll no doubt love it. If you’re new to the franchise, I’m pretty sure that you’ll love it all the same. It has a bit of a steep price tag (especially for how short it is), but, if it went on sale, I’d most certainly snag a copy. As always, thanks for reading.","November 13, 2015","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With that said, DmC: Devil May Cry is a pretty great game with enjoyable gameplay and a surprisingly good story.\n\nTHE PROS:\nSurpisingly good story that has a mix of seriousness and jokes.\nFun gameplay that has a "Stylish" system -- you earn more points by doing combos that uses a variety of different attacks, and not just the same moves over and over again.\nAs the story progresses, you see Dante go from "not caring" about anything to actually caring about everything.\nGreat level design full of secrets.\nYou unlock new weapons/abilties as you progress.\nWeapons and abilities can be upgraded with skill points -- or even new abilities can be unlocked with skill points.\nBeating the game on higher difficulties will unlock even higher diffculties multiple times, encouraging multiple play-throughs.\nSome cool unlockable skins.\nPractice mode.\nAround 10 hours until you beat the game.\n\nTHE MIXED:\nSome may find the game kinda repetitive.\nSome may also find the game too "try hard" and/or cheesy for their taste.\nAnd of course, some may not like Dante's new design (however, I am personally fine with it).\n\nTHE CONS:\nI personally found the final boss fight and ending to be kinda dissapointing.\nSome fights are more annoying/tedious than fun.\n\nTHE VERDICT:  8.5/10 "Between Great and Amazing"\nDmC: Devil May Cry really is a great game, and I do recommend it. If you get the game, play it on the Nephilim (hard) diffculty, as it will provide a more challenging and rewarding gameplay experience than the other starting difficulties.","November 13, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crimsomniac/recommended/220440/","crimsomniac","Crimsomniac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crimsomniac/","129 products in account","Definitely one of the coolest games I've ever played. I can see many people ♥♥♥♥♥ing about betrayal of the original series... But I think it is a step for the better. I've played through DMC IV before and only thing I found better there was much more complex Dante's gunplay. But apart from that, I've found this game to be better in every conceivable way:\n\nSTORY:\n\nAlthough Dante's attitude in DMC IV and I suppose the previous games was no doubt cool, I found it a little bit too much\nanime-y and cliché. In this prequel, Dante is younger, confident, straight-forward, care-free rebel, as lovable as the older himself and much more relatable, mostly because player is able to discover Dante as he discovers himself in the story. The story itself holds together beautifully despite being heavily varied, and story elements like demons, angels and Limbo not only make sense, but they add insane cool factor. Everything in the story works in favor of bringing you the best possible feeling, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is rare.\nCharacter-wise, the cast is not by any means extensive. Besides Dante, his brother Vergil, Vergil's protegeé Kat and four or five antagonists you will sooner or later face as bosses, there is only Phineas, a pacifist blind demon with mechanical eye trapped in Limbo that will help Dante along the way. Other than those are just mindless demons to kill. But don't worry, those few are able to carry to story without any struggle.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThe core of the gameplay is of course the exquisite complex combat system. It is easy to handle, yet tricky to master. There are few basic actions that player controls, and then there are variables, such as timing, chaining combos, which angel or demon weapon is player currently using, which firearm... Player with enough skill can use this system to great depth. It may seem as too much at first, but as you get more and more acquainted with the system, the more sense it makes. You start developing different strategies for different enemies, and most importantly, you'll develop your own style of gameplay. The tools this game offers you can bring a great variety of approaches to defeating your enemies. Having said that, I must also mention that this applies mostly for the meelee weapons, since I felt that firearms were of little significance and power, and besides specific cases, I had no need to use them at all.\nAnother part of gameplay is platforming. Dante's controls are quite fluent and easy, so if there is any difficulty to platforming, i lies in design, not in controls. The platforming also benefits a great deal from tools such as Angel Lift and Demon Whip, which not only add variety, but also a new dynamic and occasionaly even logic elements, not to mention their use in combat.\nWhen the combat and platforming clash together, a boss fight is born. Boss fights in DMC are a true testament to the gameplay mechanics. Not only are you forced to use a great variety of your skills to even survive them, but you also have to look for bosses' weak spots, come up with specific strategies and really put yourself into the fight.\nDmC also relies heavily upon exploration and replayability. Although there is no open world and the way to reach the progression of the story is never more than one, the game offers many side tracks leading to items or challenges. You can also revisit all the locations after you acquire a new set of skills, and try to reach prizes that you were not able to before. A great deal of replayability lies it the many levels of difficulty you can replay the game on and test your skills.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nDmC is one of the most beautiful games I, as a graphic designer by trade, ever played. It doesn't rely upon revolutionary, cutting-edge technology (Although its technological level is quite high as well), but rather on style. Majority of actual gameplay happens after Dante is pulled into Limbo, a twisted version of whatever setting he was currently in, where he can utilise all of his nephilim powers. And it is the idea Limbo that allowed the artists and developers of the game bring in the real twisted beauty DmC has to offer. Be it the city rotting under the rule of demons, night club reality changing to the beat of the music or old mansion where Dante and Vergil spent their early childhood, a great amount of detail and thought can be seen anywhere. And not only that, your surroundings can change at any given moment in the story, bringing you a new, breathtaking sight or often fast-paced platforming challenge.\nDesign of characters and enemies is equally thought out and accordingly twisted. Artists were able to avoid too much cliché in design, yet were able to preserve the feeling any given enemy or boss should emmit. If the Succubus is supposed to be disgusting, be well damn sure it looks disgusting as hell!\n\nSOUND:\n\nThe general coolness of the game of course wouldn't be complete without equally cool soundtrack, and it was delivered. Music selected fits the vibe of the game and really helps to increase the immersion. I have nothing more to say about that. Great work on the music.\n\nIn conclusion I'd say that DmC is truly a great game. It bring all its elements to nearly perfection. It is unapologetic, cool and action-packed, yet refined and masterfully executed. There are many fans of the original series that are hating the changes, but that is just how some fans are, narrow-minded and blindfolded by the things they love. There is no point in arguing, so don't waste time and rather go play one of the best games of 2013, DmC: Devil May Cry.\n\n9/10\n\nTIPS:\n\nLearn how to use your weapons. Each of them is good for something else. Rebellion is universal, Osiris is great against groups of enemies and also for juggling them in the air, where most of them are helpless, Aquila is weaker than Osiris, but is great at crowd control, since it allows you to pull a number of enemies to you, stagger many enemies in one attack, trap them for a while and even transform dante into tornado of hits that carries enemies along. On the other hand, demon weapons are more fit for fighting single, strong enemies, since they shatter shields and knock back smaller ememies. Arbiter has heavy strikes, that can leave Dante exposed for quick attack if timed incorectly, but are devastating when they land. Also, Arbiter has some pretty powerful long distance attacks. Eryx is more complex than Arbiter, since timing is everything with it. It can be quicker than Arbiter, but at the same time weaker. The catch is that every attack is chargeable and has three levels of power, last one being among the most powerful moves you can perform in the game. It has also some area-of-effect moves that damage all the enemies about. The key to quick and cool destruction of your enemies is not only learning their weaknesses, but also forming combos with different weapons in quick succession. Every weapons has a moment after first two basic attacks, when if you wait until the weapons shines a little and then proceed with another basic attack, another combo starts that is more powerfull, more specific or has a different effect. The great thing about this that you can use to your advantage is that in the moment of waiting to start this different combo you can switch weapons and do the special combo of another weapon. For instance, you can do two quick slashes with Rebellion or Osiris and the swich to Arbiter's special combo, Trinity Smash, which does thrice the damage as Arbiter's usual last attack, and you can achieve this devastation in much shorter time that using the two slow initial attacks of Arbiter.\nI also have to recommend downloading the Bloody Palace addon. It's free, it's easy way to learn how to use weapons and fight enemies, also to earn orbs, and, most importantly, it's fun, especially if you are in mood for some DmC action right away.\n\n\n","March 18, 2014","true","48.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With that said, DmC: Devil May Cry is a pretty great game with enjoyable gameplay and a surprisingly good story.\n\nTHE PROS:\nSurpisingly good story that has a mix of seriousness and jokes.\nFun gameplay that has a "Stylish" system -- you earn more points by doing combos that uses a variety of different attacks, and not just the same moves over and over again.\nAs the story progresses, you see Dante go from "not caring" about anything to actually caring about everything.\nGreat level design full of secrets.\nYou unlock new weapons/abilties as you progress.\nWeapons and abilities can be upgraded with skill points -- or even new abilities can be unlocked with skill points.\nBeating the game on higher difficulties will unlock even higher diffculties multiple times, encouraging multiple play-throughs.\nSome cool unlockable skins.\nPractice mode.\nAround 10 hours until you beat the game.\n\nTHE MIXED:\nSome may find the game kinda repetitive.\nSome may also find the game too "try hard" and/or cheesy for their taste.\nAnd of course, some may not like Dante's new design (however, I am personally fine with it).\n\nTHE CONS:\nI personally found the final boss fight and ending to be kinda dissapointing.\nSome fights are more annoying/tedious than fun.\n\nTHE VERDICT:  8.5/10 "Between Great and Amazing"\nDmC: Devil May Cry really is a great game, and I do recommend it. If you get the game, play it on the Nephilim (hard) diffculty, as it will provide a more challenging and rewarding gameplay experience than the other starting difficulties.","November 13, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ninja Theory has taken some creative liberty with Dante's character, but this isn't really the same Dante when you think about it. This is a reboot not a sequel.\n\nThe best way to look at this new DmC is think of it as a separate entirely new Dante set in an alternative, much like the new Superman ('Man of Steel'). They are different people with different origins and different motivations/  If you can think of the new Dante and old Dante in this way, as being 2 completely separate people then the character changes are significantly less bothersome.\n\nCharacter issues aside Ninja Theory did a marvelous job with the game play.  The game play retains the fast and furious action of the previous games. One thing I really enjoyed is the battles areas fell much more open and larger than in previous titles allowing you to more clearly see everything that is going on. The plethora of weapons and changes on the fly are also well implemented and allow for a variety of successive combos.  One of my favorite features is the ability to try the skill before you upgrade it, as well as the ability to switch between skill load-outs between levels.\n\nOverall DmC is a vastly underrated game for a variety of reason, but if you can come into the game with an open mind and think of it as just a brand new hack and slash that happens to share the same name, then you will be in for a real satisfying experience!","February 15, 2014","true","20.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I beat it with a keyboard and felt like I was fighting the game a bit.  Mechanics are easy to pick up.  There's plenty of moves to master, but most are not required to finish the game.  The game is a bit linear, but it's hardly a surpsise.  When you play this type of game, it's expected and doesn't really take away from the games focus...action.\n\nAudio and visuals are top notch.

Theres interesting combos that you unlock and different weapons you hold a key to use, similar to God of War, but less inconvieniant. It doesn't just throw health at you either which keeps it from being too easy.\n\nThe levels are good to explore, really nicely designed. The collectables in the environment attract you to them in a really unique way, and fit perfectly with the art style.\n\nThe platforming sections aren't exactly challenging but they're entertaining enough. The fast paced sections really keep the action flowing so long as you know what you're doing. I find alot of games never quite get a good balance, though this one is leaning towards the easy side.\n\nThe art style suits the game and the cinematography complements it brilliantly. The music (which is actually the reason I bought the game) also matches really well and makes the experiance a whole lot more fun. The animations flow really well with both the environment and enemies. Final kill shots, using your last attack on the last enemy, always seem to look great.

Theres interesting combos that you unlock and different weapons you hold a key to use, similar to God of War, but less inconvieniant. It doesn't just throw health at you either which keeps it from being too easy.\n\nThe levels are good to explore, really nicely designed. The collectables in the environment attract you to them in a really unique way, and fit perfectly with the art style.\n\nThe platforming sections aren't exactly challenging but they're entertaining enough. The fast paced sections really keep the action flowing so long as you know what you're doing. I find alot of games never quite get a good balance, though this one is leaning towards the easy side.\n\nThe art style suits the game and the cinematography complements it brilliantly. The music (which is actually the reason I bought the game) also matches really well and makes the experiance a whole lot more fun. The animations flow really well with both the environment and enemies. Final kill shots, using your last attack on the last enemy, always seem to look great. The characters (which I thought were terrible at first) each quickly show they aren't ♥♥♥♥. Even with the cool guy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the start and that occasionally surfaces, Dante's a pretty cool guy that doesn't afraid of anything.

All this and it runs smooth like butter on my modest PC.\n\nStory/Plot: Mostly meh, only some bright moments like Raptor New Network. The Vergil thing at the end was random and illogical.\n\nMechanics: Very solid mechanics and combos. You can switch between weapon types seamlessly and execute a huge variety of combos and setups. Movement has real weight and there are animation transitions between abilities. Attacks are meaty and controls are responsive.

Good replayability, once you're done with the story you just want to start from scratch and keep slaying demons, while collecting all of Dante's moves and powerups. The game runs with good graphics without fps issues even during the most violent battles. The combat system is very dynamic and enables for many combos and more moves can be unlocked while progressing in the game. By quickly changing Dante's weapons (and therefore combat style and moves) one can concatenate long and various combos. Wven though a bit too predictable the story is interesting enough, and Dante's  attitude sure helps. The scenery is always gorgeous: you can never be sure about what's going to happen once you're  dragged into the Limbo, except it's going to be exaggerated and fun. And what to say about the music... well... just perfect to go along with the quick and vicious fights offered. To concude, a must for any lover of  the genre.","May 23","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So far, the silky smooth 60 fps and high resolution are enhancing the experience even further.\n\nAn excellent, genuinely underrated game. While I don't like this incarnation of Dante as much due to his lack of clever dialogue (opting for more of an in-your-face, "♥♥♥♥ you" type speech than 1-4's more snide and humorous banter) I think pretty much every aspect is equal to or better than the main series.\n\nThe art style is an absolute pleasure to look at, with carefully chosen colors and architecture. Limbo is a very unique setting and feels very oppressive, which is what they were going for.\n\nThe music is very high on my list of best ost's, though it's definitely not for everyone. It is a mixture of Combichrist's aggrotech/death metal and Noisia's bass-heavy electronic music (Dunno exactly what genre, but it ranges from Drum 'n' Bass to Dubstep). A testament to the ost's quality (and to the quality of the musicians composing it) is that I actually am not a fan of the genres in general. All in all, it feels very appropriate to the gameplay and pumps you up as you lay down some sick combos.\n\nWhich brings me to the gameplay. Some criticize it for being less "free" than the originals, and I see where they're coming from. DMC4 in particular has quite a lot of stylish freedom in what you can do, and you can perform a buttload of crazy combos with cancelling and tech and all that. However, the grappling system and the ease of switching weapons in the heat of battle make it a very smooth and skill-intensive experience. The multiple melee weapons allow you to tailor your approach to battle on the fly, using a scythe or shurikens to take out a mob of easy enemies, an axe or knuckles to deal some heavy damage to high profile targets, or your trusty sword which is good in any situation. But the thing that makes combat so ♥♥♥♥ing fun is the aformentioned grappling hook. Depending on whether you have angel or devil weapons equipped (by holding the left and right trigger, respectively) you can either pull yourself toward the enemy or pull him to you. This opens up all sorts of "CUHRAYZEE" juggling shenanigans.\n\nAnd the bosses. Oh, the bosses! While they are somewhat easy, they are extremely fun encounters with unique mechanics. I don't want to spoil anything, but they're some of the highlights of the game.\n\nAnd so, I wholeheartedly reccomend this game. If you like hack 'n' slash games, this is one you should definitely try out!\n\n9.5 out of 10. If the dialogue were a little bit more reminiscent of the originals, I'd give it a 10. Too bad the fanboys killed a chance of a sequel.","May 20","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The core components of what made the Devil May Cry series revolutionise action-games is here in the new DMC; just a diffrent coat of paint because Ninja Theory was asked by Capcom to set it up that way.  In many instances movement and attacks are more fluid and fit roles better.  No more having too many weapons that you may not use half of them (my friends and I had that problem with lucifer from DMC4).  Ninja Theory did a good job with the combat, story, and mood.  Truth is they improved quite a bit.  Yes it is (slightly) diffrent than what it was before, but I'm a fan of the old DMC and I really like this one as well.  Personally I would like to see more out of both timelines.\n\nDont worry about the limited movesets and protagonist being a jerk at the begining.  Soon Dante finds something to fight for and has an impressive array of weapons and moves to go with it.  Some of the dialog made me cringe, but the old DMC made me do that too.\n\nYES the game is easier (someomes much easier) than the previous DMC series.  Keep in mind that DMC3 in perticular had a reputation for being extreamly unforgiving.\n\n...also the ending was kind of a WTF moment that needs some type of DLC or follow up to explain itself, but I'm not sure when that will happen.","August 10, 2013","true","62.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Dante was a grating ♥♥♥♥♥♥ from 1 to 4, so I don't miss that. He is more bearable here, but is the same cocky ♥♥♥♥.\n\nBefore this one all DMC games suffer from something that we couldn't stand this gen when God of War kicked this game out of the hackn'slash action games throne: repetition and reciclation of the content. Look, I can stand reusing the enemies, but the bosses 3 times? the maps 3 times? padded backtracking that kills any sense of momentum, progress and discovery?\n\nThis game does nothing of that and also burst with style and detail. The story is pretty good, doesn't take itself seriously.\nThe combat is honestly, easier. Just go play it in the highest difficulty you can if you're old school fan, it still can put up a reasonable challenge, if you don't miss pressing 3 buttons at the same time for actually just dodgin (thank god they removed that). Combo system works great, feels very empowering.\n\nSo, with all things cleared, this game is better than those idiots that say "I want old dante back" complain about.

Fantastic art direction, locations, and music.  Some of the zones (I don't want to give spoilers) were such a pleasant surprise for their design.

Logically placed checkpoints allow for quick drop and pickup play when I need to stop or start (I have kids, so this can make or break a game).\n\nIt is actually hard for me to think of anything I would really want them to do differently ... pausable cutscenes?

Let me start by saying that I'm a newbie for Hack n Slash games and the Devil May Cry franchise, so my review might end being highly subjective. 'Cause being an ignoramus on hack and slash games, it's a challenge to write a good and an objective review. But overall, this was just an awesome game, I enjoyed it very much, and I would reccomend it to someone who's completely new to the genre.\n\nFor me, the controls were a bit complex and it may have taken hours for me to get the hang of playing the game right.\nBut in the end, I think the controls were well designed and so were the combos that were difficult to execute at times because I'm an impatient person. The upgrade system didn't add much to the game for me, except for some essential combos and a few damage boosts. I think I wasn't looking enough for the variety the game would have offered. Probably because it was already complex enough and I kept on forgetting most of the combos constantly. So I played the game in a quite basic way, in the normal difficulty setting. Wasn't that hard, but a few bosses proved a satisfying challenge.\n\nThe atmosphere the game created was AMAZING. The game jumped immediately to a dark and intriguing cinematic experience. And after the first cutscene the action started right away, and with awesome music composed by Combichrist that just fit perfectly. The dialogues were cheesy and edgy on purpose but with some dark humor to lighten it up a bit. And one more thing I wanted to add about the music design is how well the transitions between running around, entering combat and finishing combat was made. The immersion never broke down.\nThe characters might have been a bit "one dimensional", except for Kat who you'll meet when you play the game :).\nThe story was mediocre, but the atmosphere revolving around the story and the setting made it feel better than it was.\nI also liked the wide variety of enemy castes, and I saw how essential it was for the variety of combat itself. I bet half of the development time of this game went for the designing of these enemies.\nThe game had its usual average length of 9 hours but they tried to add some replayability by adding gameplay modes that remix the combat scenes and difficulty, which can be unlocked after completing the game.\n\nPros:\n+Awesome music.\n+Good bosses and gameplay overall.\n+Immersion never broke down.\n\nCons:\n-One dimensional story and characters.\n\nTL;DR:\n"being an ignoramus on hack and slash games, it's a challenge to write a good and an objective review. But overall, this was just an awesome game, I enjoyed it very much, and I would reccomend it to anyone who's completely new to the genre."\n\nEDIT: For much easier and smoother gameplay, use a gamepad! In my case, an Xbox 360 controller.","July 19, 2015","true","10.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I have played the whole Devil May Cry series, and this game is an exceptional entry into the series. It does away with having to pick your weapon/gun load-out before each mission. All unlocked weapons are usable in combat.  Also, the Styles (Swordmaster, Gunslinger, etc.) have been phased out. All the styles have now been incorporated into the new Dante's combat system. Instead of Royal Guard, they added a demon dodge ability, which rewards you  with increased damage and style points for dodging enemy attacks at the exact moment. You also now have a standard weapon, hell weapon, and a heaven weapon. The hell weapon is for straight up damage, while the heaven arms specialize in crowd control. Also, some enemies can only be damaged by their respective colored weapons (red=hell, blue=heaven). That can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ because it gets in the way of fluid combat, but it keeps things interesting.\n\nNinja Theory has presented a great take on the DMC storyline. The game itself is beautiful. Environments are colorful and diverse. Dialogue is a huge step up from previous games. All cutscenes and voices are very well done. The new Dante is great. I never once felt like I hated his character. He comes complete with smart remarks and attitude.\n\nIt takes about 10 hours to complete the game on your first playthrough. I went on to replay it 2 more times to get all the collectibles and beat the Nephilim difficulty. There are 4 more difficulties above that if you feel up to it. Dante and his weapons have unlockable skins (the weapons only have skins if you preordered from gamestop or something).

That can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ because it gets in the way of fluid combat, but it keeps things interesting.\n\nNinja Theory has presented a great take on the DMC storyline. The game itself is beautiful. Environments are colorful and diverse. Dialogue is a huge step up from previous games. All cutscenes and voices are very well done. The new Dante is great. I never once felt like I hated his character. He comes complete with smart remarks and attitude.\n\nIt takes about 10 hours to complete the game on your first playthrough. I went on to replay it 2 more times to get all the collectibles and beat the Nephilim difficulty. There are 4 more difficulties above that if you feel up to it. Dante and his weapons have unlockable skins (the weapons only have skins if you preordered from gamestop or something). There is upcoming dlc for a challenge mode and for an extension to the story with Vergil as a playable character.  Steam achieves are a plus!","February 9, 2013","true","33.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Downright sexy graphics and not too taxing on the hardware makes it a subtle experience even on low end PCs. Topped with brilliant fighting style and plethora of combos to try out, this new breed of game is sure fun to play.\n\nThe mix of level and bosses can be daunting at times but once you get the basics right its just another level, heck some normal enemy (read Dreamrunner) feels more more taxing than certain boss(es). Things gets interesting when you crank the difficulty at SOS (Sun of Sparda) though.\n\nOverall DMC is a must have game if you like slashing, hacking your way through. Unique blend of story, emotions and fighting makes its a great game to play. A must have third person fighting game.","July 25, 2013","true","24.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","3"

Story was a bit iffy but funny none the less, Dante still has his "Shut up and let's fight already." attitude still. I didn't really like the fact that a lot of the weapons from the previous DMC's were becoming short-handed. You only really get 2 Angel/Demon Weapon's and 2 Guns through the entire game and Rebellion it'self. You can also get a "SSS" rating combat rating fairly easy as long as you group up a bunch of enemies and AoE's. Had gotten "SSS" on all mission on Hell and Hell mode on Vergil's Downfall DLC which was fairly short, only 6 missions to where Vergil goes mad for more power. But even with all this, the story was like a mix of DMC 1 &3 combined. Bunch of action and gore as usual and Dante's witty comments had me still going and interested. Oh and if your thinking the guns are useless because of the trailer, your highly mistaken. The guns in the game will cause a fairly decent amount of damage and can be implemented in numerous combo's if done correctly. They are also your best friends on Heaven or Hell Mode.","January 3, 2014","true","70.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You wield different kinds of melee and ranged weapons, that you can combo very effectively. Basically after executing attacks on enemy, you get different kind of score depending on how fluid your attacks and defense was.\n\nScore will award you with points you can spend on leveling your skills and abilities to unlock even more moves, combos and increase the power of already learned moves. Throughout the game you will unlock many melee and ranged weapons that are useful not just for bashing skulls, but also to get into secret places, defeat special enemies, etc.\n\nNot going to spoil the story, basically it follows very young Dante who is uncovering his past and learning more about who he really is. Dante is same "old" yet younger self, still arrogant and hot headed like always. I found that for me, story in this game was much more enjoyable than in 4th DmC.\n\nGame uses good, old Unreal Engine, yet for such recent release it looks somewhat outdated graphically. Non the less game looks good, with uniquely crazy DmC environments, a lot of low resolution textures, good motion capture and facial animation, great voice acting and challenging combat. Not much of eye candy in this one, than in DmC 4, but still great spectacle fighter with awesome yet evil story. Though who am I kidding, it's supposed to be evil.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/220440/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","DmC Devil May Cry is a reboot of the popular game series which eventually had an anime based off of it. I thought it was the other way around since I watched a couple episodes of the anime a few years ago.  It’s a good thing that the game is a reboot since I probably never would have bought the game if it was #5 in a series. (I’ve never played the old Tomb Raider games either and I loved Tomb Raider 2013). It’s my understanding that the previous Devil May Cry games were known for their high difficulty but fortunately for me, DmC Devil May Cry wasn’t too hard at all (at normal difficulty).\n\nThe game world is a little hard to explain since there are various “layers” to consider. There’s a Heaven and Hell which you never see (kind of like Darksiders). The whole story takes place in the “real world” and in Limbo, which is sort of a “twisted copy” of the real world infested with demons. All the game’s combat takes place in Limbo. Powerful demons attempting to attack you will pull you into Limbo for the fight, and you can also go in through magical rituals (only happens as part of the story). You play the part of Dante, a loner with mysterious combat abilities and powerful weapons, working to take down the demon king Mundus. Mundus has sort of taken over the city (possibly the whole world) through various evil ways and the humans don’t even realize there are demons among them. Dante teams up with his long lost brother Vergil and begins killing Mundus’ allies one by one in awesome boss battles.\n\nDmC is a hack and slash game with anime physics. This means for example that you can knock around a bunch of enemies with a single swing of your sword or launch them into the air and follow them upwards with a 20 hit combo. Like the game Darksiders, you unlock various “moves” by buying them with orbs that dead enemies drop. There’s a lot of platforming involved in the game as well, where you need to get from one area to another by double jumping around and using your 2 grappling hooks (one to pull yourself to a target, and another to pull the target to you). Fortunately there aren’t many puzzles, though there are quite a few secret items to be found. The reason I said earlier that DmC wasn’t too hard is because if you don’t care about your score, you can just keep “continuing from checkpoint” until you win. I believe your score will get chopped in half for every time you die. The same goes for using purchased healing items in the game, your score goes down. The game is broken up into missions, and you get a score at the end of each mission based on your time, secrets found, style (combos), and whether or not you used items/died. Keyboard and mouse controls are very intuitive and worked well for me, but I expect people who are used to controllers would enjoy that more.\n\nPros:\n+Feel like a badass smacking a room full of demons around with combos and magic weapons.\n+Very nice graphics including huge demonic bosses. I’m a fan of Angel vs Demon artwork too.\n+You can beat the game pretty easily if you don’t care about your score.\n+A lot of humor in this game. Dante doesn’t take ♥♥♥♥ from anyone and you get in some insult matches.\n\nCons:\n-The game is still rather pricy despite being close to 2 years old. I think $12.50 is the lowest historical price.\n-There are maybe 1 or 2 times in the game where you might get lost in a large level. The platforming is three dimensional so there are a lot of places to go. The game doesn’t have a waypoint system or map so it’s possible to get turned around. The levels are mostly straightforward though.\n-That’s about it actually, the game is very polished despite being a console port.\n\nOverall DmC Devil May Cry is definitely recommended. If you enjoy hack / slash games like Darksiders, you will appreciate the flow of combat in DmC. You don’t have to worry about missing collectables in the game since you don’t necessarily need the upgrades. The story is told through gameplay and cutscenes, and more or less makes sense to people who haven’t seen the anime or played the previous games. Wait for the price to drop, then buy the game!\n","September 8, 2014","true","37.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Therefore, DmC astounded me with its intelligent combat system, engrossing story, hyper-stylish mood, vibrant visuals, and virtually flawless execution.\n\nDmC is just an incredibly well-made game. DmC is so compelling that I started a new playthrough immediately, which is the obvious intention of the developers what with four (four!) unlockable higher difficulties.\n\nAll cutscenes are skippable, although the acting is so good I find myself rewatching most the cutscenes. Death is very forgiving, and the pacing never bogs down. I didn’t encounter a single glitch, and the HD textures make for a crisp, elegant world. The sound design is superb as well.\n\nBasically DmC is a brilliant game that will last 20-30 hours if you desire to find all secrets and fully upgrade Dante. In my opinion Ninja Theory has taken DMC from niche-bizarro status to universal appeal through sheer quality of design. After 40 hours of play, I must conclude DmC is the greatest action game ever made.","December 28, 2013","true","47.9"," 32 of 63 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","32","63","0","2"

But as far as Ninja Theory`s, DMC is concerned I must say it was absolutely awesome the entire way through. I am definitely not normally into the fighting genre of video games, but I must say the story and world this game twisted and turned you through was action packed, and had me so hooked I actually had to go look up the plots from the original DMC`s.\n\nAs far as the combat goes the battles are beautifully fluid and almost make you feel like you`re in a movie, perfectly stringing together maneuvers. Throughout the entire game you encounter new Demons to go up against leaving you never bored. In addition, pretty much till the last few missions you will be constantly unlocking new weapons, whether it be ranged or melee. Also earning upgrades is satisfying, allowing you to unlock new abilities and moves with your weapons.  As well as increasing maximum health.  Even with all that the gameplay has more to offer; I would most definitely consider this game a platformer with the amount of climbing, jumping, and swinging that occurs.\n\nWhere this game shines in my opinion is it`s one of a kind world and story. Most combat will happen once you have been dragged into “Limbo,” a city controlled entirely by Demons. The artwork in this game, (especially in Limbo) is stunning and refreshing, often having vibrant colors and offering a unique look. The demons also look like serious creatures, but still leaving enough room for the game`s dark comedic tendencies. The plot I suppose is more personal opinion but I simply couldn’t get enough! The thought of exploring the afterlife and the backstory of Dante was really cool, and the three protagonists (Dante, Kat, and Virgil) all have their reasons for what make them to me, strong characters. In particular, Dante.  Plus the thought that the world we inhabit could have far more going on than meets the eye. The voice acting in this game is nothing but the best, every moment there was dialogue I always found myself drawn.\n\nOverall this game is a must purchase, the world is one of a kind and the plot and characters were extremely engaging. DMC is on Steam right now for only $24.99, which is a steal! Just to back up my recommendation Metacritic gave this game an 85/100, IGN rated it an 8.5 also stating “This is exactly what the Devil May Cry franchise needed,” and Destructoid rated it an 9/10.\n\nThese are the reasons why I give Devil May Cry a very strong recommendation!\n(And mission 20 is badass.)","December 28, 2013","true","8.5"," 54 of 107 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","54","107","0","0"

Players will make their way through a series of levels that are split between Limbo and Reality, while fighting demons and other monstrosities along the way. Fans of the series initially bashed the game for the new aesthetic stylings that have changed how Dante looks. But this is of little consequence seeing as how his attitude has also been tweaked. He may well come across as an angsty 20-something year old at first, but as the character grows he quickly becomes a solid Dante in his own right, with a strong moral code and personality. Combat is fast, strong and fluid, you can really feel the impact of the various weapons that you will be bringing to battle; be it sword, scythe or ranged weapons, they all pack enough punch to make the ranking combat system worth engaging in. Fans of the series will see some returning faces and ideals, and for those of you that purchase the DL, "Vergils Downfall" this game could be considered a prequel to Devil May Cry 3. DmC: Devil May Cry is actually a reboot, but some hardcore fans differ on this decision, thus aligning the timeline:\n\nDmC Devil May Cry\nDevil May Cry 3\nDevil May Cry 1\nDevil May Cry 4\nDevil May Cry 2\n\nBut putting that subject aside, this game is damn near perfect with great add on DLC including the free Bloody Palace Mode, definitely a game for fans of sword play. Just like my original review of the game, Dmc Devil May Cry would be scored 9/10.\nBut Steam doesn't score that way, so consider it recommended.","December 26, 2013","true","25.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

When I saw this new emo Dante at first I was totally refusing to even touch this game. Where is my beautiful white haired Dante, did Ninja Theory give in to the "hip"? Then again there was a sale on Steam, and I said what the hell I give in... I'm so grateful I did. This game is in my top 3 of this year. What I have to emphasize is the awesome control, I have not met any game where the control was so fine-tuned and fluent, the combat is incredibly enjoyable. The story is the usual, side-characters are a bit shallow, but the witty humor of Dante is there, which is the most important for me, and the brotherly energy with Vergil. The music is not exactly my type, but I got a bit of love for it during playing. Lastly, the visuals. This game looks gorgeous, the different levels' desing is interesting enough to make you want to proceed until you drop.  I highly recommend it, even to old-school DMC-fans.","January 5, 2014","true","35.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

The combat system is completely perfected, no real issues with the combat system apart from it's a bit awkward to fully get used to the angel/demon mode, but that is soon changed as you get used to the fighting system.

The music that Ninja Theory decided to implement is the best thing I've ever encountered - personally - because it has a variety of great industrial metal from Combichrist as well as their previous Electronic Industrial songs in some levels while also having some 'Dubstep-esque' music from Noisia; Noisia also provide the background music for most levels too, really good music is found in this game and it has helped to shape my music interests to this day!\n\nI personally, cannot get enough of this game: the combat system is so fluid and exciting - I smile whenever combat approaches (Just an expression of course), the music makes you feel adrenaline-pumped as it is fast paced and works to set the scene for the story behind Dante. Ninja Theory have never taken on something such as Dante's story and the gameplay expectations from the previous games, however, with the implementation of Red Orbs in this game, I have no doubts that they have perfected it and perhaps even created a new spectacle for DmC games in the future.","January 26, 2014","true","48.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

All of the mocking of the original games is a serious draw back to this game they are so blatant that even new people to the series won't miss them. enimies are repetitive color coding the enimies to specific wepons was a drag to the combat making you feel limited and controlled. Most bosses felt under powered and one main enimy encounterd later in the game was actually harder then some of the bosses. There is a fair bit of replayabilty.

Players will make their way through a series of levels that are split between Limbo and Reality, while fighting demons and other monstrosities along the way. Fans of the series initially bashed the game for the new aesthetic stylings that have changed how Dante looks. But this is of little consequence seeing as how his attitude has also been tweaked. He may well come across as an angsty 20-something year old at first, but as the character grows he quickly becomes a solid Dante in his own right, with a strong moral code and personality. Combat is fast, strong and fluid, you can really feel the impact of the various weapons that you will be bringing to battle; be it sword, scythe or ranged weapons, they all pack enough punch to make the ranking combat system worth engaging in. Fans of the series will see some returning faces and ideals, and for those of you that purchase the DL, "Vergils Downfall" this game could be considered a prequel to Devil May Cry 3. DmC: Devil May Cry is actually a reboot, but some hardcore fans differ on this decision, thus aligning the timeline:\n\nDmC Devil May Cry\nDevil May Cry 3\nDevil May Cry 1\nDevil May Cry 4\nDevil May Cry 2\n\nBut putting that subject aside, this game is damn near perfect with great add on DLC including the free Bloody Palace Mode, definitely a game for fans of sword play. Just like my original review of the game, Dmc Devil May Cry would be scored 9/10.\nBut Steam doesn't score that way, so consider it recommended.","December 26, 2013","true","25.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It has tongue-in-cheek humor and compelling characters. The story in DmC was original in its own right. Sure it was good Vs evil, save the world, save the girl. But it had elements only a devil may cry title could pull off. The game NOT ending in a romantic kiss was also a nice refreshing sight.\n\nLevel design and the music composed was just fantastic. I loved the night club mission. I could play it over and over, Lilith's domain was by far the best.\n\nDmC did not get all 10 stars because of the repetitive enemies. By mission 3 the enemies are already dull and boring, sure new ones are always introduced but even they are already carbon copies; once you find a way to exploit them, the fights become easy.Also the combat system is rather janky, sometimes Dante would move, dodge, or jump out of time or there would a delay. No game is without its bugs so I will not fault the developers on this. However it is something players will have to simply deal with as they play through the game.\n\nDespite the flaws, the game is over all worth playing whehter casually or hardcore and fully clearing each level. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys blood and anarchy.","October 21, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you go into this game with an open mind and are aware that is a reboot and a reimagining of the tale of Dante then you will be more than able to thoroughly enjoy yourself, However if you go into it expecting Devil May Cry 5 then you will be sadly disappointed.\n\nThe game still focuses on the stringing together fast paced, brutal combos in an action-oriented combat that system that were so prominent in the previous entries. And the game still offers the style ranking system based on how well you perform in combat. But while the game still focuses heavily on the two key components that made the franchise famous…It does make them incredibly more “accessible” to players who have never played any of the previous entries, which wouldn’t be a bad thing seeing as the game offers seven different difficulty levels, However only three are unlocked from the start of the game and all three are simple enough where you can easily breeze through and get “Savage” or better on most levels. So unless you truly want to get some form of challenge from the game you’ll have to do a few play-throughs of the game before you really find yourself struggling to chain together a good enough combo to actually feel proud of yourself when you hear the omnipresent announcer proclaim “Savage!”. The oversimplification isn’t all bad, the game does offer incredibly streamlined controls that allow for lengthy combos to be chained together while swapping through all 8 weapons and both grappling hooks on the fly without any obstructive interface or item swapping. The natural feel provided from the streamlined controls is easily one of the game’s greatest features.\n\nBesides the dumbed down difficulty and scoring system the game is also hindered by its generic level and enemy design. None of the design in the game feels new or fresh; it’s just a bunch of dark, glum, narrow corridors with hordes of the same bland enemies with some fairly enjoyable platforming elements sprinkled in between. Not only are the designs of both the enemies and levels bland, but the main characters themselves are also both predictable, and flat. This isn’t the bias hate rambling of a fan-boy who’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they changed Dante’s hair color, I’m honestly fine with the appearance of all the characters, even the new Emo Dante, but the game does offer plenty of alternative skins for those who are too turned off by the emo vibe.\n\nThe visuals of the game are another one of the games strong points, offering easily some of the best visual graphics to come out of a Capcom game to date. And the game is certainly a solid PC port, during my playthroughs of the game I managed to stay well over 100fps without any dips that could potentially interfere with the fast paced combo chaining combat.  The soundtrack of the game is honestly a hit or miss based on your view of how you feel about Electronic Body Music, as the soundtrack consists primarily of the band Combichrist, I personally enjoy it however to each their own.\n\nAfter hearing the review thus far you would probably expect me to poorly rate the game, but its actually quite the opposite. Despite all of the complaints and flaws that this game has, it somehow manages to get passed all of that and provide an experience that is genuinely fun. If you look at the game you can easily pick apart the design flaws and nerfed difficulty, but even with all the flaws, DMC Devil May Cry proves to be an excellent game with strong enough legs to stand on its own and not be judged based on the previous entries in the franchise….because that’s the whole point of a reboot, to break away from the past and become something new. So don’t let the look of the game turn you off, pick up a controller and play through the game on the hardest difficulty you can and experience the beauty of the fast paced, stylish, streamlined, chaotic fun that you will have.\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","January 19, 2015","true","11.9"," 24 of 48 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","24","48","2","0"

They hate the game no matter what, and their oinions can't be taken seriously.\n\nHow do you know if they're a biased fanboy? Telltale signs include called Dante 'Donte', and outright hatred and vitriol towards the games existance.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way and the baggage of a much loved franchise is put aside, is this game good or not? The answer is yes, it's a very good game, in fact it's one of the best action games I've ever played.\n\nDevil May Cry 1 was an instant classic, it was my first PS2 game and is still my favourite DMC game. I've played every game in the series, including the terrible sequel, and in my opinion DmC is easily the second best game in the series. Arguably it's the best.\n\nNote that many consider DMC3 to be the best, and that's perfectly agreeable, I ultimately prefer 1 because of the atmosphere, and Dante in DMC3 was a little too over the top, OK a LOT over the top.\n\nDmC has the best combat and platforming in the series, the most well told and interesting story (it fleshed out the characters in a way that the entire tetralogy never did), and it also has one of the most striking and interesting visual designs I've seen in a AAA game.\n\nUltimately this game is pure fun, as with most straight up action games, you know what you're getting - linear level design, fast and furious combat, in your face characters and a rocking soundtrack.\n\nI've played all major franchises in this genre - DMC, God of War, Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden; DmC is easily the best of the genre available on PC.\n\nThe goal of these games is to make you feel like an all-powerful badass, and have fun while you do it, DmC delivers.\n\nGet it, have fun, kick ♥♥♥ - win.\n\nP.S.\n\nMake sure to get Vergil's Downfall, truly a great little piece of DLC that completes a fan favourite character's arc to the dark side.","November 10, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/assassinglasgow/recommended/220440/","assassinglasgow","AssassinGlasgow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/assassinglasgow/","344 products in account","While I am choosing to not recommend this game, I'd rather this review be seen as a "Meh" or "Average." DmC hits many things really well, and then falls flat on its face in others. I would like to preface by saying that I haven't played the original DMC games, but I have played Hideki Kamiya's Bayonetta, so my comparison will be based a bit around that.\n\nBy now, it should be well known that this reboot's Dante is a black haired, foul mouthed early twenty-or-something troublemaker. While a big problem is how he compares to the original Dante, for this review I'll mostly be looking at the reboot as its own series separate from Kamiya's. So how does this Dante hold up as his own character? He's not necessarily a bad character. He displays growth, and becomes less bull headed and more concerned for others such as Kat. Some of his lines and actions are actually really good too, with his attitude being a perfect contrast for some of the serious guys there such as Vergil (in one particular scene, he answers Vergil with a shrug and "So what?" when Vergil brings up the idea of freeing the citizens). Dante exemplifies the punk movement, which is what he (and to an extent the society around him) was based off of, and I think he does a good job with it.\n\nThat isn't to say he's the best character ever written, but he was the best in this game, as all the other character become really boring and flat to follow. Vergil is written awkwardly, with a shallow emotional spectrum to accompany him; essentially, he is our exposition machine. Kat is so flat I don't even know what she was doing in there. She does something action wise, but personality wise I can barely remember what her personality was after finishing the game 10 minutes ago - it's that bad. Mundus and his minions are all stereotypical demonic villains, looking to rule the world. Nothing about the writing sticks out, and many attempts at banter or funny one liners fail and just sound awkward. The voice acting for Dante is the best most of the time, but there are still a few parts when his voice actor seems to be new and they didn't go for a second take.\n\nThe game does shine when it comes to its art direction, its music, and its combat system. The art, with the contrasts for Limbo and the original city, are great to see, and the music was cool to listen to as I'm slashing away at demons. One thing to note is that, if you don't like punk, or growling vocals, then this soundtrack will not be for you. The combat itself is apparently dumbed down, from what I hear, but it's not a bad thing for new players. I personally don't play much hack-n-slash so this was a good thing for me, I think, but I can see some veterans becoming bored (in which case I recommend playing the hardest difficulties). When I played I never got anything below an A, on medium, so maybe this can indicate how difficult the game is. It was still very satisfying combat, especially when it came to the harder to kill enemies, and getting those combos were awesome.\n\nHowever, I did find that there seemed to be a delay between inputting button commands, as many times I went to strike and wanted to dodge an incoming enemy attack, but I had to wait at least half a second to a second for my input to actually register as dodge. This can be annoying and especially frustrating on harder enemies. Furthermore, this game has a lot of platforming, more than I expected, which can be annoying at times; it also has a lot of cutscenes, sometimes with only a tiny element of gameplay (moving Dante to the next point) involved, which can be annoying as well if you want to get straight into the action. There's also no lock-on button, which can be absolutely bothersome combined with a frozen camera (see below).\n\nSome minor gripes: I played on a controller, and often times the camera would lock up and prevent me from spinning it, resulting in me getting hit by enemies. I'm not sure if playing with a KB+M is better, but I heard it is decent. Also, in comparing to the original DMC games, I wish this Dante would flourish his weapons each time he got them, but alas, Ninja Theory did not do that.\n\nOverall, DmC is certainly not a bad game gameplay and art wise, but the story is horrid. I recommend purchasing it on sale, and only if you're interested in the combat. If you like story based games, this one is not written well and will possibly disappoint you.","October 7, 2014","false","10.8"," 45 of 90 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","45","90","0","0"

The combat is fine, though a little boring, probably because of the lack of different combos, the weapons are okay, but a little generic (they have the exact same combos as your sword, one is just heavy and hits hard, and the other is fast and AoE), and you're forced to use certain weapons on certain enemies, but that's acceptable I guess. The thing that really turns me off about this game is the huge amount of platforming sections in a game that's supposed to be focused on combat, the jump doens't feel great, the airglide doens't feel great, and half the time there's a fixed camera angle that makes the platforming more tedious than fun. Overall this game is probably fine for someone who isn't farmilliar with the genre, and has some interest in it, but playing this game after playing Bayonetta, this feels like baby's first character action game.","December 27, 2013","false","2.7"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

From what I've now read, this doesn't follow the original story so it's a great place to pick up.\n\nIn this game you play as Dante, a half demon, half angel creature who is battling a world completely controlled by a demonic ruler, Mundus. Your goal is to hack and slash your way to victory with the help from the small resistance (super small, actually... just two other people).\n\nThe game is a spectacle fighter. All of your sword moves are massive and sweeping. It's just as much fun to watch since it all plays out as more of a flashy dance with swords than a brawler. By the end of the game Dante can seemlessly switch between eight weapons all in a single combo. You may start your attack with a dash to the toughest enemy, launching him into the air with your battle axe. Then spin around and throw some ninja stars at the weaker enemies to keep them off your back while jumping into the air and laying on more attacks with your angelic scythe before bringing it all home with your lava-covered boxing gloves.\n\nYou also have the ability to turn your swords into grapplehooks (either pulling you towards enemies or enemies towards you). This makes for very fast traversal around the arenas and lets you keep the pressure on.\n\nThe levels and areas in this game are incredible. I've never seen anything like it. Also though a lot of the story takes place in the "real world" the missions mostly play out in the parallel dimension, Limbo. Both worlds are tightly coupled and the giant monsters that destroy the Limbo world also cause chaos back in reality.\n\nAll that to say, buy this.

Yes.\n\nI found Dmc to be a very solid and competent revival of the series. At first glance Dante looks a bit of a cross between an emo teen and a Jersey Shore reject, but I don't really get that vibe out of the character, other than his "Sexual deviousness". The gameplay is very solid and unlike the other DMCs, pretty damn fair - I've never got killed because something was attacking me off screen. In fact, it looks like some enemies don't attack you when you're off camera, so you aren't always constantly managing your camera while trying to survive and fight stylistically according to the standard Capcom "We must judge your skill level and style" grading system that came with many of their PS2 era games. This doesn't mean that there isn't a challenge, though, this is honestly the only DMC I have finished, so it's much easier and I think more reasonable than prior games, but unlockable difficulties makes things harder by changing the way enemies spawn (I guess different enemies than what they are scripted in the normal games, so you have to be on your toes instead of memorizing spawns). The game encouranges (Read: forces) mutliple playthroughs if you want to get 100% completion, as some early game obstacles can only be passed with later game items. Thankfully, it appears you can play any mission you have already completed during intermissions. Like many of these linear "console style games, you may be looking for a secret around the map, but there are two to three paths and what often happens is that you will pass a "checkpoint" or enter an arean that ends in the typical YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE annoying game mechanics, which makes it feel like Capcom is judging you for not knowing where you were supposed to go, forcing you to look outside the game to know where to go. Yes, NINJA THEORY developed the game, not Capcom, but it's has that typical Capcom level design that pisses me off.\n\nI probably won't 100% this game, but only due to the fact that I'm trying to clear out my backlog. I find a very solid game that is probably my favorite in the series (though, I'm not sure I'm a fan as I didn't Finish 1, hated 2, and got my ♥♥♥ kicked in 3, so  I didn't bother with 4). The game is missing some of the original style of the original games, which will be a problem for some fans - while there is definitely the good old spectacle of this genre, much of the "Hey, look, I'm always doing something cool and showing off, Look at my style and bad assness!" is lost in this reimagining, but we had four games to do that, so I'm perfectly fine with this. If you had any reservations about the game and like spectacle fighters, I don't see much reason to not get it beyond price.","January 11, 2014","true","10.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

So, here I am :)\nThe game is brilliant, and there are a few reasons for me to say that.\nThe first one is that the game is visually stunning. And it's not an overestimation. Almost all of the game's action takes place in the world which is parallel to our own, Limbo. And in this world, everything you look at is beautiful. Rich colors, walls and buildings floating in the air, beautiful sky, words appearing on the floor and on the walls... These things grant you mind-blowing visual experience. And yeah, about the words... As far as I understand that, those words belong to the demon, one of the final bosses of the game, Demon King Mundus. Usually, some words appear on the floor or on the walls and a harsh voice reads them. My all-time favorite words are "♥♥♥♥ you, Dante!" xD I laughed a lot on that one.\nThe second reason is the game's plot. The plot is surprisingly good for a slasher! You don't expect a great plot in such a game, just because usually slashers aren't about the plot at all. However, in DmC, you won't find the best plot in the world, but it's a solid (or even more than that) storyline, it's quite intriguing and the characters are great. And of course, the best character is Dante. He's one of my favorite characters in games, mainly because of his sense of humour and his indifferent attitude to things. He knows he's the best and he behaves as one. However, this is a reboot of the old Devil May Cry series, and Dante... He's still the same. He's younger, he's impudent, he's strong and he doesn't care. If you love this character, just go on and play this game. Dante deserves it :)\nThe most important part in slashers is the game's mechanics. Every fight is spectacular, you have A LOT of weapons and moves to choose from, and even if you're not an experienced slasher player, you'll still be able to destroy hordes of demons in any way you like. And when the fight is over, you feel the need to start another one, just to chop some more demons into mincemeat. Because chopping them is really fun in that game!\nAlso, the soundtrack is perfect for that game. Fast extreme metal with growl vocals adds so much drive to that game, and to be honest, I don't think any other kind of music would fit for the slasher game.\nThe only flow I'd like to underline is that the game itself is really short. I clearly understand I completed it on the easiest difficulty level (human), however I managed to complete the game in 7-8 hours. This doesn't make the game worse or anything, but I expected 25-30 hours of gameplay, something like Darksiders, you know... Oh well, the game is amazing, and that's the most important thing.\nOverall, if you like good slashers, or if you like stunning visual experiences, the game is totally for you. I loved it.\nMy personal rating: 8.4 out of 10.","February 15, 2014","true","23.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/draft/recommended/220440/","draft","ReedRothchild","http://steamcommunity.com/id/draft/","601 products in account","DmC is a good game. Like many tough men I typed a lot of ♥♥♥♥ about this game and Ninja Theory. Well, they are due an apology because DmC is not garbage.\n\nDante controls very well. The weapons are fun to use and provide good variety for doing combos. Grappling enemies is stolen from DMC4 and is as fun here as it was in that game. Wrangling monsters is oddly satisfying. Someone should make an entire game about just that.\n\nFramerate is very good on my old as dirt PC. The game looks great, too. Ninja Theory is one of those developers known for great looking games and I think DmC is a good example of that. Technically it doesn't seem to do anything outrageous but the art is neat, what effects exist are used well and overall it's a pretty game.\n\nEnemies are fun to fight. They respond well to getting hit and dragged all over the place by grappling hooks. Many enemies are color coded and only vulnerable to one set of Dante's weapons. This mechanic is dumb and I don't like being forced to use certain weapons.\n\nBosses are straight garbage. Probably the biggest flaw in the game. Every boss is right out of the Zelda/God of War school. Two or three very telegraphed, very slow attacks repeated over and over while their weak spot gets beaten up. After doing enough damage the boss gets visibly hurt, the attacks patterns speed up or very slightly change, and after another couple cycles the boss is dead.\n\nOne boss is very neat looking. He's basically a demonic combination of Bill O'Reilly' and Max Headroom.\n\nThe last boss is the coolest but the trick to beating him is foolish. I don't like it when a boss is completely invulnerable except for one specific thing, and especially when that thing isn't obvious. (At least, it wasn't obvious to me; maybe I am too dumb for Ninja Theory's boss fight designers.)\n\nFinally, my understanding is that NT was given this chance to revitalize the DmC brand and one area they were expected to excel was story telling. Well, they ♥♥♥♥ed that up spectacularly. The story in DmC isn't bad but it is every part as dumb, nonsensical and populated with oddball characters and off pitch characterization as every previous DmC. Why would Capcom expect any different? Devil May Cry has an insane premise and trying to present the narrative as anything but outrageous camp is doomed to fail.\n\nNT didn't make a great Devil May Cry but they made in my estimation the best Western action game of the entire HD generation. That's not saying much and Bayonetta, Ninja Gaiden 2 and of course Devil May Cry 4 are all better games. That doesn't mean DmC is worthless to Japanese action game fans. Go in with tempered expectations and I think you'll agree this is a promising step forward for Western action game development.","January 4, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Players will make their way through a series of levels that are split between Limbo and Reality, while fighting demons and other monstrosities along the way. Fans of the series initially bashed the game for the new aesthetic stylings that have changed how Dante looks. But this is of little consequence seeing as how his attitude has also been tweaked. He may well come across as an angsty 20-something year old at first, but as the character grows he quickly becomes a solid Dante in his own right, with a strong moral code and personality. Combat is fast, strong and fluid, you can really feel the impact of the various weapons that you will be bringing to battle; be it sword, scythe or ranged weapons, they all pack enough punch to make the ranking combat system worth engaging in. Fans of the series will see some returning faces and ideals, and for those of you that purchase the DL, "Vergils Downfall" this game could be considered a prequel to Devil May Cry 3. DmC: Devil May Cry is actually a reboot, but some hardcore fans differ on this decision, thus aligning the timeline:\n\nDmC Devil May Cry\nDevil May Cry 3\nDevil May Cry 1\nDevil May Cry 4\nDevil May Cry 2\n\nBut putting that subject aside, this game is damn near perfect with great add on DLC including the free Bloody Palace Mode, definitely a game for fans of sword play. Just like my original review of the game, Dmc Devil May Cry would be scored 9/10.\nBut Steam doesn't score that way, so consider it recommended.","December 26, 2013","true","25.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So, here I am :)\nThe game is brilliant, and there are a few reasons for me to say that.\nThe first one is that the game is visually stunning. And it's not an overestimation. Almost all of the game's action takes place in the world which is parallel to our own, Limbo. And in this world, everything you look at is beautiful. Rich colors, walls and buildings floating in the air, beautiful sky, words appearing on the floor and on the walls... These things grant you mind-blowing visual experience. And yeah, about the words... As far as I understand that, those words belong to the demon, one of the final bosses of the game, Demon King Mundus. Usually, some words appear on the floor or on the walls and a harsh voice reads them. My all-time favorite words are "♥♥♥♥ you, Dante!" xD I laughed a lot on that one.\nThe second reason is the game's plot. The plot is surprisingly good for a slasher! You don't expect a great plot in such a game, just because usually slashers aren't about the plot at all. However, in DmC, you won't find the best plot in the world, but it's a solid (or even more than that) storyline, it's quite intriguing and the characters are great. And of course, the best character is Dante. He's one of my favorite characters in games, mainly because of his sense of humour and his indifferent attitude to things. He knows he's the best and he behaves as one. However, this is a reboot of the old Devil May Cry series, and Dante... He's still the same. He's younger, he's impudent, he's strong and he doesn't care. If you love this character, just go on and play this game. Dante deserves it :)\nThe most important part in slashers is the game's mechanics. Every fight is spectacular, you have A LOT of weapons and moves to choose from, and even if you're not an experienced slasher player, you'll still be able to destroy hordes of demons in any way you like. And when the fight is over, you feel the need to start another one, just to chop some more demons into mincemeat. Because chopping them is really fun in that game!\nAlso, the soundtrack is perfect for that game. Fast extreme metal with growl vocals adds so much drive to that game, and to be honest, I don't think any other kind of music would fit for the slasher game.\nThe only flow I'd like to underline is that the game itself is really short. I clearly understand I completed it on the easiest difficulty level (human), however I managed to complete the game in 7-8 hours. This doesn't make the game worse or anything, but I expected 25-30 hours of gameplay, something like Darksiders, you know... Oh well, the game is amazing, and that's the most important thing.\nOverall, if you like good slashers, or if you like stunning visual experiences, the game is totally for you. I loved it.\nMy personal rating: 8.4 out of 10.","February 15, 2014","true","23.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I tried old DMC years ago (I think the original) and it had an interesting combo mechanic but not enought to keep me involved. Times have changed, Dante has changed, DMC has changed.\n\nAs I understand it the modes that "true" DMC fans are looking for are available. However, I can admit I didn't touch them. I played DMC: Devil May Cry on normal difficulty.......and I really enjoyed it. Combat is wicked fast and fluid with tons of possible combinations to keep the demons at bay or floating in the air as you whipsaw through them with a variaty of weapons.\n\nEnivronments are constantly changing between the real world and the topsy turvey world of limbo where anything can happen and environents no longer pretend to abide to any laws of earthly physics. Somebody put a lot of love into these environents and at times they really steal the show.\n\nThe story won't win a pulitzer but is more than enough to pull you through the world. I don't think I was really surprised at any of the plot twists, but it was still well done and helped me stay connected to the charatcters. The main characther, Dante, actually grows considerably through the game and my opinion of him changed from begining to end.\n\nOne thing that I acutally appreciated quite a bit was the mission set up. The game is set up into chapters or missions and each one is somewhere between 15min- 30 min on the outside. I enjoyed playing a mission or two each night and having a clear place to put the game down for the evening.\n\nLong story short: I would recommend this game. Graphics are excellent, Gameplay is fluid, Story is solid.","January 21, 2014","true","17.2"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","1"

It looks gorgeous and has a smooth fighting system, much like a-kin to Bayonetta and other 60FPS titles.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/draft/recommended/220440/","draft","ReedRothchild","http://steamcommunity.com/id/draft/","601 products in account","DmC is a good game. Like many tough men I typed a lot of ♥♥♥♥ about this game and Ninja Theory. Well, they are due an apology because DmC is not garbage.\n\nDante controls very well. The weapons are fun to use and provide good variety for doing combos. Grappling enemies is stolen from DMC4 and is as fun here as it was in that game. Wrangling monsters is oddly satisfying. Someone should make an entire game about just that.\n\nFramerate is very good on my old as dirt PC. The game looks great, too. Ninja Theory is one of those developers known for great looking games and I think DmC is a good example of that. Technically it doesn't seem to do anything outrageous but the art is neat, what effects exist are used well and overall it's a pretty game.\n\nEnemies are fun to fight. They respond well to getting hit and dragged all over the place by grappling hooks. Many enemies are color coded and only vulnerable to one set of Dante's weapons. This mechanic is dumb and I don't like being forced to use certain weapons.\n\nBosses are straight garbage. Probably the biggest flaw in the game. Every boss is right out of the Zelda/God of War school. Two or three very telegraphed, very slow attacks repeated over and over while their weak spot gets beaten up. After doing enough damage the boss gets visibly hurt, the attacks patterns speed up or very slightly change, and after another couple cycles the boss is dead.\n\nOne boss is very neat looking. He's basically a demonic combination of Bill O'Reilly' and Max Headroom.\n\nThe last boss is the coolest but the trick to beating him is foolish. I don't like it when a boss is completely invulnerable except for one specific thing, and especially when that thing isn't obvious. (At least, it wasn't obvious to me; maybe I am too dumb for Ninja Theory's boss fight designers.)\n\nFinally, my understanding is that NT was given this chance to revitalize the DmC brand and one area they were expected to excel was story telling. Well, they ♥♥♥♥ed that up spectacularly. The story in DmC isn't bad but it is every part as dumb, nonsensical and populated with oddball characters and off pitch characterization as every previous DmC. Why would Capcom expect any different? Devil May Cry has an insane premise and trying to present the narrative as anything but outrageous camp is doomed to fail.\n\nNT didn't make a great Devil May Cry but they made in my estimation the best Western action game of the entire HD generation. That's not saying much and Bayonetta, Ninja Gaiden 2 and of course Devil May Cry 4 are all better games. That doesn't mean DmC is worthless to Japanese action game fans. Go in with tempered expectations and I think you'll agree this is a promising step forward for Western action game development.","January 4, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Then again there was a sale on Steam, and I said what the hell I give in... I'm so grateful I did. This game is in my top 3 of this year. What I have to emphasize is the awesome control, I have not met any game where the control was so fine-tuned and fluent, the combat is incredibly enjoyable. The story is the usual, side-characters are a bit shallow, but the witty humor of Dante is there, which is the most important for me, and the brotherly energy with Vergil. The music is not exactly my type, but I got a bit of love for it during playing. Lastly, the visuals.

DMC takes place in a modern world that is ruled by demons without us even knowing it. It centers around the character Dante and his brother who are the only ones who can end the demon's rule. The game is a reboot of the Devil May Cry series and I have to say, this is BY FAR the best Devil May Cry game yet. The game offers some of the best combat systems in a hack n' slash game EVER. I don't think I have ever played a game like this that had such a smooth, responsive, and intense combat system. The game is well optimized so most systems will be able to run this game at a smooth 60 FPS with the games nice visuals which does nothing but help the fun of the game. The port of the game was well done but I can't say how the game works on mouse and keyboard but for the most part hack n' slash games work best on controllers so I would recommend you plug in a Suxbox Threefixme controller into your PC for this game. The storyline in this game is good and enjoyable but if you played the other DMC games you will already know how it all turns out. The game is fairly long compared to other hack n' slash games clocking in at about 6-10 hours depending on how much you explore and how fast you are with the combat. New Game + is supported in this game and it should be in more games. The difficulty in this game is fantastic and has some different difficulties you can play once you finish the game once for those hardcore fans. I loved this game and I would recommend it to any gamer looking for a great hack n' slash game and to any fans of the earlier Devil May Cry games. 95/100","April 8, 2013","true","21.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

This is a fantastic reboot of Devil May Cry, and despite a really mediocre first 6-7 chapters, the game unleashes everything it has in store after that one chapter after another. The combat has been simplified without losing any of subtlety the previous games in the series have had, and while it's no where near as technically deep as DMC3 or 4, you can still unleash ridiculous combos that require a deeper understanding of the game's mechanics and weapon types. It's late, but if you were at all hesitant to play this because you didn't like the new design for Dante (a younger Dante, so it's fitting), I highly recommend you overlook that because Ninja Theory has proven they can handle the franchise.\n\nAnd I don't want to spoil some of the later level design, but ♥♥♥♥, they are *so* good. *SO* good.","May 13, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That question being is this a good DMC game? The answer to that is no it is not. Does that make it a bad game? Not at all, in fact it is a great game and I loved it. As a result I feel that amount of backlash and hate it got was mostly unjustified. With that said I would recommend it to anyone on the fence about buying it. Whether you are an advent DMC player like me or someone who is looking for a new experience. Overall it’s an 8.5/10Below are more detailed reviews for those who want to know more.\n___________________________________________________________________\nFor those new to the series:\nThis game is a reboot to the series, not a continuation from DMC 4 or any other game. If you try to go back in the series expecting to see edgy Dante you are going to be horribly lost. Even though I do recommend this game I strongly recommend starting with DMC 3 or 4.\nPros:\n>Visually stunning graphics and levels\n> Fluid game mechanics and combo system that is extremely satisfying when fighting\n> Variety of weapons and gadgets for stringing together combos or just fooling around (personal favorite is using the sticky dart to mess with low rank enemies)\n> The concept of demons integrating into modern society and controlling mankind through media and soft drinks is a funny and refreshing idea to the series.\n>Moves can be practiced in the item shop before being purchased and can be refunded for new moves. Allowing for a high level of customization freedom.\n> Great amount of enemy variety\n> Has a good degree of replay value.\n> You can punch Bill O’Reilly in the face.\nFor those returning:\n>	The combat feels similar to past installments\n>	Guns are more viable during combat with a wider range of upgrades\n>	Weapon and character upgrades are now dependent on your overall rating during gameplay making it all the more rewarding to get that SSS ranking during combos (They aren’t given out like candy but given in moderation).\n>	Secret missions can be accessed from the mission menu when they are unlocked.\nCons:\n>	The story is horrible and feels like it was ripped of fanfic.net\n>	The humor is overly ribald and unnecessary.\n>	Boss battles are pretty simplistic and too easy.\n>	Color coded enemies become frustrating and interrupt combos frequently\n>	The game glitches at times and causes Dante to get stuck in either angel weapon mode or devil weapon mode forcing the player to restart from a checkpoint.\n>	Voice acting is subpar with the exception of Vergil’s voice actor.\n>	The ophion weapon whips can be unresponsive at times during platform sections.\n>	There is no lock on button meaning that Dante will be stuck fighting the first thing he sees.\nFor those returning:\n>      Chances are if you're coming off from a past installment you'll be dropping your combos often.\n>	Characters feel out of place and don’t do their predecessors justice.\n>	Combo system and boss battles feel extremely dumbed down.\n>	Devil trigger feels like a slap in the face as Dante doesn’t turn into a demon but rather a white haired version of himself.\n>	In order to do secret missions we now need keys to open the doors that hold them.\n>	Bloody palace has to be downloaded separately.\nThe biggest complaint I have as a returning players is that the reboot was unnecessary and that the concept and mechanics could have been implemented in a sequel instead with original dante or even nero.","March 26, 2014","true","9.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

My play time in DMC4 says it. I have DMC2 on PS2 that I completed on all difficulties as both Dante and Lucia. I didn't play DMC3 because it is buggy and almost impossible to setup. This DMC is a total disappointment for me.\n- I want to start with color-coded enemies: You know "use blue weapons to kill blue enemies and use red weapons to kill red enemies!" Not only this limits your options at weapons you can use against certain types of enemies, but it also ruins your variety of combos which Devil May Cry is all about. This is the problem which will persist you through the entire game.\n- I don't know who of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Ninja Theory or Capcom thought that it would be a good idea to levitate all enemies in the air while going into Devil Trigger mode, either way it's stupid and annoying.\n- Dante's appearance change.\n- Lots of references to the past Devil May Cry games.\nAnd I am only half way through the game.","June 26, 2014","false","5.7"," 41 of 82 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","41","82","0","2"

It has tongue-in-cheek humor and compelling characters. The story in DmC was original in its own right. Sure it was good Vs evil, save the world, save the girl. But it had elements only a devil may cry title could pull off. The game NOT ending in a romantic kiss was also a nice refreshing sight.\n\nLevel design and the music composed was just fantastic. I loved the night club mission. I could play it over and over, Lilith's domain was by far the best.\n\nDmC did not get all 10 stars because of the repetitive enemies. By mission 3 the enemies are already dull and boring, sure new ones are always introduced but even they are already carbon copies; once you find a way to exploit them, the fights become easy.Also the combat system is rather janky, sometimes Dante would move, dodge, or jump out of time or there would a delay. No game is without its bugs so I will not fault the developers on this. However it is something players will have to simply deal with as they play through the game.\n\nDespite the flaws, the game is over all worth playing whehter casually or hardcore and fully clearing each level. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys blood and anarchy.","October 21, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yet, there is no lock-on mode (except the Defenitive Version) which is really suck and i kinda feel like capcom is scamming us.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainhammerx/recommended/220440/","captainhammerx","Captain Hammer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainhammerx/","310 products in account","DmC: Devil May Cry gets some flak from long time fans because it does some things worse than other DMC games. However, it does several things better, as well. The story is about as good as you'd expect: It's nothing extraordinary, but it won't make you sick, either. Dante is young and immature and this is the basically the story of him reaching that level of maturity you're used to seeing in other games. Don't be upset when he's kind of a punk, because that's the point.\n\nBut this is also a great game for those just interested in exploring Devil May Cry for the first time because the story is a prequel and you won't have expectations set by the other games. In other words, you won't be missing anything and you won't have to know what you're missing.\n\nPros:\nSome of the best keyboard and mouse controls to ever grace this genre. Powerful, satisfying sense of impact and flair in fights. Top-level combos have less to do with tiny enemy step exploits (like in previous games) and have a more normalized flow. Skill upgrades are tied to XP, not currency, and can be respecced any time between (or sometimes in the middle of) levels. The unlockable content is good, and bloody palace mode is fantastic free DLC. One of the boss fights is really creative and entertaining, but describing it would be a spoiler.\n\nCons:\nCertain action-less sections of the game are unskippable and become a chore during subsequent playthoughs. Devil trigger has been reduced from an integral part of combat to a 5-10 second invulnerability button. Dante Must Die mode is significantly easier than in previous games. Enemies that can only be hurt while in demon mode or angel mode greatly reduce your combo options and suck all of the fun out of a battle. One of the bosses takes way too long to beat for the amount of variety in the fight (none).","December 28, 2013","true","51.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Unfortunately everything afterwards descends into either boring melodrama, or downright stupid "edgy" moments that are trying too hard to be cool.\n\nThe combat has this issue where the potential is there to pull off crazy combos like you'd see in Devil May Cry 3 or 4, but you can only realistically use them against the basic mindless enemies who never pose a threat to you. More advanced enemy types require that you use very certain attacks against them, discouraging creativity and encouraging finding a couple of really overpowered attacks and spamming them as often as possible.\n\nAside from maybe one or two, the boss fights are all Zelda-style "do this thing then wail on it three times", undermining the point of even having an intricate combo system in the first place. The Vergil DLC kind of fixes these problems, but it still suffers from enemies that lack aggression and painfully bad writing.\n\nI really wanted to like this game because there was a clear attempt to do something different with a unique grunge aesthetic permeating through the experience, but it's also trying to play directly to a wide audience with immature storytelling and never emphasizing the potential of the combat system. You might enjoy this if you're wanting a fun button-masher that isn't nearly as punishing as the earlier games, but for me this was really disappointing.","June 20, 2014","false","10.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I was talking massive amounts of ♥♥♥♥ about this game from every little bit that was being revealed up until the actual release, but I decided to pick it up because the original creator of the first DMC game was vouching to give Ninja Theory's attempt at the series a shot.  Another thing that pushed me was that a certain someone was threatening that they were just going to buy the game for me if I didn't pick it up myself, and I really hate it when people waste money on me, so.......\n\nAs of right now, I've only played about two hours, and would be playing more if it wasn't 4 AM my time!  I thought the dubstep would really detract me from enjoying the game, but you don't really notice the music most of the time while you're trying to dodge/parry/strike at enemies.  The weapons that I have are really fun to use, as they are all extremely varied.  Sometimes it gets a little confusing, as I'm not used to having so many options to dispatch enemies in a game!  It's only going to get worse as I upgrade my weapons to maximize my combos.  I've been playing on the normal difficulty, as I figured easy would be too easy, and hard might be a bit much considering I have never been 'great' at action games like the DMC series.  I haven't died yet, although I've come extremely close during boss fights!\n\nI personally don't like the look of new Dante, but I think my game came with a preordered bonus skin to make Dante look like his old self, and I'm really happy they included that with the game!  He still reverts to his old self during cutscenes, but it doesn't really matter that much as I don't really care about the story (since it seems really dumb).  The combat is really the highlight for me, and I'm really surprised at how well-made this game is considering it's out for console systems as well.  One of my IRL friends told me that they actually designed the game for PC (as the framerate is actually capped on the console version), and I would believe them considering how smoothly the game is running on my 2-3 year old machine!  I'm running everything at max with vsync@120hz and have only noticed tearing during some cutscenes, although that's incredibly minor (since the game runs pretty flawlessly during actual gameplay).  The environment is absolutely stunning from what I've come across thus far, and I'm excited to explore more of the game later!  I haven't even unlocked every available weapon yet, so I'm extremely excited to experiment with what combos I can create using all the techniques and weapons are available.\n\nI think this game is going to be really great just from judging what I've played so far, and I'm really happy I was wrong about how horrible I thought this game was going to be after following its development for so long.\n\nAs someone who has never completed a Devil May Cry game before, I'm happy to say that I'm having a blast playing through this one, and fully plan to beat this (eventually)!  Pick this up if you're looking to have fun with an action game!\n\nAlso I'm playing this with a 360 controller, so I have no idea how different it would be on keyboard/mouse!!  IF YOU PLAY GAMES LIKE THESE ON PC, YOU SHOULD REALLY INVEST IN A WIRED 360 CONTROLLER (if you don't have one by now).","January 27, 2013","true","10.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

From what I've now read, this doesn't follow the original story so it's a great place to pick up.\n\nIn this game you play as Dante, a half demon, half angel creature who is battling a world completely controlled by a demonic ruler, Mundus. Your goal is to hack and slash your way to victory with the help from the small resistance (super small, actually... just two other people).\n\nThe game is a spectacle fighter. All of your sword moves are massive and sweeping. It's just as much fun to watch since it all plays out as more of a flashy dance with swords than a brawler. By the end of the game Dante can seemlessly switch between eight weapons all in a single combo. You may start your attack with a dash to the toughest enemy, launching him into the air with your battle axe. Then spin around and throw some ninja stars at the weaker enemies to keep them off your back while jumping into the air and laying on more attacks with your angelic scythe before bringing it all home with your lava-covered boxing gloves.\n\nYou also have the ability to turn your swords into grapplehooks (either pulling you towards enemies or enemies towards you). This makes for very fast traversal around the arenas and lets you keep the pressure on.\n\nThe levels and areas in this game are incredible. I've never seen anything like it. Also though a lot of the story takes place in the "real world" the missions mostly play out in the parallel dimension, Limbo. Both worlds are tightly coupled and the giant monsters that destroy the Limbo world also cause chaos back in reality.\n\nAll that to say, buy this.

Worth it if on sale, up to you at full price.\n\nI have just finished my playthrough of both the base game and the DLC Fall of Vergil gameplay on Devil Hunter difficulty. DMC has the humor and I feel they got Dante's cocky demeanor down to perfection. The story was pretty good, if not predictable at times but you don't really play games like these for stories, you play them to feel like a badass. In this case, the game delivers. The game is kind of short, as I have beaten the base game in 8 hours and the DLC in about 2.\n\nDante is given his trusty Ebony and Ivory, his sword Rebellion, and four other types of weapons. Two of them being more power based and the other two being more speed based. You can switch between the four extra weapons seamlessly for some pretty awesome combos. I found it pretty easy to get at least an S rating on combos once I got the controls down and I got them down really quickly. It's easy to understand how each weapon works and you're pretty much limited by your creativity when it comes down to putting combos together. Since I played the game on Devil Hunter (normal), it wasn't that hard to beat but still challenging enough to feel satisfied when you get an SSS combo score. No doubt the harder difficulties will provide some fun and frustration.\n\nFall of Vergil really pales in comparison. I know it's a DLC so it won't have as much content but will Vergil you're only given Yamato and his Illusion powers. Don't get me wrong, Vergil's a badass and it was rewarding to kick ♥♥♥ with him once I got used to him. The difference is that while Dante has an arsenal of weapons that allow him to handle multiple enemies at once allowing you to be a powerhouse, Vergil was more limited and I felt you have to be more evasive and strike more precisely. That said, his demon form is pretty cool and is a little more dynamic than Dante. Still it doesn't beat being able to switch multiple weapons and going to town on those demons.\n\nThe only way this game could have been better is a longer game and more interesting characters.\n\nDo I recommend this game at full price? As cheap as I am, I would say no. But I feel I'm an outlier of the average consumer when it comes to assessing the worth of games. I'm incredibly cheap and I only ever really buy during sales. That said, I bought this game during the Summer Sale and by that I would absolutely recommend getting this game.\n\nI say wait for a sale and then get it.

They hate the game no matter what, and their oinions can't be taken seriously.\n\nHow do you know if they're a biased fanboy? Telltale signs include called Dante 'Donte', and outright hatred and vitriol towards the games existance.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way and the baggage of a much loved franchise is put aside, is this game good or not? The answer is yes, it's a very good game, in fact it's one of the best action games I've ever played.\n\nDevil May Cry 1 was an instant classic, it was my first PS2 game and is still my favourite DMC game. I've played every game in the series, including the terrible sequel, and in my opinion DmC is easily the second best game in the series. Arguably it's the best.\n\nNote that many consider DMC3 to be the best, and that's perfectly agreeable, I ultimately prefer 1 because of the atmosphere, and Dante in DMC3 was a little too over the top, OK a LOT over the top.\n\nDmC has the best combat and platforming in the series, the most well told and interesting story (it fleshed out the characters in a way that the entire tetralogy never did), and it also has one of the most striking and interesting visual designs I've seen in a AAA game.\n\nUltimately this game is pure fun, as with most straight up action games, you know what you're getting - linear level design, fast and furious combat, in your face characters and a rocking soundtrack.\n\nI've played all major franchises in this genre - DMC, God of War, Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden; DmC is easily the best of the genre available on PC.\n\nThe goal of these games is to make you feel like an all-powerful badass, and have fun while you do it, DmC delivers.\n\nGet it, have fun, kick ♥♥♥ - win.\n\nP.S.\n\nMake sure to get Vergil's Downfall, truly a great little piece of DLC that completes a fan favourite character's arc to the dark side.","November 10, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sicon112/recommended/220440/","Sicon112","Sicon112","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sicon112/","71 products in account","I will preface this with a statement:\n\nI wouldn't call myself an avid DmC fan. I have the other games. I've played them, and they were fun. Heard varying opinions of this game and got it on sale to see for myself. First off, a lot of the people saying its horrible and the spawn of Satan and the like are wrong. Kinda. It has its good points, it has its bad points, and it has quite a few just plain mediocre points, so I'll try and be as fair as I can here.\n\n(Warning. Warning. A new Wall of Text approaches.)\n\nFirst off, how does it play? Decently. Combat is nice and smooth, flows really well, but... it's not at all that difficult. Some of it just gets kind of silly too. Once the grab mechanics got introduced, I almost immediately figured out how to just return to my home planet without much difficulty at all. While things like this are usually possible, in this game it seems rather hilariously simple to discover and then spam them to your heart's content. Also, Dante's devil trigger is kind of silly. He freezes time, which would normally have me :D'ing, but then he flings everyone up into the air where they are annoying to hit, invalidating every single ground combo I have, basically. Anyway, I didn't find quite as much depth or challenge to the fighting mechanics as I would nessecarily like, but this is coming from a guy who loves Dark Souls and plays everything on the hardest difficulty he can, so my definition of challenge is a bit different from most casual players. Aside from being somewhat more simplistic than I expected, however, there isn't much of anything you can call a fault in the combat. It's pretty looking, very smooth, and kind of mediocre, really.\n\nPlot? Look, let's be honest here, no one plays the original DMC games for the plot. That was one of the many mistakes they made with 2, in fact. That said, unlike the original games, which were trying harder to be entertaining that tell a really detailed story, this one has one. A rather large one that I'm not really a fan of. However, all matters of opinion aside for the most unbiased review, it's mostly another "Eh" from me. Despite usually being an obsessive gamer who watches every cutscene and searches for all the little details etc. I just wasn't that interested in the plot. It's there, yes. Is the writing horrible? No. Is it fatastic? No. Looking at it as a whole, I can't really say there is anything about it that ever goes above average. Some is below, most is right on the line, and none of it really gets very much further than that.\n\nNext we have DmC Dante. Gonna say it straight out. I think he sucks. I don't find him funny or entertaining in any way, shape or form. This is without comparing him to the old Dante at all. had I never played another DMC in my life, I would still get a headache almost every time he opens his mouth. I have laughed at literally none of his jokes, I have completely failed to care about any of his actions at every turn, and in general just been unamused by his existence. He is whiny, thinks he is so cool for being a punk, blah blah blah blah I don't even want to listen to him any more. It seems from where I'm standing that the writers just went with any uninspired bit of excessive vulgarity they could come up with to make him seem "cool" and then went to lunch. That isn't me being a prude. What with all the time I spend online I'd probably have an aneurysm by now if I was. However, all of the teenage-class stupid that spews forth from his every orofice has gotten mindbogglingly old, so unless you giggle at "dirty words" there isn't much there that could possibly be called humor. Once in a while, he makes some comment that gets my hopes up and I think "Is this actually going to be witty and intelligent?" and then he finishes what he was saying and it all comes crashing back down to dull. And do I even need to bring up the infamous "**** YOU!" "NO, **** YOU!" exchage? he is absolutely the worst part of the game, as far as I'm concerned, and it says a lot that my feelings about any game can be summed up with "The main character is the worst thing about it."\n\nMusic... is really another matter of personal taste, I suppose. In my opinion, the main game's soundtrack sucks, but that's just because I hate most of that genre to begin with. That said, it suits the character just fine, so if that's what they were going for, great success! Considering that the Vergil's Downfall DLC switches to a totally different theme, it probably was what they intended. (That music is a little eh, too, though. It's there, it doesn't sound out of place, but it isn't stellar for the most part either. Maybe I haven't payed enough attention to it, but that it can't grab my attention does say quite a bit.)\n\nWith all said and done, my final opinion on this game is mostly just "Meh". If I had never bought it, I would be perfectly content with my life. If I had bought it full price, I would probably regret it a bit. It runs well, plays decently, and I can't say I wasted the time I spent on it any more than it would have been wasted on another game, but I still find the combat lacking the challenge I looked for, and the new Dante spent a good portion of the game giving me a headache before I just ragequit to play Vergil's Downfall for a while instead. My statements that the combat lacks depth should still be taken with a grain of salt, as the combat will probably be perfectly acceptable to most casual players, but if you are looking for all sorts of tricky shenanigans like in certain other games in this genre, you probably won't find a ton of them here. The plot was uninteresting, at least to me, and way too full of dropping anvils (That's TvTropes speak, for those uninitiated in that specific internet timesink) for me to take it seriously, and as characters I find the new cast bland at best and generally annoying at worst.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, if it's on sale and you feel like it, sure, go ahead and get it, I suppose, but if I had a choice between this and DMC3 or 4, I'd leave this one sitting in my games library collecting digital dust, which I can say with complete certainty, because that would be what is happening this very instant, and will probably still be happening whenever you, whoever you are, come by this little corner of the web and read this particular post. However, since there is no button that says "Meh" and displays a shrugging stick figure, I guess I'll just say reccomended, with the imaginary caveat of "When it's on sale".","July 15, 2014","true","33.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you go into this game with an open mind and are aware that is a reboot and a reimagining of the tale of Dante then you will be more than able to thoroughly enjoy yourself, However if you go into it expecting Devil May Cry 5 then you will be sadly disappointed.\n\nThe game still focuses on the stringing together fast paced, brutal combos in an action-oriented combat that system that were so prominent in the previous entries. And the game still offers the style ranking system based on how well you perform in combat. But while the game still focuses heavily on the two key components that made the franchise famous…It does make them incredibly more “accessible” to players who have never played any of the previous entries, which wouldn’t be a bad thing seeing as the game offers seven different difficulty levels, However only three are unlocked from the start of the game and all three are simple enough where you can easily breeze through and get “Savage” or better on most levels. So unless you truly want to get some form of challenge from the game you’ll have to do a few play-throughs of the game before you really find yourself struggling to chain together a good enough combo to actually feel proud of yourself when you hear the omnipresent announcer proclaim “Savage!”. The oversimplification isn’t all bad, the game does offer incredibly streamlined controls that allow for lengthy combos to be chained together while swapping through all 8 weapons and both grappling hooks on the fly without any obstructive interface or item swapping. The natural feel provided from the streamlined controls is easily one of the game’s greatest features.\n\nBesides the dumbed down difficulty and scoring system the game is also hindered by its generic level and enemy design. None of the design in the game feels new or fresh; it’s just a bunch of dark, glum, narrow corridors with hordes of the same bland enemies with some fairly enjoyable platforming elements sprinkled in between. Not only are the designs of both the enemies and levels bland, but the main characters themselves are also both predictable, and flat. This isn’t the bias hate rambling of a fan-boy who’s ♥♥♥♥♥♥ they changed Dante’s hair color, I’m honestly fine with the appearance of all the characters, even the new Emo Dante, but the game does offer plenty of alternative skins for those who are too turned off by the emo vibe.\n\nThe visuals of the game are another one of the games strong points, offering easily some of the best visual graphics to come out of a Capcom game to date. And the game is certainly a solid PC port, during my playthroughs of the game I managed to stay well over 100fps without any dips that could potentially interfere with the fast paced combo chaining combat.  The soundtrack of the game is honestly a hit or miss based on your view of how you feel about Electronic Body Music, as the soundtrack consists primarily of the band Combichrist, I personally enjoy it however to each their own.\n\nAfter hearing the review thus far you would probably expect me to poorly rate the game, but its actually quite the opposite. Despite all of the complaints and flaws that this game has, it somehow manages to get passed all of that and provide an experience that is genuinely fun. If you look at the game you can easily pick apart the design flaws and nerfed difficulty, but even with all the flaws, DMC Devil May Cry proves to be an excellent game with strong enough legs to stand on its own and not be judged based on the previous entries in the franchise….because that’s the whole point of a reboot, to break away from the past and become something new. So don’t let the look of the game turn you off, pick up a controller and play through the game on the hardest difficulty you can and experience the beauty of the fast paced, stylish, streamlined, chaotic fun that you will have.\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/","January 19, 2015","true","11.9"," 24 of 48 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","24","48","2","0"

This game is just wow, and it leaves me spechless. I honeslty just love everything about it. Something you people reading should know before I get started is that this is the first game I have played in this franchise.\nThe story itself just has me so involved that I can't stop playing it because one thing leads to the next and then some big plot twist happens, and off you go again. It's not just the story that keeps me playing though, there's also an amazing amout of art put into it (if you look at the concept art) which adds it's own beauty to the game.\nThe combat in this game should not be take lightly. Much like the story and art there is depth to it, as well as a cetian skill of timing attacks and doges. When you start playing you have a basic sword and two pistols, which can be upgraded as well as you own (Dante's) abilitys such as jumping and other things. Upon fighting your first demon you aquire another weapon (A demon side weapon). You get two sides of weapons as well as your normal sword and two guns, you have demons weapons and angel weapons. After your second demon kill you get your first angel weapon (a sythe) continue through the game to get more weapons (these weapons can be upgraded as well).\nNow for the not so fun part of tell you guys what I don't really enjoy about the game. Some of the controls are a bit wonky, for example if you're using your angel grapple at some points it will just stop and you'll fall or it wont read your click and you'll fall. Doging can be a bit buggy as well, like if someone counters your attack and you try to doge it sometimes won't read and you'll take the damage instead of doging. Aside from that the game is amazing!]\n~ Thanks for reading my review of "DmC: Devil May Cry"!","December 23, 2015","true","11.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

Lots of controversy has been had over Dante's new look, but I personally never really cared since I have never played any other DMC game (even though I eventually planned to since the  Spectacle fighter sub-genre is my favorite game genre). Now this game is a very fun spectacle fighter that lasts about 8-10 hours with the Vergil DLC adding another hour or two. Now the story in this game isnt very strong, but it is good enough to keep you invested. The combat in this game is amazing and very different to that of other spectacle fighters like Ninja Gaiden or God of War. You can switch weapons mid swing from a sword to an axe to a scythe. There are a total of 8 weapons and they are all very fun to use. The bosses are also a ton of fun to fight and can give you a challenge, especially the final boss. In my opinion the final boss in this game is one of the best final bosses in any game I've played so far. He legitimately feels like you equal and the area around you changes as you fight him and he is not easy, but not hard either. More games should take notes and make bosses more like DMC's final boss. Overall this game gets a 9/10 and is very fun and the story is decent and I highly recommend you play it if you like hack and slash games.","September 14, 2015","true","15.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

DMC is a game with a pretty simple, but likeable story, decent characters and development, a good twist, excellent writing, and incredible combat. The game has fast, aggressive combat with weapons that are easily switched in an instant, and awesome combos. There is also great design, with really cool level design, bright colors, and really good indicators during combat. The game can also be pretty challenging sometimes, if you're looking for that.

Well yes, it isn't the originals but it is still a great game, the story is a bit lack luster. But the combat is very fluid and rewarding, it does, however, require some work to master learning how to combo and use all of the different abilities is a bit difficult but fun all the same.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IzI969/recommended/220440/","IzI969","Chi||969","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IzI969/","1796 products in account","A game with much controversy surrounding its release due to both the stylistic change and the developer's confrontational and punk-like attitude.\n\nThe result, while not being the pinnacle of hack and slash/spectacle fighters that one of its predecessors was (DMC3), still comes off as very enjoyable and even addictive at times.\n\nStarting with the bad, the fighitng system has been simplified from past releases. Gone are the variety of styles and in their place two new types of weapons are available by holding down each of the triggers. Each weapon type has in turn two sub weapons that behave differently.\n\nThis doesn't mean that this is a Fisher-Price, nursing school fighter. The game still requires skillful and deliberate actions in order to be able to deliver a standing ovation worthy, class A demon spanking. It's just that, in what i guess was, an attempt to trim some of the franchise's fat the devs cut off some of the meat as well and this in turn hurt both the gameplay factor and the overall longevity of the title.\n\nAnother drawback is that there is no visual indicator for the targeting system so focusing on different opponents and prioritizing your targets feels more clunky.\n\nFinally the point system feels off as it awards more points the more enemies you hit in one blow or the more hits you deliver in a short ammount of time rather than handsomely rewarding precise actions like countering hits.  This in turn makes combat feel more spammy and offense-based rather than the "taunting", bursty type of combat in previous DMCs.\n\nFrom the above you'd guess that i don't like DmC?\n\nWell you couldn't be more wrong.\n\nFirst of all the level design in this and level variety in particular is one of the best of the series so far, with levels like Lilith's Club, and the News Network stealing the show.\n\nI really liked the punk/pop/street culture based style of the visuals as well.\n\nThe fighting while simplified as mentioned above is still very satisfying and fun to play and the angel/demon based mechanics, aside from a cool nod to Dante's duality as a character, are well implemented allowing you to pull off every move imaginable on the fly.\n\nOpting for including platforming rather than puzzles that slow down the pacing was a solid decision on the dev's part imo. It just keeps the game flowing better.\n\nThe game's story bears strong similarities to J.Carpenter's "They Live". Personally i found it enjoyable yet nothing groundbreaking given that it's a concept that i was already familiar with through said film.\n\nCharacter performances are solid as well with Mundus's standing out for me.\nThe only sour note in that department was that Dante's one liners come off as forced and "wooden" at times.\n\nI also liked the soundtrack as well but i realize that given the niche of the genre (Electro/Industrial) it won't be for everybody.\n\nOn the technical side of things QLOC have done a terrific job making this game look spectacular while mainting very high fps and motion fluidity on max settings, resulting in this being one of the best uses of UE3 to date imo.\n\nOverall, a very fun to play H&S title, excellent for newcomers to the genre as well as those that want to rekindle their interest in spectacle fighters.\n\nRecommended.\n\n\n\n","July 11, 2013","true","33.3"," 41 of 83 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","41","83","0","0"

Most of the negativity for this game comes from previous DmC fans who absolutely refuse change. I have personally been playing Dmc since the original (have a copy in my desk right next to me :cwat:) The only one I haven't played is 2. That being said yeah, It's different, but it is truly an enoyable hack n' slash action game.\n\nPros:\n-Surprisingly decent storyline, Not Squeenix quality... But good enough.\n\n-Combat: Good 8/10, It has a wider range of weapons that can be used creatively and fit better to a play style resulting in enjoyable combat. I have my complaints some of them being that the devil trigger is now a next to useless feature and the guns are even less effective as combat tools as they were... be that as it may, the melee combat is superb.\n\n-Gameplay: 7/10 Above average, The smooth gameplay is ridged with average linear level design giving you deja vu 20 times before the end of the mission, and the difficulty is definitely easier (I remember the days when you had to work to get the double jump ability), but overall the gameplay is nice and the interaction and dynamics of the levels make it a positive experience.\n\n-Art: 8.75/10 Goodish Great, Grafitti is not really my style, however the art was fantastically done. Much brighter than past games and much more colorful. While some people like the pure gothic artistry of old, I prefer not to stare at grey walls for an entire 31 hr story based game. In game graphics are good quality.\n\nCons\n\n-Character Development: Let's just say this dante, while at times can have good character enlightenment, is mostly a 15 year old kid who just filled out his profanity lexicon. The "bad boy" theme is way too overdone to the point that it is a pile of swearing and rude gestures on top of an ego obssessed frat boy. I found myself more interested in the development of the side/main character Kat. I'm not going to start on Virgil because spoilers however potential was lost.\n\n\n\nMiddle Ground:\n\n-Music: While not my choice, there was still some death metal battle themes and that's all I expected.\n\ntl;dr It's a good game, pick it up on a sale for some good old fashion hack n' slash fun","June 25, 2014","true","21.4"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supercoolronnie/recommended/220440/","supercoolronnie","Ronnie from TV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supercoolronnie/","345 products in account","Without touching on the stupid story, cause this isn't the focus:\n\n- The combat is weak as hell. At first glance it seems alright and similar enough to classic DMC, but enemies are incredibly easy to juggle forever - playing this game on Son of Sparda difficulty (the one right before Dante Must Die) is equivalent to playing DMC3 on normal. The game tries to create challenge by putting in enemies that can only be hit by one type of weapon (a very annoying mechanic that goes against the basic concept of the game) or facing you up against really annoying enemies that take way too much effort to open up for attacks at all (do the chainsaw guys seriously need to enter a Hyperarmor state every 5 seconds??). Even DMC3 had its enemy design pitfalls but DmC really becomes just annoying\n\n- Why is the game so easy?? The encounter design is mostly a joke, the bosses are all gimmicks with nothing interesting to them. DMC3 had a lot of crummy bosses, DMC4 fell short on making them interesting beyond the devilbringer interactions - they're both vastly superior to what this game got. The final boss is a retread of DMC3s final boss except its incredibly pathetic in comparison. Good summary for the game in general\n\n- Instead of any sort of interesting level design all this game has is dumb artsy concepts interspersed with copy pasted hallways and floating platforms to spend another hour platforming on. Instead of exploring an ancient demon structure like in 3 you now get to grapple onto blue "press button" prompts while impact fonts get shoved in your face and the game tries to make you go Wow!!! via some or other stupid manner of bombast that just makes the whole fighting arena look like ♥♥♥♥ (the disco is especially unreadable and offensive to the eyes)\n\n- Constantly breaks up the flow of the game by making you platform. Why so much platforming. What the ♥♥♥♥. Also constantly shoves cutscenes in your face, why is there a shot of dantes eyes every time some demons spawn. DMC usually was nice enough to reserve cutscenes for the start and end of missions, and bossfights.\n\n- For how the game trys to be a reboot they doubledown on the devilbringer, except making it far less interesting and forcing you to use it constantly in pointless sequences that are neither challenging nor fun. Using the subweapons and the special property dodges is an annoyance cause you seemingly cant set it to be a toggle, so I hope you like holding down the trigger buttons all game\n\nIt's bad and nothing but dangling keys in front of people who have no clue about the genre (all the visual clutter and the stupidly easy braindead gameplay makes it a normie favorite) and Ninja Theory is a bad developer and I hope they go bankrupt","October 24, 2015","false","8.3"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","4"

In my opinion this game is really, really good. The new Dante is pretty cool, the possibilites of combinations are awesome and the game has a good difficulty if you play VMD, DMD/ Hell and hell. If you like playing hack´n slays with style, awesomeness and lots of badass enemies I highly suggest you to get this DMC. Many people say this game isn´t "DMC" it´s a reboot BUT if you liked DMC before you will like this sequel too.\n\n- Bossfights are pretty cool\n- Some enemies are really annoying (this dumb rats, if you playthrough on Son of Sparda or higher, you will see what I mean)\n- 60 hours ++++ playtime if you try to get all achievements (depends on your skill, knowledge about the DMC mechanics, and so on)\n- Pretty cool Dante (My opinion)\n\nThis game is just underrated!\nJUST GET IT NOW!\n\nAnd yes, if you like DMC you shoulda get the DLC. It has only 6 missions but Vergil´s Downfall is pretty cool to play.\n-- Get it -- !\n\n/Edit: Got all achievements now. 51 hours needed.","July 27, 2014","true","50.9"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

The fighting is very entertaining because you are always switching weapons to keep your combo grade rising. The story was good. It had a few laughs in it. Certain enemies were weak to certain moves from specific weapons which was very neat. It had puzzle elements on many of the bosses and used floating text like in splinter cell conviction to send messages your way. The music was just there, not memorable but not bad.

But viewing it as a standalone game and without specific expectations, I'm finding it a joy to play.  I'm not the biggest fan of the popular genre of action games with pretty graphics, but this one really stands out.  The combat, though fairly categorized as "hack-and-slash," is very satisfying.  The responsiveness of the controls and the fluid feel of the combos make for a visceral experience that is more enjoyable than with any other action game I've played. Added to that gameplay element is the artfulness of the story and graphic design.  I was skeptical on this front when I bought the game since I'm not really into Goth or anything like that.  But the artistry on display here just won me over.  You really have to play the game to understand what I mean on this subject.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/recommended/220440/","astralchaos","Falem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/","1065 products in account",":::::Intro:::::\n\nDevil may Cry DMC is a reboot that explains things in a single package instead of having to play several games to understand the DMC universe. The first thing to note is the big change of  him being half angel and half demon instead of just half demon/human. I actually liked this change as it adds more depth to the parents he had and how in a sense they betrayed heaven/hell to be together.\n\n:::::Gamplay:::::\n\nThe gameplay is fluid like usual but veterans will find the combos easier to pull off and less challenging overall. New players will find this game quite hard if they are unfamiliar with the DMC universe and have not racked up enough experience with games like this genre. Mostly though I doubt people new to this series will find new dante discouraging in any way or the combat “easy” for that matter, in fact they will find it more enjoyable seeing as how its just as visually appealing as the rest of the DMC games just not as hard to pull off.\n\n:::::Level Design:::::\n\nThe level design I don’t see talked about much even when they were recommending this game and I don’t understand why. The level design is pretty great and its not really the details that sell it but rather the variety in animations and movement you see in the environments as you progress through the game. Though notably towards the end this feels less and less true but it was still solid. Note that there is indeed platforming in this game.\n\n:::::Platforming:::::\n\nThe platforming is pretty much done right seeing as you use the grapple hooks and wings to navigate throughout the levels. The platforming doesn’t get complex it rather paces itself as you gain powers and is used for boss fights also which is very welcome. Since you know I do not like demon vomit melting me.\n\n:::::Conclusion:::::\n\nThe major two positives in this game is the gameplay and level design which for most people is enough to justify buying the game even if its on sale because we are off-put about the new story and characters.","February 21, 2014","true","19.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

If This Dante was older maybe it would be a valid opinion.\n\nGameplay wise it's fast paced hack and slash action full of combos and "♥♥♥♥ing demons" to bash your way through the simple Story.(but better then the other DMC stories)\n\nGraphics The game looks good for what it is.

As this game is now on sale, I thought it's a good time to write a quick review.\n\nDante might initially get a pretty strong reaction from some fans, he's no longer a cocky badass, instead he's something of a lowlife rebel. That will sting on occasion, because the cocky badass persona had been built up over several iterations and had gained some pretty good (if cheesy) characterisation in Devil May Cry 3.\n\nBut given that this is the game after Devil May Cry 4, it's a vast improvement in almost every way. The story is ok (in that the character development is there and the plot is solid) but never shines, or at least not in the way the gameplay does. Fighting is smoother than ever, switching between weapons feels seemless, and no one weapon is ever distinctly bad for a given situation (the game may sometimes force you to fight opponents immune to certain weapons but is otherwise happy to let your style dictate how you fight)\n\nI think the best game to compare it to is Devil May Cry 3. Both have Dante at the start of his story, both have him meeting with Vergil, his brother but they both take it in different directions. The gameplay is better in DmC, the story better in Devil May Cry 3, but both still have the cheesy dialogue and incredible action sequences.\n\nIn short, if you loved the old games, you should love this one just as much. If you loved the old Dante however, it might take a while to adapt.","September 11, 2014","true","52.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It's an 'eh'. Hidden behind beautiful environments and a fine premise is a combat system which in any game would be 'fine'. Here the approach to fighting is entirely dictated by the game and not the player. Enemy has a shield? You pretty much have to use your grabber to take it off them. Enemy is a specific colour? Well I hope you like the maximum two weapons that will hurt them then, because otherwise you're ♥♥♥♥ed laddy. Also the dodge mechanic. Now in DMC4 there was a similar skill which allowed for perfect last minute dodging and that worked fine because it could cut through your combos and allow you to escape. Here if you've fired up one of your slow attacks (all your red weapons) and you see something about to hit you, there's nothing you can do about it. You're stuck swinging this big ♥♥♥♥ off axe. This may not be such a problem if the game wasn't limited to 30fps where every frame counts and you've got to hit the right one to get away. In previous DMC games we had choice. We could string together any combination of moves, weapons and style to get what we wanted. They weren't always successful against everything but then we learnt to adapt. Here you are given no such freedom. You do exactly what the game wants and if you don't you get ♥♥♥♥ on. Bosses have huge glowing weak spots to wail on, overly telegraphed attacks and the platforming sections weren't fun when DMC3 did it. There is no quick thinking to be done, because if you're not thinking at the game's speed then you'll just end up frustrated. I want to enjoy it, I really do. But I can't stand more than a (incredibly short) mission at a time.","September 24, 2014","false","13.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

What I expected from this game was a solid action, solid story, and some challenge...\nNow aside of seven difficulty levels (from which two are more less for masochists) and which are locked at start (really stupid decision from Ninja theory games) and also the game itself is filled with some unlockabale stuff. I cant and not to mention really darn great soundtrack for the game. The game is filled with action from the start it throws you in it from almost first second... levels in game are really really... I wont say wierd but colours on them and Ninja theory really played extra with idea of Dante being in "limbo" cause some levels are just.... (if some of you played Far Cry 3 and remember the level where house of that wierd doctor runs away from you... here in DmC you have that on almost every turn)\nAlso you start the game with lotsa skills to unlocks and also lots of areas in the game are litleraly unreachable until you get some weapons or some magic demon hooks and pullers (you get em both by playing game pretty soon) but basicly you sometimes have an option to play level again (you can play all levels again if you wish to) to unlock more content and so forth... all in all I havent regret on my investion especialy I wasnt even planing on getting DmC :) but thought "if both games are on 50% discount.... why the hell not"\nO well basicly game is good and worth it and damn I am writing big walls of text but o well I guess it is what I have to say about the game and game is darn good and dunno all whining around about it but in my book the game is darn good :D","February 17, 2013","true","36.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I have played the originals 1-3 as well as 4 and beaten all of them on DMD mode. With that in mind lets start this review. This game is REALLY fun. The gameplay is some of the best i have ever played in any hack and slash title; right off of the bat you recognize moves Dante uses in this game that he also used in the older titles, they really looked at the older titles when they made dantes combos. This goes for Vergil's combos as well in the Vergils Downfall DLC. The gameplay can be difficult at times on the harder levels but this is to be expected in any devil may cry game. i HIGHLY recommend a controller when playing this on PC; the mouse and keyboard controls do not suit this game. Here is a short list of pro's and con's about this game\n\nPRO's\n- Addicting Gameplay\n- Good Graphics (easy on the videocard) Running on a HD7850 ultra with everything maxed, average around 40-50 FPS\n- Amazing Swordplay\n- Good Platforming Sections\n- Good Music\n- Decent Story\n\nCON's\n- New Dante. What can i say, coming from the older games its really sad to see this new dante compared to the old dante that was laid back, funny, and awesome. It takes a bit of getting used to new dante but still, i really wish old dante was in this game.\n- New Vergil. Same thing here. Vergil was a complete badass in DMC 3 but now he isnt until after the end of the Vergil's Downfall DLC. In my opinion the Vergils Downfall DLC is much better than the original game as Vergils combos are way cooler and do more damage\n\nOverall, id give this game a 8/10 just for the fact that the new characters are terrible. I would recommend this game to any Devil May Cry fan but i would only buy it if its on sale, which i did back in 2013.","April 21, 2014","true","29.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

But DMC's beautiful graphic, unique art style, believable setting, and, which matters the most, well-designed, satisfying, but challenging combat really make the game a strong candidate for the best action game in 2013.

One of the most creative and cool looking games ever. Great story and script and great voice acting. The soundtrack is absolutely slamming heavy metal that fits right in when you are going bananas and wiping the floor with enemies left and right, but it is the type of music that is purely best heard while playing the game. I have tried listening to the soundtrack outside of the game and it oddly enough sounds like crap without the game to go with it. The controls are tight and very responsive with zero delay and quick, brutal gameplay. The only complaint I have is that like all other DMC games, this has a ♥♥♥♥ load of different moves. Like 5 or 6 different weapons and each has its own moveset, but in fairness the moves are almost the same button combinations for each weapon, so switching to weapons and doing moves can be done with lightning speed with practice. Even so though, it is still easy to get a little confused during combat and forget exactly what you need to do to avoid dmg and also kick heads in properly, but overall the game is very manageable with practice and fun. Basically it is a healthy combination of jumping and dodge rolling to avoid attacks, and power moves and grappling and aerial moves. Not all of the moves are needed either unless you are someone who wants to mix things up wildly and get a perfect score of SS on each level. I can usually get an A on every level, and often a S and sometimes a SS. The only downsides I found with the game are the last two boss fights being huge letdowns. Mundis is extremely easy then when I fought the real last boss on mission 20 (I won't spoil who it is) I could not figure out exactly how to finish him off. I had to google how to do it. The game is also short, under ten hours. I got the Virgil dlc so hopefully it has a bit more gameplay.\n\nOne of the few games I have ever played where I do not have any real complaints because it does not have any serious flaws. A lot of time and care went into this game and it shows. It is bad to the bone and you get to be a complete badass and go ape ♥♥♥♥ and mow down demons mercilessly.

I cannot defend the new characterization of gaming's beloved icon Dante (and Vergil) because he is nowhere near as likable and admirable as his original counterpart. The plot is uninteresting, and all these new concepts and premises Ninja Theory added to the DMC universe just seem trying too hard. World and environment designs, though, are surprisingly well done. The surrealism of mysterious art in which angels, demons, and humans coexist (albeit on inimical terms) in modern times is consistent and convincing that the game is confident in what it is. One complaint that has stood out to me during the game is sometimes getting to where the hidden items are requires weapons that have yet to be introduced. I found it a cheap way to entice the player to come back to certain levels after beating the campaign and having acquired all the weapons. But in the end, the core of this game lies in an adrenaline-rushing, intense combat action, and it successfully kept me entertained throughout. I'm very impressed by how Ninja Theory has achieved such a fluid combat system that is equally profound and easy to wrap one's head around, much reminiscent of the original DMC series. Some combos are as easy as pressing the same button 4 times in a succession, and at the same time there's an endless possibility to what kind of high-damaging and stylish combo sequences a skilled player could come up with to sweep through the horde of enemies.\n\nThe DLC chapters are disappointing, however. Faithful recreation of Vergil's fightstyle and familiar movesets is impressive, but the rest of the game does not tie up the base game's loose ends. Cutscenes are replaced with cheap, anime-style black-and-white videos that add nothing to already-bland narrative. Level designs are atrocious with simplified areas surrounded by ambiguous invisible walls, which effectively makes the game tediously linear. Placements of supposed "hidden" items are predictable, uncreative, and lazy to say the least. The players don't take long to realize that what they're doing is essentially going through a straight-path corridor with some background that gives them a cheap illusion of exploration, occasionally triggering enemy encounters at fixed locations. Unlike the base game, all levels' environment designs look the same and are uninspired. The disappointment in this aspect saddens me, given that base game featured an interesting art direction of which I was hoping to see more. Game's occasional attempts at changing things up with cheesy and poorly designed platforming don't help redeem its quality. Perhaps the biggest turn-off of all for me is the recycled levels toward the end. It is as though Ninja Theory ran out of time and budget after putting all their effort into Vergil's playable character model alone. It's a shame.\n\nStill, DmC is definitely a solid game and worth a try.","June 23, 2014","true","12.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I thought it would be totally destroy the name of Devil May Cry, the game I sat blankly looking at the screen for hours as a kid. But I decided to give it a chance like any true DMC fan should. I saw the menu in game and I was like "what the tell, it looks crap already". I started a new game and set it to Nephilim difficulty.\n\nI was hooked from the introduction movie. Sure Dante looks different, but the game does not disgrace the Devil May Cry franchise. The story line is great, Dante still has his comical characteristics while taking on this new bad-♥♥♥ role. The combat is fun and basically open to any combinations you can think of. The sword, Ebony and Ivory, Demon Axe, Angel Scythe and the two grab and pull weapons ensure that you clear an entire room of lesser and greater demons without even touching the floor. The boss levels are also great. They don't give you chances to win, they kick your ♥♥♥ properly from the get-go. If anything, this game has increased my love of Devil May Cry, DEFINITELY a game worth looking at.","February 24, 2013","true","15.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Devil May Cry is undoubtedly the posterchild of the hack and slash genre, and this game does everything correctly. The combat is oustanding, the boss fights are creative, and the entire game is a visual trip with its environments, cinematics and effects. Old mechanics that were sometimes frustrating like switching stances have been made more fluid. They have even made the sections between fights into very fun platforming sequences.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/funnyorifice/recommended/220440/","funnyorifice","Funny Orifice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/funnyorifice/","233 products in account","The Good The gameplay was a lot of fun.  There are multiple weapons and different combos to use that keep the game fresh.  I know that the style meter is supposed to be a big draw, and perhaps to some people it i, but I rarely paid attention to it.\nYou get most of your equipment pretty early in the game, which makes the gameplay pretty deep and fun right from the beginning.  You can get some neat combos going, and some of the enemies require different weapons to damage them.  That sounds tedious at first, but makes you plan out some battes once the game starts mixing the enemies it throws at you.\nSpeaking of enemies: I have heard some complaints about the enemies, but I thought they were done pretty well.  Some of them are pallette swaps, (which just means they are succeptible to different attacks) or just upgraded versions that take more hits, but there are some that are completely unique and can be fairly challenging when they appear with a horde of different minions.\nThe graphics are pretty good, and the stages do have some variability to them that makes them feel fresh, without getting too stale.  One of the best parts of the world, are the morphing of the world around you as it changes.  Looking down a hallway as the exit zooms away from you is a really cool effect.\nThe game will also give you hints at how to kill certain enemies, but only after you have fought the enemy a couple of times, which means you still have time to figure out your favorite way to kill a type of enemy before the game just says, "yeah, this is how we meant for you to do it."\n\nThe BadCombat - One of the main draws from the original Devil May Cry was that you used a sword AND guns.  Your starting guns in this game, the pistols Ebony and Ivory, are absolutely terrible.  I never used them unless I was fighting the one enemy in the game that was only vulnerable to bullets.\nBosses - A lot  [strike[all the boss battles[/strike] all the boss battles except  the final boss battle  are dissapointingly easy, and tedious.  Most of them go a little something like this: fight to expose boss weakness, hit boss weakness, repeat steps one and two.\n\nThe UglyCharacters - The characters in this game are so bland, so boring, so awful.  Hands down the worst part of this game.  I feel like every review touches on how Dante is terrible in this game, and it is true.  Dante is supposed to be cool, but he is just an absolute ♥♥♥♥.  Every time he said something,  all I could think was, what-a-tool.\nStory - There never was anything surprising about the story.  There were some things that just confused me, like how the real world interacts with Limbo, and vice versa (the rules seem to change depending on how the story writers wanted craete tension).\n\nFortunately  the main problems with the game don't prevent you from enjoying yourself as you are actually controlling the game.  You may just want to hate yourself during the cutscenes.  With that in mind, the game is really enjoyable, and provided me with a bit of fun.  There are a fair amount of levels, it isn't too short, it isn't too long.  And if you enjoy challenges there are quite a few higher difficulty levels that allow you to have some replayability.","July 23, 2014","true","7.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

And indeed there is a lot to like about this. The game play is mostly solid. It's fun as hell chaining combos and it has some proper old-school boss fights. I didn't have a problem with the Hot Topification of Dante, and while he can be somewhat annoying to listen to, the game as a whole finds some charm in its sense of humor.\n\nHowever, the overall experience in negated by some questionable level design and, more importantly, the worst camera I've ever experienced in a video-game. I'm serious, this is not nitpicking. It's broken to the point were it often negates the enjoyment you might be otherwise experiencing. In calmer, corridor levels it's just annoying when it gets caught in terrain. However, in platforming sections, the camera occasionally does a 180 degree turn around Dante while you're power jumping to the next platform, sending him in the opposite direction and ultimately falling to failure. This is never not frustating. The worst, however, is when you find the final boss. It's almost always impossible to employ the correct counter, because while the game is trying to telegraph what move he's about to make, the camera is showing you some lovely clouds and a few damaged buildings in the background.\n\nWithout these issues I'd have no problem recommending this as a great game.

The old Dante was a wise crack and a badass character. At first glance of the original trailer for this game, I hated it to its very core. It's not the DMC that I knew but over time I felt like they were heading in the right direction for this game and I ended up pre-ordering it. I'm a real DmC fan, no matter how awful the game might be (DMC2, anyone?).\n\nI ended up loving this game. The art style is gritty and dark (which I love), the gameplay is very smooth, the soundtrack gets you pumping (like any DMC track should) and the characters grew on me. Even the new Dante.\n\nThe only complaint I have about this game is its way too easy compared to the other DMCs. Call me a sadist but when it comes to DMC, I want to feel like ripping my hair out then that adreniline rush when I finally beat something.

In spite of the fact that it's been negatively reviewed by people who simply don't like the "direction they took the main character," the game itself is a dream. The animations and combat are perfectly designed to the points that, if you are a "skill gamer" you'll be playing the same levels over and over, pushing for more and more stylish and perfect combos. Not only do you have a huge number of moves available to you, but they all look amazing, and are easy to pull off. The trick isn't complicated input; it's doing the right thing at the right time. And "right thing" refers to one of ~20 or so of the moves in your arsenal, and "right time" refers to a single digit number of animation frames.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/undeadgamer95/recommended/220440/","undeadgamer95","Sora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/undeadgamer95/","242 products in account","First off, Dante is not gone. He is not that far off from the original once you finish the game. That being said, most people are turned away from the game as it is not the Dante nor the Universe we've come to know and love. But you have to understand that this game is acutally a reboot for Capcom. And in my opinion, Ninja Theory did a marvelous job with this game.\n\n(Sectioned these off, just look at first sentence for categories. TLDR at the bottom.)\n\nFirst off, the universe. Before, in previous Devil May Cry installments, Humans and Demons lived on one plane. In this game, not so much. Here, Demons and Humans are separeted by "Limbo". A plane really close to that of the human world. In this universe, humans, demons, anything and anyone can be pulled into Limbo, and the only way to get out is to kill the demon that dragged you into Limbo. In this universe, you have a more stylized and modern intrepertation of demons. They control the world with debt, keeping them docile with soft drinks called Virility, and monitor them from Limbo with CTV Surveilance systems in the real world. I think this is a pretty interesting take on our modern day and might actually be conveying a message.\n\nAs for the visual aspects of the game, I have to say it's quite gorgeous. The stylistic combos that Dante can pull off between his human, demon, and angelic form are quite a sight to see. Animations are much more realistic as they represent actual human movements. What I mean by this is that they transition quite nicely. The point system now shows you what you are getting your points from, how much you're getting from them, and what special actions you've performed that netted you those points such as perfect evades and environmental attacks. All the while, the game is running extremely well. I play on a Laptop, which really isn't the greatest for gaming, but boy. I ran this game on Ultra settings, 60Hz refresh rate with HD texture and HD Anti-Aliasing. 60FPS the whole time. Cutscenes are extremely well done, voice acting is top notch, and make the game pretty believable. I can only recall maybe 1 or 2 events where the voice acting took me out of the game.\n\nDifficulty? Not much here until you hit "Dante must Die", "Heaven and Hell", and "Hell and Hell" modes. Hell and Hell can give you a real challenge comparing to that of Dark Souls or Monster Hunter. See, in this mode, if you're not familiar with previous games is a challenging difficulty level where Dante dies in one hit, while his enemies have full health. This right here, this, is the hardest you're going to be able to play this game. Seriously, the difficulty level in this game is a joke, I beat the game on Standard difficulty dying only once and managing an S or SS rank at the end of the mission. As long as you do what the game tells you to do (Angelic weapons against blue enemies, and Demonic weapons on red enemies) you'll be fine. Took me about 9-10 hours to beat the main DmC mode on that difficulty alone. But I kind of want to go back and finish the game on all dificulties in order to get all the achievements and perfect my combos. That being said, this game is a breeze.\n\nStory wise, like I said earlier, this game has an interesting take on today's society and the demons that walk among us as your everyday Joe. I do have to say, Character Development is not a big thing in this game. When there is some, it's kind of out of nowhere and really bland. One of the most interesting characters in my opinion is Kat, but you don't really get enough of her to justify her as an interesting character all that much. Though I do have to say I was EXTREMELY impressed with what Ninja Theory and Capcom did at the end. They set this game up so well for a sequel and in my opinion, stayed true to DmC. I was absolutely speechless, no doubt do you have to play this game for that. With that ending, you know that they also listened to their fans. Hell, it may seem like they didn't at first glance, but they did. Secretly. They did a very good job calming the populus somewhat with Dante's original redesign. Long story short, the story is entirely riding on the ending. It's pretty generic throughout most of the game and the end just leaves you breathless.\n\nMusic is okay, not really much to say here. Basically what you would expect Dante to be listening to while murdering demons. Only complaint is that the music sometimes doesn't stop when all enemies are killed leaving you to think that there are still more when there actually isn't when the music is NORMALLy supposed to fade away after you get them all. But that's not the only thing. Sometimes it doesn't even fade. It just stops. Abrubtly, just like that and you're just kind of taken back a bit. Nothing too major though.\n\nReplayability? Hell yes. You'll see collectibles off in the distance far too many times throughout your playthrough wondering how to get there. Simple answer? You can't. You have to gain access to certain abilites and then revisit those levels to reach those collectibles for a higher completion percentage and the mission score screen. Also necessary if you're hunting for those achievements.\n\nDLC, I'd say skip out on it. It's not that good. By the name of the DLC you can tell you play as Vergil and I'll tell you, while he seems cool, you just feel extremely limited with him. After getting SSS ranks in combat with Dante, barely being able to scrape a B rank with Vergil just hurts. You can combo much better with him as your progress, but you don't even get all of your abilities until you finish the sodding DLC. That's right. Your reward for beating the DLC, is an ability that would have helped you clear the DLC. Their choice for this was obvious if you play through it, but it's best to just either pick this up while on sale or just skip it entirely. Another gripe of mine with this is that the cutscenes, they appear to be concept art, Just a slideshow or a quick demo of what the cutscenes should have looked like/portrayed if they were actually animated. Not only that, they switch from concept art into ACTUAL animation out of nowhere towards the end of the cutscence. REALLY takes you out of the experience.\n\nTL;DR: Game stays true to DmC history, just with a few of it's own twists taking place in a more modern universe that resembles our own. It may not look like it at first glance, but it is actually pretty spectacular with what they did with the ending. Gameplay is satisfying, beautiful, smooth as all hell, but extrememly easy unless you pick one of the higher difficulties like "Hell and Hell" which you have to unlock by beating the game several times. Great replayability requiring you to return to previous missions with abilities obtained in later chapters to get all collectibles. Music is okay though music sometimes doesn't stop as fast as it needs to, or ends too abruptly after fights. Story wise, kind of generic, but my god, like I already said, the ending... Left me as giddy as a schoolgirl. As for the DLC, either skip out on it or pick it up while on sale because it's not that good. If I HAD to give it a score, 9.5/10","January 3, 2014","true","14.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jorbyte/recommended/220440/","jorbyte","Jake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jorbyte/","308 products in account","I have never played a Devil May Cry game, and from what I understand a lot of DmC fans were deeply disappointed in this reboot. The criticisms they have of it seem fair - especially about the overly edgy protagonist Dante and his edgy mcedgyton brother Vergil.\n\nWhile Dante certainly wasn't a very fun character (I was sort of hoping he'd become funnier as the game progressed) he's not completely terrible. I never found myself cringing at his emo edgyness, and some of the lines he had were decently funny. A lot of jokes fall flat because they consist mainly of variations on "♥♥♥♥ you." The story isn't amazing, typical evil dude running the world and you have to take him out. I do think it does a good job of setting up future game stories without a ridiculously stupid cliffhanger or anything. It reveals something, resolves it temporarily, and sort of lets it be.\n\nThe gameplay is where I had quite a bit of fun. The action starts out reeeeaaallllyy simplistic, but once you get the scythe it all sort of starts to make sense. The fun comes in mixing and matching the various weapons together for good combos. Each creature has a weakness for you to exploit, and some are more obvious than others. For example there were these ninja dudes who I had NO idea, until the last level of the game, were incapable of blocking the axe thingy. I had completely switched to the fists and thought the axe was useless until I realized that. Of course you can't just use the axe on them though because it's slow, first you have to catch them off guard with something else. The same thing applies to a lot of the battles - you find new combinations as you play and it continues like that until the very end. Hell, in the very final boss fight I discovered a new way to use a weapon I thought I had figured out.\n\nOne thing about the combat that sort of fell flat was the enemies which REQUIRED you to use either an Angel or Demon weapon. I can see how that introduces challenge in fights where there's more than one enemy but it still felt extremely cheap. There'd be a red enemy that I can only use the fists or axe on, so I would just spam one of those until it was dead. No fun or strategy in it, just a huge annoyance. It became especially annoying when certain enemies would simply become ghosts if you weren't holding down the left or right trigger. Really?\n\nThat said I enjoyed the combat all the way through, and the boss fights were decent as well. I thought the next-to-last boss was a bit stupid because he took up so much of the screen that dodging all of his attacks were nearly impossible, so you just had to get lucky. The raptor news boss fight was the best though - it was funny and well designed. It was by far the most creative fight in the game.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game, especially if it's on sale. It's a solid game with some good design. If you can forgive the edgyness, generic story, and heavy use of dubstep.","January 6, 2014","true","15.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I know that the style meter is supposed to be a big draw, and perhaps to some people it i, but I rarely paid attention to it.\nYou get most of your equipment pretty early in the game, which makes the gameplay pretty deep and fun right from the beginning.  You can get some neat combos going, and some of the enemies require different weapons to damage them.  That sounds tedious at first, but makes you plan out some battes once the game starts mixing the enemies it throws at you.\nSpeaking of enemies: I have heard some complaints about the enemies, but I thought they were done pretty well.  Some of them are pallette swaps, (which just means they are succeptible to different attacks) or just upgraded versions that take more hits, but there are some that are completely unique and can be fairly challenging when they appear with a horde of different minions.\nThe graphics are pretty good, and the stages do have some variability to them that makes them feel fresh, without getting too stale.  One of the best parts of the world, are the morphing of the world around you as it changes.  Looking down a hallway as the exit zooms away from you is a really cool effect.\nThe game will also give you hints at how to kill certain enemies, but only after you have fought the enemy a couple of times, which means you still have time to figure out your favorite way to kill a type of enemy before the game just says, "yeah, this is how we meant for you to do it."\n\nThe BadCombat - One of the main draws from the original Devil May Cry was that you used a sword AND guns.  Your starting guns in this game, the pistols Ebony and Ivory, are absolutely terrible.  I never used them unless I was fighting the one enemy in the game that was only vulnerable to bullets.\nBosses - A lot  [strike[all the boss battles[/strike] all the boss battles except  the final boss battle  are dissapointingly easy, and tedious.  Most of them go a little something like this: fight to expose boss weakness, hit boss weakness, repeat steps one and two.\n\nThe UglyCharacters - The characters in this game are so bland, so boring, so awful.  Hands down the worst part of this game.  I feel like every review touches on how Dante is terrible in this game, and it is true.  Dante is supposed to be cool, but he is just an absolute ♥♥♥♥.  Every time he said something,  all I could think was, what-a-tool.\nStory - There never was anything surprising about the story.  There were some things that just confused me, like how the real world interacts with Limbo, and vice versa (the rules seem to change depending on how the story writers wanted craete tension).\n\nFortunately  the main problems with the game don't prevent you from enjoying yourself as you are actually controlling the game.  You may just want to hate yourself during the cutscenes.  With that in mind, the game is really enjoyable, and provided me with a bit of fun.  There are a fair amount of levels, it isn't too short, it isn't too long.  And if you enjoy challenges there are quite a few higher difficulty levels that allow you to have some replayability.","July 23, 2014","true","7.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

The game isn't bad per say but I do not enjoy it because I could care less how many points I earn per level.  Maybe this is the game other people wanted but I learned a painful lesson not to listen so much to what other gamers say.  The melee action is just to unrealistic it feels fake it's too over the top not to mention the guns are similar fake in an under powered way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltydaveiv/recommended/220440/","saltydaveiv","david / BNET: OceansAbove#1601","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltydaveiv/","338 products in account","Short and Detailed review. Don't vote if you don't bother to read.\nPROS: Jawdropping level design and audio-visual experience.\nReworked but still great combat with some creative enemies.\nFantastic narrative and rather simple but very enjoyable plot with great character progression and drama (especially if you know what these rebooted versions of the characters are supposed to be like).\nSurprisingly intellectual social-criticism which is the last thing I have expected.\nOnline leaderboards for everything as a welcome addition for professional DMC players, supporting the well known series of higher than higher than high difficulty levels.\nHigh replay value, and longer playtime than any other DMCs, added tiny things that help the professionals keep track of their progress.\nCONS: You really have to force yourself through tolerating Dante's personality early on.\nAlternative costumes, traditionally unlocked by succes on higher difficulties are cut out paid DLC (some remain free).\nPC version feels abandoned by devs. Context: it is a freaking good PC version, have no doubt. Technically even far superior and better optimized than it's console counterparts. It just pisses me off that despite paying for Vergil's Downfall DLC, and basicly every DLC for full price just because well, fanatism, the later relased nextgen version gets additional content such as a different, new Bloody Palace mode for Vergil, turbo mode and alternative controls by getting the focus system added back. Hell I'd even pay for the Definite Edition full price, as stupid as this is, to have those on PC. Sadly, we don't.\nThere are no cool weapon acquisition cutscenes.\nVergil's hat. What were they thinking?\nDetailed review:\nFirst of all: before it's relase, I really hated DmC. It directly spits on everything that defined the franchise, it's characters and design and goes straight to the opposite direction, in a way maybe 10 year olds think it is cool. Continous needless swearing and primitive talk, antisocial irritating skinny toughguy behaviour from the main character (who -by accident for sure- just happend to look exactly the same as the dev company's boss until the early fan outrage that thankfully forced changes before relase) disgusting things, replaced all the sort-of japanese high fantasy / gothic looks and the classy, elegant characters - and some of the cutscenes directly mock players like "yeah you liked the old one? **** you then, this is better!", among others the white hair scene early on.\n\nDespite all the hate I had towards DmC before it's relase, I've seen a really good trailer for it and decided to give it a chance - and I did not regret it. Oh boy, quite the opposite. Dante's new personality sometimes still makes me want to let him die on every corner, but looking at the greater picture the having his early personality like.. what it is, early on is a genius. Not because I like any of it, but because it adds marvelously executed, meaningful character progression to the story. It makes the lead character hated by the play, and by the end achieves the same character to be liked by the same player. And that's a big thing. Without spoilers, you cannot compare to what Dante becomes by the end of the story to what he used to be at the start of it. And there are a lot tiny details hidden though the plot that slowly changes him to a very likeable character who stands up for the weak he literally "doesn't give a **** about" before.\n\nThe stage design is jawdropping. The oversatured colors really work well in limbo as a contrast to reality's empty greyness which we also live in. The on the fly transforming levels and the "They Live" movielike hidden messages or I could even say direct references spread out through the whole city combines to a never before and I risk to say it nowhere else to be seen experience. Overall it is unique visual experience with hardly any competitor because simply there is nothing like it, especially looking at triple A relases (for the picky ones, yes, as a matter of fact it's possible I overlooked some nobodyheardofit indie title that is similar). The visuals are supported with adrenaline pumping heartbeat accelerating aggrotech music by Combichrist and drum n' base / dubstep / breakbeat / whatever they are NOISIA. First is responsible for painting a badass audio layer on the chaos of limbo during combat and certain cutscenes (with even the song's titles adding thoughts and tiny details to story, such as "Empty" for the last mission), second has done many electronic background music for stages that sometimes even change and transform matching the music's tempo. Just like other aspects of the game, I also didn't really like it before relase but quicky grew to be one of my favourite.\n\nThe gameplay has gone through significant changes aswell compared to the original series. Most of Dante's moves still remain (altho' named slightly differently and it kind of gives away a pathetic feeling how the devs really want to send a message about "ours is better!" to the fans of the original series. Like million stab became trillion stab, and pretty much everywhere they just want to say "bigger" than the source material they worked from). Controls are really different because  there is no focus system and it rarely but can be problematic when you try to focus some airborne enemies with ground enemies below them, but for those who aren't looking forward to play the extreme on top of extreme difficulty levels, just ignore what I said, it really won't matter. Combat design shifted from difficult executions and frame-cancelling to smarter positioning and isolating, making the tougher fights actually tactical and control based far more than hightech player execution lockdown damage nuking. The gameplay is still as fast as before, or even faster, only the controls required to play it fast got a lower requirement which makes this entry of the series a very user friendly one, unlike the others before, and at the same time still keeps the challanging and hightech execution aspect for those who look for it, on higher difficulties.\n\nAs a huge fan of the original DMC, as I said I really hated DmC at first. But it succeeded in exceeding my expectations continously over and over on every aspect that defines a game (gameplay, story and it's narrative on it's own, actually meaningful character drama and relationships, audiovisual experience). Yes, it is significantly different than it's predecessors. Yes, characters are nothing like the old ones, one of Vergil's moves somewhere in the middle of the story still bothers me, and I still cannot help but hate D--ch-bag Dante early on in the story. But give it a thought after you finished the game and look back, and you'll see the big picture I see, and it makes the game a damn well done masterpiece, on top of a very enjoyable journey as the first playthrough.\n\nAnd after DMC3SE, a dream came true that I could live to see Dante and Vergil work together as brothers through an entire game.","November 1, 2015","true","64.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And frankly it is a bit hard for my tastes, but I am not a big action game guy. Sometimes it just seems like it takes a million hits to down some of these guys. I'm told that you need more combos, but with as much text as this game puts on screen it doesn't give you the best damage info. Also some of the combos just don't always seem to work. Again, might be that I am not used to the genre, but I sit there in training and do exactly what it says and if the thing involves any pauses it just doesn't work. Any way, the design is pretty cool. The sense of humor gets old fast. The bosses look great, but all the level combat gets majorly tedious. A lot of the game is based on redoing things too which is definitely not the best things in the world when the combat is already tedious. On balance, worth the time, but only at a cheap price.","January 7, 2014","true","8.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chriq/recommended/220440/","chriq","YOUNG COCONUT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chriq/","295 products in account","I'm gonna start off by saying this was one of the best DMC games so far, and YES i've played all but 2 (no loss there). This game is so well crafted, i dont think i can really find a legitimate flaw in it or anything that was half ♥♥♥♥♥. There are three things that hit me hard with this game:\n\nVisuals:\nLet me go ahead and say that when i saw the original trailer for this game, i was as turned off as any of the other DMC bashers. I didnt like the direction they took with the character because Dante of old was such a lovable guy and his aesthetic had been well established. Now that i've played it, the only thing thats really that much different about him is the short hair and different jacket. SPOILERS... his hair becomes white over the course of the game anyway, and they manage to tie it into the story. Aside from that, every character and demon is not only believably realistic, but the things that aren't rooted in realism feel very creative and fresh. The environments in this game are STUNNING and kept me stopping to look at them constantly during my playthrough. Ninja Theory knows how to craft a beautiful world.\n\nGameplay:\nNot much to say here because they essentially took what made the old games great and fine tuned it a little more. The gameplay is purely DMC, there should be no complaints. They even managed to get some fun platforming sections in the game that dont get in the way of the pacing of the game.\n\nStory:\nDante's personality in this game wasn't as wacky and goofball this time around, and I am not exactly sure that it's a bad thing. Don't get me wrong, he had loads of one-liners that scratched that itch, but it definitely wasn't as comical as previous games. They toned it down just a bit so that they could tell a more compelling story... and they definitely managed that. This has to be, by far, the best DMC narrative so-far. Especially after DMC4, which was a yawn fest until Dante showed up to crack some jokes. This game's story is a bit on the EDGY side, but it's totally relevant to todays hot topics and it actually makes sense when you give it a chance. The characters feel real but interesting, where as in previous games there were always characters that just felt like flat cartoon personalities.\n\nI'm really hoping that there is a sequel in the mix and that the visual backlash didn't ruin it for Ninja Theory, this series is in capable hands once again and I can't wait for the next one to come out. I highly reccomend this game for DMC newcomers and veterans. Give it a chance and you wont regret it.\n\n10/10","July 4, 2014","true","16.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The graphical difference isn't that noticeable, although the PC version runs in 1080P and does look better than console, it's not a "holy crap!" jump in quality. The real reason to get this again on PC is the fact that it runs 60FPS vs. 30 on the console releases.\n\nSimply put, the game is smoother than a baby's ♥♥♥ now. The game feels much better to play and this is the only version I will play again. DmC on PC is the definitive version. My only gripe is that this, and other Capcom  games on Steam, are way over priced. If they go on sale, jump on it. I got this during the summer sale along with the DLC for peanuts. I would NOT pay full price for this game if you already own it.

The storyline is a bit confusing be cause the first cutscene when you start a play through would make more sense to be a mid-game cut scene.  As such, the first 4 DMC games (simply title Devil May cry 1-4) should be played before this one. That said, it is a re-boot done well.  The story feels even more captivating than the original, the character dialogue is some of the best writing i've seen since Borderlands 2, the difficulty curve Is on the opposite end of FFIIIX (meaning that the parts that seem hard are hard because of skill, not some cheap boss fight where tactics are necesarry).  There are a few minor things that I notice for one, all the game play takes place in the alternate demension of limbo, where demons are visible. Granted there are angelic weapons and demonic weapons that revolutionize the god of war esque hit-something-till-it-dies gameplay.  At $50 its a steep asking price, but well worth the cost.  If you dont like the new dante's appearance, if you get the DLC you can use the classic dante's. Capcom definitly made up for their past mistake of making DMC 1-4 have a strange, hard-to-follow chronology(DMC1 was the 2nd or 3rd chronologically, and DMC3 was the first). Admittedly, The limbo dimension DOES explain how the demons control the humans with out the humans knowing any thing.  There are some minor problems with some mid-game mechanics, but im not going to explain them here as to not spoil too much of the game.  I give it a 10/10.","February 13, 2014","true","12.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I got into the series some years ago after playing the third game. Comments by DMC purists sparked my interest in this... and they don't know on what they're missing out.\n\nI think the story is great, there's some character development, the soundtrack is awesome and the gameplay is very satisfying. I unlocked all 48 main achievements in a three-week span (about 60 hours playing and I have yet to buy the Vergil DLC) and I'm still not tired of playing it. The game is definitely lengthy and it does have replay value. Bloody Palace mode is really fun. While the game's difficulty has been toned down to appeal to less skilled players, it's still DMC to the core, and the higher difficulty levels shouldn't disappoint.\n\nOn the other hand, almost all bosses are uninspired. Only the first and the last ones felt like true bosses. They're way too static (apart from the aforementioned ones) and humanized. I was hoping for more beast-like ones. All guns are useless and a couple weapons didn't satisfy my inner demon slayer, like Aquila.

Everything in this game is awesome, platforming is much better than in the previous DMC episodes, it's still action packed, storyline is good... the only thing that bothered me a bit *spoiler alert* is the Hell and Heaven monsters, as you can't kill those monsters without the appropriate weapon, so you have to kill that minion with exactly that weapon, which isn't that much of a problem as they are pretty rare.\nAll in all, I really recommend this game.

By and large they are handled well, and a lot of the familiar signature aspects that the franchise is known for are still here as well.\n\nFor example, orbs and the time statues for "shopping" are present here. Dante still has Ebony and Ivory and they still get unlimited ammo. Signature abilities like Stinger make their return with a new control schemata. Devil trigger is of course also present, though it works in a slightly different way than in most of the past entries, it nonetheless manages to impress just as it always has.\n\nWhile I did have some initial complaints about Dante's voice acting (the lines seemed really flat early on in the game) once you give it some more time it fleshes itself out better, and that also gives you a chance to get adjusted to the new Dante as well.\n\nAnd it IS an adjustment. Gone is the super confident whimsical and snarky don't-take-life-too-seriously Dante of yore, for the most part. This new Dante is younger, more apathetic and less enthusiastic, but to an extent this new attitude is plot related as well, and for what it's worth I think it is a convincing way to show character growth and progression.\n\nGradually as Dante begins to open his eyes to the situation around him through the plot events, he starts becoming more empathetic, and discovers his own true nature in the process.\n\nI won't spoil the details too much, but it was good to see his character maturing over the course of the game. And while I do feel like he never reached the same height on the badass meter that classic Dante manages to capture, by the time all is said and done it's clear to see he's squarely on his way to becoming more like his platinum haired alter ego.\n\nTake away from this what you will, but if you're willing to brave the initial storm and wait for the seas to calm, as far as the new Dante goes, you'll see this is another great entry in the DMC series. It takes a bit to get used to the changes, but change can be good sometimes.","November 26, 2013","true","10.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Gone are the stupid resident evil style static cameras, gone is the need to lock-on to foes in order to effectively track them. Gone are the derptastic controls that made this franchise a nightmare to newcomers. Now you can actually CONTROL the camera, dish out the pain in copious amounts, and feel good doing so! So what if the new Dante is a derf at first? This game gets a few things wrong, but gets a lot of things right. Even though DMC5 will feature classic Dante, I certainly hope Capcom takes some notes from DmC, as this is how you do that genre properly; Easy to learn, difficult to master.\n\nI also expect classic Dante to have a retort for new Dante's 'white hair' wisecrack... because Dante would totally bash other versions of himself.

On one hand, veterans of the DMC franchise are going to look down on it for it's simpler combat that doesn't offer fine control or complex, rewarding mechanics of games such as DMC 3 or DMC 4.  It is a significantly easier game and there is a lot less put into the fighting mechanics of the game itself.\n\nOn the other hand, DmC: Devil May Cry offers is a refined experience that I think most people will enjoy!  Despite it's flaws when held up to it's predicesors,  DmC offers smooth combat and top-notch presentation.  The major criticism I'd offer are that the boss fights are boring, QTE-ridden, forgettable snore-fests.\n\nIt's definitely not a bad game and as long as you are willing to remove expectations for DMC 5 from this title and accept it for what it is, it's a fine game by itself.","June 22, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

With a stronger focus on quality storytelling than prior titles, DmC: Devil May Cry provides a much more coherent, "all growed up" retelling of Dante's origin.  Accompanying this excellent narrative is an incredibly solid artistic style.  The environments, special effects and monster design are all quite fresh.  Creatures you encounter are instantly recognizable; there will be no confusing one demon for another.  The soundtrack also remains superb, as one would expect from this series.  Granted, it's a slightly different style of soundtrack, featuring more electronica (of the industrial variety) and less heavy metal-inspired tracks.\n\nNow for the critiques...\n\nDmC features an "angel" and "demon" weapon system.  At first blush, this seems like a perfectly reasonable tweak/addition to the game.  First impressions would lead you to believe that it livens up combos and adds more variety to the game.  This is, however, only half true.  The angel/demon weapon system can, in some cases, leave you more limited in your combo choices.  When a designated angel/demon enemy type is struck by anything other than a matching weapon, the weapon bounces off harmlessly, (which also leaves Dante open and vulnerable for a moment) ending any combo chain you may be in the middle of.\nThrow just one of these enemies into a mix of other types, and you are forced to either A.) Remove that enemy from the group with a pull (which, granted, the game gives you the tools for) or B.) Kill the whole group with a matching weapon type.\nOver all, this isn't a huge deal, and you won't often be bothered by it.  There are criticisms to be made about this system, however, so you might find yourself occasionally irritated by the situations you're put into.\n\nThe Vergil's Downfall DLC is also fairly disappointing.  Vergil's combo list is, generally speaking, much smaller and more sparsely populated with techniques than his brother Dante's.  This leaves Vergil's fights feeling a bit stale and repetitive until every option for his combat is unlocked (and even then, it's less in-depth than Dante's is).\nThe cutscenes of Vergil's downfall also features a completely different visual style.  In Vergil's Downfall, the cutscenes are comprised of minimalistic animations, as opposed to the motion-captured CGI of the main game.  While not necessarily inferior, it can be visually jarring when one goes from the main game straight into the DLC.\n\nAnyway, that about wraps it up.  This is a solid game, with little to actually complain about once the nostalgia glasses come off.  Fans of the original DMC (myself included) and its subsequent sequels should feel right at home here, assuming they are capable of being objective and unbiased.","December 24, 2013","true","49.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And frankly it is a bit hard for my tastes, but I am not a big action game guy. Sometimes it just seems like it takes a million hits to down some of these guys. I'm told that you need more combos, but with as much text as this game puts on screen it doesn't give you the best damage info. Also some of the combos just don't always seem to work. Again, might be that I am not used to the genre, but I sit there in training and do exactly what it says and if the thing involves any pauses it just doesn't work. Any way, the design is pretty cool. The sense of humor gets old fast. The bosses look great, but all the level combat gets majorly tedious. A lot of the game is based on redoing things too which is definitely not the best things in the world when the combat is already tedious.

Luckily, the people at Ninja Theory did more than simply pay due homage to a venerable gaming series; they infused it with a fresh look at the characters, the world they reside in, and the gameplay that is the series staple.\n\nWhile die-hard Devil May Cry fans may cringe at the idea of a rebooted story, it does little in the way of producing disappointment. Dante is crass and womanizing, but manages to get away with being a rebel due to his unique ancestry. After several hours into the game his bad-boy personality is peeled away to reveal a fractured individual that mirrors the jagged intersections of limbo that crash into his world.\n\nGameplay-wise, DmC offers an intuitive "quick-switch" weapon system that lets you change between several different kinds of weapons in mere seconds for some truly awe-inspiring combos from dedicated players. Throw in a pumping soundtrack and you have a pulse-pounding game that make the hours slip away as though they were mere seconds.","January 26, 2014","true","13.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The presentation is polished to a mirror sheen and often dazzles with twisted creativity (a certain boss fight and the entirety of Lilith's nightclub immediately come to mind).\n\nYes the origins of the main characters have been significantly altered, and yes the story occasionally beats you over the head with clumsy edginess to drive the "message" home.  However, the new Dante isn't so different from the old, the one-liners are still cheesy as hell and the cutscenes are still ridiculously over the top.

In this retelling of Dante's origin story, a lot of the combat elements of it's predecessors has been brought here and refined to near perfection, something Ninja Theory is very good at. However the art style and the personality of the protagonist, Dante has been changed dramatically. He is less a facetious, care free, badass demon hunter from DMC 1, 2 and 4 and more the irresponsible punk with demon powers from 3, but somehow more annoying and crass. There is a point early in the game (which I personally do NOT appreciate) where Dante wanders through a circus or fair and through circumstances a wig very similar from the hairstyle and colour the old Dante wore lands on his hair, and he throws it off in disgust.\n\nOverall, I would give this an 8/10. It IS a great game, however some of the direct insults thrown at the older games, intentional or not are off putting to me as a fan of the series.","February 19, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dedemaru/recommended/220440/","Dedemaru","Dedemaru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dedemaru/","352 products in account","Capcom and Dante got a lot of crap for this one. A superfluous decision to reboot a franchise that wasn't in need of rebooting and a grittier, almost 'emo' new look turned a lot of fans off. On top of that, many see Ninja Theory as a rookie developer that still haven't really hit their stride. Games like Heavenly Sword and Enslaved: Odyssey to the West were both great efforts that slightly missed their mark. I'm glad to say that DmC their best work yet. While I have no qualms over the new art direction, I even enjoy it, I can understand where most fans are coming from. The whole 'emo' look is frowned upon (I, personally, don't think he looks all too emo) and Capcom wanted to reboot the series with a more modern, gritty, western feel. They achieved that. The aesthetics are beautiful in this game, down to the UI and HUD. The style retains a little bit of old Devil May Cry while dabbling in a newer, sleeker look. As for story, it's nothing special. Where Enslaved, I feel, had a great story, DmC takes a step back for Ninja Theory. However, this doesn't detract much from the game. While I can spend time talking about how the game looks and describing why it's story is lackluster, I wouldn't be doing a review of this game justice. The fact of the matter is this game is pure, unbridled action fun. This new entry in the series clearly simplifies the DmC combat/combo system. DMC veterans may not enjoy the main-streaming of the combat. However, anyone who wants to play an explosive action game and feel like a total badass will enjoy this title. The combat, while still holding true to a steep difficulty curve and high skill ceiling, is exhilarating. When you grasp the basics of weapon switching mid combo and using the pull/grab feature this will be some of the most fluid, smooth and rewarding combat you've ever enjoyed. No word epitomizes the combat system better than 'butta' (as in 'smooth as butter'). The combat system definitely lends to the games replay-ability. Die hards will want to work for a better final score on chapters or work to unlock all aspects of the system by unlocking new skills for Dante's weapons. Masochists will get a kick out of the several difficulty levels above the traditional normal mode. This is something the Devil May Cry series has always prided itself on and it hasn't disappeared. Collectors will want to go through each level and play every clever and increasingly difficult secret mission or collect the many Lost Souls scattered throughout the game. A combination of all of those archetypes will find hours of enjoyment in collecting concept art from defeating large amounts of each enemy type and beating the game on the highest difficulty setting. I could truly put this game in the running for Game of the Year 2013. While the game stands mostly on it's combat system, there is definitely more there be enjoyed. For anyone who has bored of Sparda's favorite son, the Vergil's Downfall DLC is also a worthy investment. Playing as Vergil is almost a completely different experience. They do the character justice and it feels fantastic. Anyone who enjoys a good hack n' slash or action game, and anyone who is holding back because of the new decor, take the time and give this game a chance.","November 25, 2013","true","20.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There have been a lot of arguments about this reboot. I've played all of the games (cept for 2) and enjoyed them. However i'm going to compare this one to the previous one and I can only say that they are back on the right track again.\nThe 4th game was suffering from a very, in my opinion, unlikeable character  you had to play with half of the game. The other half of the game was playing as Dante, who had to backtrack through the same levels. Not a lot of fun for me there. Number 5 is a new start with a restyled Dante, gameplay wise it's incredibly solid, plenty of weapons, firearms to make combo's with. However, getting SSS ratings are rather easy to obtain, using the same move with certain weapons on bosses will give you a lot of points. A little dissapointing.\n\nThey also added some more platforming elements, didn't bother me. The storyline amuses, the city Dante lives in is ruled by Mundus, a demon overlord (Also a restyled version of the very first badguy in the first DMC). The whole city and the plot has some very entertaining satire to it; The masses are controlled by television, energy drinks and nightclubs filled with narcisstic demons. And Dante is going to wipe the floor with all of those things.\n\nThere are some other characters, like Dante's brother Vergil and a girl called Kat. Kat is rather forgetable, even if she is very prominent and is the damsel in distress. I couldn't really care for her. As for Vergil, if you have any knowledge about the DMC games you know how things are going down between him and Dante.\n\nSpeaking of which, I also played the DLC Vergil's Downfall, that one is very subpar compared to the maingame; horrible animations, elements from the plot in the maingame are twisted around, the rating system is different and the gameplay has some faults in it.\n\nMy rating would be:\nDMC 8.5/10\nVergil's Downfall DLC 5/10\n\n","November 21, 2013","true","19.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_just1n/recommended/220440/","_just1n","Justin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_just1n/","220 products in account","DmC\n\nThe Look - The game's visuals are all top notch. The developers were clearly able to put a lot of time and effort into the environments and character designs. Dante and his cohorts all have a unique look and interesting attire. The game received some flack during its reveal for ditching the classic white-haired Dante but I think that there is a strong, fun, and unique visual style that permeates the experience. You will see some recycled enemy designs but there are enough minor differences between types that I never felt bored by their appearance. The main visual treat is the environment, which has a habit of transforming as you move through it. Walls rise and fall and floors will turn into stairs, pits, and stepping stones, as familiar environments often get twisted into a more hellish version of their former selves.\n\nThe Sound - No real issues with the audio quality. That said, the music tracks might not be for everyone. I don't have prior experience but I felt that the musical stylings of Combichrist had the potential to be somewhat polarizing. If you don't like heavy metal or death metal (or precious metals?) you might not be a fan of the audio tracks. However, I'm not a huge fan of the genre but I was never really put off by it so I think most people will be fine here. Great use of sound effects with some nice visceral slices, slams, and crunches during combat. Additionally, the voice acting, which you'll be exposed to frequently, is very strong on all fronts.\n\nThe Gameplay - Despite some claims of oversimplification, I think this game is tons of fun to play. It follows the basic 3rd person action trends with all of the combos, dodges, and power moves that you'd expect. What makes DmC stand out a bit is the variety of weapons and the diversity of each. Heavy, Medium, Light, and Ranged weapons are all on display and all offer something fun and new when unlocked. The game's grading system (a genre staple) is also a fun way to compete against others and yourself while trying to unlock things like concept art and new costumes. There are a number of hidden collectibes that can be found in the game, but these often veer into the dangerous territory of tedium when you try to seek them all out. Also, despite the fast and fun combat, there are some levels that feel overly long or overly short so don't expect that each new chapter will take the same amount of time as the last one.\n\nThe Story - DmC's story is a simple but fun affair. You are Dante, half-angel/half-demon, and you're out for revenge on the demon who orphaned you and is currently trying to take over the world. There are some fun twists and turns along the way but nothing jaw dropping or genre defining. While Dante's brash attitude may seem a bit obnoxious, the character grew on me and by the end of the game I found myself eagerly awaiting his next quip or shocking turn of phrase. The narrative has just enough momentum to keep you interested in learning more about Dante's past and to see what steps he'll take to get his revenge. You'll never be moved to tears, but you'll probably get a few laughs out of this yarn.\n\nOther Thoughts - There's not a lot to say here. This is not a game of great thematic depth or complexity. The combat, on the other hand, has both in spades. I think this is a great first chapter in what will hopefully become a new series of games. Oftentimes, 3rd person action games will lose their footing somewhere. The story may be obtuse or boring, the combos may be too tough to pull off, the enemies might be too easy or difficult, etc. DmC does a great job of walking this line and not overstaying its welcome.\n\nScore - 4/5 (A solid game. Genre fans should love it, while others will probably really like it. Check it out!)","November 25, 2013","true","13.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are some fun twists and turns along the way but nothing jaw dropping or genre defining. While Dante's brash attitude may seem a bit obnoxious, the character grew on me and by the end of the game I found myself eagerly awaiting his next quip or shocking turn of phrase. The narrative has just enough momentum to keep you interested in learning more about Dante's past and to see what steps he'll take to get his revenge. You'll never be moved to tears, but you'll probably get a few laughs out of this yarn.\n\nOther Thoughts - There's not a lot to say here. This is not a game of great thematic depth or complexity. The combat, on the other hand, has both in spades. I think this is a great first chapter in what will hopefully become a new series of games. Oftentimes, 3rd person action games will lose their footing somewhere. The story may be obtuse or boring, the combos may be too tough to pull off, the enemies might be too easy or difficult, etc. DmC does a great job of walking this line and not overstaying its welcome.\n\nScore - 4/5 (A solid game. Genre fans should love it, while others will probably really like it. Check it out!)","November 25, 2013","true","13.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/diazflac/recommended/220440/","diazflac","diazflac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/diazflac/","688 products in account","This new Dante feels like an old friend.\n\nI'll admit, I was skeptical of this series re-launch, especially when it was first announced back in 2010 and the first promotional image was this: http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120923082161/devilmaycry/images/1/12/Dante_dmc_2010.jpg\n\nMy gut reaction to seeing that image back then was "You just ruined Dante and the DMC franchise." and to an extent, that gut reaction sort of stayed with me until I finally had a chance to try the game for myself.\n\nThankfully, the end result was far from my initial fears.\n\nDmC does a good job of managing to reinvent the so-called "origin" story of Dante and Vergil, and yet by and large once you manage to get used to the new face and very different attitude (at least at first) of the new Dante, you'll discover that the gameplay itself is nothing short of the classic DMC style you've come to know.\n\nControls have been somewhat re-imagined in a way that neither takes too long to get used to nor feels terribly unfamiliar. By and large they are handled well, and a lot of the familiar signature aspects that the franchise is known for are still here as well.\n\nFor example, orbs and the time statues for "shopping" are present here. Dante still has Ebony and Ivory and they still get unlimited ammo. Signature abilities like Stinger make their return with a new control schemata. Devil trigger is of course also present, though it works in a slightly different way than in most of the past entries, it nonetheless manages to impress just as it always has.\n\nWhile I did have some initial complaints about Dante's voice acting (the lines seemed really flat early on in the game) once you give it some more time it fleshes itself out better, and that also gives you a chance to get adjusted to the new Dante as well.\n\nAnd it IS an adjustment. Gone is the super confident whimsical and snarky don't-take-life-too-seriously Dante of yore, for the most part. This new Dante is younger, more apathetic and less enthusiastic, but to an extent this new attitude is plot related as well, and for what it's worth I think it is a convincing way to show character growth and progression.\n\nGradually as Dante begins to open his eyes to the situation around him through the plot events, he starts becoming more empathetic, and discovers his own true nature in the process.\n\nI won't spoil the details too much, but it was good to see his character maturing over the course of the game. And while I do feel like he never reached the same height on the badass meter that classic Dante manages to capture, by the time all is said and done it's clear to see he's squarely on his way to becoming more like his platinum haired alter ego.\n\nTake away from this what you will, but if you're willing to brave the initial storm and wait for the seas to calm, as far as the new Dante goes, you'll see this is another great entry in the DMC series. It takes a bit to get used to the changes, but change can be good sometimes.","November 26, 2013","true","10.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The controls can be hard to use at times. (EG: Trying to dodge while holding the Angel mode button and pressing cntrl instead) I recomend using a gamepad.

The story plays out like one of his lectures. The game play itself reminds me of a lot of that newest Alice game. There's a lot of jumping on blocks suspended in mid air for a little bit then getting to a bigger platform where you fight a bunch of dudes then go back to jumping some more platforms and repeating the process. The game is very linear with some hidden things off to the sides. It's all been done before, but the story was really a lot of fun and I looked forward to seeing what happened next. The game took around 17 hours to finish.The combat is based on stringing combos of hits together and racking up points for beating enemies up with style. The Vergil's Downfall DLC was a let down. It is the epilogue to a story that didn't need one. The pacing of the main game is good and it reaches a satisfying conclusion. In the DLC, the cut scenes are done with a cheap hand-drawn animation that are a severe step down from the campaign and also the story of the DLC is a lot less fun. The whole epilogue just seemed pointless.  Just pass on the DLC. The main is a fun and I do recommend it.","October 24, 2013","true","17.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The combat's a shallow entry, but after you wade in it for a bit it begins to get deeper; The extra difficulties and DLC will have you coming back to experiment more and more. Though I highly suggest you ignore the ranking system. I commend Ninja Theory for taking the dive, though I do hope they get a better writer for the next game, if there's going to be one. If you still haven't made your decision and you're reading this, just think for a second. How many decent stylish action games does the PC market have? If you like those types of games adding this to your library won't hurt. Not the end all be all, but good for what it is.\n==============\nLong\n==============\nWhere do I start with this game?\nIn a Vacuum this game is a solid 7. "Why a 7" Is probably the question you're asking. Well for starters, the script; while workable and functional leaves something to be desired even though it gets you through the game. I know you've probably heard the outcry for the "F*ck you-F*ck you" back and forth between Dante and the Succubus; though I guess you could look at that  as Dante's such an ♥♥♥ that he has the innate ability to ♥♥♥♥ off demons without trying. No, being an ♥♥♥ is not necessarily a bad thing. Then comes the voice acting. I have to give it a pass simply because the only real cringe worthy lines in the reboot, won't scar your brain like the original (look up "fill your dark soul with light" on youtube, you'll see what I mean). The voicework is on par with the script. Passable, no stellar performances, some hitches here and there (hitches as in cringe-lines), but it's not bad. For an example of bad, look at the original resident evil, or Sonic Adventure.\n\nThe combat is decent. Hell when mastered it's practically on par with previous games, though there are still things that I personally wish they kept. For one, royal guard is no more. That got replaced by the parry system. This system is good and bad, because you can use it intentionally to make enemies kill/damage themselves, but at the same time you'll get a bunch of free points just by accidentally parrying enemies you had no intention of parrying. The H/H weapon is just plain boring to use; effective against certain enemies, but still boring. Sorry but Beowulf was just too damn good to not miss it.\nTaunts are missing even though there's a free button that's not used while playing with Dante. This was a fun mechanic for funzies that is definitely missed.\n\nAnother issue with combat is that it's so loose that when you try to cancel certain moves it causes conflict with the animations which leads to certain abusable bugs or Dante Jerking around. I honestly can't recall previous DMC's having this particular combat bug, though the "fair play" bug seems to be shared.\nWhat I mean by fair play is that enemies usually won't attack you unless they're in the camera's view, or are already in the middle of an attack when the player points the camera away from them. Though sometimes while looking at enemies they behave as if the camera isn't looking at them and they'll just stand there in one spot, confused. This is usually fixed by turning the camera away and turning it back, but at the same time, why would a player want to do that? >.>\n\nThis Dante is practically a more solid version of Nero (DMC4). Take note I only say this because I personally found Nero boring/too easy to play with the tools he had. Others will have their own opinions of him.\n\nCompared to previous DMC's the story here is more focused on the main character. Where Dante's given a history. Where as with the original series (as far as the games were concerned) was more a history of Sparda and Dante is simply cleaning up his dad's leftovers. Granted, the story in Vergil's downfall DLC is as anime as it could get, but still the gameplay offered in that DLC makes up for it. I mean I personally found Vergil more fun to play.\n\nThe music works for the game. I can't complain about it at all.","November 25, 2013","true","44.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That being said, this game is worth a try. While some of the dorkyness that came to define the series has been toned down, the gameplay remains top notch, matched only by the enchanting Bayonetta. If you played the past DMC games solely for the story, then I don't know what to tell you. BUt if it was the gameplay that kept you coming back, then this game doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe series needed a reboot, and this is an amazing attempt at that. Its not the DMC we all played back on our PS2s, but it is a refreshing take on the characters with the same classic gameplay that made this series a success. It deserves a chance from any "fan".","December 17, 2013","true","10.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you've like DmC in the past, get this game, you'll love it. If you like the genre, you'll enjoy this game as well. If you're unfamiliar with it, give it a shot. You're not going to be dissapointed.","December 14, 2013","true","9.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've completed this game on multiple modes on the PS3.\n\nDmC Devil May Cry is a reboot of the Devil May Cry series. Telling the story of Dante's origin story. Retaining it's fast, fluid combat and bringing us a new Dante, (I prefer the old Dante, new one is kind of a prick). His attitude is more immature but I suppose that would be fine since the game is telling his origin story. At times it may feel repititive, but a vast array of weapons will keep you trying out different combos and combat styles.\nThis game's storyline isn't amazing, but it isn't bad either. Characters are pretty well acted and the voices are great.\n\nIf you're into to action hack 'n' slash games, then buy this.\n\n9/10","April 9, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Also the boss fights are pretty hard and they make a lot of fun. Also searching for all the differnt objects you can find in this game is a big competition, because some of them are pretty hard to find.\n\nAnother aspect, which makes this game great, although it sounds pretty weird, is the soundtrack. You just get an unbelieavable feeling, destroying enemies and listen to great music!\n\nThe story is ok, it is not the such a great story line as in other big Triple A games, but it is definatly ok. Also not the story, but the gameplay the most important acepect in the game.\n\nAll in all I can just recommend this game and it is definatly worth the money!","April 5, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

But let me tell you that this has to be one of, if not THE BEST Devil May Cry to date! Fast pased action, Tons of new weapons at your disposal at any time during the game for tons of play styles and different combos, And I have to say once you get past the new Dante's look, He is no less of the old Dante. And he's honestly alot funnier then in the older games. And Honestly I would give this game a 10/10 if the ending of the game wasn't poorly made.\n\nIf you love fast pased hack and slash games, with good graphics, awesome story, and the coolest protagonist in the world, then this is your game!!!","December 22, 2013","true","29.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
