This game is incredibly luck based. If you can not take losing in a graceful way I would recommend skipping it.\n\nThat said, Dead Man's Draw is a very polished card game with a decent learning curve and simple gameplay you can easily get the hang of. You can make a lot of combos with a lot of cards and you will probably have a few good hours with it.\nWhile it may seem the AI cheats, to this point I have not found it to do so. In fact, for a large part of the game the deck is stacked in your favour by giving you two traits at once while the AI has only one. The AI though is incredibly agressive, prefering to use cannons to blast your hand over potentially winning moves. This is quite annoying if you're just starting out, but often it leads to the AI impotently blasting away your 7 score card to reveal a 6 underneath, barely doing anything.\n\nThe AI does not seem to be able to really understand the game, it's functional, but feels very much like it follows a flowchart rather than that it plays the game. All opponents are the same as well, all following the same AI.\nLuckily, where the AI does not change, the traits they use does, and the game has interesting ruleset changes after every 'tournament' (A string of a few matches) you play to keep things interesting.\n\nAs much as it looks like it may be enjoyable with a friend, it does not have multiplayer at this point. To continue on with its flaws, the game needs you to play a lot to unlock things. To the point where it begins to feel like grinding, and that the randomness begins to get annoying after yet another loss to an AI using a trait that you haven't even unlocked yet.\n\nIs it polished, entertaining, and an interesting game?\nYes\n\nWorth 10 euro?\nI'd be sceptical. If you can find it on sale you're sure to get a few hours of amusement out of it, but otherwise it might be hard to get your money's worth.","July 28, 2015","true","8.1"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","33","39","0","0"

Easy to learn, but that's not to say there aren't things to think about while playing. More strategy in playing your cards are added at the different challenges. And there are a lot of challenges to go through so there is always a reason to keep coming back to the game. The game is more based on luck of the draw than strategy but it's not all luck. You can also unlock abilities by completing challenges that you can use to make certain cards more powerful for your own style of play that you prefer. Up to two can be used after you unlock both ability slots.

Mechanically it works well once all the different card abilities have been unlocked, and I like how it eases new players in to the game.  There is some strategic decision making to be had, and there is also a 'push your luck' aspect which mixes things up nicely.  The graphics are good, but the pirate theme is pasted on.\n\nThere's two things that stop me giving this a recommendation:\n\n1. There is no multiplayer.  If this game had online multiplayer for 2 players I would not hesitate to recommend it.  As it stands this omission makes the game feel a bit pricey for what it is.\n\n3. Unbalanced AI.  Far too many times the AI will manage to put together a combo that is just amazing (it's not uncommon to see a significant lead wiped out in one hand), or will draw in such a way that it doesn't make sense (for example sometimes the AI will stop drawing after 2 useless low value cards and bank them; this could be a strategic decision, but every time it happens the next card turned over would have made the AI Bust).\n\nIt all leads to too much frustration for what should be a fun time waster.","January 2, 2015","false","2.7"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

It's a card game with pirates, and it's a very casual one. Anyone can play it and anyone will understand it, unlike Magic The Gathering. Just believe me when I say that it's a very fun game and one that I'm still enjoying.\n\nYou'll be playing tournaments against other pirates, which start off rather easy, but increase in difficulty after just a few of them. And that's not because the game is becoming harder - it plays out the same way in every tournament you participate in - but the rules do change. Where initially your goal is to get the higest score, there'll be tournaments where you have to get a score of 60 or lower or certain drawn cards will be added to your opponent's score. This keeps things fresh and challenging.\n\nYou get XP for every opponent you beat and every tournament you complete. Leveling up allows you to unlock perks and portraits. Perks can be used to make your life a little easier. For example, there's a card that allows you to see the next card on the stack and 'activating' a certain perk might allow you to see 2 more after that. There are many more to be unlocked, but it will require quite a few battles. The limit seems to be level 34, by the way.\n\nI'm not sure how many tournaments there are just yet, but there seems to be tens of them. I think I'm about 10-15% finished now so completing the entire game might take you more than 20 hours if I had to take a guess.\n\nPlenty of content here as you can see. Unfortunately there's not much else to do but to battle opponents and level up. I have the feeling that it's missing something, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe I was hoping to see you get money for tournaments that could then be used to unlock things like portraits (instead of leveling up). It's not even worth mentioning if I look back now, but maybe I'm not the only one.\n\nDead Man's Draw is a fantastic little addictive game and truly is a game for everyone. Highly recommended !\n\n[Rating: 86/100]","February 12, 2014","true","6.1"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

The AI is really good and not overly cheaty, there were a couple of times I thought you wouldn't keep drawing like that or you'd have had to have known that card was there to have carried on or to have played that card, but this didn't happen often enough to make it a concern. It is incredibly fair the majority of the time.\n\nBasically cards in your hand are banked, cards in the draw pile are the ones that you play with.\nThere are 10 suits and each suit has a function.\nYou're trying to beat the characters and usually you need a score of 65 at least on each game to get 3 stars on a tournament. (It will unlock the other tournaments on just one star though which just requires you to win each game with any score. I was going for the achievement which is why the 65 was important to me.)\nYou play cards from the draw pile, if you get a duplicate suit you lose all the cards in play to the bust pile (unless your opponent has a trait that puts bust cards into their hand instead)\nOnly the highest card from each suit is counted towards your score (although there are a couple of tournaments that count every card towards your score)\n\n* Anchors lock all previously played cards so you can't lose them\n* Hooks let you play a card from your hand\n* Clairvoyant lets you see what's next in the deck. (The mystic trait will allow you to view the next 3)\n* Swords lets you play a card from your opponent's hand as long as you don't already have the suit in your hand or currently           in play.\n* Chest combines with a key card to give you a selection of cards from the bust pile based on how many cards you drew that turn (or your ops hand if you have the plunderer trait. The treasure hunter trait will let you triple the amount of cards you get given)\n* Cannon makes you discard a card from your hand which goes to the bust pile, or you can take the misfire trait and you can discard a card from your ops hand instead....if you combine misfire with the scavenger trait, the card you blasted goes in to your hand.\n* Kraken makes you draw 2 cards to play so you can't choose to bank the cards you have until you've drawn them. If your op has the beastmaster trait you'll have to draw 4 cards.\n* Mermaid lets you replay a card currently in play....Sir Lovesword sometimes uses a trait that banks the card you replay (you can also unlock this trait)\n* Maps lets you take a card from the bust pile and put it in play. Ordinarily you get to choose between 3 cards, but the navigtator trait lets you pick from any card in the pile.\n\nYou don't have to memorise the suits to play effectively, if you hover over a card it will say at the top of the screen what the suit does.\n\nThere are loads of traits to choose from which you unlock as you level up (much more than the ones I've mentioned here) which allow you to manipulate how the suits work for you or against your op.\nYou can choose 2 traits at a time to use.\n\nI completed the game with 3 stars on every tournament and I tended to stick with the misfire and scavenger traits. I only occasionally swapped one or both of these out for something else.\nHere's a tip if you're going for the 3 star achievements....you can only get 70 points in total (unless you're in the tournaments that count every card towards your score) and you normally need 65 points per game, so I played to get five 7's and the rest as sixes if I couldn't get 7's (obviously any extra 7's will allow you to have another suit at lower than 6 and still get the 65 points you need), all lower numbers are dross and can be gambled with. The cannons trait combo will let you steal the 7's you need from your opponents hand. There are a few times this trait combo doesn't work as well, or you'll find it's better to negate your opponents traits instead but for the most part this method worked brilliantly.\n\nThere is no multiplayer, which doesn't bother me, I prefer single player games for the most part, this game would be great as   a multiplayer though.\n\nI bought Dead Man's Draw when it was on sale for around £1.64 but I think it's worth the £6.99 they normally ask for.\n\nBrilliant game, very easy to learn, simple to play yet there's loads to it :)","June 21, 2014","true","54.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

In all honesty its about 40% luck 60% skill.\n\nThe core game is based on 1v1 drawing from the same deck, once the deck is gone the player with the most points win. How do I earn points you ask? Well, let me tell you. There are 10 suits which have numbers on them 7 to 2. Each card in your hand adds to your point value. However only the highest card in each suit counts. Each suit has a specific ability once drawn which are slowly introduced and pretty easy to quickly grasp. But a few examples are the canon suit makes your opponent discard a card or the mystic suit allows you to see what card is next in the deck.\n\nYou can pull as many cards from the deck as you want each turn unless you pull 2 of the same suit, then you bust and all the cards drawn are discarded. However further into the game there are modifiers that may change this function.\n\nThere is no multi-player which is a little sad but its still very enjoyable against the AI. The game is also slightly RPGish in that you earn experience points even if you lose, though not as many. It'd be cool if it had some tech trees or something to tailor your own progression but you earn XP fast enough where that doesn't really matter. The games aren't very long either, probably 5-7 minutes if I had to guess. The XP earns you levels which at each level unlocks either a new character portrait or a character trait which is essentially an additional modifier to the core rules. Using the example from before, the mystic trait would change when the mystic card is active, it would reveal the next 3 cards in the deck rather than just 1. The other traits are similar in this fashion. Once multiple traits are unlocked you can choose from them before each match to attempt to thwart any rule changes that may make you play more defensively or cautious rather than an all out attack or risking a bust.\n\nThe game is split into tournaments, each having their own modifiers on the core game as well as each opponent within having modifiers of their own. Which leads to what is a very simple game into something that keeps you on your toes and keeps you switching tactics to progress.\n\nTHE GIST\nVery fun, enjoyable casual filler game that is easy to grasp but hard to master with a side of luck thrown in.

For first I'll point out pros of this, because I need to point out few of them:\n\nA) Combination of really easy to learn mechanics combined with amount of strategies you may pull off with cards you have on your hand + traits. Traits is what make this so fun to play and yet allow you to be creative with your plays. Technically after tutorial you learn everything you need, while with each in-game tournament you learn new card combos and gain traits to use.\nB) The amount of gameplay which in-game tournaments provide you. Counting all cards when it goes to points ? No problem. You need to reach 50 points first ? Also in. You can't score more than 60 points while beating opponent in points ? In as well. The amount of possible modes to play in is just nice making each tournament pretty much different.\nC) Graphics and music are good combination here. For a simple game like this, I would say it fits really well.\nD) Still lots of room for improvements and new additions. The amount of cards is good, but not huge enough IMO to add few cards in-game without making it too complicated. There's also a possibility of new traits. In other words - this game has still more potential for improvement.\nE) Good AI which actually can not only count well (which is not as obvious in such games) but counter your strategies and eliminate/steal cards which are the main core of your strategy. I'm really happy with this as it makes game challenging.\n\nAlthough unfortunately I see few problems as well:\n\nA) Lack of multiplayer is outright unacceptable. I would really love to play this game against real players and outright test some traits and card combos against them, especially when this game has the perfect combination of simple mechanics and yet good amount of strategies and combos available to use. Please, do it. It's such a waste otherwise.\nB) Price is a bit too high for a card game like this, but I must admit I don't regret spending this money. But still, I would lower the price. Or I won't even bother mentioning this as a con as long as creators will add multiplayer option.\nC) While it is luck based (and I don't mind this, it adds additional thrill for example when one lucky pull saves you), but I think game favors AI a bit more than a player. But maybe that's me and I'm a bit biased. But still, you should still win more games than loose if you choose your cards and traits right.\n\nIn other words I give this game 8/10 because of small cons and lack of multiplayer. I really recommend this game as it's fun, addicting and challenging, while you don't need to waste time learning complicated mechanics. I would give 9.5/10 with multiplayer, but without it - I can't. Still good buy and certainly not wasted money as long as you enjoy card games ;).","February 9, 2014","true","8.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There's a lot more depth to the strategy than I expected initially. There's a lot of risk involved in deciding how many cards to draw each turn, so it's not a good choice for people who don't like the randomness of card games, but for those who enjoy assessing the odds, it's an enjoyable challenge. Easy to learn, great for casual play. Pity there's no hotseat or multi-player modes.\n\nUpdate: Why can't I stop playing this game? It keeps getting better and better as more traits and interesting challenges are unlocked. And the challenges seem to go on and on and on... when is this game going to end?

It's fun to play and discover at first.\n\nHowever, it does get repetitive after a while, because it's incredibly luck based. You can tell yourself you're using sneaky tactics, but at the end of the day, you're given a random card, and there is one optimal way to use it, so thinking of new strategies is useless. Also, you play versus all kinds of different characters, but they all make the same moves, and use the cards the same way.\n\nRegardless of that, I think it would be a decent game if it had a multiplayer option.

Honeymoon: You love it. You are winning most games. You get half the achievements in 2 hours of play.\nPhase 2. Frustration: Now the games are evenly matched you each have 2 traits. Your opponent is better than you. They have a computer program that instantly calculates odds on inceasing the score risk. Now the rules change often and your AI opponet never forgets them. The AI has all the best card play sequences for every situation stored in its memory, you don't. You are still winning games, but you are losing 4 times as many.\nPhase 3. Resolution: Out of your frustration to proceed you look for a guide and read the forums. You learn about a bug that gives you an unfair advantage. It is merely an undocumented key board stroke. No 3rd party. You use it to slaughter your opponents now scoring huge wins. You feel elated and take revenge on the opponents that hve been consistently beating you. You feel justified because you have convinced yourself that the deck is stacked in the AI's favor (even though it is not).\nFew other games have brought out more emotions in me as I played it.

Although a lot of it may be luck-based, the AI never appears to have an advantage and, for the most part, the AI plays fair.\n\nThe game is really easy to learn. I picked it up in the very first match I played, probably because the concept is simple: Draw cards to fill up the various suites in your hand, but draw too many, and risk losing the currently drawn cards. For example, if I draw three cards from the deck: a sword, an anchor, and a cannon, and then draw another card of the same type (like another cannon), then I lose those three cards and cannot add them to my hand. The goal is to have the highest number of each suite in your hand, combining to form the highest overall score.\n\nEach card ranges from values 2-7. Whatever value is the highest that you currently have in hand will be the one added to your score. You can have others of the same suite, but they wont be counted towards your total score. The optimal hand would consist of a 7 from each suite: anchor, hook, crystal ball (?), cutlass, treasure chest, key, cannon, barnacle, mermaid, and scroll. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score wins.\n\nThe gameplay seems simple, yes, but it gets progressively gets increasingly complex the more you play it. Eventually, each suite will have its own ability. The cannon, for example, when drawn from the deck, allows you to discard one of your opponent's cards. If you're smart, you'll usually go for whichever card has the highest value in its suite. Later on, an ability is also added to the cutlass, allowing you to, upon draw, steal the top suite from your opponent for a suite that you currently do not have. Each card will eventually have their own abilities, all of which are very fun to use.\n\nOnce you've unlocked all of the card's abilities, you'll get into character traits, which allow you, and you specifically, to make use of a special trait. The first one you'll unlock makes it so the cannon removes an entire suite of cards, instead of the highest number of that suite, from your opponent. This prevents them from having a backup to replace that suite once the higher number is removed.\n\nThe AI in the game also puts up a fair fight. They don't seem "too" lucky, but they do know their math, and will make a lot of good decisions. Regardless, I still found the game surprisingly easy, even in the later levels. I only ever lost a couple of times, and those few losses were very close matches too.\n\nOverall, Dead Man's Draw is a must-buy. It is incredibly fun. Although it may appear boring, or simple, it can certainly provide a one-of-a-kind experience.","February 17, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At one point you will play numbers instead of suits. You will notice that you are pulling 3 card doubles about 80% of the time. Let's see, 2 cards drawing a third, 7 numbers total. That's 2 cards of 7 that will cause a double and 5 cards that won't. Does it seem like you are playing those odds. Now add the 2 card doubles. This game also has tension builders that are not needed. You have to rush your discard pick because it moves right away. The computer's is figured before the graphics even shows but the screen pauses and slowly scolls like it is choosing at a relaxed pace. Creating what seems to be an unfair illusion because the computer does not need that relaxed pace. Now the "Busted" graphic does get old but it is also creating tension. First, you are being told repeatedly that you have failed. Next, clicking the mouse should remove it and the cards, starting the next hand. It doesn't work, you have to press the mouse a second time to remove the cards. Thus you try to match the timing of the double click or wait for "busted" to disappear on it's own. As that tension builds you are now button mashing thinking that will speed it up. One click should finish the process but they want that tension there. It helps the AI appear to be a tougher opponent. Actually the AI follows a pretty basic set of commands. In the end the Devs ruined the game by adding these things so I cannot recommend it.","February 21","false","29.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/naogilles/recommended/262450/","naogilles","Nao 尚","http://steamcommunity.com/id/naogilles/","1700 products in account","I appreciate how hard it is to create a card game with new rules. Well, there are books around here with rules for hundreds of Solitaire game and 2-player games made with regular cards, so you can always get inspiration from those, I guess. This one game uses a custom deck with many more suits, each being associated with a power-up.\n\nThe hardest part is balancing it out, I guess. DMD doesn't do it with flying colors, though. You can only unlock tournaments one at a time. If you really suck at a particular set of rules, you're screwed, you just can't finish the game. I'm only halfway through it and with about 12 hours of playtime, I'm guessing there's at least 25 to 30 hours of time to play. It's all very artificial, though... After a while, new tournaments are just variations on the previous ones, with harder AI, etc.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game is the complete lack of a story. There are characters; tournaments all have a title that supposedly draws from pirate lore. Great. But no one has anything to say, you just play against them and I guess you have to make up your own story.\nThe soundtrack is very limited, too. There's a quasi rip-off of the Pirates of the Caribbean score used in the main menu (at least it's longer than the very similarly PotC-themed single track from Clicker Heroes), and a more ambient song used during games. Overall, it looks like most of the development time was spent on refining the game rules. To each their own.\nI'll also note that some of the special rules are self-contradictory, and as such the AI appears to be cheating, when it's just not applying the rules properly. I don't know what to say about that. This game is getting old, I doubt it'll ever be fixed.\n\nIf you're into hard casual games, walk the plank and give this one a try. It's well worth its price on sale. Maybe even at full price. I don't know, I'm not used to buying games full price any more... I'm so scared they'll get bundled the following week for a buck. Yes, it has happened before, and it will happen again™.\n\nEDIT: I finished the game after 25 hours. In line with the last of story, there is absolutely no ending. No even a congratulations message for finishing all 60 (?) tournaments. Gosh, I wish it weren't so addictive... At least, now I can move on. Game isn't too hard because it relies so much on luck, and getting XP on losses means you'll eventually unlock everything, including unbeatable combos like Misfire/Parry or Plunderer/Davy Jones' Locker, etc. The fun comes in trying to find the right combo for each duel. Unfortunately, after the first half, all of your adversaries start using the same usual combos, so there's nothing new to see beyond the first dozen of hours. Still, well worth its price.","February 26","true","25.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

A match will be affected by some game-changing condition, and each opponent chooses an ability that changes another rule just for him.  Matches only take a few minutes, and the progression of unlocks is constant and satisfying.  The game is smooth, colorful, and responsive.

Basically.\n\nGame mechanics has two things that deserve attention: too much RNG based gameplay which in turn slowly but surely sours the gameplay once you put in more than a few hours. Every game is a RNG luck fest of defeating your opponent with trait Y who in turn uses X while rules Z are in effect..  Not bad - for awhile.... but the random feeling win-loose chains really dont make much sense after some time. You can't look back and say 'i should have done that hand differently.  You can - and must - put in some tactics to how you play but this far no specific strategies are winning strategies because of RNG.\n\nBuyer beware.\n\n","March 1","true","7.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are 10 different card types in this card game, each card type has it's own unique abilities.  The game further allows you to equip two traits before each match in order to form a strategy going in that could best counter your opponent.\n\nEven though I gave this game a No recommendation, it doesn't mean that this game is bad.  It's can actually be quite fun at times.  The problem comes in when you put in more than 5 or 6 hours in the game.  The first bunch of matches were really fun, you were unlocking new card powers and then new traits to augment those card powers.  Each game felt really unique and it was fun to learn how each new power interacted with the ones you unlocked before it.  However the tedium started to set in after about 6 or so hours of play into the game.  Unlocks became very slow and instead of cool new traits now you were getting cosmetic hero potraits which further slowed getting new traits.\n\nThe game does try to combat some of that tedium by introducing a different set of table/map rules for the matches as you further progress into the game.  And yes the first time you play those rules it again brings you back into the game.  Instead of just having more banked points/gold than your opponent you have to beat him and have less than a certain number of points/gold, or instead of just counting the highest point value cards in your hand it counts total value of all cards currently held (which can get kind of crazy with some of the traits that you or the AI can have).  But once again the tedium sets in.  Once you've played through the rule sets twice, it's no longer that fun and combined the fact that you've progressed so far in the game and nothing else has really changed each match feels more like the ones before it and there doesn't feel like a really big need to keep playing\n\nAnd then there is some randomness that needs mentioing.  The randomness is mostly contained to only the drawing of cards.  After the draw is done based on how the cards interact with each other and the traits you can equip you can control the randomness of the drawing a fair bit by comboing cards together.  However that still wont' stop you from drawing a key and drawing a second key and busting your turn without being able to do anything.\n\nLastly since this is against the AI only, I'll mention that the AI isn't exactly the most polished.  They do make some questionable moves at times while at other times pull off perfect combos and that inconsistancy can add some not needed frustration on top of game that kind of feels like it's to long.\n\nI'll finish up with saying that I'm not giving this game the thumbs down because it's bad.  It's not a bad game, it's actually quite well done and the card mechanics are quite fun.  It's just that I can't recommend it to everyone, it's a very niche game and for someone looking maybe to kill 10-20 minutes here and there it can be fun but playing for longer times in one sitting shows the weaknesses the game has.","October 6, 2015","false","11.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/262450/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","Far, far too luck-based for my taste. I'm not opposed to certain types of randomness in games (especially card games) as far as the initial dealing of the cards, but once you play your cards, they should be played. Dead Man's Draw doesn't feel that way, though.\n\nIt's essentially just regular old "War" where you and your opponent draw cards and whoever draws the highest card wins, but DMD just puts off the score tally until the end and has you "test your luck" each around by drawing additional cards and trying not to bust. Essentially, it is a combination of blackjack and war.\n\nWhat I don't like about it, though, is that the game is overflowing with random occurrences of upsets and reversals. Imagine blackjack or war where every number between 1 and 10 has a special effect, where if you draw that number, a certain thing will happen every time you draw that number, no matter what. This goes for both you and your opponent. Drawing a 1 reveals the next card to be dealt (note: it doesn't give you the OPTION to look at it; it just shows you). Drawing a 2 forces you to remove a high-scoring card from your opponent's discard pile, dropping their points. Drawing a 2 and a 3 on the same turn automatically doubles your score for this round. Drawing a 5 forces you to steal any card from your opponent's discard pile. As these effects are turned on, they can be chained together into combos by you or your opponent. Draw a 5 and steal a 1 from your opponent (lowering their score), which allows you to see that the next card is a 2 and won't bust you, which you draw (raising your score) and use to destroy another one of your  opponent's cards (lowering their score). When you are chaining these combos, it feels like "strategy", but the only reason you got to perform this combo was luck (you happened to draw a 5), and deciding which card you are going to steal or destroy is a bit of a no-brainer. So it is a very shallow sort of strategy as far as I can tell.\n\nThe net result of every drawn card having some kind of game-upsetting effect is that even when you score points, you can't count on the fact that you simply scored those points. Your opponent will randomly draw a huge combo opportunity on the next turn and drop your points from 50 to 10 while raising his points from 7 to 48. The score upheavals and reversals can be so random and large, it's enough to give you whiplash.\n\nUltimately what this game feels like is if the game gave you and your opponent each a bag full of random effects, and each turn you both randomly draw an effect out of the bag, which makes some random stuff happen, and then one of you ends up having more points than the other. Whoever that turns out to be is the winner. End game.\n\nAlso, the game has the most superficial and meaningless use of XP I have ever seen. I don't know why it is in there. For a feature brag, I assume.\n\nThe art is great, though. The game looks and sounds fantastic. The test-your-luck blackjack element is a great aspect of the game and probably my favorite thing about it (and the gameplay element that persuaded me to give the game a try). Unfortunately, the torrent of forced upheaval effects on the cards just turns the whole thing sour for me. It feels like a game of interesting decisions getting overruled by a steady torrent of RNG interruptions, which just turns me off.","September 26, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

For example, swords allow you to steal and play a card from your opponent's hand, while anchors "lock down" all previous card in the current play to protect them from a bust.

The "luck" of the AI is slanted so extremely in its favor, its impossible to win a match. Every time I draw the octopus card, which forces you to draw 2 more cards, 80% of the time I immediately draw another octopus, which busts my hand. You can't have more than one of a card type out. If I draw the fortune teller to see what the next card in the deck is, 75% of the time it's another fortune teller card, which I can't draw, because I'll bust. This also means I leave that card for the AI. I've been able to play 5 cards maybe twice without busting. I've seen the AI go up to 7, clean out my entire hand with cannons and swords, and not bust. The AI draws a cannon and/or a sword 90% of the time, more often than not it draws both. Sometimes it even draws a mermaid so it can reuse one of those. The AI draws the chest + key fairly regularly. I usually only get it if I pull the chest or key out with the map or hook cards.\n\nThis is hands down the most frustrating game I've ever played, especially a casual card game.","September 25, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The computer opponent gets to use abilities too, and based on the goal for that particular scenario level, chooses accordingly.\n\nThe game plays very quickly and requires the player to determine what is the best strategy to win a scenario level, and pick abilities to achieve that goal.\n\nStrategies are unlocked, the more scenarios the player wins. The player can only use a max of two abilities, but has all abilities unlocked to choose from. A player can change abilities each hand, if they so choose.\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable card game that plays quickly. If the subject interests you, you will not be disappointed in a purchase.\n\nThe game also is very stable.

This isn't to suggest that DMD is entirely luck based - to the contrary, there is plenty of skill involved in properly utilizing your cards.  You are, however, at the mercy of the draw and at times you just can't catch a break.\n\nThe opponent AI makes intelligent moves and overall I'm satisfied with the time-waster challenge that DWD provides.  Trait customization (player card modifiers) along with several game variants provide for a good variety of game experiences.\n\nThe only thing missing is multiplayer.  It's a shame that the developer has moved on to other projects, because I think that DLC or a sequel could prove quite profitable.  Player versus Player is a very appealing amenity these days.  Furthermore, I believe a 2v2 mode would make things even more exciting.\n\nIf you are a fan of strategy card games and DMD is on sale, purchase with confidence.","June 14, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But instead he's going to play a cannon to remove 2 points from your deck instead of gaining 15 points himself.\n\nAnd this trait makes it a very very annoying game as you see over and over again in each level the same underhanded tactics being used by the opponent.\n\nAnother annoying thing is that the opponents can use advanced-level abilities and you can't.

Unfortunately, as time has gone on, other complaints have replaced this one, even if they're not QUITE enough to merit another thumbs-down. I'll detail them here so that buyers can make an informed choice. If you'd like details on how the game actually plays, the descriptions and some other reviews/threads should give you the gist.\n\nNeedless to say, the lack of multiplayer is one gaping flaw, although it should be noted that a good chunk of the player abilities would have to be disabled or revamped for this to work, since some of them do too much to cancel out others to make for consistently balanced matches. And there's no point allowing players to see each other's selections beforehand, since this would just lead to a cyclical bout of power-switching as they keep trying to counteract the other's selections. Still, doing this would make multiplayer perfectly doable.\n\nThe next complaint is that there is an incredible need for some kind of counter or image to give the player at least some idea of how many cards are currently in the discard pile, which is currently off-screen. Some players can apparently keep track of this mentally without disrupting their experience, but the rest of us often have no idea what to expect once the pile starts to get low, and when choosing whether to take from the discard pile or do something else, it would be nice to be able to tell whether there were many - or even any - cards in the pile altogether.\n\nAnd the final gripe is that, as much as people dismiss the mere suggestion, I think there is some genuine unfairness in the AI's knowledge of the draw deck. I don't think it's deliberate stacking or cheating, but rather a partial failure to partition what the AI SHOULD know (i.e., nothing) from what it actually does. I base this on the sheer number and proportion of cases in which the AI will take unreasonably high risks (namely drawing when it already has four, five, or even six cards on the table and the chance of a bust is high, even though there is nothing protecting most or all of the current cards from loss in the event of a bust) only to be rewarded with exactly the right card or even succession of cards it needs to get the most out of its current hand. I understand the effects of luck, but this particular bit of grand (and situationally specific) "fortune" has played out a few too many times for me to be satisfied with that explanation. Combine this with the AI's being generally aware of what's in the discard pile (unlike the player), and there are times when what should have been a fair bout turns into an infuriating, unbroken string of losses for a perfectly completent player. Now, to be fair, the program does sometimes make less-than-efficient or even self-defeating plays thanks to other holes in the programming, and luck does indeed play its role in all cases, so this doesn't really break the game. But it sure makes for a less enjoyable experience than it might have been.\n\nStill, for a cheap, renewable diversion, you could do worse.","October 30, 2015","true","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of strategy involved, plus some luck too. I WISH it was available on Android - I would play the heck out of it there (it IS on ios)","January 26","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The AI is challenging. I got this game on sale but would have still been pleased if I bought it for $10. Make sure you set an alarm because you will lose hours of time otherwise.","November 28, 2014","true","29.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept for this one and the suits seemed compelling and I am glad I had picked this game up.\n\nIt starts you off easy and you start gaining suit abilities and eventually traits to boost those abilities which happen everytime you draw that particular suit.\n\nIt gets boring after a bit as the suit traits become farther apart in levels and you find yourself playing the same game rules with the AI tweaked slowly. Even then sometimes winning is about playing the last draws really well.\n\nEdit: After some time, I've played this off and on and I find that overall I'm pleased with the game the more I casually play it. I think originally my problem was I hit a wall with luck and trait strategy and a month + break easily fixed that and I've breezed through the vast majority of the tournaments. I think I was slightly bitter when I wrote my original review and this game is a great pickup when on sale.\n\n10/10 this is actually quite the gem.","June 27, 2014","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Luck based, like everyone says, but most IRL card games are so it's not an issue for me. I like to open it up and play in between other games. It's fun :) I would definitely wait until it's on sale, though.","December 3, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I revert my original impression recommendation as there is no way I would recommend this game now.\n\nThis is the second game in my Steam library that will put me into bouts of swearing.\nDo you want that?\n\n\nFirst Impressions Review:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSo far I am really enjoying this game. The game appears to have a large amount of depth to it and I am intrigued to see if some of the ideas I am having on-the-fly of what type of buffs might unlock from future playthroughs will pan out.\n\nDepending on your playstyle and what buff you choose I would say the luck vs skill can balance out.\nI highly recommend this game if you enjoy card based games.\n\nI Wonder if they will add the ability to play online multiplayer games against your friends in the future? Here's hoping!","September 25, 2015","false","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
