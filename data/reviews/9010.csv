Or RTCW you get me right ?\n\nActually ( when i write this review am 28 and soon 29 ) Date 27/12/2015 at 00:30 on the planet earth...... Sh!t !\n\nI buyed this game in 2001 in the beautiful metal box so the limited edition.\nMy friend at that time was jalous ^^\nMy mother was mad about me cause she always said it was a Nazi game, and me to tell her that it was just a game.....\nAnd yes its just a game ! Dont confond game and reality.\n\n\nAnyway let start.....\n\n\n\nWolfenstein using the graphic motor of quake 3. And hell yeah this graphic motor do perfectly his job, very very well optimized ( well we know its a old game ok.... ) But imagine those graphic in 2001.... I remember and it was just amazing !!\n\n\nThe graphic are still very enjoyable and nice ( i dont givashit about graphic btw except for Thief 1 ... )\n\nThe environnement are very nice, there are different kind of environement too, castle for sure, forest, ruins, airport, small village in the snow, laboratory, there is also a U-Boat with the symbole of the smiling sawfish on it. Das Boat movie reference ? ^^\nAnd way more stuff....\n\nFor sure if you are like me, saying that old game are .... Old but gold, you will, like me do the game in the hardest difficulty, your not a noob right ? You like it hard right ???...\n\n\nSo you will do the game in  the I AM DEATH INCARNATE difficulty !\n\nI did the game straight without pause, it took me around 7h30 the first time, using most of the time the sten, the G43 and the K98 + killing all the ennemy finding also all the secrets area.... ^^\nFor sure you will rage a little bit, the I.A ennemy are still very very very good ! They are smart, use environement object, use cover or take cover, throw back your grenade ^^\n\n\n\nThe badass thing in this game\nThe differents boss!\nYou can hear the ennemy reloading, so rush them and kick ther /-\ss ^^\nYou can open the door by kicking them and destroying item too that way.\nDefinitively in this game the IA is so GOLD, the intelligence of the ennemy in the hardest difficulty is just amazing seriously !\nDifferent and nice environement.\n\nThe sound i like them... Especially the sound of the Alarm ^^\nBut time to time the music can appear too much repetitive, so i like to play without during some mission\nThere is some infiltration mission ! You can also use the sten to stay silent if you want.\nAnd also my preferate thing is that in almost all the level there is some secret area, if you see a place where you cant go its generally cause this place is secret and you have to find your self the way in.\n\nLast thing.. If you see a couple of barrel near a wall... Shoot them....\n\nTHE MOST BAD /-\SS SH!T IN THIS GAME\nThe boots !! Yeah you can kick with your foot door for example !! This is nuts !!\n\nBut with your boots you can also kick.... Lets say some poster paint picture, radio, chair,windows, soldier, door for sure,  SOME BOSS :D, zombie and more !!!! BOOTS THAT SH!T MAN !\n\nOpening a door the normal way ? NO USE YOUR BOOTS BOOOOM HELL YEAH !!!\n\n( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\n\n\nWhat about the weapons now ? They are realist for some and fun for the other one ^^ But enjoyable.\nMy preferate is for sure the Sten with the silencer what the fuerk man seriously this gun....  pew pew pew pew pew pew shhhhhhhhh ....   <3\n\nThe headshot in the game are real headshot, one shot in the head = Ennemy down ^^ So the Hitboxe are good and better then csgo hahahahaha ..... ( badjoke right ? ) ...\n\nWhat else ???  I think you can really enjoy this game seriously.\n\nDifferent weapons, different environement, ennemy too.\nThe story is not the most important in this game, there is some reference about Indiana Jones for example... ^^ Find yourself..\n\n\n\nps I am French my english is not perfect, but you get me right ? Wolfenstein is a must do.\n\nps² There still some player on Ennemy Territory mod... <3\n\n\nWith HD texture.  http://hpics.li/14144ab\n\n\nEDIT\nTo avoid open GL error at start of the game and to be able to use high resolution in the game install this patch\n\n\nBe sure to read the README from the patch.\n\nLink >>> http://www.markshan.com/knightmare/downloads/rtcw-sp-1.42c-win32-bin.zip\n\nAnd also i just re finished the game in like 3hoo new record.. :D i love RTCW ............ <3","December 26, 2015","true","23.3"," 97 of 125 people (78%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","78","97","125","47","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/9010/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Mein leben!\n\nReturn To Castle Wolfenstein is a first-person shooter reboot of the Wolfenstein series which much like its predecessor focuses on fast-paced gunplay with a number of improvements made to compensate for the new engine technologies available at the time.\n\nFirstly, unlike Wolfenstein 3D, the developers actually tried to implement a compelling story to a franchise known for not actually having a “story”. To some degree, the story in this game, at least from a concept point of view, brings something new to the table by adding elements of occult. The plot revolves around the American soldier, B.J. Blazkowicz, trying to impede the Nazis from discovering and extracting a serum hidden in an ancient tomb capable of augmenting soldiers into “Dark Knights”, an evil undead army from the 9th Century. Nazis and occult? Absurd ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but what’s not to like. However, while the concept does enhance the single-player campaign, the story itself is mostly ignorable since it generally feels like it is there to fill in the space. Blazkowicz, while a total badass, still remains one of the blandest protagonists in existence. He takes orders from his superiors like a puppet with no remorse or personal motives. Even when the Allies want to give him a medal for his efforts and persumably a well deserved break at the end, he is somewhere outside still kicking Nazi butt. Boy, he sure is souless; born with only one scope in life: to kill Nazis for eternity. Plus, it is silly how the Allies' solution to most problems is to send a "one-man army" to take down Nazi headquarters single-handedly without even breaking a sweat. But that is Wolfenstein after all; it purposely does not need to explain how Blazkowicz does it -- and hey, some ancient voodoo magic is involved, so anything is justifiable, right? Fortunately, the story did manage to create the cool villain by the name of Deathshead, who later becomes the franchise’s main antagonist.\n\nThe gunplay in here is hasty but satisfying, reminiscent of older games such as Quake, Doom and Unreal Tournament, and unquestionably the strongest point of the game. While it all boils down to sprinting and shooting enemies in quick manners, the game does offer some moments of straightforward stealth where you get to sneak behind enemy lines. Additionally, there is an adequate variety in enemies from the deadly female squads in tight leather uniforms (those butts though) to juggernauts like the Über-Soldats. Different weapons are at Blazkowicz’s disposal too, with the Tesla gun being the most fun one to use, even if the MP40 probably becomes the most practical throughout most of the game, thus making pistols pretty redundant. One problem with the weapons though is the fact you never seem to run out of ammo. Retrospectively now, the gunplay does feel very basic, but mostly thanks to its fast paced action killing waves of enemies does not get dull, surprisingly enough.\n\nThe level design has the mentality of most shooters back in the late '90s and early noughties based on maze-like corridors and paths, essentially allowing the player the freedom to pick whichever route to travel back and forth within the somewhat confined space. Exploration is also encouraged and rewarded by finding secret chambers filled with collectables, even if these give no gameplay advantages to the player. Graphically, at the time, the game looked great but as time went by its visuals sure look dated today. On the other hand, the same cannot be said to its soundtrack which even to this day remains memorable and rather ageless. When you can recognise a level/map by a specific track from the soundtrack, then you know the soundtrack left a good impression.\n\nBoasting a strong single-player campaign, (wherther you take the story seriously or not), many probably remember the game for its multiplayer component which at the time was very popular and considered by many superior than the campaign, even as far as being regarded one of the best multiplayer components in a game ever. I cannnot argue with that, although it was not until the highly acclaimed free standalone Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory came out that the multiplayer component peaked in popularity. Featuring a class-based gameplay similar to Team Fortress, two teams (Allies and Axis) fight each other to complete objectives on various maps. Personally, I spent far too many hours in the multiplayer alone when I was younger because it was balanced and had a very enjoyable experience. Currently, the multiplayer from Return To Castle Wolfenstein seems dead. Rest in peace.\n\nIn conclusion, Return To Castle Wolfenstein still remains a classic in the eyes of many, including myself, who played it in its heydays online and/or offline, and a milestone on PC. But it definitely lost its relevance and appeal to the general public as years have passed due to more ambitious and realistic shooters showing up years later. More old-school than modern, it still is a solid shooter, nevertheless, which does not spoil the player with today’s regenerative health and cover-base mechanics and can still provide enough hours of fun mindlessly killing Nazis. Pick it up only for nostalgic purposes or if you are curious to see how fast-paced shooters were like more than a decade ago in case you never grew up with them.","March 14, 2015","true","11.8"," 55 of 63 people (87%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","87","55","63","9","1"

I appreciated the various letters that you find lying around during the game; they really add to the game's atmosphere.\n\nDespite the game's age, the graphics are still good, in my opinion. By 2001 standards, they are exceptional.\n\nThe Quake 3 engine not only provides decent graphics, but, more importantly, makes for an awesome FPS combat experience. The weapons are great, and your character's movement is smooth. Combat is the game's main focus and without a doubt its strongest point.\n\nThe enemy A.I. is tough. I played the game on Bring em on! (the "normal" difficulty) and died several times during my playthrough. However, my deaths were never frustrating; I always felt as if each of my deaths was due more to my own shortcomings/poor play than by any cheapness from the A.I. I was forced to keep multiple save files and I recommend the same to anyone who isn't an expert at these sort of games.\n\nThe level designs are great. Plenty of hidden spots with loot for the players that appreciate that sort of thing in a game. I've  heard complaints about the stealth missions, but I found these levels to be really fun and a great change of pace. My only complaint is that some of the levels were a little too dark for my taste. They made it difficult to see enemies who have no problem seeing and shooting you in the same poor lighting.\n\nThe game's music is good as well. The sounds of the game really add to the atmosphere, and in some parts the game is downright creepy. You also stumble on conversations between Nazis who are unaware of you presence. These conversations often add to the game's story, and a few of them are hilarious and memorable.\n\nIt took me about 6.5 hours of total playtime to beat the campaign. At the end I was more than satisfied. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced FPS games.","December 30, 2015","true","10.6"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","23","23","2","2"

I only took notice of it when Wolfenstein The New Order was announced so I decided to try one of the earlier games and holy crap this game is so much fun.\n\nReturn To Castle Wolfenstein does so much right in the single player campaign. Cool settings, tight gunplay, epic orchestra music and a good array of weapons to take out the many types of (Nazi) enemies. This game is pure fun and it achieves at that with flying colours. The best part about it is probably the lack of handholding and not so linear level design which is sadly not so popular in many modern FPS games.\n\nI would give this a total of 8/10 for the fun challenge and gameplay this game has made but unfortunately I couldn't find a game in the multiplayer which is sad but the game is still very much worth the price for the singleplayer campaign alone. Nothing is better than shooting nazis, super soldiers and the undead at the same time.","November 22, 2014","true","11.2"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","30","36","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/9010/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","Return to Castle Wolfenstein is supposedly a sort of remake of Wolfenstein 3D, but I don't know how you can have a remake of Wolfenstein 3D where you don't get to fight and kill a mech-clad Hitler.\n\nRtCW is all good fun when you're fighting Nazis. Basic Nazis, elite Nazi ladies, and the what have yous. Where it loses me entirely is when it does the Monster Mash. The first mission is great! Fighting your way through Where Eagles Dare (a classic) and feeling like a boss. Then you get to mission 2. And now you're facing skeletons with swords and shields. For ♥♥♥♥'s sake, the most basic, stereotypical video game enemy possible. And yes, I am complaining about that in a game where you fight NAZIS.\n\nBut that's the thing, isn't it? I wanted to fight Nazis. I was playing Wolfenstein, and it turned into medieval DOOM with Germans. The final boss is an undead guy with a sword. Quite a step down from Hitler in a mech suit, I can tell you that. And sure, Wolf3D definitely had zombies. But they were experiments created by a Mengele-type guy. And they were basically just regular Nazis, but with an extra arm in the middle so that they could point their gun at you quicker than you could at them. There are electricity-shooting legless monster things in RtCW that the Nazis did create, and they're pretty cool. The game does a great job of building tension with these guys, and when they're not leaping into your face and being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they add a fun level of depth to their levels. But then you also have to deal with Super Soldiers, who are also sciencey, but ultimately boring.\n\nDon't get me wrong, here. The majority of the game has you just fighting Nazis. Snipers are awesome and paratroopers are awesome and the extra-skillful leather-clad ladies are awesome, and... well, the guys with flamethrowers suck. But luckily there aren't many of them in the game.\n\nThe level design is very good. Each mission looks and feels different. In one you'll be sneaking around a wooded area, in another you'll be sniping through a snowstorm. In one mission you'll be fighting from a cable car as you descend from Castle Wolfenstein, in another you'll be infiltrating secret Nazi labs, and in still another you'll be escorting a tank through a town. There are plenty of secrets to find... at times. After you leave Castle Wolfenstein, they seem to just stop existing for several missions. It's a bit of a bummer, to be honest.\n\nThe pre-mission cutscenes are dull, I'm not gonna lie to you. A fat guy behind a desk far away from our protagonist speaks with some suits as slow and boringly as possible (not even having Tony Jay voice the fat guy saves these scenes). I also found that the music drowned out half of the other sounds in the game, making stealth tougher and making it impossible to overhear conversations that you're meant to overhear. Make sure to turn that option down a good deal.\n\nThe guns feel good when you're fighting humans. Otherworldly creatures often take too many bullets and don't react enough to being shot, leading one to wonder whether you're even damaging them at all.\n\nSo I like it. I do recommend it. But I wouldn't blame you for using console cheats to go invincible or skip levels when you have to deal with doofy skeletons and anything else that just fills you with apathy. And if there's a mod out there that replaces the final boss with Wolf3D's mech suit Hitler (in all of his pixely sprite glory), I'd suggest getting it. And if there isn't, I'd suggest making it.","October 15, 2014","true","11.3"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","36","50","7","3"

Do note, however, that installing the game is not enough to have it run properly under newer systems - there is a guide available on Steam that tells us what patch to download and what files to overwrite. Once it is done, RoTW can be enjoyed even in the HD resolution!\n\nThe story of Wolfenstein has always been about Nazis and the occult. Blazkowicz, our hero, now faces some pretty gruesome monsters - beside eliminating soldiers we have lots of undead warriors here, plus, we get to see how Wilhelm Strasse's Übersoldat project unfolds. The Lopers are pretty nasty creatures - they are cyborgs whose lower body has completely been amputated and replaced with some sort of generators. Thanks to them and the undead creatures encountered in the labs, crypts, RoTW's atmosphere becomes great and creepy at times.\n\nThis is a classic shooter i.e. you shoot first then ask questions later. There are no keys to collect - just shoot everybody in your sight in order to proceed. Classic also means there are several hidden areas with lots of golden bars and chalices hidden throughout most of the levels. Finding all of them can be quite the challenge! While the game is old and has dated graphics the environments can still be appreciated. I still remember how critics marvelled at the flamethrower's effect which was one of a kind at the time.\n\nI only have two complaints about RoTW - first, it misses a shotgun. There should at least be one weapon that is efficient during close encounters. Second, there are some levels where the emphasis is on using stealth playstyle. This is not executed very well always - sometimes you do not know what the reason was for the Germans to raise the alarm.\n\nRoTW is a classic and should be played as such! Thanks to the great community there are means to run it on modern PCs and reminisce during its roughly 8-hour long campaign.\n\n","March 28","true","7.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Back before the days of regenerating health and scripted sequences. When the Quake 3 engine was still king and everyone still waited for Duke Nukem Forever.\n\nReturn to Castle Wolfenstein's most memorable element to me is its simplicity. It is very similar to Wolfy 3D in that you basically do two things in this game: Kill Nazis and find treasure. Infact it is to the game's benefit as it has aged startlingly well for a game from 2001. It encorporated elements like secret areas, treasure, eating food to restore your health etc, and added slightly more fantastical designs like mutants and zombies. RtcW is more linear than the previous game, but it has extremely good pacing and map design. You uncover shortcuts back to prior areas, and always feel in control in gunfights.\n\nIt's a shame RtcW isn't talked about as often as other games from it's era, since it is one of the best games Id ever published.

World war II element\n2. Horror\n3. High tech enemies\n4. Bosses\n5. Area called Castle Wolfenstein\n\nUnfortunately i can not call "the new order" a wolfenstein game because it has none of the elements mentioned above, the last true wolfenstein was wolfenstein 2009 (when it came out i said it sucks but after i played new order i noticed that game was actually more wolfenstein than new order) so i suggest you people specially you "new generation" kids who think if a game has out dated graphics (which RTCW does not have) that game is worthless and you should only and only buy the new one with epic graphics, the new order and old blood are not even wolfenstein game they are starwars with NO horror element and NO true boss fights like what we had in RTCW and 3D and 2009. Wolfenstein is the name of a castle which you escape from it in 3D and RTCW, and return to it in 2009 and Spear of Destiny, in wolfenstein new order this castle does not even exist so what is the point in calling that game "wolfenstein"?\n\nTo all those classic fans of wolfenstein who are playing this game since it came out in 1992, there is a JAVA mobile versino of this game called "Wolfenstein RPG" that game story is combine of wolfenstein 3D + Spear of Destiny + RtCW, and if you have not played that one then trust me your life is wasted, i love RtCW so much but RPG is something else, once you play it you see how developer of that game was so smart to combine story of 3 games into 1 and make something truely epic, make sure you play that even if you need to buy a JAVA phone.\n\nHow to run RtCW in 4K + FULL HD:\nGoogle this rtcw-sp-1.42c-win32-bin and look for download links, once it is download extract the files and copy paste them (replace) them with the orginal one in your steam directory. second step: there is a .exe file in those files you extracted run it and it starts the game without steam overlay, go to options set your resolution and graphics settings to whatever you want. save and exit the game then run the steam version. GG now you have a steam edition of RtCW in full HD and ultra textures with steam cloud support ;)","December 2, 2015","true","8.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","8"

Blazkowicz is on a mission after some Nazis and Magic artefacts, and he's once again imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein.\n\nRTCW (Too long to write) is a classic FPS, with few little innovation, and the engine is essentially a heavily modified version of the trusty Quake III Arena Engine: iD Tech 3. The most evident modifications are lightning and Flamethrower effects wich for the time really were an incredible innovation. Level structure is always linear with various settings, from castles to citadels, big large buildings, catacombs, hills and laboratories. In other words it has a large variety of ambiences, both inside building and open air.\nThe game structure is a classic "shoot-everything-breathing" but there are few sections where the mission requires your discretion, so you must use a stealth approach.\nThe story involves much more the occult side of Nazism, infact Helga von Bulow (one of your targets) is after some artifacts and as a consequence you will face some revived corpses.\nAnyways AI is something quite odd as I've noticed that soldiers and enemies in general can sight and shoot you with millimetric precision even at the longest distances which is something really ridiculous especially for the stealth sections.\nYour arsenal presents some interesting innovations and a very big variety of weapons. There are 3 kind of rifles, 2 sniper rifles, grenades, Panzerfaust and a Powerful Experimental Tesla Cannon, not to mention the Efficient Flamethrower.\nI would like to point out the possibility to play in Co-op (which is how I've played in this run) through a very good mod, you can look into it in the always useful Steam community.\n\n+++PROs+++SETTING.  Once Again We're "B.J." Blazkowicz, Once again we face the Nazi Army and much worse, from ubersoldiers to rising deads. There's a very large variety of ambiences and places to visit, so it is unlikely for the game to be boring.\nCOOP. This isn't a native option but there's a thread in the steam community discussion forum that points toward this mod: RTCWCoop.---CONs--- COMPATIBILITY ISSUES.Obviously this game's age is creating few minor issues, one of them being the 4:3 aspect ratio for the resolution. Nothing that can't be dealt with, anyways, there are useful guides in the steam community, though laptops could still have some trouble.\nWAR GODS. You're not going to face common SS Soldiers, but war gods that can and will hit you with whatever gun at any distance... repeatedly...

Shock horror, you can do that, Use a silenced weapon or go for a backstab (instant kill), while listening to your enemies chat away about simple things Thief style, as a stealth shooter it does its job if its a little rough.\n\nDecide to go loud? You have enough firepower in your arsenal, with classic WW2 weapons and a few experimental toys to play with, oh and bottomless pockets mean you can carry them all into battle and use them whever you feel like it!\n\nMap design is a little rough but still classical old school, no arrows, no waypoint markers but designed in such a way you always knew where you were going and where you were.\n\nOverall Return to Castle Wolfenstien is a great example of a classic shooter and should rank up for someone who wants to dive into old school shooters, people after yet another cookie cutter corridor crawler look elseware.","March 4, 2014","true","14.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Runs very smooth on my Windows 7 32 bit laptop without a problem. I did not see Windows 7 listed here but it works. I can't speak for the multiplayer components - I don't know if they work or not as this seems to be the original game. They do have a stand alone game I think it's called Enemy Territory - But its a standalone and not a part of the original game.\n\nThis game does include plenty of references to Nazi symbols and Hitler, and may offend some depending on someones cultrual background. My Grandmother is from Germany - And I actually showed her a portion of this game when it first came out as I owned it on disc but it ended up making her cry because of the sensitive nature of the games references.\n\nMe - I just play the game for what it is I don't let it bother me, it's just a game , nothing more.","May 8, 2014","true","0.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Even if you didn't grow up with RTCW (I didn't), you will thoroughly enjoy this game.  RTCW has LOTS of levels with varied environments, from secret Nazi labs, rocket bases, towns, haunted crypts, and even Castle Wolfenstein itself.  There's also lots of secret rooms and nazi gold to be found in the various levels, but they are hidden, so be sure to search the walls for hidden buttons and look behind every Hitler poster and swastika!\n\nThe graphics themselves are nicely detailed.  Some textures on the terrain are what you'd expect from early 2000's, but the characters themselves are actually very nice looking.\n\nMost of your guns are from the appropriate WW2 era, but you get some interesting ones like the flamethrower, tesla gun, and venom machine gun; you'll probably stick to the mp40 and sten 80% of the game though.\n\nOnly complaint with the game is that it might break it when adjusting the screen resolution higher than 1024 width, so be sure to visit pcgamingwiki to figure how to adjust the resolution and you'll have NO problem at all!\n\nAll in all I'm impressed with how well this game has held up and entertained me after over a decade of not even knowing about it.","May 26, 2014","true","40.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It is really good, and a game that I always come back to here and there. Though, the reason why I'm giving it a 9/10 and not a 10/10 is because it lacked what the Xbox could bring. ( I know Playstation had things too, but I only played the Xbox version. )\n\nThe PC version does not have the prequel mission, the shotgun, those dogs with the miniguns, rewards for getting all the secrets, and those weird zombie wizards that shoot electricity at you. But the PC version still is extremely good. It's just since I played the xbox version like crazy, I come into some areas expecting a certain enemy or weapon, only to be disappointed. I also do not use the Thompson, or m1911 (duel or single) because of the 'no reward for getting the secrets', I miss getting the ammo for those weapons since the Thompson sounds badass.\n\nThe PC version does have a few other things the Xbox version does not. Like the music in the town (Xbox version is Beethoven), the sniper scope, the stamina, and it seems that the guns and explosions sound different (Maybe not all of them, but I noticed a few better sounding things).\n\nOverall, this game is still amazing, and you should definitally get it.\nI'm not sure if the PC version has a mod that adds in what the consoles have, if it does then I'll try to download it. If not, then I guess I'll wait.\n","November 25, 2014","true","23.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/9010/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D fo sorts. Well, of prequel. Or reboot. After 9 years or so and technology advancment you shouldn't expect things to be same anyway. It's a WW2 shooter from 2001, made by id and Gray Matter and Nerve Software (one handled singleplayer, another handled multiplayer), it runs on Quake 3 engine. And well, was released in the beggining of those horrible times when every second shooter was WW2 themed.\nThere also was Enemy Territory, a sort of stand-alone multiplayer expansion pack that is free. It's not included there, but you know, it's free.\nIt also had XBox and PS2 version, both with additional prologue level and new shotgun as weapon. XBox even has 2-player coop as far as I am aware. Worth tracking down.\n\nSurprisingly, for id software title, this game on Steam works pretty fine. It just doesn't support widescreen, which I think can easily fix through config files or so. Check guides.\n\nWell, if forget that multiplayer portion still tries to use master server that was shut down times ago. In all honesty, I didn't bother fixing it, I doubt that it has active enough player base nowdays. Multiplayer the main reason people were praising this game, but with free Enemy Territory around, I don't think anybody will be playing this now.\n\nIn this game you play as agent Blazkowicz, noted for his ability to infiltrate bases and infiltrate every nazi he meets. And you have to Return to Castle Woflenstein!\nIf forget that you already start inside it and it's not as pretty as your rose-tinted nostalgia glasses were telling you, so now you have to Unreturn to Castle Wolfenstein!\nAll while learning about occult stuff on your way out, which then excites people at headquarters enough to send you to every Nazi evil project in the world, to learn more. And to sabotage every possible invention that Nazi came up with. Which is fun, no complaints.\n\nAs for game itself, well, it's an early WW2 shooter. It was past Doom times when your movement was your defence, since pretty much every attack here is hitscan. It was also before regenerating and cover systems. It's just an early realistical FPS where your main defence is how fast can you react by headshotting soldier and where you can get into unfair situation where you randomly die due to random hitscan bullets and you can't do anything but to reload quicksave until you luckily pass it.\n\nThankfully, this FPS is one of those 2000s shooters that mix stealth and action instead of fighting straight on. You could lean left and right to peek around corner. You could just walk to sneak onto enemy. And you have knife that instakills if used on the back of unaware enemy with stab stab stab animation. You will also get silenced weapons that will help you. Oh yea, and pistols in this game are useless, don't bother.\nJust don't think that Stealth is all that goodly done. It's on a weak side, somewhat, just enough to vary action up, to remove some soldiers before main action starts. It's not often required, outside of two mandatory stealth missions, that aren't as hard as worst examples in some other games. Just don't expect it to work well, you can always get noticed seemingly randomly.\n\nAnd then once alarm goes on and everybody notices you, or if it was straight action mission to begin with, you get to shooting part. And well, it's mostly reaction game. Enemies who aren't exactly aware what and where are you don't react so fast, but once they do, they can be pain. Now, you can easily outshoot common enemies. You can even effectively snipe them at long distance, and it's fun. Or you can use grenade around corner, fun too. Awesome music helps.\n\nGame gets to worst when you get to straight fight, when you can't sneak or ambush or take advantage of enviroment much. These are bad moments of gameplay. It gets worse if you meet tougher enemies in such situation. Unlike, say, enemies from Rise of The Triad, game that handles crowds of hitscan enemies, soldiers can shoot with no problem back while being shot at while screwing your aim off. And then game can have unfair situation, especially when you are on low health. Like, getting ambushed right while crawling up the ladder. Or second boss, Das Ubersoldat, immeditly hitscan-attacks you even before you can take cover or even check where you can take cover. Unless exploit his AI, mhm. Or just getting shot at by sniper in a foggy valley, where sniper is only barely visible from the fog, is placed behind tree, is on the hill somewhere on the side, and keeps dropping your aim off by shooting you succesfully. All yay quicksaves.\n\nBut hey, outside of shooting itself, game has nice exploration feel to it, despite being linear. Small detail spread over realistical, yet not painfully gray, levels. Secrets are placed through levels, nicely hidden. First mission, castle Wolfenstein, is especially awesome with all the secrets hidden. Graphics are nice. It also has plenty of less generic guns, like flamethrower or tesla gun.\nI also didn't mention the very few parts of a game where you handle undead. It becomes something more simple here. Not great by itself, but helps to vary up.\nBosses aren't great. First one is good, second is hitscan bulletsponge, final one is bulletsponge that has harder time to kill you than anybody else.\nSoundtrack is also awesome, improving atmosphere and actually helping you to get into mood required for playing this game.\n\nReturn of Castle Wolfenstein is pretty good when compared to other early WW2 shooters. It's a mix of not-so-strong stealths and not-so-strong action, which will give you fun when both of those are present. When it comes to parts with straight action, it gets as frustrating as expected, though.\nStill better than Wolf3D. It is however amazingly overrated, while being more of meh.","August 12, 2015","true","16.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

This is old school, so no regen health, no iron sights, no hand holding, no 2 weapon limit etc. the way it should be. Also one more thing to note is that this game is hard and i mean brutly hard.

Level design is pretty good in this game. It's definitly not a corridor shooter like most modern games. However I felt that a lot of secret rooms should of included health and armor instead of just treasure. Health, armor, and weapons are the reason I look for secret rooms so as to help me progress further into the game not collectables.\n\nThe quicksave system is slightly annoying. Whenever I would quicksave and then die shortly afterwards the game would not load the last quicksave but instead whatever was last loaded. So you would die, then the game would load an older save, then you have to  reload the new save. It gets quite irksome after a while and the only way around it is to immediatily quickload after qucksaving.\n\nI felt the gunplay was ok given when this game came out. I do feel that the AI in this game has unreasonable accuracy though. Their were numerous occasions where I was about to snipe someone who doesn't even see me and they would spot me at the last second and immediatly shoot and hit me sometimes before the character model even turned around fully.\n\nI didn't really care about the story that much but I don't think anyone really cares about that.\n\nOverall I would say Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a decent FPS that is really starting to show it's age. It's still by all means playable though and I would recommend it to anyone who wants an FPS that isn't a corridor shooter.","February 25, 2015","true","10.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, what I found was an incredibly solid and challenging shooter (and the best looking game from its era) that somehow made killing Nazis seem cool and different, despite being from 2001 - the eye of the WW2 shooter storm.\n\nThe secret to RTCW's success is solid core gameplay complimented by sound technical design, loads of atmosphere, and a thematically colourful and interactive world. The running and shooting all works very well, and the variety of weapons and enemy types all make for a compelling and exciting FPS. The stealth works, and the number of silenced weapons you are given allow the player the change their play-style from time to time. It's not a central feature, but it works well enough to compliment the game rather than detract from it, which is more than I expected.\n\nBut this all would mean little if it weren't for the layers draped over the framework.\n\nThe level design, while not always consistent in terms of level length or complexity, is more often than not interesting, and the variety of environments leaves the player feeling like they've experienced a great deal between the beginning and the end of the game. At its best, RTCW has multiple routes that the player can take, and plenty of secrets to uncover for the completionist. However, if one chooses to run and gun, the action is responsive and the enemies well-programmed and well-placed enough to compliment this play style as well.\n\nThe game is just dripping with atmosphere, and this is in no small part due to the fantastic sound design. The soundtrack is excellent, and on par with the classic Medal of Honor soundtracks from back when that name actually meant something. Since the narrative covers both battle-oriented military settings and creepy horror, tonally the music shifts frequently and dictates the level of tension in an individual mission, saturating the player with emotion before a single thing has happened - this is especially noticable in the creepier levels. The weapon sounds are similarly powerful and convey a sense of accuracy skewed just enough towards dramatic licence to give each shot a sense of fulfilling drama. A small but powerful feature is the changing sound of the gunfire as the enemies move further away - the crack of a nearby rifle gives way to a dull thud as they are fired in the distance, and enhances the tension of the battles as your brain is left to process the direction and distance of the shot, and you are immersed further into the world.\n\nI found the voice acting to be delightfully tongue-in-cheek as the actors embrace the schlocky nature of the story and deliver their lines entertainingly, allowing the tone of the game to shift from moment to moment and lifting the game beyond a single note played ad infinitum.\n\nI also was pleased with the in-game narrative dealt up to the player. Whilst there are a number of cutscenes that are not always that compelling, from level-to-level one can find a number of papers to read, or pick up on enemy conversations that are shockingly effective at rounding out the otherwise faceless goons that you plow through. One particular example is a conversation between and officer and a subordinate regarding a soldier that has been sent to the wine cellar to find some wine and has failed to return. As you venture around the level you can eventually hear some drunken singing, and you find the soldier in question staggering around one of the cellars. Not only does this give the NPCs some personality, but it also adds to the larger narrative, in which you are infiltrating a city in which there are a number of officers gathering for an event. You know how they're occupying themselves, and how they treat those around them, and it all adds up to make you feel like you're in a real place, which is essential for a game that is trying to sell you a fictional story of such outlandish proportions.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a solid shooter that is a cut above the rest in terms of imagination and personality.\n\nP.S. In 2001, the leather-clad she-Nazis were the hottest things in gaming.","December 27, 2014","true","5.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You can run the game in High video settings & the graphics look awesome!   This games engine feels revolutionary for all the war games that would follow up in the years to come [ call2d00ty] & such.   & Quiet frankly I don't think those shooters are too appealing to me, but it's always nice to pay respect to the older grand dady of games.\n\nLevel design seems pretty cool thus far, secret areas to be found in each lvl.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/9010/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","shooting nazis.\n\nThis is the third game in the Wolfenstein FPS series and fifth overall, released in 2001 and still playable even today, especially when compared with its preceding titles. (Not that they were bad, but they are considerably more dated.) Notably, it was developed by Gray Matter Studios, the same people behind Call of Duty's expansion pack United Offensive, with help from Nerve Software. iD only published it.\n\n\nYou play as Agent B.J. Blazkowicz, allied saboteur/spy/killing machine sent behind Nazi lines in World War II to...spy on the Nazis, specifically their paranormal activities. Unfortunately, you and your fellow agent-in-arms are captured and sent to the ubiquitous Castle Wolfenstein, where you must make your escape from the retrofitted dungeon.\n\nThe gameplay consists of making your way through levels and fulfilling objectives in any available manner you see fit - there's little hand-holding here. The levels are designed well and realistically, and even when they are linear it does a good job of convincing you otherwise, like in Half-Life.\n\nObviously there are Nazis in your way, and the number of weapons you get to choose from to kill them grow in accordance with the types you'll face. RTCW starts out akin to Call of Duty: World at War, but starts to resemble something more like that game's zombie mode pretty quickly and gets hairier from there.\n\nThe gunplay is great. Most of your weapons are generally useful, and you'll go from blasting troopers with a pilfered MP40 to silencing enemies with a silenced Sten that is both accurate and great fun to use, to roasting all manner of monsters with flamethrowers, Panzerschrecks and other big guns.\n\n\nInteractivity isn't something you might expect from a game like this, but there's a good amount of it here. If an enemy sets off an alarm, you are capable of switching it off or simply destroying it to silence the alarm. You have a dedicated kick button, which lets you kick down doors and destroy objects with your mighty boot such as pictures of Hitler. Sometimes you must do things like destroying walls to continue. There are also secrets to be found in the levels, containing health, ammunition and sometimes Nazi treasure, akin to Wolf3D. The treasure does nothing but increase your treasure counter at the end-of-level score screen, but it's nice to grab it anyway.\n\nThere are two stealth levels that are nice ideas in theory but can prove frustrating and sometimes nonsensical in practice. Expect them to take a few tries, and don't be afraid to save. There are also ways to take stealthy approaches to the other missions, which are much more enjoyable.\n\n\nThe game has 3 difficulty settings, which are basically akin to the three hardest from Wolfenstein 3-D, the easiest setting from that game being removed. Playing on the middle difficulty, by the time you're nearing the end of the game it will prove rather challenging, with health and armor (especially armor) in short supply and a good amount of tough enemies...and those are just the regular mooks. There is no shame in quicksaving at certain points, or really ever but that's another matter. The AI is generally good, but not perfect (elite troops barrel rolling into walls come to mind), and while the final boss has the distiction of being easier than the levels preceding it you still need to watch yourself.\n\nI have not played the multiplayer, but as far as I know it still has a relatively small amount of players. It primarily revolves around Axis players defending installations from Allied attackers, and is class-based. There is also a free multiplayer-only title out there called Enemy Territory that contains more features.\n\nOverall I'd place RTCW as a slightly below-average length game, but with how atmospheric and difficult it can be you'll likely spend a decent chunk of time during your first playthrough.\n\n\nRTCW runs off the Quake III Arena engine, which means fast default movement speeds and strafejumping when the levels permit it, but you can change it to a slower walk if you wish for a more realistic/difficult game. I'm sure this accounts for the graphics, as well, because when you max it out (and it's easy to do), the game looks very good, especially for a 2001 title! There is a fan patch to increase resolution sizes beyond 1028x760 and enable widescreen, but I personally couldn't get it to work and I didn't feel a need for it.\n\nThe plot, as befitting a Wolfenstein game of this period in the series, revolves around sci-fi/occult Nazi meddling with a bit of camp and a portion of horror. It can get outlandish at times, but the atmosphere the game presents only serves to complement it. If you're at all interested in secret Nazi stuff and alternate history, or blowing up secret Nazi stuff - especially with their own wunderwaffe - you'll probably like it.\n\nTony Jay is a voice actor here, and he's good as usual. That's worth quite a bit, at least.\n\nWhile the game is good, I'm not sure about the Elite Guards. They're an all-woman enemy force, and while it's nice to see women taking action-oriented roles I could do without them wearing revealing outfits that I'm not sure are entirely practical. They serve as challenging enemies at least, but that's about it.","August 10, 2012","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is defnitely fast and dynamic, the gameplay is a good mix of styles - gun blazing, fast running, and even stealth - you must complete the entire mission without making any noise, which is great. The weapons are just normal, you can find many well-known weapons from world war II, like german MP-40 or classic american M1A1 Thompson. The effects are incredible, especially flame. AI ain't all that bright, but it's not a big deal after all. The good thing is you can always try to sneak from the back and backstab your enemy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/9010/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","205 products in account","A pretty enjoyable old FPS from the early days. I once played this game a few years ago and got bored in the middle of going through the Ancient Burial Site at the beginning. But that was a younger and more foolish me that we don't refer to in conversations anymore. I've returned to Wolfenstein II: Return to Castle (An odd title, but whatever), to look at it professionally as an adult.\n\nFor what it's worth, RtCW has a solid story. It's not entirely as clever as saaaaaay.... Half-Life, but it gets it's job done. It's actually quite similar to the style of story that Star Wars: Dark Forces has. You're a gun-toting manly man where the only bit of personality he has is "likes to shoot guns" that goes on a secret mission and slowly uncovers more information on this secret of an evil government and getting tons of huge guns as you finally get to the humongous boss. The plots are pretty identical, when you look at it in that aspect. But what Return holds over Dark Forces is it's more subtle craft of telling it's story. Sure, it has too heavy of a reliance on cutscenes where the information is so thick it might as well be your mum trying to spoon-feed you double-fudge cake (Where as Dark Forces had a little file you could read... well, I can't see that as much better. I guess it's moot point then).\n\nWhat I mean is... there are points in the story that are crafty. They tell you what's going on without any words at all......... Like Half-Life. BUT they're still commendable! For example, near the end of the game you encounter the Nazi rite ceremony and the Nazis that are left behind have to fend for themselves against the crypt's guardians... and they're sucking at it. By telling how their skins look and the scripted event that happens in-game, it tells you exactly what you need to know without directly telling you.\n\nIn fact, there are a few moments you can read letter (though I'm sure most people ignore them because who reads in video games, am I right?) And I ended up reading a few, and I came to a conclusion. Return has a good sense of humor. The little small-talk between Nazis is enjoyable to listen to before you inevitably splatter their brains across the floor, and sometimes it's funny to cross a letter in a top-secret lab where the priority message being send out is for an emergency delivery of chocolate. The game had me laugh at a few parts, I won't lie.\n\nThe level design in this game is good, too. It really has a good color-palatte that shows a lot of variety to it. Some scenes make you feel stealthy, some make you feel like you're trampling on unholy grounds, and some make you feel like the next step you take could be your demise. Because this game is very hard. Very hard. It's hard as balls. Well, it's not the most difficult game, but it still is hard. Some of the most irritatingly difficult enemies I've ever faced in an FPS (The Nazi women, the Uber Soldat, the Electro... spinner... thingies) are found in this game. If you like a nice ramping difficulty curve with good level design, here you go.\n\nHowever, there are some faults in this game. The sound certainly hasn't aged well. Crumbling rocks sound like soundbites from... Half-Life, and some of the voice-acting is a little less that what it could be at parts. But the guns sound fine, and the majority of the voice actors are very decent. And perhaps the best sound is that of your flamethrowere and you move it in circles. THAT is a good sound effect. Another downside is that while the level design is good, it has this vague side to it at times. Where you'll be running around and realizing you missed one small corridor or room because some doors and hallways blend a little too well with the rest of the background and after seeing someone else do it on a walkthrough makes you slap your forehead like you're an idiot or something.\n\nIt's not a perfect FPS (Like Half-Life), but Return to Castle Wolfenstein is still an excellent one, that I'd recommend to anyone who wants some great game design and a pretty decent story.","September 4, 2015","true","9.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In it, you take on the role of an Allied soldier working his way through waves of nazi soldiers and supernatural elements that the SS have brought to life in order to turn the tides of WWII. It's irreverent, and is actually still quite a lot of fun.\n\nI'm not sure how much of a community remains for the multiplayer element, but in its heyday this was one of the best multiplayer experiences one could have.\n\nEffectively, this is one of the few FPS I can think of which straddles the need to hide behind cover of modern shooters for the complete insanity of running into mobs of enemies of older shooters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/9010/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","205 products in account","A pretty enjoyable old FPS from the early days. I once played this game a few years ago and got bored in the middle of going through the Ancient Burial Site at the beginning. But that was a younger and more foolish me that we don't refer to in conversations anymore. I've returned to Wolfenstein II: Return to Castle (An odd title, but whatever), to look at it professionally as an adult.\n\nFor what it's worth, RtCW has a solid story. It's not entirely as clever as saaaaaay.... Half-Life, but it gets it's job done. It's actually quite similar to the style of story that Star Wars: Dark Forces has. You're a gun-toting manly man where the only bit of personality he has is "likes to shoot guns" that goes on a secret mission and slowly uncovers more information on this secret of an evil government and getting tons of huge guns as you finally get to the humongous boss. The plots are pretty identical, when you look at it in that aspect. But what Return holds over Dark Forces is it's more subtle craft of telling it's story. Sure, it has too heavy of a reliance on cutscenes where the information is so thick it might as well be your mum trying to spoon-feed you double-fudge cake (Where as Dark Forces had a little file you could read... well, I can't see that as much better. I guess it's moot point then).\n\nWhat I mean is... there are points in the story that are crafty. They tell you what's going on without any words at all......... Like Half-Life. BUT they're still commendable! For example, near the end of the game you encounter the Nazi rite ceremony and the Nazis that are left behind have to fend for themselves against the crypt's guardians... and they're sucking at it. By telling how their skins look and the scripted event that happens in-game, it tells you exactly what you need to know without directly telling you.\n\nIn fact, there are a few moments you can read letter (though I'm sure most people ignore them because who reads in video games, am I right?) And I ended up reading a few, and I came to a conclusion. Return has a good sense of humor. The little small-talk between Nazis is enjoyable to listen to before you inevitably splatter their brains across the floor, and sometimes it's funny to cross a letter in a top-secret lab where the priority message being send out is for an emergency delivery of chocolate. The game had me laugh at a few parts, I won't lie.\n\nThe level design in this game is good, too. It really has a good color-palatte that shows a lot of variety to it. Some scenes make you feel stealthy, some make you feel like you're trampling on unholy grounds, and some make you feel like the next step you take could be your demise. Because this game is very hard. Very hard. It's hard as balls. Well, it's not the most difficult game, but it still is hard. Some of the most irritatingly difficult enemies I've ever faced in an FPS (The Nazi women, the Uber Soldat, the Electro... spinner... thingies) are found in this game. If you like a nice ramping difficulty curve with good level design, here you go.\n\nHowever, there are some faults in this game. The sound certainly hasn't aged well. Crumbling rocks sound like soundbites from... Half-Life, and some of the voice-acting is a little less that what it could be at parts. But the guns sound fine, and the majority of the voice actors are very decent. And perhaps the best sound is that of your flamethrowere and you move it in circles. THAT is a good sound effect. Another downside is that while the level design is good, it has this vague side to it at times. Where you'll be running around and realizing you missed one small corridor or room because some doors and hallways blend a little too well with the rest of the background and after seeing someone else do it on a walkthrough makes you slap your forehead like you're an idiot or something.\n\nIt's not a perfect FPS (Like Half-Life), but Return to Castle Wolfenstein is still an excellent one, that I'd recommend to anyone who wants some great game design and a pretty decent story.","September 4, 2015","true","9.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Fast paced and challenging gameplay paired up with a great atmosphere, and a sweet soundtrack. RtCW offers fantastic environments and an arsenal of awesome weapons. The weapons themselves look and feel perfect. The gun models in this game are easily among my favorites and the recoil mechanics work well, which makes shooting Nazis and the undead feel great. Return also features a leaning system which is helpful for scouting out enemy positions. The campaign contains very memorable missions, such as fighting zombies and ghosts in a spooky crypt below a German occupied village, or sneaking your way through a forest, stealthfully taking out German positions as you go, which ultimately leads to an enemy compound and after taking out all the guards, you hop into the back of a truck that takes you into the base. Return to Castle Wolfenstein puts you in a place where you truly feel all alone, isolated and stuck facing the odds. In certain missions, I found myself wanting to stop playing, simply because the atmosphere made me feel uncomfortable. RtCW is a must own for WWII first-person shooter fans. Straight up, fun World War II action.","May 5, 2014","true","16.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is also a wide range of enemies, including Nazis, mummies/zombies, more powerful Nazis, X-Creatures (which are what make the later parts of the game really challenging), and even more powerful Nazis.

While it isn't an AMAZING title, I can't think of anything that I didn't like about the game. Everything it does is at minimum good.\n\nPROS:\n- Good mix of different kinds of missions, from run in and blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything to sneak around and try not to sound the alarm.\n- The guns are very well balanced so you will actually find yourself probably using almost every type of artillary you can get your hands on. Each type of gun is suited to different types of situations and/or enemies.\n- Good balance of different types of enviornments from castles, crypts, dams, ice fields, arial bases, etc.\n\nWhen I think of how to rate a game I try to compare it to similar games of its genre within its time period. I think Duke 3D is a better title than Return in general. And System Shock 2 is well... System Shock 2. That game is omega tier good. Return to Castle Wolfenstein isn't quite as good as either of those titles but it is still a lot of fun. Return takes about 10 hours play time to finish.\n\n8.5/10\n\nPlease upvote this review if you found it useful :)","May 16, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Definition of "raising the bar". This game will always hold a special place in my heart as it was the first game I played with a 3D graphics card. Ah, the old Quantex (no longer in business) Pentium II, 233 mgz and no memory to speak of. The GeForce I crammed in was too powerful for the old bird and continually crashed the system. The game ran like ♥♥♥, but it ran, and I must have played through it ten times in a row. Great action, great sound, great story. Kudos for the subtle humor and attention to detail. Nails the pseudo-serious atmosphere perfectly; you could leave all the occult stuff out and it would still be a quality war game about killing Nazis, but there's a fantastic science-fiction story to boot!

I hadn't played it for almost 10 years and I decided to give it a shot. Honestly, I was blown away with how well it has aged.\n\nIt's a shooter, but it's constructed very well. The levels are linear, but they also feel open. Lots of corridors and extra rooms to explore (2 or more secret areas for those who wish to find them). The shooting feels and sounds good. Each gun has it's own unique punchy sound and there's a huge variety. By the end of the game, you're carrying 11 different guns and 3 different explosives.\n\nThe story is cheesy and the voice acting is awful, but it's intriguing. If you've ever been fascinated with the Nazi's rumored interests in experimental weaponry, the paranormal and other weird things, RtCW takes that and runs with it.\n\nMy only complaint, is that some of the enemies are very bullet-spongy. It could take 5-6 rounds from the Paratrooper Rifle (the best in the game IMO) to take down a Paratrooper solider. Some enemies can even withstand more than one or two rounds from a sniper rifle. Annoying.\n\nIf you ever want to play an "older" shooter, give RtCW a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nNote: Be sure to download the community patch that enables widescreen. It's a simple drag and drop installation and stable. I had no issues during my 8 hours with the game.","October 7, 2013","true","8.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It was on sale and I was REALLY hoping that people still played this, but there are NO servers. So don't get this for multiplayer. However, I really enjoyed the campaign. The story is meh, but the gameplay is great! Its the classic gameplay of picking up health packs and killing everything (almost) with a wide range of weapons. There is also a wide range of enemies, including Nazis, mummies/zombies, more powerful Nazis, X-Creatures (which are what make the later parts of the game really challenging), and even more powerful Nazis. Overall, this is a good campaign that I would recommend if wanting classic gameplay.\n8/10","June 14, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Fast paced and challenging gameplay paired up with a great atmosphere, and a sweet soundtrack. RtCW offers fantastic environments and an arsenal of awesome weapons. The weapons themselves look and feel perfect. The gun models in this game are easily among my favorites and the recoil mechanics work well, which makes shooting Nazis and the undead feel great. Return also features a leaning system which is helpful for scouting out enemy positions. The campaign contains very memorable missions, such as fighting zombies and ghosts in a spooky crypt below a German occupied village, or sneaking your way through a forest, stealthfully taking out German positions as you go, which ultimately leads to an enemy compound and after taking out all the guards, you hop into the back of a truck that takes you into the base. Return to Castle Wolfenstein puts you in a place where you truly feel all alone, isolated and stuck facing the odds. In certain missions, I found myself wanting to stop playing, simply because the atmosphere made me feel uncomfortable. RtCW is a must own for WWII first-person shooter fans. Straight up, fun World War II action.","May 5, 2014","true","16.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is great gor old-school fans, however it feels slightly like a more modern experience than something like, say, Quake II.\n\nPros:\n+Graphics that hold up well (for me, at least)\n+Nice environmental effects (some destruction in the environments, though mostly cinematic.)\n+Its got the old-school (even wolfenstein 3-D-esque) secrets, which are usually hidden behind a cracked, destructible wall, these award armor, health, ammo, and maybe even some treasure (Completely useless, but believe me, its satisfing to pick up)\n+Cool enemy diversity, all with different techniques/usage of the environments, that will help you to kill them.\n\ncons\n-Fighting some of the Nazis can be a pain in the a**, tbh, because your screen will go all over the place when they shoot you(This is not horrible, but a minor annoyance)\n\n-Some of the  supernatural enemies are a complete annoyance, with seeking gouls, that hit you, take away  5+ of your health, make the screen go black, and you cant kill them, or really do anything to stop them. There are also other instances of hit-scan enemies, and some bothersome crap\n\n-Cutscenes (are skippable) pretty much consist of 2-4 guys, standing around in a room, and talking about information that,\nA, Does not matter\nB, You already know this\nIt doesnt help, as well, that the voice acting is sub-par.\n\n-There are to stealth only sequences, the first makes sense in the context, the 2nd is just taking fun, and shoving down the toilet. It took me MANY tries, until i realized a place to go to get an (extremely helpful) weapon.\n\nI would say, if you are an old-school fan, or just an extremely open-minded gamer (who doesnt mind a mix of oldschool overpowered shooter, mixed with some story/cutscenes, and *sighs* stealth sequences) you will probably enjoy this game, its not perfect, but by no means does it suck.\n\n7.8/10\n\nP.S. sorry if this review was hard to read, or just sub-par, im actually only 12 ( :P )\nI will welcome any feedback/constructive critiscism)","December 21, 2015","true","9.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/recommended/9010/","Saleck","Saleck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Saleck/","650 products in account","If you put a World War 2 shooter in front of me, I'd usually look up at you and say "Excuse me, this isn't what I ordered! Take it back and try again!". My dislike of them is quite high. So when everyone started singing the praises of Wolfenstein: The New Order, I thought "Looks like I better have a go with at least one of them" and gave Return to Castle Wolfenstein a shot. Turns out I quite liked it.\n\nYou probably already know about Return to Castle Wolfenstein. A First-Person Shooter set in an alternate reality where the Nazis usually have access to technology they normally wouldn't do. In this case, it's occult magic! As B.J. Blazkowicz, it is your job to find out what the Nazis are up to, kill them all through fairly linear levels and not say a single word to anyone. Bullets are all the talking this fella needs.\n\nB.J. Blazkowicz will be sent to some very different locations over the course of seven chapters, slowly understanding what Heinrich Himmler and the "SS Paranormal Division" are up to. The locations are nicely constructed and have some nice variation to them.\n\nI have to say, I wasn't expecting as much stealth as there was which was a pleasent surprise. I'd definitely call this a FPS Stealth game. Unfortunately, the game does have a habit of forcing this in some parts of missions. You get seen, its "MISSION FAILED" and back to the beginning for you. That's how real life works right?\n\nThese sections tend to be brief though and, outside of these constraints, the overall stealth works really well. You can be rewarded with eavesdropping over funny little conversations the Nazis have if you manage to stealth around. If you screw up majorly with stealthing, not every enemy in the map is alerted about it (unless an alarm goes off). This gaves the player the chance to recover from mistakes and keeps the game interesting.\n\nThere are plenty of secrets are to be found around the levels, usually containing Nazi Gold. One thing I really liked about this game is, before you're just about to finish a level, the game will tell you how many secrets and Nazi gold you found, giving you the opportunity to turn around and go back and find it! A feature that needs to be in more games with this sort of stuff inside it. Don't let me finish the level and THEN tell me what I missed, making me reload an earlier save if I have one at all if I want to go find all the goodies.\n\nThe secrets aren't too hard to find and don't add anything to the overall outcome of the game, just fun little rewards for exploration.\n\nIf I have a few gripes with the game (and I always do), the  snipers can feel a bit unfair on the higher difficulty levels  and  the end boss was laughably bad. Just circle-strafe around it and shoot until dead  but they didn't sour the experience too much.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable game.\n\nFor the best experience possible, use the unofficial patch from here > http://www.markshan.com/knightmare/","March 8, 2015","true","14.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I felt like a lot of the levels were copied straight from Goldeneye, but were still lame & dreary. There's nothing wrong with this game, its just mediocre or okay at everything. The terminator fights are BS, the paratrooper rifle makes it too easy, the cinematics are boring, the graphics look bland, the final boss is too easy. Most of all, instant failure stealth missions are STUPID.  Most games dont do that now.

There is a total of 7 linear missions to blast your way through and, as per all ID software games, there are hidden areas and goodies to be had. The sound is average and unfortunately the developers had the German soldiers speaking in German accented English. This is very dull compared to Wolfensteins occasional screams of 'mein laben!' and 'achtung!'.\n\nLucky there is a variety of guns to put to good use from your tradional dagger to pistols to machine guns to a tesla gun (among others). With all the options I found there was too much ammo in the game. The AI aren't completely stupid and will often hide and make you flush them out. They will also try to avoid grenades and will sometimes kick them back to you! They also have the ability to notice dead comrades and realise something is amiss and will either come searching for you or sound the alarm.\n\nThe story line is a little lacking making me feel they just chucked in a heap of fluff to try and get some length to the game. It does, however, take you everywhere from towns, snow peaks, large open areas and underground caverns (to name a few) so there is plenty to see.\n\nConclusion : Don't expect epic content from this game but if you'd like to take a crack at a classic then this would definately count.\n\nOther notes : I would go through the process of creating a saved game. I would have to double check through the save menu to make sure it had since sometimes it didn't!","October 2, 2014","true","16.5"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I felt I needed to see if my opinion changed after all these years...\n\nConsidering there are many better games that came out before and after this, with better gameplay/mechanics/everything, this game should be skipped.\n\nYes, it's a WW2 shooter, so it will feature all the usual weapons (and being an FPS, they are the main characters).  But they all feel boring to use (or awful like the grenades).  There are many to use, but unlike Half-Life there is limited weapon stacking (where if you press "3" you get several options).  This will make combat in the later stages of the game needlessly awkward trying to stretch and blindly press the correct key to get the venom cannon/whatever (seriously, why isn't the panzerfaust, venom, and tesla all set to one key?).\n\nDevelopers: "Hey there was this amazing game called 'Half-life' and they have this great idea that unclutters the weapon selection which make combat run smoothly... let's partially implement it on the early stage weapons that become pretty superfluous as the game progresses!"\n\nThe combat is garbage and requires  lots of trial and error or exploiting the A.I. of the super soldiers (which takes some trial and error to find where you can exploit it).  Imagine, you come across one of the many boring enemy designs (like a paratrooper/bullet-sponge) you land the first hits.  As you're emptying your magazine into them, they lock onto you fire back, then messing with your aim (even though you already dumped several seconds of close range shooting at them).  Why?  It makes no sense that they would implement a staggering mechanic that only affects you but not the opponents.\n\nDevelopers: "So there is this game called 'Unreal' and it has great combat and balancing, so much so that winning and losing is based on player movement and skill.  Let's make movement hinder weapon accuracy (only for the player) and give all the enemys hitscan weapons!"\n\nThe atmosphere and story telling is ugly and stupid.  First off, the entire premise is campy as ♥♥♥♥: nazis trying make super soldiers, zombies, nazi-ninja femme-fatales, and all that.  This would be better if the game didn't take itself so seriously.  Because it does, the developers also thought it would be cool to make everything a boring hue of poop like all the quake games.\n\nDevelopers: "There was this game that came out a year before that had a fun story, great level design, amazing voice acting, genuinely humorous gags, all the while being colorful and interesting to look at.  I think it was called 'No One Lives Forever.'  Let's not copy any of those things!"\n\nThere are good things about this game though: the Multiplayer WAS GREAT.  But as this game is old, that community is long gone.\n\nAnd at least this game is short (why is the last cinematic not skippable?).\n\nWaste your money on this heap (I did twice!) if you want to not spend time playing a good game.\n","May 9, 2015","false","7.3"," 12 of 62 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","12","62","0","10"

A keyboard and mouse offer excellent control although certain things, such as aiming down sights, lack polish.\n\nHowever, the graphics have not aged nearly as well: textures are blurry and animations, clunky.  Although some elements, such as the Nazi mysticism, add much needed interest, the story falls flat. The more interesting enemies go mostly unused: expect to grind through waves and waves of enemy soldiers.

The question becomes does this game pass the test of time? ie. can you still have fun with this game today as you did when it first came out? And for me the answer is no. The first person shooter genre doesn't age as gracefully as other genres because the genre has been developed and refined so much over the years it becomes very easy to see all the flaws in older games.\n\nThis game has some serious flaws. First off the level design is big and often times very confusing. I love exploring large levels however when the environments look the same it feels like I'm running through a maze.\n\nIn addition the enemies feel like bullet sponges, at the same time enemies can fill you with an entire clip of their weapon in the span of a few seconds making saving and reloading your best weapon.\n\nThen they added stealth in the game. Nothing says fast paced shooting like stealth. I love stealth but in doesn't work in this game. In fact the stealth mission they added to the game is possibly one of the worst implemenations of stealth I have ever seen. You have to do EXACTLY what the developers want you to do or else you will fail the mission leading to some very frustrating moments.\n\nWhen I played this game when it first came out I really enjoyed it, however the game has aged horribly it terms of its gameplay and design. I actually think the original DOOM games are more fun and aged better than this game.\n\nIf you want some nostalgia and want to play this game then you might enjoy it, if you never played this game before your probably not going to like it at all.","September 4, 2014","false","6.4"," 4 of 74 people (5%) found this review helpful","5","4","74","0","0"

Immediately, the Allies send their best agents from the fictional Office of Secret Actions (OSA) to investigate the dig site at Wolfenstein.  Unfortunately, the OSA spies are captured and tortured.  Players take the role of B.J. Blaskowitcz, one of the captured spies.  After escaping Wolfenstein and the Heinrich archaeological dig deemed unimportant for the time being, the OSA send Blaskowicz on various missions to sabotage the Paranormal Divisions's other efforts across Europe.  As he gathers intelligence from his travels, B.J. uncovers the significance of Wolfenstein and the SS's plan for Heinrich I.\n\nGameplay\n\nRtCW simultaneosly preserves and innovates its lineage.  This is a first person shooter with a great balance between gameplay and story.  Levels appear linear, but further investigation reveals secret levers, buttons, walls that can be destroyed, and other hidden switches that can lead to shortcuts, treasure to increase your score, or secret weapon caches.  Thus while the main goal is to complete the level, RtCW is a fun game just to look around in since you'll never know what you'll find.  In terms of shooting mechanics, their are crouch and lean mechanics giving the game a tactical approach.  Indeed, a stealth approach (silenced weapons, backstabs, minimal offensive fire) is advised and required for some portions of the game.  When the bullet start to fly though, there is a hefty arsenal of tools to employ.  SMG's, pistols, rifles, flamethrowers, rocket launchers, and other weaponry all have their uses.  Every weapons has different stopping power and ammo availibility, so you can choose to save your Thompson for tougher enemies or rely on the weaker but more available German weapons.  I almost consider RtCW to be survival horror at times because many of the supernatural enemies you will fight in the game take a lot of bullets to put down.  The segments with the X-Creatures are particularly tense in this regard.  There is also some puzzle solving and a few logic puzzles.\n\nRtCW is a single player experience with the only game mode being the campaign.  There are mods that can make it co-op (which would be pretty cool) but I did not try them.  That being said, the five or so campaign missions themselves can take quite a while to complete.  Each mission has 4-7 chapters that took me on average a half-hour to complete probably.  The AI can be brutal at times even on normal and some sections are trial and error.  But there are some truly memorable moments here, such as moving through the Saxon tombs in the beginning of the game or later on infiltrating the X-Labs.\n\nDesign\n\nOld games do not always translate well but I find RtCW to be one of the best.  The dialogue is great, the music bold and brash but also quite intimidating at times.  The tomb segments are some of my favorites, with dim lighting, armored skeletons, and eery noises.  You certainly do not start this game expecting it to get creepy but it sure does.  Enemies are well animated with only the death animations a little stiff for humans.  The Quake engine may be old, but boy does it hold up here.  Lighting and sound are both excellent and except for the occasional rough looking texture, the game has great atmosphere.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nRtCW is a testament to the timelessness of shooters from around the turn of the century.  Despite it's age, it manages to capture the spirit of Wolfenstein and always amps up the action when you least expect it.

But the gameplay is very interesting and the story as well. They have cutscenes too. They have multiplayer so feel free to try it out. If you are more interested in the story, then i would recommend it. On highest difficulty in the story the enemies are better at aiming and quick at reacting. You dont lose alot of hp like previous wolfenstein games, but regardless its STILL hard.

You get no nonsense slow motion, combos, skills etc.  Just run, point and shoot.\nYou play as American agent something shooting Nazis and zombies.\n\nThe good:\n1. Fast pace.\n2. The main character, whatever his name is, has no existential crises.  Too many games characters have those these days.\n\nThe bad:\n2. The game is not memorable at all.  It has no atmosphere to speak of.\n3. The missions are short and the levels forgettable.  There are secrets and loot?\n4. Enemies are mostly far off.  You have to squint and shoot.  This means strafing is basically nonexistent other than in 2 boss fights.\n5. Enemies' ability to spot you varies between non-existent and super hawk-eye randomly.\n\nThe ugly:\n6.

Yes, BJ returns to Castle Wolfenstein to take out Heinrich Himmler who has started to dabble in the occult as a way to boost the conquering power of the Nazi regime.  Something goes wrong, (of course), and BJ must deal with the terrible power Himmler unleashes.\n\nGood old fun all around :D  During a sale, this is a must have for any serious library.

This may be long, but worth skimming if you're interested in buying.\n\nAs a child, game mechanics, wonky controls, poor story and bad graphics were completely ignored and off our radars as young, fresh gamers. I remember my dad playing this game on our Windows 98 desktop. We had the Game of the Year edition which I own to this dad, but sadly got corrupted, so I bought the Steam version. My dad and I were blown away by the destructable objects, hidden areas and terrifying enemies. Now, coming back to it a decade and a half later, the novelty as not worn off. It feels the same and thinking about it critically makes me more impressed at how well this game has stood the test of time. Coming back to older games, I find myself thinking "This looks like crap" "how did I let that cinematic go and not laugh at its stupidity" "these controls are terrible". Coming back to this, I found myself amazed at the fact that I was only saying "This is still terrifying" "I don't remember that secret room" "Woah, that's awesome."\n\nThis game had impressive graphics for its time and gives the same Doom/Quake FPS feel that most early FPS players are accustomed to. What makes this game unique is its level designs, enemies and believe it or not, horror-themed atmosphere build ups. Each level makes you feel like you're in that place and gives you a real sense of presence that other old FPS games completely ignore. The story is great too, though its no Metal Gear Solid or other intricate storylines, but it gives you a goal, an enemy and context. You really take on the role of an OSA agent fighting advanced Nazi technology. The action unfolds around you where in modern shooters it would be in a cutscene free from your control. The music and ambience doesn't get old and adds to the experience and sounds (although silly, like falling bones or collapsing bodies) are superb.\n\nShould you get this game? That's up to you, but not only is this game a pinnacle moment in gaming's "Golden Age", but it is still enjoyable and entertaining to this day. For those new to the Wolfenstein series who may have come in through "Wolfenstein" in 2009 or "The New Order" I highly recommend you check out this stepping stone in the series. Don't get it so you can say you've played it, get it because you will like it.\n\n10/10 My favorite game out of the thousands I've ever played.","November 4, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wow is this game still something. In my opinion, this is the best Wolfenstein game to come out, and hes why I believe so.\n\nThere is good weapon choices. Sten is silenced, does more damage, but to balance it, the gun can overheat after 5-6 shots. The MP-40 is a good spray gun and so is the Minigun. The game is a mixture of hard and fun. The game is really challenging, the Elite Nazi ladies are a pain in the ♥♥♥♥, and the boss fights are tough. The game still is fun, like the Forest mission where youre forced to play stealth. That leads me to the next point. THE GAME ISN'T LINEAR. This is really rare for an FPS. RtCW features no map, compass, etc. so the game is up to you how to complete it. I found myself using the supressed luger and Sten the most to be stealthy, and the amount of secret rooms keep you interested. Also, because its not linear, there are a lot of replayablity choices.\n\nGameplay: 10/10 - My first perfect, and it really deserves it for its choices. Either slow paced stealth where youre crouched the whole game, or fast paced shooting where your jumping around spraying, its entirely upto you.\nGraphics: 6/10 - Old game and the graphics aren't good. Luckly, there are HD texture packs.\n\nOverall, I normally only factor graphics as 20% of the overall grade, 40% if the gameplay is so bad and the only thing keeping it alive is the graphics. However, we could rule out the graphics for this game and I'd still rate it a solid 9/10. The gameplay is so compelling that it's a ton of fun after 2-3 playthroughs.","July 9, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/9010/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A pretty straightforward run & shoot Quake 3: Arena mod; get to an objective while killing off Nazi forces and abnormal looking enemies to keep alive. The game gradually gets tougher as you progress through the missions where new enemies who unnaturally aim better and have more powerful guns will start coming in.\n\nIt could just be my computer but I get severe & random frame drops every now and again despite most of the game going at 60-90+ FPS.\n\nThe maps in the game are both linear with a few very small paths to find secrets & supplies & whatnot and somewhat open where objectives may have you do some bothersome backtracking. The backtracking really can be a bother since there aren't usually any visible indications on where to go next for anything. In some relatively open maps I had to do some running around to find where I had to go which I'm usually fine with until things like locked doors that have been passed by minutes ago only become unlocked with very little to no indication of the door being unlocked after an objective is reached on another side of the map happens.\n\nAlthough the game is generally straightforward with its shooting there are stealth mechanics in the game, which seem pretty weak. At the very least it functions; crouch or walk up behind an enemy and use a suppressed gun or backstab with a knife to silently kill them while avoiding enemy detection. The problem is that it seems a bit out of place for a game that's generally all about being fast and shooty. The stealth is optional in most missions and I think for the most part there are times where detection is unavoidable.\nAfter an enemy spots you it seems like headshots become almost non-existant when all enemies are aware of your presence. They don't die instantly when taking in a headshot or the spreadless-shots hitting the body instead of the head despite the reticle aimed at the face. There are objectives where you can't allow the enemy to hit the alarm if you've been found which in this game is more annoying than it is fun. Fortunately objectives like those are incredibly minimal in number.\n\nThere are a chunk of weapons you can have in the game almost all practical one way or another. The only guns in the game I found to be useless are the two available pistols which all shoot very slowly and are generally weak\n\nI could be observing this one wrong but the hitboxes for anything look like they go all over the place. When firing something with incredibly little spread aimed aproximately two feet away from an enemy they seem to take damage anyway.\n\nOut of the 7 missions in the game (split into 3 or 4 parts each) there are only 2 boss fights (3 if you count that upgraded version of another enemy). All of them are incredibly easy to kill and are very anti-climactic when defeated, even the final boss.\n\nIt's still an overall simple and relatively short fast action Wolfenstein game (at least when you let it be that) so there's definitely fun to be had.","August 13, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsb123/recommended/9010/","dsb123","A Red-Letter Day","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsb123/","114 products in account","Curator-esque Review\nHas everything a Wolfenstein game should have: guns, girls, destructible chairs, zombies, random enemy spawns, creepy tombs, sausage, booby traps, castles, secret rooms, treasure, hard bosses, jump scares, occult horror, cool weapons, Wilhelm screams, spooky skeletons, and great level design.\n\nReturn to Castle Wolfenstein (RtCW) Review (Spoiler Free)\n\nStory\n\nAs the Germans research any and every weapon that might give them an advantage over the allies during WWII, the SS's Paranormal Division stumbles upon the legendary tomb of Heinrich I at Castle Wolfenstein.  Immediately, the Allies send their best agents from the fictional Office of Secret Actions (OSA) to investigate the dig site at Wolfenstein.  Unfortunately, the OSA spies are captured and tortured.  Players take the role of B.J. Blaskowitcz, one of the captured spies.  After escaping Wolfenstein and the Heinrich archaeological dig deemed unimportant for the time being, the OSA send Blaskowicz on various missions to sabotage the Paranormal Divisions's other efforts across Europe.  As he gathers intelligence from his travels, B.J. uncovers the significance of Wolfenstein and the SS's plan for Heinrich I.\n\nGameplay\n\nRtCW simultaneosly preserves and innovates its lineage.  This is a first person shooter with a great balance between gameplay and story.  Levels appear linear, but further investigation reveals secret levers, buttons, walls that can be destroyed, and other hidden switches that can lead to shortcuts, treasure to increase your score, or secret weapon caches.  Thus while the main goal is to complete the level, RtCW is a fun game just to look around in since you'll never know what you'll find.  In terms of shooting mechanics, their are crouch and lean mechanics giving the game a tactical approach.  Indeed, a stealth approach (silenced weapons, backstabs, minimal offensive fire) is advised and required for some portions of the game.  When the bullet start to fly though, there is a hefty arsenal of tools to employ.  SMG's, pistols, rifles, flamethrowers, rocket launchers, and other weaponry all have their uses.  Every weapons has different stopping power and ammo availibility, so you can choose to save your Thompson for tougher enemies or rely on the weaker but more available German weapons.  I almost consider RtCW to be survival horror at times because many of the supernatural enemies you will fight in the game take a lot of bullets to put down.  The segments with the X-Creatures are particularly tense in this regard.  There is also some puzzle solving and a few logic puzzles.\n\nRtCW is a single player experience with the only game mode being the campaign.  There are mods that can make it co-op (which would be pretty cool) but I did not try them.  That being said, the five or so campaign missions themselves can take quite a while to complete.  Each mission has 4-7 chapters that took me on average a half-hour to complete probably.  The AI can be brutal at times even on normal and some sections are trial and error.  But there are some truly memorable moments here, such as moving through the Saxon tombs in the beginning of the game or later on infiltrating the X-Labs.\n\nDesign\n\nOld games do not always translate well but I find RtCW to be one of the best.  The dialogue is great, the music bold and brash but also quite intimidating at times.  The tomb segments are some of my favorites, with dim lighting, armored skeletons, and eery noises.  You certainly do not start this game expecting it to get creepy but it sure does.  Enemies are well animated with only the death animations a little stiff for humans.  The Quake engine may be old, but boy does it hold up here.  Lighting and sound are both excellent and except for the occasional rough looking texture, the game has great atmosphere.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nRtCW is a testament to the timelessness of shooters from around the turn of the century.  Despite it's age, it manages to capture the spirit of Wolfenstein and always amps up the action when you least expect it.  Grab your MP40 and return to Wolfenstein in this glorious reboot of the FPS that some consider pioneered the genre.","December 14, 2014","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Class based team objective missions where all the classes were needed and players had to work together was a refreshing change and some of the maps were just amazing.\n\nThe in-game audio chat was wonderful, allowing players to hit V to get a menu of chat commands so it was usual in MP for a new player to arrive and say 'Hi!' if Allies of 'Allo' if Axis and many on the server to respond similarly.  There was a lot of competition but there was also a good community.\n\nThere have been Wolfenstein games since but they really need to hust improve the graphics and give me the same game in this case for a wonderful experience.","May 4, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I play the single player game and desprately try to find MP games. The official server for RTCW is down now, but Enemey Territory is still going for multiplayer. Enemy territory is the MP only aspect of RTCW, and lives on. This game is so worth playing for SP alone!!!! Just buy it. It's on sale, and you'll experience one of the greatest gems of gaming ever. Sorry, but I can't say enough about the single player aspect, AND the multiplayer aspect. If you end up downloading Enemy Territory, try to find 'The Beach' map. The one where your objective is to grab documents deep below ground of an Axis base. I'm about to try to find this map myself in Enemy Territory. It is too nastalgic, Sorry for my spelling.

It's a tough game but it will leave anyone satisfied if they don't mind the lack of regenerating health and along with being tired of scripted scenes that force your character to take some beating in a trap.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/9010/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","Actually, I don’t think I’ve ever played this gave on Steam before now.  I think its one that I bought on Steam after buying boxed, and just never bothering with since I had already played it.  And that is pretty unfair to the game, since it has some pretty good qualities to it.\n\nThe first rule with Return to Castle Wolfenstein is that despite its title, it’s less a sequel and more a remake.  Why they called it ‘Return to’ when its not returning, unless they are remarking about you and I the gamer, returning to the series.  Then I guess it might make sense.\n\nWhen it was released it made it to the consoles, because some people insist on not playing games as best as they could.  And for some strange reason the Xbox release got bonus content that the PC didn’t get.  Just one of life’s mysteries I guess.\n\nI’ve read at various places that the multiplayer element of Return to Castle Wolfenstein was what really made the game.  And while it does sound like an interesting play mechanic, a sorta blend of Team Fortress and Counter-Strike, and there is even a guide to help you get it working again.  But I’m just too much of a hermit to play most multiplayer games out there.\n\nSo I played the single player, cause that’s my thing.  And it starts off similar to its predecessor, with you in a prison cell inside the dungeon of Castle Wolfenstein and a dead Nazi in front of you.  Now of course there is a little scripted sequence prior to this.  First you get a little information about why you are there and you get to learn about the Office of Secret Affairs or OSA.  Then you get another scripted sequence of just how that Nazi became a dead one, and what happened to your partner, Angent One.\n\nOutside of the first two levels, and your escaping from the castle, that’s where the two games similarities end.  Return to Castle Wolfenstein goes on it’s own path and sends you around to many different locations, only to bring you back to the castle at the end to tie it all up.\n\nEverything isn’t perfect however, the game has it’s issues.  Although mostly small and easily ignored.  Like when you die it often ignores your last quicksave and loads the last autosave instead, miner nuance really.  It also could use some more autosaves, instead of pretty much only at the start of the levels.  There might be one or two that autoave mid level, but I only ever noticed them happen at the start of a level.\n\nSo more than once I would me more than halfway into a level, having finished the first task, only to die and be sent all the way back to the start.  Maybe more of my own fault for not quicksaving more, but as a general rule games should autosave when an objective is complete, not just on map changes.\n\nThe AI combat is good, no enemies are too easy nor was anyone too tough.  I didn’t like just how tough the undead soldier/demon/zombie things were.  More than once I’d hit them square in the head and they would just keep coming.  Maybe its the games engine, but headshots should always be instant kills, with boss battles being acceptable deviations.\n\nThe game has a fair share of stealth levels, sometimes going so far as even being seen causing you to fail the mission.  This added with the ‘somewhat’ open worlds was the recipe for awesome.  And all things considered that is what this game is.  A fun Nazi killing trip around Germany.\n\nThe graphics could hold up better, perhaps someone out there are had a HD textures mod or something.  The audio, NPC AI, and basic gameplay mechanics are all decent enough to keep you entertained.  It’s not what I would call the best twelve year old game out there, but it certainly is a good one.","November 30, 2013","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, the good:  the story that drives the game is a good one and, for a game initially released back in 2001, the graphics are pretty good.   The cut-scenes and voice acting are also pretty good.   The initial key-binding are awful, but with a little effort they can be made to approximate current bindings.\n\nNow, for the less-than-good:  there's nothing really wrong with the game, but the fact that the player can't affect the outcome in any way drags it down for me.  Specifically, most levels have Secret Areas (SAs) and Treasures.  But, whether or not you enter those SAs or pick up any Treasures is irrelevant.  You get nothing useful outside of the box saying you've found all the SAs/Treasures when you leave the level (and maybe some additional health, ammo, or armor).  Also, even though I used "Return to Castle Wolfenstein Single Player v1.42c Unofficial Patch" to fix various bugs and allow me to use my standard 1920x1200 resolution, I still ran across a few glitches associated with those SAs.  Specifically, in one case, even though I found, opened and looted a certain SA, the game refused to give me the credit for it.  In another case, when I entered one SA, I couldn't manage to leave it.  Also, in every level, you can go back to search for the SAs once you've cleared the it of enemies.  Except for one level.  But, again, that means nothing to how the game plays out.\n\nSo, all-in-all, it's an OK game.  If you favor straight shooters over more quest-driven action games, you'll probably like this better than I did.  It's currently listing for about $10 and is on sale for $5.  At $5, it's a buy.  At $10, you might want to think about it a bit.","January 1, 2014","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I can raise one thing I didn't quite like, it would be some elements of the final Boss fight. Everything builds throughout the game to this, the culmination of Operation Resurrection - Heinrich the first. But, I felt that as he was limited in his attacks and merely a lumbering oaf, that this slightly detracted from my full enjoyment of the battle. I came equipped. I worked HARD to keep my ammunition and health high for this battle. And when he doubled over after my onslaught of lead, I expected a second form to fight, it was too easy. But he exploded and died. Disappointed, yes, but surprised? Not particularly, as this was 2001, and the concept of multiple boss forms was still a new topic, but it was an enjoyable fight while it lasted nonetheless.\n\nI reccomend you definitely spend an afternoon with a thoroughly well executed game such as this, it would be time well spent.","July 1, 2014","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlphaMeridius/recommended/9010/","AlphaMeridius","AlphaMeridius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlphaMeridius/","106 products in account","Mein leben!\n\nReturn To Castle Wolfenstein is a first-person shooter reboot of the Wolfenstein series which much like its predecessor focuses on fast-paced gunplay with a number of improvements made to compensate for the new engine technologies available at the time.\n\nFirstly, unlike Wolfenstein 3D, the developers actually tried to implement a compelling story to a franchise known for not actually having a “story”. To some degree, the story in this game, at least from a concept point of view, brings something new to the table by adding elements of occult. The plot revolves around the American soldier, B.J. Blazkowicz, trying to impede the Nazis from discovering and extracting a serum hidden in an ancient tomb capable of augmenting soldiers into “Dark Knights”, an evil undead army from the 9th Century. Nazis and occult? Absurd ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but what’s not to like. However, while the concept does enhance the single-player campaign, the story itself is mostly ignorable since it generally feels like it is there to fill in the space. Blazkowicz, while a total badass, still remains one of the blandest protagonists in existence. He takes orders from his superiors like a puppet with no remorse or personal motives. Even when the Allies want to give him a medal for his efforts and persumably a well deserved break at the end, he is somewhere outside still kicking Nazi butt. Boy, he sure is souless; born with only one scope in life: to kill Nazis for eternity. Plus, it is silly how the Allies' solution to most problems is to send a "one-man army" to take down Nazi headquarters single-handedly without even breaking a sweat. But that is Wolfenstein after all; it purposely does not need to explain how Blazkowicz does it -- and hey, some ancient voodoo magic is involved, so anything is justifiable, right? Fortunately, the story did manage to create the cool villain by the name of Deathshead, who later becomes the franchise’s main antagonist.\n\nThe gunplay in here is hasty but satisfying, reminiscent of older games such as Quake, Doom and Unreal Tournament, and unquestionably the strongest point of the game. While it all boils down to sprinting and shooting enemies in quick manners, the game does offer some moments of straightforward stealth where you get to sneak behind enemy lines. Additionally, there is an adequate variety in enemies from the deadly female squads in tight leather uniforms (those butts though) to juggernauts like the Über-Soldats. Different weapons are at Blazkowicz’s disposal too, with the Tesla gun being the most fun one to use, even if the MP40 probably becomes the most practical throughout most of the game, thus making pistols pretty redundant. One problem with the weapons though is the fact you never seem to run out of ammo. Retrospectively now, the gunplay does feel very basic, but mostly thanks to its fast paced action killing waves of enemies does not get dull, surprisingly enough.\n\nThe level design has the mentality of most shooters back in the late '90s and early noughties based on maze-like corridors and paths, essentially allowing the player the freedom to pick whichever route to travel back and forth within the somewhat confined space. Exploration is also encouraged and rewarded by finding secret chambers filled with collectables, even if these give no gameplay advantages to the player. Graphically, at the time, the game looked great but as time went by its visuals sure look dated today. On the other hand, the same cannot be said to its soundtrack which even to this day remains memorable and rather ageless. When you can recognise a level/map by a specific track from the soundtrack, then you know the soundtrack left a good impression.\n\nBoasting a strong single-player campaign, (wherther you take the story seriously or not), many probably remember the game for its multiplayer component which at the time was very popular and considered by many superior than the campaign, even as far as being regarded one of the best multiplayer components in a game ever. I cannnot argue with that, although it was not until the highly acclaimed free standalone Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory came out that the multiplayer component peaked in popularity. Featuring a class-based gameplay similar to Team Fortress, two teams (Allies and Axis) fight each other to complete objectives on various maps. Personally, I spent far too many hours in the multiplayer alone when I was younger because it was balanced and had a very enjoyable experience. Currently, the multiplayer from Return To Castle Wolfenstein seems dead. Rest in peace.\n\nIn conclusion, Return To Castle Wolfenstein still remains a classic in the eyes of many, including myself, who played it in its heydays online and/or offline, and a milestone on PC. But it definitely lost its relevance and appeal to the general public as years have passed due to more ambitious and realistic shooters showing up years later. More old-school than modern, it still is a solid shooter, nevertheless, which does not spoil the player with today’s regenerative health and cover-base mechanics and can still provide enough hours of fun mindlessly killing Nazis. Pick it up only for nostalgic purposes or if you are curious to see how fast-paced shooters were like more than a decade ago in case you never grew up with them.","September 10, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are no interactive quicktime cutscenes. Just you, a ludicrous supply of weapons and nazis. The variety of weapons and abundance of ammo lets you choose your own style. I played almost the entire game with the rifle. I'm not a big fan of hardcore stealth games and in this one, the stealh parts are pretty forgiving. There are no maps but sometimes the mission guides have useful diagrams. I didn't try the multiplayer game.\n\nBe careful with save game management as it's easy to quicksave yourself into a very bad situation.\n\nThere's no controller support but I think the gameplay relies heavily on accurate aiming so I don't think it would be playable that way anyway.\n\nThe only bad thing about this game is that setting the screen resolution was a bit tricky. If you get stuck just look up some help...it's an easy fix. I wish they'd do a proper update with modern resolution support and support for extra mouse buttons. Also, they could bump up the draw distance a bit more.

Heck, I know the whole story in general. The story is good: during the Second World War, you play as an American agent of some secret service who investigates certain activities of the fictional SS Paranormal Division. You operate behind enemy lines, your mate has fallen and the service refuses to send reinforcements; therefore, you stand alone. The story fits nicely in the whole Wolfenstein saga, and gives a nice thrill overall.\n\nGraphics are good for a game which is roughly 14 years old. Gameplay doesn't have any serious shortcomings either; it is just your average first person shooter. Only thing I miss is the possibility to aim down the iron sights of non-scoped weapons. The setting is an extra plus for fans of the WW2-genre, with a touch of fantasy attached to it. Bonus points for feelings of nostalgia.\n\nThe only serious problem with this game is the initial inability to set the resolution higher than the default setting. Although that can be fixed by downloading and mounting a non-official patch of the game (link: http://www.markshan.com/knightmare/. Patch can be found under 'DOWNLOADS'. Extract all files in the ZIP-file in the Return To Castle Wolfenstein folder under SteamApps > commons.), it is an issue which prevents jumping right in, which some may find irritating, and should be adressed accordingly by Steam.\n\nOne more important thing: make sure to save your game regularly, as the game doesn't save automatically even after completing a level. Got me back to the beginning after three levels.\n\nThis game is okay and deserves to be recommended, but enthusiasts of nostalgia and the WW2-genre will find something valuable in Return To Castle Wolfenstein.","July 25, 2015","true","35.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

RTCW is easily one of my all time favourite games. Bought the collector's tin edition way back when it first came out in 2001. Still have the embossed tin, and the cool little poster of the characters ... is still on the wall of the pantry after all these years. Now I have bought the Steam version, so no more disc and patching every time I want to install it.\nRTCW was the first shooter that really blew my mind and created an absorbing game world that was intensly atmospheric... and it really sucked me into the whole story-line.  I was creeped out in the catacombs, impressed by the weather effects and the sumptuous interiors in many of the buildings. Sexy and Dangerous, athletic killer babes counterpoint beasts so ugly as to scare the pants off the best and bravest of us intrepid video gaming warriors.\nMy favourite weapon is definately the  FG 42. A 10/10 game ...and a trip down memory lane.","December 8, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can also play the game stealthily at times which is appreciated.\n\nStory it nothing special but it does not take itself seriously at all which is part of the charm.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/9010/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A pretty straightforward run & shoot Quake 3: Arena mod; get to an objective while killing off Nazi forces and abnormal looking enemies to keep alive. The game gradually gets tougher as you progress through the missions where new enemies who unnaturally aim better and have more powerful guns will start coming in.\n\nIt could just be my computer but I get severe & random frame drops every now and again despite most of the game going at 60-90+ FPS.\n\nThe maps in the game are both linear with a few very small paths to find secrets & supplies & whatnot and somewhat open where objectives may have you do some bothersome backtracking. The backtracking really can be a bother since there aren't usually any visible indications on where to go next for anything. In some relatively open maps I had to do some running around to find where I had to go which I'm usually fine with until things like locked doors that have been passed by minutes ago only become unlocked with very little to no indication of the door being unlocked after an objective is reached on another side of the map happens.\n\nAlthough the game is generally straightforward with its shooting there are stealth mechanics in the game, which seem pretty weak. At the very least it functions; crouch or walk up behind an enemy and use a suppressed gun or backstab with a knife to silently kill them while avoiding enemy detection. The problem is that it seems a bit out of place for a game that's generally all about being fast and shooty. The stealth is optional in most missions and I think for the most part there are times where detection is unavoidable.\nAfter an enemy spots you it seems like headshots become almost non-existant when all enemies are aware of your presence. They don't die instantly when taking in a headshot or the spreadless-shots hitting the body instead of the head despite the reticle aimed at the face. There are objectives where you can't allow the enemy to hit the alarm if you've been found which in this game is more annoying than it is fun. Fortunately objectives like those are incredibly minimal in number.\n\nThere are a chunk of weapons you can have in the game almost all practical one way or another. The only guns in the game I found to be useless are the two available pistols which all shoot very slowly and are generally weak\n\nI could be observing this one wrong but the hitboxes for anything look like they go all over the place. When firing something with incredibly little spread aimed aproximately two feet away from an enemy they seem to take damage anyway.\n\nOut of the 7 missions in the game (split into 3 or 4 parts each) there are only 2 boss fights (3 if you count that upgraded version of another enemy). All of them are incredibly easy to kill and are very anti-climactic when defeated, even the final boss.\n\nIt's still an overall simple and relatively short fast action Wolfenstein game (at least when you let it be that) so there's definitely fun to be had.","August 13, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Amazing and greatly in depth story (campaign is like atleast 12 hours if not longer), smart AI even compared to certain games from todays titles, Graphics were amazing for its time and still aren't a drag to play with. I'm pretty sure the multiplayer on this game became a influence for almost every multiplayer shooter to date after it's release. Buy it.

Variety was also good.\n\nRemember to R-click on your EXE, select PROPERTIES, COMPATIBILITY(tab) and set to Windows XP, SP3; then check the box "disable display scaling on high DPI settings" -- else your cursor will automatically move to the lower-right.

I played on "Don't Hurt Me" at first and quit that due to it being way too easy in the first parts, still found it easy in the first parts on "Bring Em On", but from the middle stages it got exponentially more difficult with each map! I lost patience and started using cheats for much of the final few maps I'm afraid to say! I dread to think what "I am Death Incarnate" is like. Still the difficulty settings actually DO what they SAY..... unlike so many others who only have one difficulty level, "Impossible", no matter what meaningless difficulty level you select!!!!! The FG42 armed paras were the worst, even worse than the prototype Uber Soldats! They just hit hit hit you even from 500yds and thats it, if not dead, more than 50% health gone. The number of times I had to quicksave/quickload over and over and over.....\n\nHad a few issues with a few quirks and bugs in the game too - but none were unsolvable. Annoying though! Any why did your character have so little stamina? Run for 20 seconds and he was wheezing like a 20 stoner with a cholesterol reading of 8.0!\n\nThis uses the Quake 3 engine, which never was really brilliant IMO - nor was any other Quake..... nvr been a fan of the Quake games, and as for Quake 4..... that can GFI!\n\nThankfully it's still a lot better than Quake 3..... but it still has this engine's faults, such as the tiniest pixel of scenery completely stopping you dead and grenades that refuse to bounce anywhere except back up your nose or down your crackers! Grenades were pretty much useless for anything but wall opening anyway, the enemies AI was far too good to ever get caught by a grenade! Quite impressive AI for a 2002 game it is too..... especially the expert use of cover and teamwork by the AI..... seldom seen in games of this genre. For the more "elite" troops only however, the first maps green troops had no intelligence at all! The game covered the full range of stupidity to genius very well!\n\nOther than the outstanding AI, this was a pretty formulaic FPS - but why break a winning formula? Don't expect anything new, but if you like FPS's you will like this too!","May 8","true","21.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
