It comes off as "portal, but in 2D, and minus the sense of humor." And well, it kind of is, but it does so much more. The puzzles get progressively harder and more complex as you get different guns, and the last sequence of puzzles before the end is kind of just completely brain-melting. There's a surprisingly high execution factor in some cases, as well. And this is only the normal difficulty. I've not played the game's "hard" mode but I doubt I'd be able to complete it if I did.

The lack of a third-dimension makes the portal-only puzzles much easier than in Portal 2.  However, Gateways also adds several game-mechanics not found in Portal 2, such as the ability to change gravity or travel backwards in time.  The new mechanics are introduced continuously throughout the game, keeping the puzzles fresh and interesting.  Additionally, they ensure the puzzles are challenging even to Portal-veterans.\n\nMy only complaint about the game is that it's so short (~4 hours of gameplay).  However, when that's my only complaint about your puzzle-game, you're in very good shape, especially for only $5.\n\n10/10","February 25, 2014","true","4.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The puzzle design has some of the most difficult puzzles in the game being mandatory to complete, which wouldn't be a problem normally. But, the mechanic you unlock near the end of the game that enables these puzzles involves a lot of key timing and platforming that ended up being far too twitchy for me to finish.\n\nUltimately, because I have no 'maybe' option, I have to vote No on Gateways because of this. Perhaps if they had structured the game a little differently I could recommend it.

The most mind bending of these has to be the one that created portals in time, altough the gravity changing one comes as a close second.\nAll in all, the game is a solid puzzle platformer with a heavy emphasis on puzzles, later of which could take me up to an hour just to solve one. The pixel graphics may be a bit too pixely for some, but overall the presentation holds up, as does the user interface. Mostly.

I wish Valve's playtesters hadn't weeded out the 5 emancipation grid room, or thrown up when walking on the ceiling"? Well, you're in luck.\n\nThis game is, from my vague knowledge of Metroid, a hybrid of Portal and Metroid. You are a scientist, stuck in his lab, with all the areas therin sealed off by devious puzzles only solvable by your gateway (Portal) devices. Yes, devices. You get the basic one early on, but then you find yourself needing to rotate gravity, and link time AND space, and make yourself small (or large, but I managed to Portal all the large situations) through the same device. As you get more unlocks, you can explore more of the map, and open up harder puzzles.\n\nThis doesn't have GLaDOS, but the cruel puzzles make up for it (you can buy automated solutions for just 25 hint orbs, but generally the 5 orb "Is this possible yet?" question is more entertaining).\n\nIf you want a very much easier platformer with the same time mechanics as here you can check out Shuggy by the same dev. But it is very very easy, and I'd only recommend it to kids. Seasoned platformers are going to find that the only challenge here is trying to complete two player co-op with one character on each hand.","January 25, 2013","true","13.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I find the way they did it ingenious, as I had already wondered before if it would be possible to make such an effect in a 2D game and make it look good. I'm glad to see somebody did it right!\n\nBut I mentioned this game goes one step further. Well, in addition to the basic Gateway Gun, you also get to use 3 different ones that create gateways that make you change size, travel through time and shift gravity. All these together give a lot of interesting possibilities creating a really smart, but fair puzzle game. I didn't find any of the puzzles really frustrating. They were sometimes tricky, but all could be solved with some logical planning after understanding how each Gateway Gun worked. The time travel one was the most confusing to me at first, but it was in fact all very logical after I got used to it.\n\nIf you enjoy this sort of puzzles, check it out. Check the Steam Workshop as well. The developer published their own custom level there called "Back To The Lab", which contains a nice new set of puzzles, adding even more content to the game. It's like a free DLC!","December 1, 2015","true","18.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's charming 2D graphics make you think it's a simple platformer, but in reality it is a puzzle platformer, a la Portal. The layout of the laboratory (and the fact that you have to collect other items) reminds me of Metroid and Castlevania. So it's a mix of several games. The puzzles start off fairly easy, but (I think) about halfway through they get so complex that you probably have to use the in-game"help" function to get you past these puzzles. The game works with tokens, which are spread throughout the lab. Collect these tokens and you're able to see if you're able to solve a puzzle. Do it again and you'll be given the answer, where the game basically takes over and shows you the way to solve it.. Eventually you'll run out of tokens, and you *gulp* actually have to think for yourself.\nNow, I don't know if it's me, but that's just mean...\n'Challenging' is the word to describe this game.\n\n[Rating: 80/100]","October 2, 2012","true","2.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game starts with simple jump-and-run and “gateway-puzzles”, somewhat similar to Valve’s Portal, but quickly becomes more challenging as you find more powerful Items (powerups and modifications to your “gateway gun”) which let you explore new areas of the lab.\n\nSadly, I found the introduction into the game (and it’s items) unnecessarily hard. For me it was basically learning by doing. New items are introduced via popup-text (which is gone for good if you run away too quickly) and a simple puzzle, in which you have to use your newly found item.\n\nBut for me that was just not sufficient. It was until 90% into the game, that I (by accident) found out there is actually a map of the lab, guiding you to important spots, and a key to cancel active portals. Yes, I could have clicked on “CONTROLS” earlier. But why? I assumed, the game would tell me, like any other game would.\n\nThis is especially odd, as the ingame-help-system is really awesome. In the lab you can find 500 “power orbs”, which can help you with tough puzzles: Every puzzle in the game (apart from the final one) has a “HELP”-spot, in which you can spend a small amount of your “power orbs” to see, whether you can actually solve this puzzle with your current items and a BIG amount of your orbs to actually get it solved.\n\nThis is a brilliant way to prevent frustration (as long as you save your orbs for those REALLY tough puzzles) and keep the game going. The map, which not only tells you, where you should go next, but also shows every unsolved puzzle you have walked by so far, is also really helpful. I’d go so far to say: without this ingame-help, I would probably not have recommended this game.\n\nOverall Gateways is a decent game with a VERY steep learning curve. The gameplay is entertaining but can become frustrating, especially if you used your power orbs too early. If you like challengig puzzles and don’t mind being thrown into ice cold water, you should have a look at this game!","March 25, 2015","true","9.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/216290/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","There have been a lot of clever puzzle gimmicks over the years. There were time clones in Braid and P.B. Winterbottom, rotating the world in And Yet It Moves (shame about the game), and portals in... well, Portal. Did you ever think about combining them? Because that's just what Gateways does, and it's even more mind-bending that you're expecting.\n\nYou play Ed, a brilliant, balding scientist whose sprawling lab has just been ransacked. To get to the bottom of whatever it is, you're going to need to retrieve his greatest inventions, the gateway guns. There are four in total, each granting you a remarkable power over space and time. You have your basic portal gun that lets you go in one end and pop out the other. Then there's a resizing gun that lays down a big portal and a little portal, making you bigger or smaller depending on which one you enter. There's a rotation gun that works like the portal gun except it maintains your orientation, essentially rotating the world around you. And there's a time gun that lets you loop over the same span of time over and over, creating clones of yourself. You'll also find a few additional tools, as well as bonus upgrades like higher jumps and more time loops.\n\nAs you locate the portal guns, you'll encounter all sorts of puzzles throughout Ed's rather open-form laboratory. Your map will helpfully point out the next key puzzle to tackle, but you can always go searching for side paths and bonus puzzles that you might be able to solve with your current abilities. Each puzzle is helpfully marked with a Help Point, where you can spend a few orbs (found in tricky spots all over the lab) to confirm whether or not you have the right tools to solve the puzzle, or a lot of orbs to view the solution and skip the puzzle. It's a clever system for avoiding frustration, especially if there are gateway guns you're having trouble coming to grips with.\n\nThe puzzles start out as good introductions to your fantastic powers, and grow steadily into reasonable challenges. After a few hours, you'll probably have a solid command of each gateway gun, and be wondering why there are still puzzles you can't quite work out. And then you find the power that lets you use all the guns simultaneously, and the difficulty curve launches into space. Honestly, just dealing with a handful of time loops or working out a rotation maze taxed my brain to the limit. Combining them overwhelmed me to a degree I didn't think was possible anymore. You'll be using time portals to send your tiny past self to hold a switch while your giant future self reflects a laser through a right-angled portal into another switch so your present self has a few seconds to slip through a gate... or at least that's what's expected of you.\n\nGateways is pretty much everything you could ask for in a puzzle platformer, taken to almost comical extremes. It looks good, sounds good, has plenty of puzzle gimmicks, items to collect, secrets to find, and enemies to squash (in strangely bloody fashion, too). But it's going to challenge you in ways other games don't, and it will keep pushing until you've fully mastered every aspect of your powers. I reached a point where it got to be too much for me, a level of complexity far beyond Braid or Portal or anything that inspired it. If you're seeking that challenge, don't pass this one up, and even if you aren't it might be worth a try.","February 20","true","5.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And if you only played the first 15-20 minutes that would be a fair first impression. But once you start to really dig into the game and explore the expansive Metroidvania-inspired setting, you begin to realize that it's so much more than that. It all starts with the different Gateway guns that are scattered throughout the laboratory. Finding each one introduces a new gameplay mechanic that involves manipulating the environment, your character, and eventually time itself. The clever puzzle design does a great job of utilizing multiple mechanics simultaneously to create some mind-bending situations that require thought, patience, and speed. You can almost imagine the developer fiendishly laughing as he created some of the late-game puzzles which prove to be especially challenging.\n\nMore than just a clone or knockoff of a more popular game, Gateways is quite an inventive and exceptionally enjoyable puzzle-platformer that does enough new things to distinguish itself from the pack. Highly recommended, especially at the dirt-cheap $5 price.","January 17, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He explores it, and in doing so recovers parts of his equipment, which lets him progress further. The initial gun fires simple point-to-point gateways, like Portal. But as more guns are unlocked, the game becomes more and more challenging and interesting, with Time travel gates, gravity reversal gates and so on.\n\nThe game doesn't take very long to complete, and I was able to solve the game first time without using any of the hints, but it still proves to be challenging enough in certain areas.\n\nThis game can be controlled by a controller, but I would reccomend against this, as using analog sticks it can be hard to accurately place the gates. Keyboard and mouse work much better.\n\nThe 8-bit graphics in this game are very nice. The map never looks particularly "static" in any way, with minor details\n\nThe music in this game is very nice. It's never too obtrusive and loud, and definitely adds to the atmosphere of the game.\n\nThere is a level editor (library>tools), and workshop integration so you can create and share your own maps. The level editor is easy to get a hang of, and the developers included an extra map which is available on the workshop.\n\nI found no bugs while playing this game, and it never crashed on me. My only complaints are that the save points are a bit sparse, though. So if you die, you might have a long way to travel to get back.\n\nOverall this is a great little platformer puzzle game, it's a bit short, but definitely worth playing.","September 28, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Instead of being fun and untuitive, it went the way of crapy logi-gun and make everything unnecessarily convoluted. It is basically portal but some of the portals do more things. It starts out fine enough but then the time gun makes no sense and is overly convoluted. You then need to make 4 copies of yourself sometime and then do a specific thing with each one without touching the others, as that resets everything. There is so much repetition and trial and error to figure out puzzles. Walkthroughs barely help because everything is so complicated and requires so many steps and needs to be perfectly placed that words don't help, only videos. Unfortunately since like nobody plays this turd anyways there are like no video walkthroughs on youtube, nor is their anything in the community page, and the only written walkthrough online jumps around randomly/doesn't make sense and isn't well done. The conrols suck on pc and are even worse on controller. Everything is finicky and too touchy, especially when you need to be precise. Saving should be done before each puzzle so you don't have to go through others to get back to one. The inclusion "of metroidvana" is just annoying and unnecessary. So much annoying backtracking and having to do mechanics again just to traverse the level. There is random boosts like jumping that you actually need to finish puzzles but they can be hard to find and in this giant randomly made map with no specific direction or flow its a lot of running around looking for it. Apparently it gets even more convoluted and confusing at the end of the game, growing so annyoingly complicated the makers released a video of how to beat the final puzzle, which took 4 minutes of them doing straight through. No thanks, I decided to get out 3/4 through the game when thinks already sucked enough. No story at all. Terrible graphics.

Occasionally, you get a game that's absolutely amazing and, of course, you absolutely don't expect it. Enter Gateways, a puzzle platformer, where you guide a professor in his lab with a surprisingly complex topology. Someone's been interfering with his equipment, Monkoids are rampaging everywhere, and his most powerful tools are missing. Let's help him gather his stuff and get out of the lab!\n\nGateways mixes the elements of many puzzle platformers - you can teleport via portals (of, well, Portal), you can manipulate time and your past selves (like PB Winterbottom), you can rotate gravity (like in many other games), and you can also change your size. All this combined together in a dual portal gun mechanic. Sounds like it would never work? Certainly. But defying all common sense, the creators of Gateways managed to create a mechanic that not only works but works wonderfully. With a bit of practice, that is. Growing from the portal mechanic, the entire control scheme and UI is very sleek, and the action is very well flowing, making it difficult to stop playing.\n\nWhat about puzzles? First, it bears mentioning that the game plays in one huge, complex lab where further and further areas open as you solve puzzles. Some of these are quite easy (the difficulty curve is gentle up to a point), and later in the game some of them are really tough, and sometimes, though very rarely, a bit unfair. But I guess it's not a real puzzle game if you sometimes don't feel like bashing your controller into the screen :) However, the online help system is there to help you when you're stuck.\n\nPresentation-wise, the game has excellent visual design paired with rather ugly, huge-pixel-style graphics. I'm not sure what's the reason behind this choice, but the game is absorbing enough to forgive this flaw. The music is also excellent.\n\nGateways is a really enjoyable puzzle platformer with more focus on the puzzles than the platforming. Recommended to everyone who likes the genre - it's tons of fun.\n","March 8","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And for the first twenty or so minutes, that's basically what it turns out to be.\n\nHowever, it isn't long until the game's true nature reveals itself. It's a cross between a metroidvania and a puzzler. The game takes place in a single massive level, and you're supposed to go from place to place gathering powerups that let you go to the next place. Those powerups are new puzzle tools you use to solve the puzzles blocking the way to the next powerup. It even has optional powerups, just like any good metroidvania.\n\nIt's put together quite well. There are help points for each puzzle that can first tell you (for a small cost*) if your current powerups are enough to solve the puzzle and, if so, can then show you (for a large cost*) how they are solved. That being said, the puzzles (at least thus far) have been trivially easy to solve. Maybe the tough ones are reserved for the end of the game. We'll see. At least it has a level editor and workshop support.\n\n*These costs are paid with in-game pickups. I figure this is worth clarifying in this day and age of in-app purchases.","February 27","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
