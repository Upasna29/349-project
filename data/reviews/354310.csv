"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/354310/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","Claws & Feathers is another addictive and challenging puzzle game from Alawar Entertainment.  A fusion of Match 3 and puzzle fair, the gameplay is pretty unique and fun.  And despite looking a bit like Angry Birds in the art department, it is anything but.\n\nBirds are striking back after a gang of nasty cats stole their eggs, but rescuing their offspring may be trickier than they thought!  The gameplay is more complex than it first appears.  We're given a game board with birds and cats sprinkled about.  Matching 3 of the same colored bird will remove them from the board, and to remove the cats and reveal the keys they're hiding you need to surround them with birds of the same color.  This is easier said than done as any move that does not result in a match adds colored eggs to the board.  An additional non-match move and the eggs hatch into full birds which will quite often block your path.   Too many bad moves, and you run the risk of getting blocked in and not being able to complete the stage.  Planning your strategy and working out the best series of moves is required to get through the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=414264314\nEach stage has an objective that must be completed in order to earn a gold egg.  While failure doesn't prevent you from progressing on to the next stage (as long as you free the required number of chicks), the gold objective adds an extra layer of strategy to a lot of the game boards and helps bulk up play time as you'll often have to replay levels multiple times to earn gold.  This is something I really enjoy about a lot of these casual games; while you can certainly play them more casually, goals that encourage challenging yourself opens the game to even the not-so-casual crowd.   The difficulty ramps up pretty quickly too, so don't think it'll be easy sailing getting gold eggs on all stages, even the earlier ones will have you stumped and replaying multiple times. As you get further into the game, additional mechanics (bombs, chained birds, fireworks) introduce even more complexity to the level designs, mixing things up and keeping gameplay interesting and challenging.   Some stages are pretty dang clever, too.\n\nThe nice thing is that outside of a handful of stages with timed gold objectives, you can take as much time as you like to complete each.  So if you need to study the game board for a few minutes to plan out your moves, there's no ticking clock to worry about, it's just you and the birds.  This is great for those looking for less hectic "casual" gameplay  but also works well for the times you can't dedicate your full attention to a game.  My only complaint is that the timed levels can be rather hectic and stressful, the later ones taking dozens of tries to perfect, but this is only one small gripe for a game that is a ton of fun otherwise.\n\nThe presentation is top notch, as well.  I don't know why, but the sound effects are one of my favorite parts of the game; I just love the chirps the birds make as they fly off, it's so silly and cute.  The music is also great, reminding me of classic cartoons with their jazzy and lighthearted scores. Graphics aren't anything fancy, but cute and fitting for the type of game this is.  And really, who doesn't like a mustachioed bird?\n\nWith 56 levels and 30 achievements, there's quite a bit to play through.  Progress tracking on the achievements is a much appreciated addition, but they could definitely use Steam Integration.  At least it has trading cards to help sweeten the deal.  Although it took a bit to get the hang of the mechanics, I'm now squarely hooked on these birds.  There's just something about those trickier levels that makes you feel awesome once you finally snag gold.  Claws & Feathers is definitely worth a look if you're searching for a good puzzler without (for the most part) the craziness of time crunch games.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended for strategy game enthusiasts and anyone needing to scratch that puzzle game itch.\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review.","March 26, 2015","true","20.1"," 76 of 86 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","76","86","4","7"

Bright, fluffy birdies and cute kitties feature in this game, which at first glance looks like a really easy and casual match-3 type game. A few levels in and the fur and feathers are flying (figuratively and sometimes literally) as you try to maneuver your pieces around the board while thinking multiple moves ahead like some master chess strategist.\n\nIn the game, your chicks are trapped in locked cages and you must free them. To accomplish this, you move birds around the game board, matching 3 of the same color in order to clear some of the birds off by letting them take flight. The idea is to clear paths on the game board between golden keys and the locked cages. Making all of this much more difficult is the fact that every move causes eggs to appear and more birds to hatch. Sometimes you might clear some part of the board just to block other parts on the same move, a bit like taking a step forward while also sliding backwards. This definitely forces you to think several moves ahead as you play. Additional game mechanics, like cats and bombs, can further hinder or help your progress as you try to clear obstacles blocking the way.\n\nDon't be fooled by the cute, Claws & Feathers gets hard fast. The timed missions are particularly difficult, and I found just completing those levels a challenge. Solving the conditions of each puzzle board is going to take multiple repeats, and I honestly found the game a little frustrating at times.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a challenging strategy puzzle game masquerading as a casual match-3 timespinner, you will find it in Claws & Feathers.\n\nA review copy of this game was provided by the publisher.","March 26, 2015","true","1.8"," 45 of 46 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","45","46","4","7"

This fact shouldn’t be surprising, but sometimes it is, and sometimes it’s best not to judge a book by its cover. Especially when that cover is the same ugly bird monstrosities that have defined a certain section of the gaming landscape for years now. Those who go in with an open mind will find that Claws and Feathers is the type of game that you can easily play while listening to a podcast, with levels that are short enough for quick sessions and long enough to feel satisfying to beat. It is a breezy puzzle game that layers on mechanics and complexity naturally and doesn’t overstay its welcome.The setup for Claws and Feathers is that a group of cats have stolen chicks right from their nests, and birds are out for revenge.You control the birds and fight back by bunching them together into groups of three in order to surround their feline aggressors and free their babies from cages. The game board operates like a sliding puzzle game. Any bird can move to any space as long as there is a path for them. If the player makes a match, the board remains static. If they fail to make a match, then eggs begin to spawn in, cats drop from above, and everything generally gets more crowded.Completing each level just to progress isn’t too difficult, with the challenge coming in going back and attempting to achieve secondary objectives that require patient play and the use of various non-bird power-ups. These range from a lightning ball and fireworks that each clear away birds to a paint can that changes the board’s layout in a tight spot. There is a short tutorial whenever something brand new is introduced, but Claws and Feathers respects the player’s intelligence and allows them to experiment with slight variations on existing mechanics to figure out what they do. There are also boss fights and stages that are set up like Rube Goldberg machines, which come as a welcome change of pace from the standard levels.Aesthetically, Claws and Feathers is challenging to say the least. The 3D models of the birds on display during gameplay sway and move in a very stilted fashion, similar to the creepy characters of Five Nights at Freddy’s. Some of the designs are ridiculous enough to be funny, such as the purple bird with the Flavor Flav gold chain or the somewhat racist yellow bird with a Fu Manchu mustache. On a positive note, there is some nice hand drawn art used in cutscenes and tutorials that has a lot more character than the strange 3D models.There are two music tracks that run on loop throughout the experience. They are suitable enough to the game but not long enough to be worth keeping on over your own tunes. You shouldn’t come to casual puzzle games for anything but gameplay, and Claws and Feathers makes no attempts to disprove that sentiment.I realize that many people will be put off immediately by Claws and Feathers, and for good reason. The game doesn’t hide its mobile roots and the character designs are bizarre and unlikable. However, for those purely looking for casual puzzles in the vein of the games PopCap used to make, this will certainly fit the bill. The gameplay is simple but unique, and it is a good challenge to fully complete every objective. Claws and Feathers is likable because it doesn’t get in your way and it can easily accompany any otherwise tedious activity on a lazy weekend afternoon.","April 21, 2015","true","10.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/recommended/354310/","mikeoliva","Motoki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/","4610 products in account","Fun little level based puzzle game that's a bit of a different take on Match 3.\n\nThe premise may sound familiar, some birds are angry that their friends are kidnapped, this time by cats. Don't expect a physics game though. This is a straight puzzle game that plays closer to a match 3 though significantly different, and I would say more complex, than something like Bejeweled.\n\nThe staple of the gameplay is to remove birds of the same color from the playing field, a roof, by aligning three of the same color. You can do this in a row or in an L shaped corner. The trick is that a bird can only move where there's an open path, so no obstacles like another bird blocking it, and if you move a bird without making a 3 or more group match then more birds will show up on the playing field adding more obstacles. There are little eggs of different colors showing where the new birds will 'hatch' and sometimes you actually want to make a move that's not a match in order to get a bird of a particular color to appear so there's a bit of strategy to it all.\n\nOther additions are made to the gameplay such as this cats, the 'Claws' part of the game, who you must surround on either side to fly them off the playing field, birds who are chained up and need a match to be released and hidden keys.\n\nNote that some of the levels are timed as well but not all. Each level has different requirements so there's a lot of variety and you never quite know what to expect. I liked the unpredictability that you had other goals to meet besides simply rescuing the birds that varied with each level.\n\nI was a bit apprehensive of the timed levels at first since I prefer to play puzzle and casual strategy games at a slower pace where I have more time to think out my moves but after a few tries I was able to get through them without much problem. It forced me to play in a bit of a different way for those levels which again I found to be a nice variety.\n\nAs with most level based casual games this is one where you don't need to make a huge time commitment and can play a level or two here and there in short bursts.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint the visuals were all done well, looked great in full screen. I experienced no bugs errors or technical issues.\n\nIf you're looking for a puzzle game that's a little bit different and more complex than a simple match 3 and you like variety I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Claws and Feathers.","March 27, 2015","true","8.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"

The aim of the game is to be the good chook by saving all the poor little chicks trapped in cages.\n\nYou will have to match at least 3 chickens of the same colour to make them fly off the grid but if you do not succeed coloured eggs will hatch and more birds will appear on the board. Place your chickens strategically to grab menacing cats and fly them off the grid. Every time you remove a cat from the board items will be revealed, such as keys or bombs. Keys will unlock the cages to free your beautiful chicks and see them flying gracefully to their nest. Bombs will explode to remove obstacles such as walls. Calculate your move carefully so you do not overpopulate the board with chickens thereby freezing your next move.\n\nFrom time to time, you will have several objectives to achieve within a level. This can be tricky; you might need to unchain all chickens, remove walls and if you are lucky you may even have to beat the clock! They are plenty of variations per level, which is exactly what you want for this type of game.

So I played it on my Win 8 tablet. And to be honest this is biggest advantage of this game, because on Steam there are not many games working well using touchscreen only. This game is one of them and in my opinion this is the best way to play it.\nBut to be honest I didn't enjoy it, so this is next time I wish there was neutral opinion here. But I prefer to give positive because it's solid piece of code. It works well, I didn't experience any bugs, graphics and music are nice and there are some fresh ideas in that genre. Nothing revolutionary, but it might be enjoying for fans of such games.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you're a casual gamer, you shoulf try it, especially if you like match 3 games.\nIf you don't like casual games, keep looking, this one won't change it.\n\nLike this review?

It's varied and while it might use similar versions of an objective, they don't repeat and the boards are shaped around new experiences. If you want to go above and beyond the usual, every stage has a "golden egg" challenge to meet as well, and it kept this challenging even for my skills with the genre, especially by the end of the game.\n\nOverall a fantastic title unless you've got some kind of revulsion to Looney Tunes "violence" (bombs turning cartoon animals to ash and eyeballs, etc) or the genre itself.","October 23, 2015","true","12.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
