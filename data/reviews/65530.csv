However though it was fun to play, it left me a little disappointed. At a glance, everything about this game should mean I loved it. It was classic Spellforce. Except, it wasn't.\n\nFirstly, unlike the other incarnations of Spellforce, I could not create a female character, and there doesn't appear to be a reason for this (no male only references in the storyline etc).\n\nSecondly: It was short. So very, very short. I felt like the story had barely got going before it was over. The whole game feels like a demo for Demons of the Past, not a game in it's own right.\n\nAnd finally: The extra scenarios. After paying for a game that was almost insultingly short, I was offered 3 extra scenarios. For a fee of course. No thanks, I've forked over enough of my cash already.\n\nIt breaks my heart, but unless it comes up on sale, I cannot recommend this game, and I think my journey with Spellforce ends here. I certainly won't be paying full price for the next one.\n\n\n","September 18, 2014","false","11.6"," 68 of 77 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","68","77","3","0"

What does surprise is the complete lack of imagination and at the same time a unique and seamless transition between RTS and hack and slash. What it does well, is offer a fun time for those with somewhat lower standards.SpellForce 2's unique mix of role-playing and real-time strategising makes a return in Faith in Destiny, but it only brings a few new tricks.However, even with those negative points and the fact that it doesn't add much to the series I still like Faith in Destiny. Despite showing its age at times the core game play is still entertaining and somewhat addictive.Spellforce 2: Faith in Destiny isn't a bad game and if you are a fan of RPG and RTS you will like it.","April 28, 2014","true","10.7"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","31","37","3","0"

It has what made the Spellforce franchise great, but it's short and i'll risk to say that it has the worst story of all the Spellforce series, based on the cliche that you have to do everything "because it's your destiny". However, if you like Spellforce mechanics you can still find this game enjoyable, and if you like the single player free mode it will be worth it for you.\n\nBeware, however, that you won't be able to play with your friends if they own this game because the servers exist no more. You may try to find a way to play online with a program like hamachi, but I can guarantee that it won't be easy.\n\nVery average for the Spellforce series 57/100","November 26, 2013","true","36.6"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","30","38","0","0"

Though I can't say I was fully satisfied by the whole of the experience but I really had fun playing it and its features nevertheless.\n\nGraphics\nFor an expantion based on a 2007 game they are pretty cool. You get sweet nature designs, accurate animations, fire-lightning-smoke and other effects. Not too bad water material for lakes and seas. Legit logic of terain designing combined with natural effects colors and mood.\nThe characters are also neatly done, you can see weapons and gear with enough details and light effects and you can even notice various cute details like smoke and sparks when gear hit against each other during fights.\nThe engine is kinda like a sweet magor upgrade from what the old RTT/RTS games used to be.\n\nStory\nNothing really extraordinarry. I haven't played any Spellforce games before so I had to do some homework in order to understand what was going on.\nThe background of what's going on is pretty cool, however the game itself doesn't really give you a good story-telling sequence during the game and doesn't let you get too enthusiastic about it. Though there are a couple of dialogue and cut scenes that help the game stay in the avevare mood.\n\nCharacters\nNot much to say. The units are pretty pretty sweet and there's an appreciated quantity and quality of units.\nHeroes are nice too. Was happy to see some basic voice acting that helped me enjoy the game [though i eventually removed all acknowledgement effects cause i was a tinny bit irritaed of them due to playing with many clicks I guess :P ]\n\nGameplay\nIt was ok. All features were sweet with the exception that there's unfortunatelly a bad balance between RTS and RPG.\nEventhough there are some good RPG ideas [gear upgrades, cool skills, skill tree etc etc] the averate taste in my mouth was that there was a bit more RTS than RPG going on.\nAlso the game was kinda short. No not from the average gameplay point of view. It took me around 20 hours to do the cempaign while exploring every inch of the maps. However the story goes on through some very few basic sequences and after a few maps that's it, you are done with the campaign. And your only hope for more gameplay is skirmishing and downloading custom maps. I know the cost of adding more maps in the main campaign is too big compared to skirmish maps, but 2 or 3 more maps in the main story would make it feel a lot more satisfying!\n\nMusic/Sound\nAverage neatly designed music additions with a bit of epic character. Nothing original.\nOne thing though is that I REALLY loved that the developers never missed to concentrate on the details regarding sound effects. You can hear your units' footsteps or wingflapping while they move when you zoom close to them and not by an average generated effect but by individually generated sound.\n\nAverage\nIt's a cute game. Don't keep high expectations about it and you'll have enough fun.\ni'd say it's above 6 cause it keeps you happy but bellow 8 cause they could have added some extra material and a better balanceed RPG experienced so I say it's a 7/10 for me.\n\n\nPS: I got it on a special offer. I strongly suggest you grab a similar chance to buy this on a better price  ;)","January 11, 2014","true","21.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

There was one mini game as far as I can remember everything else was just hack and Slash, go to a map build a base own everything due to the fact that your avatar (and the Dragon) kill everything on their own, leveling was too easy the army was a step ahead or on par in levels with the Nameless. Poor excuse, might change with DLC´s but I am not gonna buy any of them. My recommendation: Buy Spellforce Platinum and get some real RPG/RTS gaming done then compare it with this.","January 19, 2014","false","12.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The ability to grow your own hero like an RPG as well as play the game strategically like an RTS is what really drew me to this game. The first one was quite complicated and although it was a great game, I prefer the sequel due to it's simplifications and making the game much easier to just pick up and play for anyone. I love the free game mode where you are growing your own hero to whatever you please.\n\nI enjoy the two new playable races; however, the shaikan are abit overpowered with their ressurection ability and the nameless are abit underpowered with how they have not many buildings, but then each building is heavily necessary to build another thing before you can build it.\n\nI have also found a game crashing bug... if, for example, norton anti-virus does a pop-up saying your pc is secure, then the game crashes and says 'access violation'.\n\nanother bug I have found is with hiring heroes in free game mode... if you hire more than one merc before you recieve the quest increase your honor, then you are glitched to keep having the gain a new companion quest.. and while you can't hire a new merc yet.. its a strange glitch..\n\nanother glitch is found when talking to the dwarf in westguard... if you stand by the building and rotate your camera a certain way and then talk to the dwarf then you get glitched into the building... once glitched into the wall you cant move... and the only way to fix it is if you quit the game..\n\nAnother thing... I have seen enemy troops just walk past mine and there was no conflict... they are not shadow units.. if the enemy units walk past a certain radius then they can bypass aggressing my units... unsure if this is a feature, but it seems abit too feeble of a feature.. multiple times has workers simply walked past my wall of troops only because they found a hole in which they can walk through.. and then they proceed to stealing my resources...\n\nAnother feature I wish existed was that your workers can fight back... if the ai decides to build a stone build near my workers then one would think that the workers are able to fight back and attack the enemy workers or even destroy the build before it begins.. if not then when selected with a worker, dont give the option to attack when your cursor is hovering above an enemy unit/build ... if this is to dissuade a person from doing an all out worker attack with 80 workers and 80 slots worth of soldiers and 6 heroes then give the workers only the ability to defend themselves or only be able to attack other workers/resource buildings... make their ability to attack a special case only.. or just remove the option entirely.. small pet peeve of mine..\n\nI have yet to try the DLC of this game, but they seem mighty fun.. I bought the Complete Collection of this game, and I have been highly amazed by this game.. please fix the bugs..","April 16, 2014","true","26.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Well...that's not what this is. Faith in Destiny feels like it was hastily cobbled together in a scenario editor with a month-long deadline for a finished product. The campaign has no voice acting and doesn't even bother with the illusion of choice like the previous campaigns did, instead just outright forcing you to play a male character. The campaign AI doesn't even pretend to play fair, instead spawning in units at set intervals because reasons, out-numbering you 10 to 1 and never actually doing anything but waiting for you to attack. Many map triggers and quests are broken, making the plot make even less sense than it would otherwise. You only find out why you're bothering to do any of what you're doing in the minute-long cut-scene after the final mission. As to the multiplayer (never one of this series' strong points, really), the new race (the Nameless) have their buildings, units and tech tree designed in a way that makes it obvious they're meant to be played only by a cheating AI, though if you're allowed to actually climb their ridiculously overpriced tech tree you'll end up with two titans and a host of overpowered units and towers that there's really no counter to in competent hands. The stand-alone scenarios are a little better in terms of both writing and gameplay (the AI doesn't cheat as hard), though broken scripts still abound, periodically making missions unwinnable because you climbed a hill from the left instead of the right.  All in all, don't bother with this, even if you liked the previous games, you'll just end up disappointed.","April 4, 2015","false","14.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It isn't so short - it takes me 18 hours to finished it what was longer than many dlc's to new games. The storyline is not bad, characters are quite good - the real trouble with them are sometimes embarrasing dialogue lines which don't exacly suit same npc (Caine for example).\nGraphic remember time of Spellforce 2 which isn't great, music on the other hand is fine.\nOf course dlc is far away from greatness of Dragon Storm but that's propably is caused by changing of studio. Faith in Destiny is quite challenging - it isn't so easy as it looks, and same storyline have some potential in it, also if somebody wish to play in next dlc ("Demons of the Past") it is good to know Faith in Destiny first - without it you can loose some important information from storyline.\n\nI can advice this dlc to everyone who loved Spellforce serie - Faith in Destiny represents almost all what was good in this serie - even if it doesn't add anything new (besides new kind of enemy) to it but it's a very good reminder.","June 6, 2014","true","18.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This is coming from a franchise where games had close to 20 maps of 2 to 4 hours each.\nGranted the game is much more lighthearted than the infuriating hellishly difficult of its predecessors, and i kindof appreciate this, but the story makes very little sense in its own, much less when put against the previous titles. Just as when i started getting the hand of the story and understanding my role in it (just by a little bit, because it is still confusing), well the game ended; it feels more like a prelude to something else, like an Act I of a game than a whole game in itself.\nI recomend only getting this game when heavily discounted, otherwise you are not missing much.","February 16, 2015","false","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was nothing special compared to Shadow Wars and Dragon Storm, although the new nameless invasion and their relation with your avatar was well done, the game lacks a variety of maps in the campaign, so the campaign even if it is entertaining, was a bit shorter than expected for a Spellforce game. They could have done a lot with the Nameless invasion, perhaps giving you the role of liberator as you help the other nations against the Nameless.\n\nThe gameplay was basically the same as Spellforce 2, but since I loved that game, I don’t find the gameplay to be a problem. The existing nations and armies you play with keep you interested, even if they did add the Nameless in Skirmish, free and Domination modes, you don’t get to play with them in the campaign. Your avatar now has a few new abilities but nothing that changes the way you played in Shadow Wars or Dragon Storm.\n\nThe music never disappoints in a Spellforce game, they added a few new ones but the classics remain. The graphics are still the same as Spellforce 2, with higher resolutions but that’s no problem since these are some of the best looking graphics in the RTS/RPG genre, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, it was a good game but I was a bit disappointed with Faith in Destiny because of its short campaign and very few additions to the game, they should have just made it into a expansion like the Dragon Storm campaign instead of a stand-alone game.","March 26, 2015","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first, I found it discouragingly difficult.  But this was because I had played Spellforce, and this game plays significantly differently.\n\nOnce I learned the quirks of the new game, I found this game quite enjoyable.  The main differences between the two lay in how you grow your army and how strong your units are as opposed to your towers.\n\nSpellforce, for me, always turned in to a tower defense game.  I found I could build towers to destroy incoming waves of enemies before they got close to my base.  In many instances, it was actually best to create a line of towers going through the maps in order to get close enough to enemy bases so I could send in an army to destroy them.  But more often than not, I could actually just build my towers right through enemy bases, then mine them for experience.\n\nThey nerfed the towers in Spellforce 2, and while I imagine it's possible to continue using them in this way, they seem to cost much more than they did before.  It seems unlikely a person could use them in this way in this game.\n\nThere are new mounted units, and you get all the racial units by upgrading your headquarters.  You can also build a new headquarters.  While I never completed Spellforce (it took an awful long time to build towers everywhere) I do not recall being able to build headquarters buildings.\n\nThere appear to be other quirks, too, regarding the handling of heroes.  There appear to be no rune monuments, and your heroes are not called "rune warriors," which, I suppose, could make sense.  But it may just be a matter of nit-pickery that I notice these things.  Besides, aside from the name change, and that your compinions without having to summon them, your heroes seem to be nearly identical to the rune warriors from the first game.\n\nAside from a number of side challenges, the game plays pretty much the same in RTS mode:  Build headquarters, build at least two of each resource miner (provided you can find the resources themselves), upgrade the headquarters to produce mounted crossbowmen, build farms, build mounted crossbowmen, have the mounted crossbowmen stand guard or march on small patrols until you can finish your headquarters and build what you need to get the mage unit, and, once you can do that, build a titan, one mage unit, and then storm the rest of the map.\n\nThe mage unit is more for intelligence gathering.  Able to go anywhere, I found the mage unit pretty routinely died if it was ever used in combat.  The mounted archers pretty universally could take on any target.  But I have only just started playing the game, so the usefulness of the mages (magi?) could change in later game play.\n\nPerhaps the winning strategy will also change in later game play, too.  I do not yet know.\n\nThere are skill trees, which I've not fully explored yet.  But I have noticed that, for at least the first six levels, the game forces you to spend your skill tree points in two different, almost opposing, skill trees.  If you can specialize more after that, I haven't yet discovered.  I suppose I could spend the time counting all the skill points you can spend and compare them to all the "spent point" requirements, but at present, I'm simply too lazy to do so.\n\nThe new mounted units seem, thus far, grotesquely OP, but that's a large part of why I enjoy the game.  I don't enjoy games that don't make me feel powerful, and this game certainly does that!  So if you're a fan of extremely challenging games, and especially rogue-likes, you probably won't enjoy this one at all.","December 27, 2014","true","42.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The story takes place after the event's of first spellforce (although only 3-4 charcters and some landscapes are the same) sooooo\nBeacause i dont want to spoil the game i will only write why i put thumbs down\n\n-Campain is too small (you can finish it in approximently 6-7 hours if you are fan of series or if you are new player it will go around 14-16 hours)\n-Objectives and main quest arent many\n-You must buy more DLC's inside of a DLC-Expansion ...\n-You dont have the luxurity of building a base (only in 2 missions you will have the privilage of doing so.....)\n-Too expencive for an expansion that needs other dlc\n-The "Buy DLC" button in main menu is a HUGE turn off\n-Music sometimes play and some others dont (so better go to youtube and type "spellforce 2 faith in destiny OST"\n-Scenario leaves you with many questions\n-Few mearchent's whith even fewer goods to trade....\n-sometimes saved games glitch and the game forces to stop(the savegame stay corupt and if you dont have another save file you are screwed my friend)\n\ntip:if you take the quest in 2nd mission from dwarven smith dont get in trouble of searching for items or if you do use traveling stone to get back to ur's mountain, dont wait that the game will send you back there.... i was gathering all ingridience 1 by 1 but when i done the game FINISHED...... (even so the items are powerful but you most likely find others higher level and better than them while you go forward in campain)\n\n\nSpoiling alert for old timers!!!!\nthis arent cons\n\n\n\n\n\n-you will come accross of Mosaic Of death\n-you will have to go to dwarf forge and play with fire\n-Nightsong is guest star and you aint gonna play with her\nsome other small things that you will see inside of game\n\n\n\nThis is why i dont recomend it,its even more unfair that i bought spellforce 2 complete edition and still i got to pay for all dlc's ....\nI am really dissapointed as a fan of series, especialy beacause the whole game is "take your hero and go killing horde's of enemys" and even if i skip that fact,there are many things that make it "avoid-able" as game such as No base building (i dont know what developers had in mind) and PLUS that old game characters are not even interfere with the plot (exept some cut sceens)\n\nIf i were you as a normal gamer i would suggest you buy spellforce 2 not this,never buy this as a stand alone game\nAnd if you are fan of series and you want it desperatly i would recomend you to buy it in sales, not more than 5-6 euros\n","February 19","false","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
