When I first played Peggle several years ago it took me back to the old arcade  games I used to play when I was a kid, standing on the pier spending all of my  money on those machines.  That game was called  Pachinko,  (where you send a metal ball bearing spinning around a series of peg like mazes, trying to  get your ball to drop into various cup like  recepticles on the board)  and it is  still all the rage  over in Japan where  whole arcades are devoted to the game.\n\nPeggle has become one of   my favorite 'short term'  arcade games of the last decade barring Ricochet Infinity and Gish.  What I mean by short term, is the ability to play  for  just a few moments in between other games, or when  on a coffee break from more important  things.     With Peggle,  you have to  attempt to knock out all the orange pegs  from  various arrays of  blue and orange pegs  (55 levels in the adventure mode)  using a ball launcher/cannon  that fires a ball from the top of the  game board.  You get 10 balls  to clear the board of the orange pegs.  If you can clear the whole board of both orange and blue pegs plus any special pegs,  you get  extra bonus points.  There's a bucket like object that is constantly on the move at the bottom of the board.  If your ball falls into this you get your ball back which in turn makes it easier to complete the  round. There's also  more points gained depending where your ball finally comes to rest, with a jackpot score of 50K  from the central well, 25K from the two adjacent wells and 5K from the outer wells.  The first time  you fail to hit any pegs  you will get your ball back, but this only happens once on each board.  Each new board includes two green pegs that give you one of several special powers when you clear them away.  These can  help you clear  the orange pegs away easier, for example  you may get   a double ball that enables yopu to clear away  a lot more  pegs, especially if you get it early on in the level (as more pegs get in the way), or extend the length of the ball catcher to give you a greater chance of catching the ball and getting it returned to the ball launcher or  a marker that shows you where your ball will bounce.  Some of the powers come into effect immediately (like the double ball which only lasts for that turn) or on the next turm that last for the next three turns; (the latter power is very useful for  aiming your ball for maximum effect).  Each of these specials  continues through several levels before changing to a new power, that are introduced   via Peggle Masters.   There's also a purple  peg that when hit  gives you bonus points.  Each time you flick a new ball, the  purple peg changes position.  Scoring over 250 000 on one board  gains you an extra ball as well.\n\nThere's four different modes included with the PC version, Adventure mode with 55 levels spread over  10 stages,  quick play, which allows you to play any  board you've already unlocked, duel that  allows you to play against either the computer or a friend (with the X-Box version you can play online against up to 4 players) and finally theres the challenge mode, which has 75 harder levels and is locked until you've completed the adventure mode.\n\nThere's two different  versions of the game available on Steam,  Peggle Deluxe and Peggle Nights, both of which are well worth buying if you  like arcade games.  Sadly there's no  level editor, but Steam do have a free version  Called Peggle Extreme that features   levels dedicated to Half-Life 2, Portal and Team Fortress.  There's only  ten levels with one special (also known as Peggle Masters), and five Challenge levels, but it's enough to gives you   an introduction to the game.  It's more like a demo, but is different to  the two commercial versions, so is worth getting if you  like the game.   I think they also made a second free themed  version that's not available on steam, but I've forgotten what the theme was.\n\nThe beauty of this game for me is that it never gets boring.  The levels are  vibrant and  enjoyable to play;  each time I replay the adventure mode or replay  levels via the quick play  mode   the game is  never the same and it's great  playing against friends or family, sadly it's only local play on the same computer and you share  the 10 balls.  If you play against the computer  you can select one of four difficulty modes.\n\nThe game is  only Â£4.99 on steam  in the UK  or $4.99 in the US (it's cheaper to get a freind in the US to buy it for you if you live in Europe).  I oriignally paid $20 for each version   via Reflexive Arcade when it was first released seven years ago.\n\nYou can see a video speed run of the whole game HERE  (it's 2hr 14mins in length), which gives you the opportunity to skip ahead and check out all of the various levels available in the deluxe version  or you can check out the free Peggle Extreme version HERE","December 12, 2014","true","12.8"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","2"

It's very straightforward. Aim for the orange pegs. Hit the green ones to get various power ups that change every few levels. The power ups are all very different and keep things interesting. Some are not as useful as others like the lobster claw flippers. Each power up makes you think differently about how to approach a level.\n\nAs straightforward as the gameplay is, Peggle isn't simple. You only have 10 moves to clear all the orange pegs and it's difficult to predict just where your ball may bounce at times. Most of the time the results are what you aim for, but sometimes the judging an angle slightly wrong can turn into a wasted ball. Other times, you might just get a layout that works against you. While the design is always the same, the placement of orange pegs varies. But that's the challenge of Peggle.\n\nThere are 55 levels in the game, so plenty to play through. You can always replay levels of your choice later outside of story mode to try your hand at clearing the entire playing field of all blocks.\n\nI wouldn't really consider Peggle a largely re-playable game. I played through story mode twice on a non-Steam version of the game, and playing through again on Steam didn't really hold my interest. But I would definitely consider this a great game for at least one or two playthroughs that is worth it's price point.\n\nThe only negative aspect of this game is the resolution, which is low and doesn't stretch to fit widescreen monitors.","December 23, 2013","true","2.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

Yes, this is game is exactly like Call of Duty: Ghosts where you are able to make your character male or female. I must assure you that if you do not play as the female, you will not get the benefits of being a grill gamer. However, if you do not mind what sex you are, then you'll enjoy the game regardless of the limitations that is given to you when you're handicap. (i.e. Not a female or "grill gamer)\n\nAs you adventure more into Peggle Deluxe, you will find out that you come across enemies known as ex ring leaders of the country Peggleistan. You will have to fight through tough terrain that cannot be done by a point and click game such as Club Penguin. You must use your Xbox 360 controller in order to defeat the enemies, just like TDM in Call of Duty. When you finish these games, you will gain a rank. When you rank up, you unlock more weapons and accesories for you to customize your Peggle soldier. When you are max leveled, you will go through the process of prestiging. Once you have prestiged, the game will offer you a bonus stage that is only exclusive if you own any version of Activison's Call of Duty franchise.\n\nYou may be wondering to yourself: "After I prestige, will I have anything else to do?" The answer to that question would be that you have plenty of opportunities to get more out of the game. The first example would be getting gold guns that which requires you to get 300 headpeggles. Headpeggles are where you headpeggle the headpeggles of the Peggleistan ex ringleaders. Once you get 300 headpeggles, a gold gun that you got those headpeggles will be unlock.\n\nDon't worry, there's more! The game features an unicorn companion as featured in the game's cover art. This unicorn will be your assistant when you're playing this FPS game by PopCap Games! You will later encounter yourself becoming the best ever, and eventually unlocking an MLG avatar that can be only be exclusively unlocked if you pre-order this game!\n\nWait, hold up, I just got some intel from Charlie Delta Echo Sqaud that PopCap Games is offering a one-of-a-time deal if you're the person who bought this game! You will get an exclusive weapon-camo that has the PopCap Games logo on it! What kind of person would you be if you passed that up?\n\nââââââââââââ\n\nAs an ex IGN employee, I can assure you that this review was not bought by PopCap Games. I can also assure you that the feedback that I provided today in this post is not limited and/or accurate to the actual in-game footage that you can see on this Steam page.\n\nSincerely,\nex IGN Employee","June 7, 2014","true","21.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Initially released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X systems in 2007, it has since had versions released for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, the Nintendo DS (with the help of Q Entertainment), Windows Mobile, iOS, Zeebo and Android; the game has also been ported as a Java application, and an extended minigame incorporated into the massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft. A sequel was released in September 2008, titled Peggle Nights.\n\nInspired by pachinko and bagatelle, each level of Peggle challenges the player to shoot a limited supply of balls at a field of colored pegs to clear out specifically marked pegs while attempting to achieve a high score through skilled shot planning. Special powers associated with a number of cartoon "Peggle Masters" can be activated to aid the player in this task. Peggle initially sold slowly but was boosted by the inclusion of a specially designed demonstration in Valve's The Orange Box, and has since enjoyed over 50 million downloads from the Internet. Both its release on Xbox Live Arcade and the iPhone OS have enjoyed similar success. PopCap, now a subsidiary of Electronic Arts, have announced a Peggle 2 at the E3 2013 convention.","May 20, 2014","true","135.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This already shows that it is the better version to choose to play and if you say otherwise  Shut up you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot .\n\nPeggle is a game that involves complex calculations and mechanical skill to ensure that the screen is cleared of small little multicultural dots. The dots vary from a cold-hearted blue, a tanned slag of an orange, and a nice combo of purple and green, thanks doc. By firing out your little ball, you can make it bounce around the screen, hitting these dots to build up a "score", once the dots are all cleared, and the score has been built up, the game reaches its climax when you manage to shoot out your ball into one of the score holes, causing it to explode into a mess of confetti and colours.\n\nAll in all, Peggle deluxe is something to approach with caution. It requires high mental ability to be able to predict and calculate where and when your ball will hit a dot and the amount of score you will obtain. It would also help if you were able to run the game at 60FPS for an enjoyable experience, as we all know, the murky atmosphere and gritty artstyle of a game like this is taxing on the GPU.  Peggle has also been played for years in humanity, being recorded as far back as Aristotles time, as his name was on the leaderboard, next to other geniuses such as Einstien and Shakespeare.\n\n"Î Î¿Î»Ï ÏÎºÎ»Î·ÏÏ ÏÎ±Î¹ÏÎ½Î¯Î´Î¹, Î¼ÏÎ½Î¿ Î³Î¹Î± ÏÎ± ÏÏÎ­Ï" - Aristotle 327 BCE\n"â¥â¥â¥â¥ was harder than figuring out relativity, had to use cheat engine for some of this cracka â¥â¥â¥â¥" - Albert Einstein 1901\n"One would not recommend to inferior feeble minded peasants" - William Shakespeare  1610","January 4, 2015","true","0.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The premise is simple: Shoot the ball to knock out colored pegs in each level. The basic mission in "Adventure Mode" is to clear all of the orange pegs, with bonus points being awarded for stylish shots and clearing the other pegs. Colorful characters provide power boosts and give the game plenty of personality.\n\nPeggle is that special kind of casual puzzle game that will rope you in and keep you playing into the wee hours.

I've put way too many hours into Peggle on my Xbox and thought it would be good to possibly play with my PC friends.  I'm not sure when this version was released on steam, but it looks like a straight port from mobile/tablet and lacks any of the added polish of the console releases. The resolution is paltry. I don't have a large monitor and it only utilizes a third of my screen with no way to push it to full screen. The low res graphics and animation adds to this lackluster port. I could live with those flaws because....PEGGLE. Unfortunately this version doesn't include Peg Party mode which happens to be my favorite mode. On top of that the steam version usually costs the same or more than on XBox Live.

And I played the demo (years ago), and it never really appealed to me. But since I picked it up in the recent Humble Bundle weekly sale featuring PopCap Games, and since people have been talking about the upcoming release of Peggle 2, I thought I've give this old favorite another tryâ¦\n\nWell, I played through the entire "Adventure Mode", and that's about as much of this kind of game as I can see myself playing (so, "no" to the 75 challenge levels, "no" to the sequel, Peggle Nights, and "no" to Peggle 2, as well). It's not a bad game, I just have a very limited attention span for pachinko games, I guess.\n\nI suppose the most interesting personal observation I made while playing this was that I noticed how annoyed I always felt upon hitting the final orange peg and the ball starts bouncing around wildly while the "Ode to Joy" fanfare playsâsomething that I've heard many people report enjoying. It just seemed like a waste of time, during which you weren't actually playing the game. So it's hard for me to understand how some people seem so excited by the reported new feature in the upcoming Peggle 2, which each "Peggle Master" will have their own, unique fanfareâ¦","April 23, 2014","false","4.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lerabbitt/recommended/3480/","lerabbitt","trolltasm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lerabbitt/","116 products in account","Peggle is an epic pinball game that manages to be both vastly amusing and immensely frustrating.\n\nThe point of the game is to eliminate the orange pegs to clear the stage and move onto the next. Blue pegs become collateral damage (or annoying obstacles) in this quest while green pegs release the special powers of your chosen "teacher."\n\nWith a new map loading every time you reload (or fail and must retry) the level, there's endless possibilities for replay. However, that also means that some maps may be easier or more difficult than others, depending on the placement of the orange, blue, and green pegs. In some cases, this meant for me that I had to replay the same level several times to gain a map where I could beat the stage.\n\nThe game also comes with several other ways to play besides the 55 level adventure mode: Quick Level, Duel, and Challenge, that are fairly self-explanatory. Quick Level allows you to select any level you've already beaten and unlocked in the adventure mode, with your choice of any of the teachers and superpowers that you've already unlocked. Duel allows you to challenge someone else (friend or an AI) to a level and compete scores, and challenge gives you access to 75 new "challenge" levels beyond the adventure mode.\n\nThere aren't any achievements to unlock, however, leaving you to compete solely against yourself to see how many points you can get per level/stage (unless you utilize the duel mode).  The music isn't particularly exciting, but it's also not entirely distracting, either.\n\nOverall, for $4.99, it's not a bad way to kill some time and I don't regret playing (or buying) it.","May 15, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its gameplay is so simple and straightforward that no tutorial is really required to get the hang of it. I always learn how to play games best just by jumping right in, and this game lends itself well to that.\n\nDespite its simplicity, there are plenty of things that you can do to make it more challenging for yourself, such as trying to clear the entire screen of pegs, and finishing with as many balls at your disposal as possible. However, since not of that is actually required, if you've only got a couple minutes and don't really care, you can still get something out of this game.\n\nI started off in Adventure mode to familiarize myself with the games, its characters, and their abilities. Then once I finished that I tackled the challenges, which are a lot of fun. There's plenty to do in Peggle.\n\nJust be careful.

It's a stupidly pointless game that heavily resembled Pinko and I'm super ok with that. You launch a ball and try to clear all the orange "peggles" so you can proceed to the next level. Depending on who your character is, if you hit a green "peggle" it ignites their speical power which allows you to play the game a little effectively. Not exactly but close enough.\n\nSome of the levels are trickier than others. I know I've played some countless times just to try and clear it. Then again I have horrible predicting the trajectory even if the game is helpful enough to tell me where it will go after I position it to its first target.

A variety of characters (each with their own special ability) and maps keep the point-and-click gameplay fresh and entertaining throughout. Duel mode is great if you've got a friend over, however some character/level combinations are imbalanced, especially if you're able to activate the special power at the right moment. Selecting the same, or random, characters in duel mode keeps it less cheesy. Peggle is great for younger gamers as well.

Oh yeah, peggle 2 DID just come out but thats an Xbox one exclusive and may never ever be on the PC (which sucks big time). This game is very challenging, has tons of great concepts, and overall, just an awesome game!\nIf you own a wii u and have played neintedo land, you know theres a mini-game where you drop balls (you get balls by getting coins in game) into holes for in game prizes (which this does NOT have but I really don't care), that is a quite simple mini game. But this takes that concept, slaps pinball all over it, and makes it a game worth it. This game does not rely on story and NEVER uses cutscenes, which is great so i don't find myself etheir skipping what I am currently watching (as in cutscenes) or being bored out of my mind! Though if you don't like a plants vs zombies (PC VERSION) type resolution, you may be stuck with the one the game has (though I don't care about that). This game can be REALLY challenging in many ways, and thats what (may) make you want to go back to it. The design isn't bad at all, and I have never experienced a bug playing this game (in other words, I have not experienced a GLITCH playing this). though if you have a *NEW* OS or computer (windows 8 etc.)\nThis may not run as well (but I'm not so sure about that).\nFor me: this game is errorless, theres no really bad thing to say about peggle.","December 27, 2013","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lerabbitt/recommended/3480/","lerabbitt","trolltasm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lerabbitt/","116 products in account","Peggle is an epic pinball game that manages to be both vastly amusing and immensely frustrating.\n\nThe point of the game is to eliminate the orange pegs to clear the stage and move onto the next. Blue pegs become collateral damage (or annoying obstacles) in this quest while green pegs release the special powers of your chosen "teacher."\n\nWith a new map loading every time you reload (or fail and must retry) the level, there's endless possibilities for replay. However, that also means that some maps may be easier or more difficult than others, depending on the placement of the orange, blue, and green pegs. In some cases, this meant for me that I had to replay the same level several times to gain a map where I could beat the stage.\n\nThe game also comes with several other ways to play besides the 55 level adventure mode: Quick Level, Duel, and Challenge, that are fairly self-explanatory. Quick Level allows you to select any level you've already beaten and unlocked in the adventure mode, with your choice of any of the teachers and superpowers that you've already unlocked. Duel allows you to challenge someone else (friend or an AI) to a level and compete scores, and challenge gives you access to 75 new "challenge" levels beyond the adventure mode.\n\nThere aren't any achievements to unlock, however, leaving you to compete solely against yourself to see how many points you can get per level/stage (unless you utilize the duel mode).  The music isn't particularly exciting, but it's also not entirely distracting, either.\n\nOverall, for $4.99, it's not a bad way to kill some time and I don't regret playing (or buying) it.","May 15, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh yeah, peggle 2 DID just come out but thats an Xbox one exclusive and may never ever be on the PC (which sucks big time). This game is very challenging, has tons of great concepts, and overall, just an awesome game!\nIf you own a wii u and have played neintedo land, you know theres a mini-game where you drop balls (you get balls by getting coins in game) into holes for in game prizes (which this does NOT have but I really don't care), that is a quite simple mini game. But this takes that concept, slaps pinball all over it, and makes it a game worth it. This game does not rely on story and NEVER uses cutscenes, which is great so i don't find myself etheir skipping what I am currently watching (as in cutscenes) or being bored out of my mind! Though if you don't like a plants vs zombies (PC VERSION) type resolution, you may be stuck with the one the game has (though I don't care about that). This game can be REALLY challenging in many ways, and thats what (may) make you want to go back to it. The design isn't bad at all, and I have never experienced a bug playing this game (in other words, I have not experienced a GLITCH playing this). though if you have a *NEW* OS or computer (windows 8 etc.)\nThis may not run as well (but I'm not so sure about that).\nFor me: this game is errorless, theres no really bad thing to say about peggle.","December 27, 2013","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Peggle has a great balance of easy and challenging to make it an extremely enjoyable game.","March 31, 2014","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lerabbitt/recommended/3480/","lerabbitt","trolltasm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lerabbitt/","116 products in account","Peggle is an epic pinball game that manages to be both vastly amusing and immensely frustrating.\n\nThe point of the game is to eliminate the orange pegs to clear the stage and move onto the next. Blue pegs become collateral damage (or annoying obstacles) in this quest while green pegs release the special powers of your chosen "teacher."\n\nWith a new map loading every time you reload (or fail and must retry) the level, there's endless possibilities for replay. However, that also means that some maps may be easier or more difficult than others, depending on the placement of the orange, blue, and green pegs. In some cases, this meant for me that I had to replay the same level several times to gain a map where I could beat the stage.\n\nThe game also comes with several other ways to play besides the 55 level adventure mode: Quick Level, Duel, and Challenge, that are fairly self-explanatory. Quick Level allows you to select any level you've already beaten and unlocked in the adventure mode, with your choice of any of the teachers and superpowers that you've already unlocked. Duel allows you to challenge someone else (friend or an AI) to a level and compete scores, and challenge gives you access to 75 new "challenge" levels beyond the adventure mode.\n\nThere aren't any achievements to unlock, however, leaving you to compete solely against yourself to see how many points you can get per level/stage (unless you utilize the duel mode).  The music isn't particularly exciting, but it's also not entirely distracting, either.\n\nOverall, for $4.99, it's not a bad way to kill some time and I don't regret playing (or buying) it.","May 15, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a stupidly pointless game that heavily resembled Pinko and I'm super ok with that. You launch a ball and try to clear all the orange "peggles" so you can proceed to the next level. Depending on who your character is, if you hit a green "peggle" it ignites their speical power which allows you to play the game a little effectively. Not exactly but close enough.\n\nSome of the levels are trickier than others. I know I've played some countless times just to try and clear it. Then again I have horrible predicting the trajectory even if the game is helpful enough to tell me where it will go after I position it to its first target.

Its gameplay is so simple and straightforward that no tutorial is really required to get the hang of it. I always learn how to play games best just by jumping right in, and this game lends itself well to that.\n\nDespite its simplicity, there are plenty of things that you can do to make it more challenging for yourself, such as trying to clear the entire screen of pegs, and finishing with as many balls at your disposal as possible. However, since not of that is actually required, if you've only got a couple minutes and don't really care, you can still get something out of this game.\n\nI started off in Adventure mode to familiarize myself with the games, its characters, and their abilities. Then once I finished that I tackled the challenges, which are a lot of fun. There's plenty to do in Peggle.\n\nJust be careful.

I believe this is Pop Cap's most successful game other than Plants vs. Zombies. Sadly, Pop Cap has been bought out and doomed by EA like most game companies. Anyway, the gameplay is most entertaining, but sometimes frustrating. You'll look back at your mistakes and just say to yourself "I can't believe I never noticed that" and other quotes. Bottomline, it's pretty entertaining in the longrun. I've only played this game for a few hours, but I am enjoying every second of it.\n\nSmall note: The game tends to freeze for about 10 seconds when opening the Shift+Tab menu after completing a level.","August 29, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've had Peggle across 3 different platforms with enough hours played to feel ashamed of, and I still can't get enough! A variety of characters (each with their own special ability) and maps keep the point-and-click gameplay fresh and entertaining throughout. Duel mode is great if you've got a friend over, however some character/level combinations are imbalanced, especially if you're able to activate the special power at the right moment. Selecting the same, or random, characters in duel mode keeps it less cheesy. Peggle is great for younger gamers as well.

The gameplay is satisfying when it's simple and it's satisfying when you're getting crazy scores.","April 9, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a very relaxing game, and it gives you that sense of accomplishment every time you finish a level. I would've liked to see some achievements, I feel it would've given me a few more hours of play time, but still, overall a fantastic game. I recommend getting it, worth it's price, and honestly, I'd pay a bit more, that's how good it is.","January 24","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you play through the game you begin realize there is more to it than just hitting red pegs and completing the level. Thereâs strategy, timing and angles involved for those who do the Challenge levels which I'll get into in a bit. Combo's are a huge part of this and can result in massive scores and free balls by going for pink pegs (Score boost), green pegs (your peggle masters ability) and hitting enough pegs to build up your combo meter.\n\nAdventure modeThere are 50 Adventure mode levels split between 10 different peggle masters and 5 master levels at the end.\nThe Adventure mode is designed to teach you the different "Peggle Masters" aka characters and their abilities.\nDifferent characters abilities are better for curtain scenarios depending on what your strategy is.\n\nChallenge modeThere are 75 Challenge mode levels which require you to complete the specific level in a particular way, the further you progress through the challenge levels the harder they get. Towards the last 15 or so they become very hard and only the best/luckiest players have a chance at beating them. Some examples of levels I had a very hard time beating and got a little lucky when I did beat them were "Complete a level starting with only 1 ball", beat a master AI score over 3 levels, score 750k over 3 levels etc. Ones that I tried and just couldn't do are like "Score 1 mil over 3 levels, "score 750k in a single level" and "beat 10 levels in a row".... yeah no thanks. In total I beat 70/75 challenges which is good enough for me.\n\nQuick Play and Duel are a waste of time, you get to do some duels anyway in the challenge mode.\n\n9.2/10- Hours of content, Relaxing gameplay and challenging high end levels","April 27","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
