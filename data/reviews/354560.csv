When it comes to this game youre more of a general commanding massive numbers rather then just selecting a handful of guys and telling them to attack. This game makes really easy to attack since there is auto attack. overall extremely just be careful starting a match because your ideal 30 minute match could become 2 hours. have fun.","August 9, 2015","true","55.8"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","24","33","0","0"

After playing a session for like an hour or so though, I love the concept.  They made an RTS game that is as minimal as possible.  Literally zero options for units, buildings, or anything of that sort.  You just have a barracks that automatically spews out enemies and you place gold mines on gold mines to generate money.  The Jade system is basically a special currency of special weapons.  You need it to cast nukes and such.  Harvested exactly the same as gold, you place little jade harvesters on jade mines.\n\nYou have the ability to send 1000's of units into battle at once.  The game is all about volume and strategy.  Your unit creating barracks will automatically send them to a desired waypoint, so you can literally create 100's of barracks all over the map and send them to your enemies bases or you could try to surround your enemy with barracks so they are just getting infinitely bombarded.  And you will have armies to face as well.  The sheer numbers of units you will be using is so entertaining.  It would be too complicated to have direct control on any of them so it's great how you can just focus on setting the waypoints to your battles so the fresh units will be at the right place.  You could also build up an army of a  zillion units to send in all at once and overwhelm them.\n\nI only played one match so far but I plan on playing the game a lot more often, I just wanted to post my thoughts here.  It's not a game I could see growing old anytime soon since it's so shallow there isn't much to get bored of right off the bat, but no other game I have played uses these very simple rules with insane numbers.  It instantly became one of my favorite RTS's of all time in a very short period of time.\n\nSomething you notice early on is that the cost of each barrack or gold mine increases with each one added.  Also, the amount of jade required for a nuke (or any other ability) increases with each use.  This helps to bring balance to the game over periods of time!\n\nThere are some aspects I would like improved, but the main drawback is that the pathfinding is not very bright.  Sometimes the units get confused and just stop.  Or one prime example is I had a barracks creating units and sending them across the map to the north-east but 20% of the units created were being sent into a corner and pooling up for no apparent reason, even if I changed the waypoint they kept just leaking out into the corner (in the complete opposite direction).  That being said though, for something this "indie", they have created something very unique and worth checking out.","August 18, 2015","true","13.5"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

They were just really chill people who were stoked about the game, that excitement quickly rubbed off on me and I was ready to try it out. My first game didn't go so well as I was bum-rushed by another player before I had the chance to get my dragonlord out of the way. Second game, much better. I believe that it was the first coop game setup at RTX 2015 so that was pretty cool. I was playing along side my friend against two people who had just met, obvious advantage, right? Wrong. It started out with my friend on the top left quadrant and me on the bottom left quadrant. We both fought battles to our right first of all and it just so happened that I was paired with the more capable enemy out of the two. My friend had already won his battle and half of the enemy team was taken out shortly after the start of the game. I wasnt't too far behind him in my defeat so I reverted to defensive strategies and attempted to transport my dragonlord up to where my friend was located. The remaining enemy got a little too close to my confused dragonlord and defeated me. It was up to my friend. The game went on a little longer and then we recieved guidance from a great source named "John." It started out with John saying to my friend something along the lines of, "So you want to wipe out the pink?" Pink being the enemy of course, the answer was obviously yes. John told my friend to sit tight and build up jade which didnt't take long, then he pointed out the enemy dragonlord on his corner with a not-so-big army gaurding his dragonlord. John instructed my friend to use a strategy that was very familiar to him that hadn't crossed either of our minds. My friend used Terracotta, it was super effective! A well placed Terracotta wiped out an enemy that was easily winning the battle in troop count and brought us to victory. Thank you, John! The four of us at the table were all fairly surprised at the outcome and high-fives were shared amongst us. My friend and I then split the cost of four copies, with the intentions of giving away the other two copies to our friends. After downloading it on my PC and having a chance to experience it more, I really like the community that I've seen so far and have throughly enjoyed playing the game with people that I met less than an hour earlier. Overall, a very enjoyable game, and I hope that the community will grow and give it support so that it can be even better.","August 10, 2015","true","2.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slizzard420/recommended/354560/","slizzard420","Daddy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slizzard420/","76 products in account","The only reason this review is negative is because the developer seems to have abandoned this promising title.\n\nTL;DR: The game is fun, but it's limited to multiplayer. Wait till the devs start updating it again before you buy it.\n\nSome friends and I bought this game after talking to the devs and seeing gameplay at RTX 2015, and it seemed absolutely worth it. Aside from some initial technical difficulties (which were quickly fixed by the devs within a day of us bringing it to their attention) they game was really fun. It's fun to play, has decent music, and functioning multiplayer. Unfortunately, that’s essentially as far as it goes. There isn't really any single player aside from the training maps, but those are essentially just you trying to build up your army fast enough to not be overwhelmed by the preplaced enemy buildings. There is no AI that tries to out build you or gather more resources or anything of that nature, so the only real strategical matches you'll play in this game will be in multiplayer. Nonetheless, if you have someone to play with, then you'll have a good time.\nAlso, after launch the devs added a "Map Editor" feature that allows you to design your own scenarios and maps (much like the scenario editor in Rise of Nations). This is a great addition; however, you cannot use the custom maps in multiplayer matches. Thus, the feature is somewhat worthless considering the lack of a single player AI.\nHonestly, this game feels like it should have been an early access release considering the sheer lack of features. And like many early access releases, the developers stopped pumping out patches and additions in September.\nOverall, I wouldn’t buy this game unless it is heavily discounted or the changelogs reveal some more recent updates.\n","January 1","false","4.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

You start out with a Dragon Lord (General), and possibly a handful of troops, and start out to build Gold Factories and Jade Factories where the resources can be found. You use Gold to build more factories as well as barracks. Jade is gathered so the Dragon Lord can cast spells to harm your opponnent/strengthen your position. The sole purpose of Barracks is to continuously and indefinitely pump out soldiers at no further cost to you. The more barracks you have, the quicker you can build an unstoppable legion. And from there, use your wits and strategize against your opponents.\n\nOverall, WAL is a great RTS game to play either solo or with friends.  So what are you waiting for? Play it!\n\n\n\n","August 10, 2015","true","4.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

I really love simple "easy-to-learn-hard-to-master" -type games, this one has only the simplicity without any depth. It's like the developer had a great game idea, then lost interest midway and just released it.\n\nThe most basic RTS elements would work wonders on this game:\n- more maps and objectives on the map\n- defensive buildings(walls, towers)\n- more than three units types(ranged shooting units)\n- upgradeadble units "what unit should i upgrade next?"\n- ...\n\nSimplicity is well and good, but it's not an excuse for lacking depth. The thing about "retro arcade style strategy" as the developer calls it, is - as with all arcade games- that there is something to master, for this game there is literally nothing to learn. I would not recommend this game before a major content update, which most likely will never come.","August 9, 2015","false","1.6"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","2"
