The game has a loose story about arachnophobia and gynophobia, The game contains two short, boring shooting sequences and it's over, that's it. I was disappointed by the length (an hour at most). I dont know what else to say because there was nothing to it. I may be a little harsh, but play another horror game worth your time.","May 29, 2015","false","1.0"," 302 of 346 people (87%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","87","302","346","20","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetinnman/recommended/365020/","thetinnman","TheTinnMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetinnman/","347 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGynophobia tries really hard to symbolize a deep, dark meaning, but unfortunately does a very poor job at explaining or hinting to it. There's little to no continuity in the little bit of story that peeks through, levels don't match and feel stitched together, and the game ends as abruptly as it starts. The time I have logged in is almost enough to beat the game twice (it crashed towards the end my first time).\n\nSpoilers Inbound:\nWithout extrapolating more information than I need to, you play as a young man with an acute fear of spiders and women, living with his mother in a rather small apartment. The game starts with you staring out the window in your mother's room. Quickly growing tired of this, you decide to go play PC games, but on the way there you are "ambushed" by a tarantula-sized spider walking across your hallway. After it passes, you are free to enter your room where you begin the first portion of the game, a crappy Left 4 Dead knock-off consisting of two short zombie-shootin' levels. After this is complete (no more than 10 minutes later), the doorbell rings and you are terrified to learn that it is a young woman with a very low-cut top. Spooky! You make a dash to the kitchen to drink your stress medicine out of a very ornate silver bottle. This makes you tired, so you need to return to the bedroom and rest, starting the second (and final) portion of the game: a dungeon-crawling shooter that plays exactly like the first portion, except now you have spiders to worry about in addition to the all-female zombie horde. Oh, and weird floaty head things. After a quick jog through two generic dungeon/cave levels and a simple boss battle, you awaken to find your courage restored. You charge out of the room, squish that pesky spider, and throw open the door to greet the young woman who had apparently been standing outside during your entire nap, and the game ends.\n\nIn Short:\nGynophobia lacks so much that I'm not sure I could even qualify it as a game. There's no variety, no continuity, no explanations, and not much of a game to play. As I mentioned above, I'm sure the developer had every intention to make this game as symbolic and deep as he could, but failed to realize what his game was short on: everything.","June 6, 2015","false","0.6"," 152 of 164 people (93%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","93","152","164","16","0"

Gameplay is pretty boring and takes place within two levels with some pretty average run-and-gun elements. Somethign tells me if the creator tried to make a more fun, more faster paced arcader style shooter they'd actually do pretty darn well with it. Game is pretty smooth in that area.\n\nBut the really unnecessary 'fear of the ladies/Mommy issues' the game seems to be built on is not only weak but borderline stupid. You're just scared of women, for no justified reason. You're dumped into the game world with only one line of text to explain what Gynophobia is and the only justification that you have it is that the screen gets all shakey when someone with an XX chromosome rings the doorbell.\n\nYou're also afraid of spiders; almost seems like an excuse to add an extra enemy into the game.\n\nBought it for curiosities sake, consider this cat to be killed. Buy if you want bragging rights towards ownership before this game triggers the wrong crowd and it's removed from Steam.\n\n","May 30, 2015","false","0.7"," 181 of 234 people (77%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","77","181","234","28","8"

Well... it's okay at best. I got this on sale for $2 and I can't say it's worth more than that. The game is all of 30 minutes long maybe, assuming you play the zombie mini-game. Basically, Gynophobia is about a young male of indeterminate age with a paralyzing phobia of spiders and females. His mother slips him some strange potion and he goes on a mental bender within a dream, fighting his fears to overcome them. That's basically Gynophobia in a nutshell. While I feel like there is an idea of a better story to be had here, the work simply hasn't been put into it.\n\nTo start, Gynophobia has some buggy walking detection. The difference between a street and a curb can cause your character to bounce up and down while sometimes loading in from a continue screen leaves your movement (and controls frozen). Additionally, you can surf atop of enemies! Land squarely on an enemy's head and you'll be taken for a ride wherever they go. Dead foes also present walking obstacles until they fade into the ground.\n\nConcerning the art, outside of the last boss, it's generally very low. The female zombie-like enemies resemble something from a cruder version of the first Timesplitters with poorly stretched out textures and barely recognizable humanoid shapes. The spiders are somewhat better off, but I'm not certain as to why. According to the developer, these are stock assets. Understood, but they really don't make things look all that great.\n\nThis is the kind of title that's bad enough to be amusing and I suspect it capitalizes on that concept so people like Jim Quisition (who gets referenced in this game) will give it free advertising and cash in value. Gynophobia DOES have the potential to be an interesting game, but it's so short and cheaply done that all the tongue in cheek references can't make it genuinely good. I honestly wish someone more competent could have helmed this titled because the concept is there, but the execution is barely worth the penny. The game is so-so at best.","August 6, 2015","false","2.1"," 92 of 107 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","92","107","10","3"

You are greeted with very fast zombies, that you need to one shot to the head with your pistol, which is given very limited ammo (you need to find the rest). The speed of the monsters puts you on edge right away.  This can be good for it does have a high level of tension, sadly this tension turns into frustration along the way. The monsters only need to hit you a few times before you die from it, but the restart check point is the start of the level, and the levels get longer as you play. But should you strive on and make it through the game you will be meet only near the end against an ubber boss who will do you in nine out of ten times.\n\nThe game is not balanced, and while the graphics are not the worse thing in this game, the fact it does not respect your time is. It has fast pace action with guns that feel heavy, but the cost of dying is just too easy and great.\n\nWhile it was interesting at the start it quickly got old fast.

You start out as a boy that has Gynophobia (Abnormal fear of women) closely  related to the phobia of spiders...which you also have. You play video games which seems to be one of the reasons you may have these phobias, and your parents are concerned. Your mother ends up giving you a bottle of some kind liquid to try and help you. Last your way through nightmares to overcome your abnormal fear of women and spiders.\n\nPros & Cons ++  Pros\n+Actually scarry\n+Easy controls\n+Not ALL jump scares\n+Great art (Creature and character models)\n+Price (Currently $3.99 US)\n+Sound effects\n+Low spec computers can handle this without any issues\n\n-- Cons\n-PS2 quality graphics\n-Total of 3 weapons\n-Not a lot of story or lure\n-Game is very short\n\nPersonal Opinion In all honesty, this game terrified me. Spiders and I do not get along to well either anyways and this game has magnified by 1,000. The overall game play and the sheer entertainment of the game forgives the graphics. The price for the game is great for how long the game actually is. I do want to add that this game had a fantastic sound track and fit well with the game play.\n\nFinal recommendation: Based off of graphics, sound, control, story, price, game play flow, and overall user experience\nI rate this 7/10. It feels high to me due to the low graphics its putting out, but the devs knew that and gave it a reasonable price so you are getting what you paid for, graphics wise.\n\nIf you found this review helpful and want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow here!","January 9","true","5.9"," 40 of 64 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","40","64","3","0"

The crouch key issue is now fixed, thank you!!\n\n*Very smooth gameplay and interface overall\n\n*Fun and responsive weapon system\n\n*some unique zombie-surival style elements\n\n*The enemies are varied and fun to battle\n\n*The developers nailed it with the scare factor of spiders\n\n*very nice textures overall (the 'poly count' on the enemies is a bit of a toss up in terms of it being a pro or a con)\n\n\nCons:\n-No optional save system\n\n-the game itself is a bit short\n\n-some small clipping issues\n\n-no sequel\n\nOveral rating:\n\n9/10\n\nmy personal reason for the rating (edited as of Aug 10th) (starting from a perfect 10 and deducting points from 10):\n\n-1 the game should be longer\n\n10 - 1 = 9 = 9/10 rating\n\n\n****Big thank you to the developer(s) for listening to their customers****\n\n***P.S. I believe Creashock Studios deserves some credit for the pride they take in their work.","August 5, 2015","true","9.1"," 30 of 60 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","30","60","5","2"

It does have bad AI, the level design is pretty plain, but honestly just knowing that one person made this game, makes you feel kind of a connection to the developer. One guy just hoping that some people would buy his game. Sure it's kind of misogynistic that one of the few primary monsters in the game are women, but there was a real challenge to the game of conserving ammo and being careful at every step. It also goes to a time where checkpoints are far apart which gives you a real rush when you make it past the "one" hard part. Overall I'd say give it a play.

When playing this game i found it fun to play, and rather emmersive with the environment. i admit that the story line is slightly lacking, but If you go in with the mindframe that the game is meant to be a jump scare based horor game, then the fun of these scares and the atmosphere made by the soundtrack (not the one in the trailer) makes up for the lacking story\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0rBtyXD2FdU","August 21, 2015","true","3.1"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","5","0","0"

I had to quit my job and cannot leave the house because I'm afraid a woman will try to put spiders in my mouth. Also I sleep with a stocking over my head so spiders cannot lay eggs in my ears or crawl up my nose while I am asleep. I'm also scared of the stocking, but it seemed like the lesser of two evils.\n\nIn its present state the game is very short, so much so that when it ends you will be left asking "Is that it??". The fact that I was left hoping for more is what makes me want to recommend this game, because obviously what I played was good enough that I hoped it would keep going.\n\nThe graphics are pretty basic, and the gameplay is fairly standard FPS stuff, but that's exactly what the game promised. It handles well, and the only time I died was because I panicked and didn't reload my weapon and bumped into a wall or something. Despite being in early access Gynophobia seems fairly stable; I didn't encounter any bugs while playing it (other than a bunch of spiders of course). It seems the dev opted for stability in early access rather than having a great volume of content, which you can't really be upset about because the game works; it's just too short.\n\nHopefully the dev will add more levels and depth to the game such as elaborating on the backstory of the protagonist to further cement my newly found irrational fear of spiders and women.\n\n5/10 - Just don't mention Spiderwoman.","May 31, 2015","true","1.4"," 20 of 63 people (32%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","32","20","63","30","5"

He deals with those fears by playing a zombie shooter called Dead Hunger.\nThe game switches between apartment map to zombie shooting maps. With 3 weapons knife, handgun and assault rifle to fight off the zombie hoarde. The zombies are fast and have a head bob making them hard to hit with that single headshot. Spiders of many sizes with an egg destroying mission to go along with them.\nLooks good.

Step aside Pushkin, re-seat yourself, Chekhov, we have no need of you.\n\nThis game is stilted, homophobic, and sexist - you don't necessarily have to present gynophobia as sexism, and in fact it would be interesting to look at gynophobia as a product of a sexist society, but instead presents it as an almost rational fear. The only female that the protagonist is close to roofies him to try and cure his phobia. And then, once he defeats all the spiders and women and spider women and drider riders a woman is his reward. Hooray.\n\nAlso the zombie game is literally the worst nested narrative in the freaking world. Why do it? To demonstrate the mechanics before the actual meat of the 'game'? More like to pad time for this two-dollar experience. Everyone knows that nested narratives are a cheap tactic to make weak stories stronger.\n\nBesides that, the game isn't... that great. The sounds aren't localized to enemy locations, the controls are... strange, to the point where I got beaten up by a twelve-foot-tall leather daddy while I was trying to get a tire to not clip through the car it was being put on, and the game artificially inflated its difficulty by throwing gobs of enemies at the player. But even then, it was still barely a two hour game.\n\nIn any case, I hate to constantly beat up on this game. If this was a first game, then, honestly, okay to you, studio, you tried and you made a product that is being sold and experienced. Now comes the even more valuable experience of sorting through criticism to make a much better game next time!","October 11, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would never recommend it out of the blue to anyone but if someone would ask me about it then i would say that it is a simple fps that excel at nothing but it might be worth trying if you want to try something new, can find it dirt cheap and of course already have played the better fps games.\n\nWhat i will say about the game is that it feels like a honest attempt to make a low budget fps. There is not a whole lot of content in the game but what is there works and the game feels finished.\n\nSo what you get is a cheap fps that functions but neither sounds, looks or feels all that good to play. I like shooters though and i can see a charm in low budget games that seems to have some love put in them. But my biggest problem with gynophobia is that it there is not a whole lot of content and the content is not very interesting or unique.\n\nI completed the game in less than an hour and i can't see myself replaying any of it. The levels are quite boring and does not seem to use the theme in any interesting way. The enemies are with a few exceptions always zombies and spiders and even though there is some weak connection to the theme they are just not all that interesting not to mention fun to fight against since they do little more than run towards you.\n\nIt also does not help that you only have three weapons in the game. You get a knife, a handgun and a machinegun and this is just a plain boring weapon selection. Especially so since the combat section are set in dreams and games and therefore you could perhaps expect a little more creativity.\n\nOverall the content feels pretty generic which is a shame since you could imagine the theme to be used to create something that felt more unique. So what you get is a pretty generic and short fps that works but would still have been below average in basically all aspects even 10 years ago. It is cheap though.\n","October 11, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
