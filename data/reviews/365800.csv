Definitely not worth 20€.\nIn fact, I feel a bit disappointed because when I spotted this game on Steam's Upcoming Releases, i was excited about the concept and bought it just as it released. Sadly, in my opinion, it fails to deliver the depth one might expect at that price.\n\nWhat feels pretty good about the game :\n- A brand new take on the Tycoon games concept\n- Atmosphere and Music is pretty great\n- Interaction between CyberSpace and MeatSpace\n- Everything is dynamic, cashflow is realtime, city is affected by adverts... or supposed to be (see below)\n- Multiple OS support (thanks!)\n- In-game display of the ads\n- Runs rather smooth\n- Apparently has Trading Cards support despite not being on store page\n- Occulus Rift Support (couldn't try it myself)\n\nSadly it has a number of problems:\n- Basically no kind of game setup settings or anything. City size, difficulty, number of companies.. Nope.\n- No options beyond video. I couldn't even find where to change keyboard layout (WASD on AZERTY ? what a pain)\n- Game runs fast, and apparently without timing controls. All i could find was pause. When you begin the game and are advised to take a loan, you're going to owe twice the loan in a matter of minutes while you're figuring controls out.\n- Most of the dynamism is completely hidden, it's hard to tell what you do has any actual effect\n- It's a tycoon & management game. You would expect a few fancy visualisation screens and stats to guide your choices. There's pretty much none beyond a rough cash/debt graph and corp value.\n- I couldn't find anything like a tutorial, so game start is pretty much planting ads left and right and hoping to make a profit. I have to mention you don't even start in the 'right place', and i had to click around to find out i had an HQ with an actual influence area.\n- Because of the lack of feedback about what's actually happening, all you can do is spray'n'pray and watch your cashflow. What's going on behind the scenes ? No clue.\n\n\nAll in all, it's not really a bad concept... But for 20€, it's definitely not polished and deep enough. Don't buy it at this price, or you're definitely going to be disappointed.","June 5, 2015","false","0.6"," 258 of 289 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","258","289","5","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DanglyDeever/recommended/365800/","DanglyDeever","Dangly Deever","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DanglyDeever/","531 products in account","Tycoon games always have a special place in my heart. Nothing like running a business, growing big, and smashing all the other competitors, and AdvertCity doesn't disappoint. Playing as an ad agency in a cyberpunk world, you must plaster name brands on every surface possible.\n\nFirst, I want to point out what the game does really well. You can create a new city through the random number seed, and you basically have a completely different city every time, which is nice. The business aspect of the whole game is mixed with meatspace and netspace, which you must control both to get the best out of your advertising. Meatspace entails sending out fliers to setting up billboards while netspace deals with text ads and such. There's always the goal of expanding and stretching out your ad agency's empire, and it's a great feeling when you plaster the whole city with your own ads and rolling in the credits.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, and it's coupled with a fantastic soundtrack that makes you feel like you really are in a cyberpunk world. Even the little things like switching between real world and the internet also tweaks the music a bit to grant more immersion.\n\nThe game runs great with no hiccups whatsoever, and I hear it's optimized for multiple operating systems (I only have windows, so I don't know how it runs on other OSes). The graphics work well for the game, and does a good job of creating a cyberpunk atmosphere.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does come with its share of problems. First of all, the GUI in the game could definitely use some work. It's hard to tell what buildings are and how many people are in them until you click them, so you'll be clicking through A LOT of buildings to better target ads, which is time consuming. It would be nice to know what building is the HQ of a corp, especially when you're looking for the bank to get a loan. The visuals definitely give a great cyberpunk feel, but at certain angles, it's hard to see some buildings that blend into the background.\n\nThe game also seems to like hiding some of its features. It's hard to tell what effect your ads are having on people, how it affects other corporations or even how it affects the building you're targeting since each building is owned by a different corporation. More management screens or something that's telling what's happening could definitely improve the game.\n\nOn a personal note, I would also love to see more corporate warfare. Maybe hire hackers or thugs to sabotage other corporations or something like that, but that's the cyberpunk fan in me wanting a little more.\n\nOverall, the game is definitely worth checking out especially if you like the cyberpunk theme. At it's current price point of $20, it's a hard investment to put into a game. Maybe catch it on sale or wait until the price goes down.","June 6, 2015","true","2.1"," 52 of 62 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","52","62","0","0"

Self-promotion and advertisements are an essential part of getting eyes on your work, after all. Those eyes on your work are ultimately what puts food on your table.\n\nOut there, floating through my procedurally-generated city, I had a real sense of sudden connectivity with what I do in the real world. Picking my targets and watching, in real-time, how the campaign unfolded gave me a quiet thrill. If anything, I wanted more information on the outcome of each campaign: not just the amount of views, but the reaction of the viewers, their demographics... information I could use to more carefully craft future advertising programs.\n\nIt was then that I realised that AdvertCity had me. For all its flaws, I was revelling in it, pursuing more information, seeking approval, weighing up my finances -- more, more, more!\n\nAdvertCity is a tycoon game with a cyberpunk flavour. As the owner of AdSplay -- a futuristic analogue of Google Adsense -- your goal is to advance the reach and sales of a suite of Megacorps through your advertising. Back them, gain their trust, and then buy them: the ultimate objective is a complete city takeover. Advertising is done both in meatspace and cyberspace by navigating to buildings or websites and selecting your method and company. As your funds and influence build, you'll unlock new methods and technologies to keep pace with your crushing loan with the Happy Banking Corp -- who, incidentally, are ripe for a little hostile takeover.\n\nUnfortunately, AdvertCity is held back by its relentless conformity to an older style of game. Much in the same vein as Dwarf Fortress, the UI is a mess -- opacity between text windows means that it can be difficult to pick out pieces of information.\n\nThe uniform grey, slab-like cyberpunk city is thematically appropriate but it makes locating individual or specific buildings next to impossible. Constantly scaling debt and a lack of a method to pause the game means that, at least initially, spraying and praying becomes your best advertising policy.\n\nControls are another beast. Keyboard navigation is aptly floaty, which can take a little getting used to. The problematic part is mouse control. With no way to adjust sensitivity in-game, I found myself spinning wildly through meatspace and cyberspace alike. The game promises partial controller support, but it isn't clear what or how this is achieved.\n\nFeedback on your actions is minimal. A lack of sound cues does not help. In a sense, though, that's an understandable decision: AdvertCity's soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. The bleak, acidic jazz perfectly matches the tone of the game. The hour-long soundtrack is sold separately and is well worth considering.\n\nOverall, subtle touches combined and a strongly principled approach from its developers left me with a positive impression of AdvertCity. If Steam used a star rating system, I'd go with 3/5 stars. The game's flaws aren't always easy to overlook, but the immersive atmosphere, fantastic soundtrack, and engaging gameplay are worth the struggle.","June 7, 2015","true","1.9"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","36","44","0","0"

There's enough of that ♥♥♥♥ already.\n\nI personally cannot keep my hands off of any tycoon that passes through my line of sight. I really owe this addiction to the SimCity series. AdvertCity is no exception. However, like the latest installment of the SimCity bloodline, I'm finding my self wanting so much more, yet at the same time constantly coming back and playing over and over again. Even when I look at this game in a critical point of view, I find it so darn charming that I wish I could dance with it at the royal ball and then at midnight loose my glass slipper so it can call me up the next morning and take me out to sunday brunch. It really is that good of a concept, and I agree with the developers with their choice of forcing the player into the world with no prior information on how to do anything. Yes, at first it is frustrating to be plopped in the middle of an endless city without remembering how you got there or what in God's holy name you are even doing there, but once you figure it all out, it's a wonderful feeling.\n\nI suddenly hear you muttering to yourself, "But the UI is worthless garbage, it's inexcusable and sloppy..."\n\n"Yes," I say, "but one of the parts of the game that I found enjoyable was trying to find out how to use it and creat an efficient method to the madness that is this diabolical city."\n\nYou then return fire with "But the game is so grindy and grinding is stupid."\n\nI then furrow my eyebrows and say "It's a ♥♥♥♥ing tycoon game. One way or another, there will be grinding. It's inevitable with these types of games. Atleast, I think so."\n\n"It's 20 dollars," you say flatly.\n\nGood point.\n\nBut even though I am 20 bucks poorer, I don't feel that dissapointed. Maybe that's because I am easily amused, or maybe it's because I have hope for this game and more like it.\n\nAll in all, I do reccomend this game to those who are largely interested in tycoon gaming. If only the game was like 15 bucks cheaper, then would I think that people would be more accepting and more willing to try it for themselves. But hey, if you got 20 big bucks that you are willing to squander, then by all means, knock yourself out.","September 12, 2015","true","22.3"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","24","28","4","1"

I miss these kind of games quite much, where your main objective is just as simple as it is challenging: To gain the most money in every way possible (well, mainly through Ads here xD) Now let`s get to the pros and cons:\n\nPro first:\n-a new idea of a tycoon game (never seen a game, where your main income comes from advertising)\n-interesting concept of implementing the in-game world through meatspace and cyberspace (resembles the idea found in Shadowrun)\n-great music, which matches the theme\n-I can see the ads I put on the buildings (gives me kind of a feedback)\n-uses seeds to generate a random map\n-interesting idea of implementing the Oculus Rift to "fly and control" in this virtual world (Sorry, but again it reminds me of a decker character found in Shadowrun ;P)\n-it gradually gets new updates\n\n\n\nNow the Cons:\n-Usability of the UI is quite questionable\n-Camera controls are not as easy to get into\n-the first time I entered this world I felt like being thrown into cold water (short and almost non noticeable tutorial on the bottom of the UI)\n-a bit pricey\n-well, it`s not really a con, but this game is locked at 60 fpm although my setup could support way more (only if fpm matters to you)\n\n\nNow this game really has some interesting concepts and ideas. However, as it likes to implement the cold and harsh world of a cyberspace setting its UI seems to simulate the unfriendliness as well too.

The main goal is to expand the company's area of influence by investing on its advertising business on behalf of different megacorps, until it takes over their territory and owns them.\n\nGameplay\nAfter clicking on "New Game", a new city is generated and everything quickly starts with a really bland and short tutorial, which doesn't really explain anything. The player is left wondering what to do next as the debts with the bank increase and the funds don't seem to keep up. Unfortunately this is not supported by the UI and general camera navigation, which are not easy to get comfortable with. However, underneath this cryptic surface, there's a series of real time events and developments that affect the city's growth. In short, the player must get into the cycle of providing an advertising service to one of the megacorps, increase influence until a new technology is available and then start building cash to expand his/her company's empire. This can be achieved by switching between physical (meatspace) and digital (cyberspace) advert.\n\nArt Direction\nThe cyberpunk atmosphere is successfully delivered, and the variations in the background music when you switch between meatspace and cyberspace are a nice little touch. However, the overall look could benefit from a bit of polishing and some improvements in the readability of the buildings that populate the city.\n\nTechnical Issues\nThe game's engine doesn't offer many options to tinker with, but should run smoothly on any system. I encountered an issue with windowed mode, where my cursor would keep going upwards until I switched back to fullscreen. Also, it's possible to select the font size, but it doesn't scale too well at the highest settings and doesn't affect the messages you receive in your activity log.\n\nSo, should I play it?\nI can recommend this game only to who really likes the genre and doesn't care too much about presentation/user friendly interfaces. If the developer will listen to player feedback and work towards addressing the noticeable usability issues, the experience could be much more enjoyable. Maybe get it during a sale, as the price tag is pretty high in my opinion.","April 7","true","5.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

How I perceived this game whether it’s positively or negatively is entirely up to me.\n\nAdvertCity is a tycoon game set in cyberpunk theme, The way to make money is by advertising,building your operations and to engage/buyout the other Tycoons.\n\nPros :\n\n-Unique gameplay\n-Great Soundtrack\n-VR support\n-Graphics-wise\n\nCons\n-UI is bland and the font is really hard to read\n-Tutorial is really hard to grasp/understand\n-The Camera is really hard to control\n\nOverall : This game could really use some fixes in many areas, but I think the concept alone caught my attention and I will watch the game’s development since I know the game can be improved dramatically in a couple of patches. 7/10\n\n\n","April 10","true","1.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

AdvertCity is different from any other simulator or cyberpunk game.\n\nWhen I first launced this game, I was confused by the interface, it was a little hard and weird. But after 1 hour of playing I realised that interface is comfortable and easy to use. You need some time to get used to it. One of the main reasons why interface is weird is a useless and short tutorial.\nDespite the inconveniences with interface, control in AdvertCity is really handy! It's easy to move througout the map (which is really large). The only thing i had troubles with was a mouse sensitive, it was too high, so I had to visit game settings and to lower it. It helped.\n\nMusic in this game is strange, but it harmonizes with the genre and gameplay of the game... and it doesn't annoy.\nThe interesting thing about AdvertCity is changing of day and night! Even lights in windows of buildings are changing!\nThen, I noticed support of VR and Oculus Rift, it would be definitely interesting and exciting to try it, but unfortunatelly I don't have it! =)\n\nThe only thing that disappointed me is absent multiplayer. This game is competetive, so I would like to compete with my friends and other players(or even build a big advertisment corporation together)!\n\nTo sum it up, I should say, that this game is unique and absolutely worth buying! Wish good luck to developers!\n","April 6","true","4.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

At first I was a little confused and struggeled to find the HQ building. It turned out to be a small building with a white flag right in the center of your control area, in case you could not find it either. Once I got going I spent hours building my ad empire, taking over whole areas of the randomly generated map, destroying my competition. It was actually very satisfying. Game runs perfectly on my PC, soundtrack is awseome, gameplay is addicting, design reminds me of tron legacy which creates a unique atmosphere. If you never played these type of games before, I would definitely give this one a try. It's well worth the money.","April 6","true","4.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I was one of the kickstarter backers.\n\nLet me be clear.  This is a grindy game without any tutorial and a terrible interface.  Once you get past all of that and learn how to play it, it's still horrible.  And for 20 dollars you might as well kick yourself in the balls and call it a day.  You won't find much playability here.  Within an hour you're going to have seen everything this game has to offer.  Maybe you only have 1M resource when you could grind your way for no reason at all to 10M.   Just not rewarding or interesting in any way.  Lacks any real content other than what you see in the screen shots.\n\nIf you want to understand what playing this game is like there's been many free flash games developed that are similar.  Basically you have "abilities" that can be used on buildings.  The better the abilities (earn you more money) the longer the cooldown they have.  So you might start out with something you can spam every few seconds.  And work you rway up to a suite of abilities that let you juggle things that have minute cooldowns or longer.   That's the whole game. Jump around from building to building to set your abilities once they go off cooldown again.   It's even less fun than it sounds, becuase there's a lot of randomness to it.\n\nThe only good thing about this game is probably the style of the art, if you enjoy the screen shots.\n\nI wouldn't play this game if it was free.  That's my honest review.\n\n** edit **  I was banned from the forum by a developer with no ban reason given for saying the game isn't worth the price tag to another user who asked.  No rules broken as far as I can tell.  Really terrible behavior from a developer I backed to see this built in the first place.","June 11, 2015","false","1.8"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","1"
