Something being a trend doesn't mean it's right. Let's do some clarifications.\n\n\nSTORY:\nThe game has a great story, if you don't do your research you'll find an anime story which you may like and not think twice about.  If you're more aware of japanese culture than the average joe, you'll find the hidden meaning behind it and see it for how awesome it really is. It refers many things that we have in our real world and shows it in another light and tries to pass on a message. I love this fact.\n\nSome people say the story is bland and uninspired. Again, stop listening and following the trends. I know it's the norm for people to be sheep but dammit guys, use your head for yourselves already.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n'' IT DOESN'T PLAY ENOUGH LIKE MEGA MAN ''\n\nCome on.... People bash Capcom for being so cliche and non-innovative, rehashing the same things and resources over and over and freakin' over. Now we FINALLY have innovation from a passionate team and you guys spit on it because it's not a copycat of ''Muh Mega Man''.\n\nThe gameplay is fresh, new, innovative and exciting and it'll keep you on your toes. If you want that so-wanted Mega Man gameplay, acquire the Dullahan weapon in the game which makes it as close as possible to playing a Mega Man ZX game.\n\n\nMUSIC\nThe OST is fantastic, the Stratacombs stage is my favorite song in the entire game by far. It's pretty diverse and epic, you're sure to find tracks you'll like. No complaints when it comes to music.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThat's .... up for debate. It's a port of a 3DS game and no, I'm not a ''graphics whoare''. Graphics looks exactly like what you'd expect from this type of game and there's bloody nothing wrong with it. They could make HD filters in the future, but it's not like it would 'suddenly' make it a good game, it already is a good game.\n\nDIFFICULTY\nYES!  THANK GOD YES! A game that doesn't take us for morons and actually challenges us to bring us to the best of our abilities as players? I'M IN!\n\n\nThe game features a New Game +, A plethora of challenges, an insane replay value, new features like a speed run mode have been added, the game is updated everytime the devs find something worthy of adding and they are HIGHLY RECEPTIVE OF CRITICISM AND CONSUEMR'S CONCERNS! UNLIKE YOUR DEAR CAPCOM BY THE WAY.\n\n\nBottom line, the game is freakin' excellent. It's not because it's a ''cool thing'' to hate on this port that you should do it like a mindless sheep, you're disgracing the work of an entirely dedicated team who put effort into this product. The team is listening to the feedback and are at work to fix whatever's wrong with the port. You guys realize they could just leave it be and take our money right? But no, they actually put legit effort.\n\nMy only complaints are the following\n\n- Keiji Inafune being the face of Azure Striker Gunvolt as a marketting technique is completely disgraceful. He lost the fan's respect with how horribly Mighty Number 9 was handled and it's an insult to see him in the spotlight instead of our dearly beloved and precious Mr.Takuya Aizu. Please give credit where it's due, specially since Inafune barely did anything on this game (in his own admittance).\n\n- The community is completely ungrateful and even shameful. Because of this, I highly suggest to watch who you're interacting with on the forums. There's a lot of baiters and trolls following the hype train of ''this port sucks'' without having actually played it for themselves or even bought it.\n\n- Game crashes, it happened to me once during a challenge run and I was kind of upset to have lost all my progress I worked so hard for. Bye Bye S-Rank. It only happened once so far though, so it's probably my laptop.\n\n- There are some glitches here and there that haven't been fixed since the 3DS version, I've figured a few well hidden ones that I'm shocked no one else online seems to have found.\n\n- Keyboard controls configuration.... I beg you inti creates, make it more customizable, make the game adapted for customize keyboard controls I'm begging you.\n\n- Unless you wanna learn the awkward default keyboard mapping, I heavily suggest using a controller.\n\nGreat game, great product, highly worth its price, insane replay value, plethora of challenges and things to do and items to collect and play for. GOOD GAME! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","August 30, 2015","true","26.7"," 181 of 264 people (69%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","69","181","264","13","27"

It does have the Megaman recipe such as dash, climb, shoot and etc\n\nWhat is different from Megaman is this, the game mechanics reward you for playing very well in game.\n\n\nInstead of charging, shooting and slashing, you need to tag your enemies and then use your filed of electricity to kill off your enemies. Sure you can kill them by tagging to death. But electricity is the best way to go. You do not get the boss weapon but you get this neat little upgrade.\n\nYou can even make your gear (though it iis really only making the game last longer) Think of it as like Megaman Legends where you collect items and made your own gear. The items are hard to get sometimes but it is worth the effort.\n\nThe enemies might be a push over at time but the boss are not. There are not grinding your teeth hard but they are the most entertaining boss fight. The boss fight really shines through the game. For example, when the boss used their power (such as Merak using Lazy Laser), you can feel the boss is getting very determined t0 finish your off. You will do whatever it takes to get stop his attack or avoid it at all cost.\n\nHaving to hear the awesome music when I reached 1000 Kudos is the thing I been looking so forward too. It force me to be better and it forces me to keep it at that pace because the music is really integrated well into the game. So if you can played a good game, you will feel like you are empowered, become a full blown yangire or unstoppable force which is neat. Think of it as like Carol from Freedom Planet. You worked hard to get her bike and you do your best to keep it\n\nThe storyline is good as well. I literally cried when I finished the game after watching the ending.\n\nThis game, I take my hats off the people who made this game.\n\nEDIT:Be warn though, this game does not work in Steam offline Mode","September 16, 2015","true","112.5"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","38","42","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/recommended/388800/","BertieWooster","William Shakesman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BertieWooster/","1087 products in account","Now that it has been patched, it runs well. EDIT: I have noticed several graphics glitches here and there, nothing major. If you were into SNES emulation back in the day before emulators figured out transparencies etc, that's the sort of occasional weird interactions you get. Nothing but bad it's not perfect yet. Still runs fast, still playable.\n\n3DS veterans, the original translation with the cut dialog is by default. Choose the Japanese voice English text option to get access to the new translation with the extra dialog.\n\nFor people who don't know what that means, this game essentially comes with two translations: The original 3DS translation, enabled by default, and a new translation that includes all the Japanese dialog to go with it. I will call them 3DS and Japanese dialog translations. The 3DS translation cut all the mid-stage dialogue and Japanese vocals, keeping it to the cutscenes. This is not as negative as it sounds as the mid-stage dialogue is almost constant, pointless, and CONSTANTLY overrunning itself as the triggers for the next conversation always come before that conversation finishes. And the dialogue is always about the most obvious nonsense anyway. The original 3DS translation also seems to have taken some liberties to punch everything up, giving the dialogue less of a dry feel and a more hardcore/noir-ish flavor, whereas the Japanese dialog translation reads more accurately to the Japanese dialog. The original 3DS translation also cut a large amount of the "Talk to Joule" conversations, which are between stage cutesy skits between Gunvolt and Joule, but the Japanese dialog translation resotres all this. I make these statements neutrally, without judging either option. I am happy we have both and there are reasons to prefer both. Understanding Gunvolt's history as a 3DS game is important to understand why you are constantly having to toggle off a second touch screen as well as the reasons why it is there.\n\nSpeaking as a 3DS player veteran, it's a fine little gimmicky Mega Man Zero-type game. You tag enemies and then hold a button to fry them with electricity. This changes the combat a bit and not necessarily for the better. Worse, the levels are quite easy and boring, but made irritating by an ever present score system which only really has two factors going for it: Never getting hit and stopping at every fight to tag everyone individually to kill them at the same time. it's not much fun. You can't really go fast as every fight requires a full stop, a few hops, and a dance to get the maximum score bonus. The enemies are absolutely not threats except for your combo if you face-check them by trying to play for speed.\n\nThrow in a wholly unnecessary XP system that just extends your life bar, the complete lack of enemy damage balancing so you are only ever going to die in boss fights, and a material grind system that is so wonky, you will likely beat the game before ever crafting more than one piece of equipment. (Plus, half of the equipment you get is useless but there is one item it will take ages to get that gives you a 10% score boost, so the score system is hobbled and annoying in yet ANOTHER way.) Then the challenge system, which works as an achievement system for replaying stages and getting good ranks... but you have to "equip" the challenges before going in, so if you beat a stage with an S rank the first time, it unlocks a challenge to... beat it with a B rank. Which you then have to equip, replay the stage, and then clear to finally unlock the challenge to beat it again with an S rank.\n\nAll of these systems come together to suggest Gunvolt is simply an unpolished kludge of weird choices. Still, if you compare it to the rocky systems of the MMZ series, it's hard to come down all that hard on it. MMZ's systems were sillier by miles.\n\nThat said, the bosses are, and if you don't mind some light MMZ-style fare, this is a worthy dip. The bosses alone are worth the price of entry.\n\nOther important information: If you use the Japanese voice translation, hit the X button to tell the people to shut up. Faces from dialogue will cut in during boss fights to block off important screen real estate. Use F5 to slide the dual screen around and get rid of it during gameplay for full screen goodness.","August 29, 2015","true","8.4"," 61 of 90 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","61","90","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/varKhalin/recommended/388800/","varKhalin","varKhalin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/varKhalin/","169 products in account","Note that this review is biased due to my affinity with fast-paced 2-D platformers with dash mechanics such as Megaman X, Zero, ZX, etc.\n\nAzure Striker Gunvolt is a 2-D platformer, similar the games above, but with its own style of gameplay. While the movement can be similar, actual mechanics of fighting are almost completely different. Instead of charing weapons or just attacking with them, you "tag" or mark enemies, up to 3 times with your gun, then emit an electric field to caus damage. The gun itself casuses damage but the electric field is the main output of damage you have, for most enemies.\n\nYou also have special moves, which take up a special bar, of which you start off with 3. Each can slowly recharge, and are used for moves such as an electric orb to deal damage or to heal. Different special moves can take up different amounts of special bars. As you level up you learn more skills.\n\nI'd recommend this more to hardcore gamers who want to get high ranks or top scores in games, as this game revolves around a ranking system and is more fun by attempting to get the top rank of S+. To do this, you will want to not take any checkpoints, get as many points as possible by killing multplie enemies at the same time or fully tagging and enemy and killing them while in the air. This builds up a large amont of "Kudos" or points, and as you go the multiplier grows. However, touching a checkpoint or using a special move cashes in these points, adding them to your actual score, resetting the multiplier. Getting hit outright just makes you lose all of your points. Getting a certain amount of points will also make a theme for each stage appear, consisting of a J-Pop song, which can be a turn off for some.\n\nBesides the Kudos system, the game is honestly pretty easy otherwise. The game is more set on you creating challenges for yourself, in trying to rank highly and complete challenges.\n\nAs for the plot, its sub par to standard really, but enough to keep you going, really a lot like other megaman games.\nTalking to Joule can be nice, unlike in the 3DS version where there were only about 3 things that could happen when you talked to her. There's a lot more characterization in general compared to the 3DS version as it cut out a lot of dialogue for whatever reason, but it was added back into the PC version.\n\nThe biggest problem is that you can't have just a button for the special attacks, instead having to click on the attack or use F1-F4, which is unfortunate for controller users, and the game is not exactly keyboard friendly. The fact that it's sort of just like a 3DS emulators is also dislikeable to some, but it does the job fine. F5 switches between layouts and works great. Loading times are also an issue compared to the 3DS version for me, but my computer might be reallly cluttered and I DO have a New 3DS XL which has better processing than the normal 3DS.\n\nThere's also equipment and stuff, which can add in midair jumps/dashes or decrease damage taken or otherwise, and different guns, etc.\n\nTLDR\n\nLike Megaman X, Zero, ZX in movement. Combat is vastly different. "Kudos" point system is there for getting ranks and thus making the game much harder and more fun. J-pop is a thing. Special moves are kind of annoying to use. Layout can be weird. L O N G A S S loading times.\n\nFor some the gameplay will click nicely, for others it might just not be for you. Either way I encourage you check it out.","August 30, 2015","true","35.5"," 38 of 53 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","38","53","0","0"

Get the 3DS version, as the Mega Man Zero gameplay is done rather well, and good combat mechanics with interesting boss battles is great. But it's a nightmare of the port, like they basically dumped an emulator and didn't bother to really try to make it better in the Steam Version. This is not only lazy, it's insulting. Giving at game to a new audience, ok, but honestly it wouldn't have taken THAT long to change over tsome of the elements the game absolutely needed, like NOT NEEDING THE TOUCH SCREEN (Yes, they have an option for full screen.....but there are items still bound to the touch screen controls via keys that don't make any sense.). Honestly it's pathetic and you should get the game on the 3DS, but this game on the PC is not worth your time.\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nGood Gameplay at the core. Mega Man Zero.\nGreat story, characters, all that jazz.\nGood boss fights, entertaining gameplay.\nHonestly, a fantastic game on the 3DS version...but.....\n-:\nAbsolutely horrible port. There's no reason to be a 3DS emulator. The touch screen serves no purpose that controller or keyboard keys could have done. While there is a full screen option, the fact is that the controller/bindings is still a huge problem, and the game was obviously not deisgned for it.\nSeriously, you can't bind the powers to keys, and they are just the F1-F4 Keys?

It's like they don't want the music to be recorded.\nBindable keys only go so far and would have done a lot to be able to define the triggers, and the ability to BIND THE POWERS.","August 28, 2015","false","1.6"," 70 of 111 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","70","111","6","0"

Pretty much every issue that has been brought up about the port was fixed relatively quickly. Controls were improved to allow for skill activation with the right analog stick, you can switch screen modes with F5 and hit Esc to leave the game. Pretty much every complaint anyone has had has been addressed and fixed.\n\nIn regards to gameplay, its fairly solid as well. You tag enemies with your gun, then shock them with your electric powers. Different guns have different shot patterns and can tag different numbers of enemies, making choosing which one you use in what situation fairly meaningfull most of the time. The short stages lend themselves well to speed running, and since you get materials for crafting by running stages as well as doing challenges, its usually in your best interest to retry stages several times.\n\nOverall I'd say the game is pretty enjoyable overall. The only main downside I can think of is that the additional dialog crops up while you play is fairly distracting, and theres no way to hear it all unless you periodically stop or slow down. Not to mention the fact that the game penalizes you for going too slow with worse scores; the dialog portraits also can block portions of the screen. Which can make boss battles fairly difficult if you're trying to read ANd play. It can be easily disabled, but its a bit of a shame since it can be kinda neat to see the idle chatter.","September 3, 2015","true","4.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/garirry/recommended/388800/","garirry","Garirry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/garirry/","51 products in account","This game is quite amazing. By Inti Creates, the developers of the Mega Man Zero and ZX games (as well as 9 and 10), this is truly one great experience.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIt is very similar to the Mega Man Zero games in terms of mechanics, you can jump, shoot (in auto-fire), dash, wall-jump (you can't slide off walls nor wall-dash though), and something completely new, unleashing electricity (I don't know how it's called). Basically, it creates an electric field around you which hurts enemies around you, and if you shoot an enemy, which creates a lock-on, activating the field will hurt the enemy(ies) massively. There's an energy meter however so that you can't overuse it. It's an incredibely interesting concept, and I love it. It does create a bit of confusion in terms of how it works though, and it does variate the difficulty of the game a bit too much (sometimes it makes it too easy, sometimes too hard).\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe 2D pixel art they used is amazing and is, once again, very similar to the Mega Man Zero/ZX games. The full-drawn art in cutscenes and dialogue is also incredible. Overall, it's great, no complaints.\n\nAUDIO\nLet's make this clear. The soundtrack is AMAZING. Ippo Yamada, the composer of many Mega Man games, including the future Mighty No. 9,  returns to the stage and makes an impressive soundtrack. However, the instruments used in this are a bit irritating in certain situations, but considering how great the music itself is, I think it compensates. I think a re-mastered soundtrack for release would be a good idea, as long as it isn't overly changed. As for the sound effects, they're pretty basic. The voice acting in the English w/ Japanese Voice and Japanese voice settings is very good as well, but I can't judge too much because I don't know Japanese.\n\nSTORY\nI'll have to give bonus points for the creators in this category. While the story itself is kinda the same as in MM games (bad guy does bad things), the way it is presented is remarkable. It's told in a mature manner, involving actual world problems and such in conversations and stuff. It's great.\n\nLEVEL DESIGN\nNot perfect, but still very good. The stages are fair, don't have many cheap deaths, and are overall very fun to play through. Only complaint is that they are a bit short, but that I'll address a little bit later.\n\nDIFFICULTY AND LENGTH\nThis game is quite difficult, however very forgivable as it has no life system and you have a lot of health before you die. I like that very much. The length though is a bit disapointing. It's too short honestly. I was able to finish it my first time in 6 hours, which isn't that great. I find it kind of annoying that there are only 6 main bosses to choose from instead of 8 like in Mega Man games, which would have made the game longer. I also believe that the stages themselves are a bit short, the first try it takes only up to 10-15 minutes, but after that I can beat them in barely any time at all.\n\nONE FINAL COMPLAINT...\nNow, even though I absolutely love this game, there is one thing, ONE thing that hurts it A LOT. The PC port. To put it simply, it's a mess. The screen is still split (as this was originally released for the 3DS), so it means that a lot of the area is wasted, it just doesn't look good. Thankfully, at least when you're in-stage, only one screen is shown and the HUD is properly placed. Worst of all, not only is there a launcher with this game (which is automatically a red flag), it's a pain to set up, I spent like 30 minutes setting up the thing to work perfectly. There are two sets for the English language, one with voice, one with not. But it doesn't matter because you can still turn the voices off in the voiced one, and it also has in-game conversations, but that again can be turned off so I'm not sure what the deal is. Just keep one set of languages, not two. It also means that you can't play in other languages with voice acting. Another annoyance is that the controller buttons have to be mapped in the launcher, but even then you can still switch controls inside the game, UGH, this is annoying. I heard that they fixed most of the issues since the release, and considering it was released only a few months ago, I'm expecting improvement over the PC port.\n\nVERIDICT\nThis game is AMAZING. I LOVED IT. The PC port however hurts it quite a lot, and if you can, I highly suggest you buy the 3DS version instead. Haven't played it, but I can bet that it is certainly better than this.

Its really easy to pick up and play.  It  some good Japanese voice acting to move the plot in a fairly entertanining way.  The stages are well designed.  (The good thing here is spikes aren't  a one-hit kill as in the Megaman Legacy collection)    There is a broad range of challenges to get your competitive juices flowing.  For welcome chance to get  to top of leaderboards.  For those brave enough to try it,  there is also a Speedrun option at the main menu.    Try getting an A or S+ ranking on those missions. Hopefully fortune smiles down on you and your patience will be rewarded.  Inti Creates did a decent job with the English translation.  There were a few hiccups here in the dialogue.  Thankfully, there is nothng that merits a poor attempt at  localization.  Due to the primary language focusing on its core audience of gamers who live in the Land of the Rising Sun  there is no English voice acting.\n\nNo love lost there, in fact the Japanese voice actors do a good job adding depth to the cast of characters.  I like how they've mixed in elements of drama, feelings of betrayal, guilt and determination to forge ahead in a world of mistrust and despair.   A few characters do use gruff language at times.  So, I'd be on the lookout for whose in the room with you. If they happen be small and precocious children then you might have some explaining to do later.  As far as swearing/violence  there's nothing that exceeds a PG Disney esque animated feature.  There's some tongue in cheek moments that might fly over your head.\n\nMoving on..  I tip my hat to the team who were inspired to make this game.   Combat is heavy on runnning and gunning, locking on to targetsand frying foes foolish enough to stand in your way,  with your pulsing electric powers.  Yes, thiis is a platformer, but you are free to backtrack on levels until you activate a stage checkpoint.   Which this game merrily sends your way.  Boss fights and mid-boss fights are of the Megaman variety, which test your skills in pattern recognition, but, reward you for besting your opponents by opting to off them with your skills with a flick of Right thumbstick, on the controler layout.   Most if not all enemies can be vanquished by seniding them to oblivion with your Flashfield attack in tow.   And you can recharge your powers but doublie tapping Down on the D-pad, keyboard, etc.\n\nIf you like to speedrun and nail every achievement in your Megaman styled action games. Give ASGV a try.\n\n\n\nPros:  Easy to follow plot, characters\nGood controls\nGood soundtrack\nJP voiceover is done well\n\nCons:  Mission Challenges vary from finishing levels in record time to taking no damage\nDefault weapon and loadout isn't as versatile as it should be.\nNewbies and vets might get bored too quickly, combat is repetitive.  Stages are easy to run through.\n\nI picked this up, because the wait for Mighty No. 9 is excruciating.   You can grab this game now, or wait for it to go on sale.  You should definitely buy it.\n\nOverall rating 8/10","October 9, 2015","true","19.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

Just make sure to pick the language choice with the Japanese Voice Mod!\n\nFor those who have not played this game before on the 3DS, think Megaman series. If you do not like that type of side-scrolling shooter, However, please do not actually directly compare the two games. It's like comparing all bullet shooters to Touhou.\n\nNow, with that introduction out of the way, let's get to the finer details.\n\nSTORY\nWell, my opinion changes depending on whether you are talking about the English version, or the English version with Japanese Voice Mod. The former...is rather lacking. Alot of content was cut in the US release, and that is exactly what you are getting with the English version.\n\nNow, if you switch towards the English with Japanese Voice Mod, you suddenly have a lot more dialogue, voices(duh), and more content that was cut. Without spoiling the plot-line, I'd have to say that, it was far more enjoyable, and actually allows you to see the relations and character development through the story.\n\nOr, to use comparisons, the 'cut' version is basically something along the lines of, 'Oh, he did this. He did that. That's the result. The End', whereas the full content version has the details within, that actually allows the player to understand the characters.\n\nGranted, the story may seem a little short, but, after all, this is a game that came over from the 3DS.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nOh...damn....where to start with this....\n\nFor those of you coming over from the 3DS, you would somewhat feel a familiar position, or a deja vu, as you play this games. The controls seems to emulate the ones found on the handheld, which would be fine, if it wasn't awkward utilizing the touchscreen simultaneously. Trying to figure out the keys was another problem. I had spent about ten minutes hammering at every key, and I still haven't found all the keys yet. What is the left and right bumpers anyways?!\n\nThe gameplay itself is solid, a side scroller that would bring nostalgic memories of the days of the old, with 8-bit side scrolling, platforming, and the like. Granted, the same, slightly odd control scheme from the 3DS hitched a ride on the port.\n\nHowever, while a player can rush through the game, easily and beat it quickly, I don't suggest doing that, as if you can keep you combo, or Kudos, Lumen will sing for you~!\n\nGraphics\nIt's a port from the 3DS, and without a 'Remastered' or an 'HD' tag, don't look to high for 4K quality. Although, for a mobile console based game, the graphics aren't too bad, while the art is quite nice, fits the characters' personas quite well.\n\nAudio\nProbably the best part in regards to this games, especially when Lumen starts to sing. There isn't much I can say, except that I've enjoyed them. The only probably downsides in regards to the music, although this detriment should be mentioned in the DLC section, is that it does not include the two English version of two of her songs.\n\nDLCs\nThe two DLCs that one can get, is extremely nice. I HIGHLY recommend the Phosphorescence, it's where all Lumen's songs can be obtained. The other one only has the BGM of the rest of the game, also worth noting.\n\nConclusion\nRead my [tl:dr Review] at the top.","August 31, 2015","true","6.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/388800/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","My problem with Azure Striker Gunvolt is that it's a Nintendo 3DS port that was lazily converted to PC. Simply getting a full-screen display took an eternity, but capping a side-scrolling platformer with high skill requirements at 30FPS makes for an exercise in frustration. From hidden endings to achievements to extra stage challenges to speed-run modes... everything seems to be designed for the expert player, except for the game itself. This is not Guacamelee. You will feel the dropped frames and you will go through loading time (why are there still loading times in PC games?) when you want to restart a level.\n\nOf course, you don't have to play for S ranks. In which case, the game is rather frugal in terms of giving you new toys. Or to put it in another way: you don't get the Robot Master's weapon after defeating them. Some gun sidegrades are given, but shooting isn't how you defeat your enemies. "Tag with my gun, follow with my flashfield. That's how my world turns." Yeah, but it gets old after a while because that's all that you ever do. Air dashes and double jumps are what you want, and such upgrades are only given through a somewhat out-of-place crafting system. Better scores offer more parts, making for a recursive loop preventing you from gaining the tools to get ahead.\n\nAs a platformer, there's not much platforming challenges. As an action-shooter, you don't really encounter any hordes of enemies to quickly and creatively dispatch. A better description of the ASG experience would be more as a stop-and-go side-scroller wherein all the gimmicks of the main character are used to better your score. Methodically advancing and destroying every foe that creeps to your right is a serviceable way of clearing a stage, and your reward for such a strategy will be a C score and very little parts for you to craft potentially fun upgrades. Playing to win is boring. Playing to excel is frustration.\n\nAs a 3DS game, I'm sure that Azure Striker Gunvolt is an excellent product. However, that isn't the product I am reviewing. Everything apart from the gameplay is great: graphics, story, enemy design and especially the soundtrack. However, if a game plays like boring ♥♥♥♥ than I cannot recommend it. There's obviously a demand for Megaman-like games, AND BOY DOES THIS GAME PILE ON THE REFERENCES. However, nostalgia alone cannot make me like a product. There's no hook to keep me playing. The resistance to your progress is so strong, all that electricity your hero generates only succeeds in burning you off.","February 17","false","4.9"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","2"

However, be aware that this is practically the 3DS version with dual screen and all. The good news is that on the actual gameplay by default you'll play with the main screen on display, so the double screens will only appear on a few menus. The only true difference is that it has a lot more dialogue than its handheld counterpart, with voices and all and that's something i was really looking for a game we might have to wait a pair of years for the (already confirmed) sequel.\n\nGunvolt is pretty much Megaman Zero coated with gimmicks. The main character will use electricity to attack and solve some platforms, so while he carries a gun is mostly part of this mechanic. This also includes the main bosses, having patterns to learn yet some will require some thinking to get the best of our options against them. The game overall is short and easy to master, but carries challenges and a true ending to unlock which will length the gameplay. The game might feel linear sometimes but is part of the focus on highscore runs. Challenges and rewards will require you to go as fast as possible, yet the score will get severely punished if you get damaged.\n\nWhile the 3DS screens might seem a very small flaw, there's a big one added for the PC version. The conversations added during the stages are EXTREMELY intrusive as textboxes occupy literaly half the screen, and that will be your worst enemy if you are facing a boss yet wanna know more about their personalitites (You can remove them with a single button push however, but will also remove voices). I also have a tiny complain as one of the characters being of unkown gender and the 3DS version used Xe/Xem pronouns, and while in here are refered solely by name to keep xyr identity it was a nice touch from the localization team.\n\nGunvolt is a great game overall. With the Megaman series crumbling to dust and probably the incoming Mighty No9 (At the time this was written atleast), this should be the horse you must bet on to get back that action platforming yet with its own seal of identity.","November 27, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryoyuki23/recommended/388800/","ryoyuki23","PengySan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryoyuki23/","20 products in account","To begin with, yes this is from Keiji Inafune, so yeah expect it to "resemble" megaman, but it is not megaman, and such you should not treat it as a megaman game. Instead, it is a 2d side-scroller and should be viewed as such.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is fun but lackluster is the name of the game here. The game abandons the classic shoot em up charge and blast tactics and goes with a refreshing but slightly repetitive gameplay in which you "tag" your enemies. Bullets do minimal damage but causes crosshairs to appear on the enemy which upon consecutive tags on the same enemy will get you a red crosshair. This is where you activate your flashfield, a new mechanic that separates this game from our blue bomber. The flashfield itself does minimal damage , but combined with tags you just placed and you will decimate your enemies. This is where the game gets interesting and strategic since you need to manage your EP(flashfield meter) while tagging enemies meaning that the classic run and gun tactics need to be kicked up a notch. However this new mechanic comes at a price, for one, although subtle, this mechanic does slow the game down, the game itself is slower compared the zero series where you could just speedrun and destroy everything. Tagging and flashfield may seem fun at first, but it gets tiring soon enough. Another thing to note is that Gunvolt (our hero) relies to heavily on this flashfield, you not only need it to take out enemies, you need it for puzzle solving and some enemy attacks just can't be avoided w/o flashfield (most of the bosses have at least one attack where you MUST use your flashfield). Although this game has a good new mechanic, it sorta forces you to adapt with it which can be a chore.\n\nContent wise, the game is short but the replayability value is quite high, newcomers will appreciate the game's somewhat easy gameplay, since GV(gunvolt) is tough as nails and infinite retries+tons of checkpoints, while veterans can partake in the challenges offered by the game, which can range from cakewalk objectives to sadistic torture at times. Oh and there is a scoreboard system called kudos in which increases on how well you play , but 1 hit and boom, back to 0, for newcomers this will be like eh, but trying getting your kudos all the way to 2990 only to get shot by a random enemy (this happened to me, i cried for 10 minutes ;~;). Getting good scores will net you many materials required to synthesize and upgrade GV, although on my first blind playthrough, i don't really require them, but for speedruns or completionists, they are a necessity.\n\nNow on to the best part, presentation wise, this game is phenomenal. I'm a sucker for anime graphics and yes the graphics of the game is a bit outdated but it makes it up with colourful atmosphere and pretty neat artworks for storyline  sequences in the game. Oh and the skill cut-ins for when GV or a boss uses a skill is cool and really gets you pumped. Really just looking at this game screams that it would make an awesome anime adaptation. As for the OST and audio, this is based on preference but i absolutely LOVE the osts in the game especially the Lumen Songs. Getting even a 1000 kudos is a pain since it is hard to build but one hit and it's gone, but well worth it since a Lumen Song will start playing. This is a good way to get you motivated to keep the score going. Oh just to tell you they are J-POP songs just in case it's not your thing (but come on, why would you even check this game if you hate J-POP) :< . My favorite tracks from the game are Reminiscence Wound , Moon World Circuit and the game's main theme Beyond the Blue ^^\n\nOK to conclude this review, the nicest thing i can say about this game is this game is certainly a diamond in the rough, don't let it's somewhat shallow gameplay deter you from it. It is a short but challenging game that every side-scroller or anime fan should give a go. The meanest thing i can say about it is all glitter with catchy songs and anime visuals, but no gold, albeit bare-bones content and repetitive gameplay.","September 29, 2015","true","3.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Your main attack power comes from electric attack and to maximum its power, Gunvolt uses his gun with special ammo to shoot on any enemy in order to "tag" them then he will uses electric power to homing on them and finish them off, but doing the electric attack costs power which is called "EP" or Energy Power, using electric attack and/or any action related to EP too long or too many times will cause his EP to overheat, which pervert Gunvolt to use any more of electric attack and/or any action related to his EP.\n\nGunvolt also has ability to dash, jump and climbing wall and he will get more additional ability through gears/items in later game such as double jump, air dash and etc. However, most of additional ability will also cost EP while using same to Electric Attack.\n\nGunvolt also has ability to neutralize harm, one of his most powerful ability, as long as you have enough EP or not using Electric Attack, he will not get hurt like at all in exchange of losing some EP. This particular makes a game easy enough for casual gamer, who doesn't want to dodge some impossible looking attack from enemy. This ability is called Prevasion. Gunvolt gains access to this Prevasion through most of Pendant eventhough they're not written in the Pendant's explanation. If you remove Pendant, he will not use Prevasion.\n\nFurthermore, Gunvolt also has special skill such as offensive skills that allow him to damage one or more enemy in an instant with heavy damage or support skill that help recover his lost HP, restore his overheated EP or increase his overall attack power, in all of these actions cost SP or Skill Point which player will be given with 3 of them at the start of each stage and if used, the SP will automatically be restored overtime.\n\nGameplay focuese heavily on player's skill, and then your reflex and memory will be put in to use. Each stage has unique challenge which require different technique. While each stage is easy for a  2D Action Platformer side-scrolling game,  the game provides a ranking system as well as several optional challenges which will put your gaming skill into test. Getting the highest in rank is basically a no damage run and do all the bonus on killing as many as possible, and while doing all of these the player must be very fast to complete each stage in time for highest possible bonus multiplier.\n\nLike I have mention before, there're gear/item in game, each time you completed a stage, you will be rewarded with materials which can be used to craft gear/item which will benefit Gunvolt ever more, making him more versatile. There're no doudt you can complete a full game without any use of gear/item because all the stages are designed for gearless Gunvolt to be able to complete them peacefully but like most game, in later stages, they will get harder and more deadly, having a gear will help you deal with them easier, gears are optional as they're not necessary but they're so helpful that you don't want to avoid unless you want a real challenge.\n\nVisual design in this game is unique, Art style that looks modern, cool dude and cute girl, that stuff. Most characters are well designed and have their own theme, Like Gunvolt is a lighting type super human for example, there're several characters in this game, most of them presented as a boss and Gunvolt will need to face them off and win battle. Each boss represent their own theme, most of their attacks are influenced by such theme. Fire is Fire, Light is Light for example.\n\nOne of the most greatest thing is music, the regular music in each stage seems fine enough but if you manage to kill so many enemy and do not take any damage like at all until some point, music will be changed into something else! This ability is belongs to second main character of game Lumen or Morpho in Japan, she will sings a song for Gunvolt if he somehow, has done a fair among of good actions during stage, in order to encourage Gunvolt or the player! There're several songs in game and can be unlocked or heard through out different stage in game. Lumen also has one of the most powerful ability, to revive Gunvolt when he's killed in action. Whenever Gunvolt dies in battle, there's small chance that Lumen will help him get up with song, this ability is called Anthem or Song of Diva, this ability returns Gunvolt into battlefield with full HP and ever more powerful than ever, he will have infinite EP and unlimited Jumps and Air Dashes until the end of stage. Also trust me, you will look into original soundtrack like crazy after you have played this game for a while.\n\nStory is this game has some depth in it despite appearing to be generic kind of story, I don't know where to talk about it because If I say anything about it, it will be nothing but spoiler, I can say it's quite interesting but you have to find that for yourself. Then again this game is all about action and score the highest possible kind of game, the story itself is fairly good when look it in that way.\n\nIt's truly a hidden gem in steam. I would recommend anyone to get this game. 8/10 for me.","January 21","true","102.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

One the one hand, the mechanics of Gunvolt are amazing, it plays great, and is a wonderful feeling game. It plays very smooth with lots of great flow and a very interesting mechanic (you don't do much damage by directly attacking an enemy, but rather by linking with it and then releasing energy).\n\nThe PC port on the other hand...\n\nWhy am I looking at menus that were clearly ripped from the 3DS and not given a good PC change? You literally see the top and bottom screen during the main menus. During gameplay, it shows only the main screen, but I can't help but feel that it's the ROM just brought straight over and slightly cleaned up.\n\nThe gameplay and mechanics save it for me though.","March 7","true","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That and i give kudos (bud-dum-tis) to Inti Creates for saying the new stuff they are on the pc version will also be on 3ds sooner or later so if you can't or don't want to buy this version you can still experience the new stuff on the original version of the game.\n\nBut with that now that the game has been patched and working flawlessly in my opinion I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone whom like fast paced action and to those that played games like Megaman Zero and/or Megaman ZX as this game feels just like them honestly.","August 28, 2015","true","3.7"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

Not because I'm a dirty weeb but because it enables mid-stage dialogue (which reveals more information about the characters), a LOT more dialogue from certain deuteragonist and different end-mission dialogue (rather than your typical "mission complete", it's something minor but a nice touch regardless). Playing the game in any other language not only disables the voices: it also takes out everything mentioned above, which makes the game... almost "souless" imo. I played the original English version without the Japanese Voices and -while the characters are fun and hilarious at times- the game feels incredibly empty in terms of history. The missing dialogue just makes it even worse. I have no idea why the developers did this, but if you really want to grow attached to the characters and the game as I did, you should really play it in English-Japanese Voice Mode.\n\nAlso, the 3DS version doesn't have this feature at the moment, even though there's word from the developer that it's going to be added "soon". It's also missing like seven extra modes that you can only play in the Steam version (and by the looks of it, seems like they're going to be exclusives). You should buy it, as it's the definitive version because of everything stated above.\n\nOh, and the sequel is coming this summer.\n\ntl;dr: English-Japanese Voice mode is the way to truly enjoy this game.","March 28","true","80.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can finally exit the game just by pressing Esc. Well it's no in-game quit function but it's definitely very quick and reliable so, that works perfect ~\n\nStill wish they'd fix the forced 2-Screens Mode Quirk that won't let me keep a 2-Screens Method I chose, but at this point it's more or less a nitpick as this port is finally up to snuff with that of the 3DS version, if not better! So if you guys haven't already, please go pick this up! :D\n\nUPDATE (8/31/2015): Well it's good to know the guys down at Inti Creates have been up to speed about the faults with this game. As of the Update the released today they've left a little bit of info on the start screen showing people how to change screens, and they also made full screen the default which is nice. Also mapping the Special Moves to the Right Stick was a Clever Idea and I appreciate that ~\n\nThat being said they still need to implement an in-game Quit Function, and I'd appreciate it if when I HAVE to have the 2 screens on that I can keep the set-up that I want instead of it reverting to the first set-up (which I think is kinda ugly). Still I do appreciate that Inti has been quick to act on the previous faults on the game and I can say unironically that you guys should try this port out if you haven't already. =)\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay so, despite having read previous reviews I did give the game a shot and, for the most part this port is definitely playable (and a lot of friggin fun), but not without some flaws that really do need to be addressed in a future patch.\n\nFirst off, do not use the Full-Screen setup. The devs forgot to add in a Quit option in-game, so unless you're in Windowed Mode you'll have to either use the Alt-F4 Method, or Crtl-Alt-Delete your way out of the game. Secondly, while you CAN in fact edit the 2 Screens with the Alt Key (or by pressing F5 to switch to other Screen Setups), for some dumb reason it just completely resets should you turn the game off and go back to it at a later time. These are really the only offensive things I noticed about this port that need to be fixed.\n\nOther than that, the game still runs as fine as it did on the 3DS version. It is very well possible to edit your controls (only in-game though, but do make sure to set-up on the initial launch screen first), and despite running at only 30 Frames like the original it rarely if ever chokes. The only drawback from the visual department though is that they forgot to properly upscale a lot of the menu images as well as Character Portraits (they look like they were ripped right out of the 3DS version ;;). I also noticed that Load Times are a little longer for some reason ...\n\nIn any case, if you've never played this game yet then there's no shame in getting this port. Between this and the 3DS Version, I'd say probably go with the 3DS version first if you already have one ... at least until Inti makes a patch for this game that fixes the issues I just talked about.","August 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","4"

Controls could use some improvement, but the game is fun and priced well.\n\nUPDATE\nControl options to use special skills have been added to the right analog stick on controllers. Full rebinding is coming for keyboards in a future patch.\n\nAs far as ports from a portable device go, this one is perfectly fine. There's the fact that the original version is on the 3DS and therefore, has two screens, but the game provides multiple ways to arrange them on the screen by alternating them with F5. Personally, I like one on top of the other.\n\nThe graphics are all 2D and there doesn't seem to be any upres on the sprites, but the game looks good for a 2D game, and there's a certain nostalgia to the way the game looks. No complaints on that part.\nWhat I will say that they could have improved is the controls. As it stands, you can play on kb+m(don't, it's awful), or use a controller(strongly advised), but the mapping is basically 1:1 from the 3DS controls, with the "second screen" being clickable with the mouse. Special attacks during gameplay can be activated by clicking or pressing F1-F4, but there's no way to map those to the controller. Functional, sure, but there's room for improvement.\n\nAs for the game itself, gameplay revolves around using a gun to "tag" enemies and activating an electric field around the character, which extends to the tagged enemies and damages them. Interesting mechanic, but there's very little explanation inside the game as to how to use it effectively, or what each color of the tags do differently, if they happen to differ at all. Platforming wise, what I've seen so far is basic jumping over gaps, avoiding spikes, and using the electric field to slow down your fall to reach distant platforms. Just like the combat, it's an interesting mechanic, but when you're faced with multiples enemies on-screen and trying to escape from a flooding section, it can get a bit confusing. Probably just a matter of adaptation.\n\nSure, it's a port from a portable platform, but the port, while barebones, is functional, and the game seems to be fun. Price is also good. The option for the original japanese version with english text is also nice, and is not present on the american 3DS release.","August 29, 2015","true","0.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

But that’s not the case with Azure Striker Gunvolt,  the 2014 Inti Creates 2D action platformer that absolutely captured my heart and added a unique spin one of my favorite genres. Hey, I’m go ahead and spoil the ending of this review for you – I highly recommend this game. But don’t leave yet, let me tell you why my love for this runs deep.\n\nThe game focuses on our hero, Gunvolt, who is one of many people who’ve developed septimal powers known as adepts. You can look at adepts in the same vein as superheroes – people with superhuman abilities, such as, flight, teleportation, or those who can control various elements, like fire, water, or in Gunvolt’s case, electricity. The world is currently a peaceful place, thanks to the Sumeragi Group – although, behind the scenes the group is actually going to great lengths to attempt to experiment and control the world’s adepts.However, Gunvolt’s employer, QUILL, isn’t going to allow that to happen. You see, the QUILL organization is an anti-Sumeragi group that is directed by its founding member Asimov, who like Gunvolt, is an electricity based adept. Gunvolt owes his life to this man, all because Asimov rescued him from a Sumeragi facility where they were performing horrific experiments on him. Now that he’s free, he has dedicated his life to QUILL and taking down the Sumeragi group. Which brings us to the current events where the game opens with our hero held captive by one of Sumeragi’s henchmen. Gunvolt is tasked with locating and assassinating a unique adept named Lumen who’s housed within a young girl named Joule.\n\nNow it’s no surprise that Azure Striker Gunvolt embodies a Mega Man vibe since the Inti Creates team has worked with the series in the past. Mega Man dealt with Doctor Wily’s robot master antics, while Gunvolt has to hunt down seven crazed adepts who’re associated with Nova and the Sumeragi group. You’ll jump, shoot, and dash your way through stages, just like Mega Man, but in the case of Gunvolt it’s completely different. His weapon alone does very minimum damage and it’s used to tag his enemies. You see, destroying enemies efficiently is a two step process where you must first tag the enemy with your weapon and then finish them off with Gunvolt’s flashfield. Enemies can be tagged up to three times and the flashfield damage is amplified with each increased level.  As you progress through the game and defeat bosses you’ll acquire new weapons that make tagging multiple enemies much easier for higher scores and bonuses, which is where this game starts to shine.\n\nOkay, so at the end of each stage, the player is given a letter grade based off of how well they performed during the stage and between stages. Then afterwards, in Gunvolt’s apartment, they can synthesize different gear to aid them in battle. Some of the more rare gear requires you to complete challenges issued by QUILL to obtain hard to find materials. For instance, there’s a pendant that you can equip that makes spikes lethal and removes Gunvolt’s ability to neutralize damage in exchange for some of his electricity meter, otherwise known as EP. But this accessory adds ten percent to the kudos gained – which is an absolute godsend when you’re shooting for S+ ranks. Kudos matter because they are essential for achieving higher scores. As you traverse through a stage you’ll gain kudos for inflicting damage on enemies, but your kudos will reset back to zero if you receive damage – so a solid performance is ideal. The idea behind kudos is to build up as many as you can, then convert them into bonus points by using an attack skill, passing through a checkpoint, destroying an enemy with a special skill, or completing a mission. You can also acquire bonus kudos by destroying targets with a level three tag, eliminating multiple targets simultaneously, or even killing them while in midair.\n\nAt its core Azure Striker Gunvolt is a high-speed action platformer with plenty to keep you busy and many options that allow the player to customize their experience. My initial opinion of this game was lukewarm. During my first play-through I kept thinking to myself that the difficulty was way too easy. Health replenishment came from almost every enemy, bosses only took a couple of tries to defeat, zero controllers were thrown, and I never saw a game over screen – something that I am all too familiar with from Mega Man games.  But looking at Gunvolt as if it were a Mega Man game is completely wrong, because at the end of the day Azure Striker Gunvolt is a completely different experience. An experience that focuses on the player’s skill, speed, and scoring. Sure, I’ve been gushing about how amazing this is, but it does suffer from bland level design where exploration is scarce and enemy variation that is rather lacking, but the mechanics and challenges make up for it. You can pick it up on the Nintendo 3DS eShop for $14.99 and there’s also a demo available if you’d like to try it before you buy it. However, I used the Steam version for this review, which I think is identical and also $14.99; but there is no demo available. So if you stumble upon an extra $14 or you catch it on sale, I’d definitely recommend picking it up. I never thought it would capture my heart, but it did and I hope this review helped persuade you to give it a go, too.","May 24","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Difference from other shoot-em up platformer is that for the whole game your main weapon is your lighting. And you use in this way. First you have to shoot the enemy, and after he/she is hit you've actually have him under a lock on. Then you use your lighting with different button and apply the damage. You can shoot multiple enemies, and once you've ''tagged'' them you can damage them all. It's pretty fun at the beginning, but gets tedious later on, especially on bosses. I love Megaman type of games, but this one had too few power ups and uninteresting level design to make it so interesting. Character Gunvolt himself was badass though. Had some fun with it, so I'm giving it a thumbs up.","September 19, 2015","true","7.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Very faced paced "Action Platforming" since this would be considered more of an action game, and the slight RPG elements in this game such as the Level system and the Equipment/Crafting system are pretty well done in my opinion, you just have to be really good to get some of the better gear and what not. The way crafting works is the same as any RPG, you get the items you need, and you make the thing, but the way you get items is a little different. You beat the stages and you get a base amount of tries to open panels for money or materials. Then, throughout each level you can find medals that give you more, and depending on your rank you can get even more.\n\nNow, ever since this game was released on Steam, it has gotten a lot of updates and extra stuff that makes it easier or harder, etc. Honestly, the base game itself is challenging enough while still being accesible enough to people who are kinda bad at games like this (like I am). Sometimes when you die you will be revived by Joule/Lumen, while a song named "Reincarnation" plays. Also, each stage has a song that will play when you reach 1000 combo points (aka Kudos) and will play as long as you maintain that combo.\n\nAll in all, the gameplay is very good, and the story is great, honestly can't wait for the sequel.\nI give this game a 8.5/10.

Quit your complaining, please! If it was a 60fps game deadlocked to 30fps for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reason, yes, that's bad. This is not the case here. It does not run at 60fps on 3DS, either. That's not something you should judge the game over\n\nQ: IS IT LIKE MEGA MAN ZERO?\nA: There's some loose inspiration from the Zero and ZX series, yes. Does it play exactly like it? No. Does it retain the same style? Eh, not really; you can tell it tries to be its own beast. It's fast-paced and there's some options.\n\nQ: IS IT AS BAD AS MIGHTY NO 9?\nA: No. In fact, I really wish THIS was the game that got that big amount of attention. Mighty No 9 is a load of trash and is infinitely worse than this.

I personally don't have a crazy amount of finances so I can't quite say I'd pay full price, but you probably have more money than I do, so sure! If it's on sale, snag it.\n\nBut seriously guys, stop comparing it to Zero and ZX. It plays nothing like them, and that's a false accusation. There's some pieces taken from it, but it's definitely not exactly like them. That's like looking at a bunch of art pieces and saying "they all look the same." Don't judge a book by its cover, yo!\n\nIt's going to run fine. The port is not that bad.

I have an Nvidia card, so that might be making a difference here, but the latest patch should've fixed issues with Radeon cards (patched within 12 hours or so, so a very quick response, unlike a certain other developer *cough*SEJapan*cough*).\n\nI think FPS is limited to 30, but that is not an issue. It's not jerky, there are no frame drops or anything. Maybe the game could be patched to allow 60 FPS, who knows. It'd certainly be a welcome addition.\n\nThis a DS port, so you have two screens. But the way they approached is quite novel. You have the main screen which is big enough to be able to play comfortably, and then you have the status screen nestled in the corner. It gives you a quick glance at any information you need without taking up half of the screen. If you want to pause the game, change your equipment and so on, it switches the screens and pauses the action. So you don't actually need to interact with the smaller screen if you don't want to.\n\nMy only gripe is that it would be great if you could map shortcuts to your gamepad, since you actually need to use the keyboard or mouse to use certain skills. Perhaps some solution can be found for this.\n\nBasically, if you've ever played Megaman Zero on an emulator, you'll feel right at home here. There's some additional bells and whistles with this port and I think the devs would be open to add small quality-of-life changes here and there, so I'm looking forward to how this port evolves.\n\nAt this price point it's a no-brainer, especially if you've been starved for 2D action games in the Megaman Zero style.","August 29, 2015","true","5.5"," 19 of 39 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","19","39","0","0"

Great music, well designed characters, pretty environments and lightning-fast (heh) gameplay. You can take your time and safely make your way through the stages or you can aim for the top score and blaze your way through the enemies - as long as you don't get hit, which will reset your score counter.\n\nInstead of simply shooting enemies, you tag them with your gun (up to three times per enemy) and then zap them with your flashfield. You don't get boss abilities this time around, but you do unlock new weapons which change the way you tag enemies.\n\nDefinitely recommended for any Mega Man and/or 2D platformer fan.\n\nABOUT THE PORT:\n\nI do have some gripes with this port; the biggest one being the absence of any way to natively set the special skills to my controller - I had to use JoyToKey for that. Also, the whole thing with the two screens being kept instead of integrating all of the interface to a single screen does strike me as lazy. Some graphics could use some upscaling as well (mainly the dialogue boxes). I also heard of some people with AMD GPUs having issues with the game, but it seems this has been patched (I did not encounter any issues since I have a GeForce GPU).\n\nThat said, I'm still having tons of fun with this port. Using a DualShock 3 will always be more comfortable than a 3DS XL in my opinion, and I'm loving the new dialogue (even though it's coming to the 3DS as well). All in all the 3DS version is still the best one, but if you don't have one, go ahead and get the PC version.","August 29, 2015","true","12.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

What to say about the game itself. It is good. It has the same dinamics as Megaman Zero and ZX. The main difference is that your gun is used to mark the enemies with darts in order to electrocute them with your flashfield. You can use materials you get for beating levels and challenges to create accessories with special properties like double jump, but the game is menagable without them. Difficulty is low during the levels, but bosses take the cake: they provide good challenge while not being unfair in any way.\n\nNow the port. The port is done uniqely in a sense that it retains 3DS's dual screens. It largely looks like any NDS emulator with customizable display layout. It also retains the 3DS control scheme... which means using B for confirming, which may feel a bit weird.\n\nAs for what I don't like is that while they give option to choose a language to your liking, only one option retains japanese voice acting and mid-stage dialog, which defeats the purpose of having any other laguages for me.","August 30, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

No? OH! SUMIMASEN. Inafune-sensei was the one I need to be talking about for this review! XD\n\nWhen Keiji Inafune left Capcom, it ruined my hopes and dreams for a definitive conclusion to Megaman ZX, Zero, Legends and X.. These were the games that pushed my thumbs to the limit. And story-wise, as inconsistent and random as they can be (basically, bad guy reprograms/builds robots to do bad things, and you gotta be the good robot!), X, Zero and Legends had quite the solid story. Yet, none of them have definitive endings... Capcom... Instead of re-releasing RE4-6 on PS4 (since I JUST re-bought them on Steam), work on these sequels just so we can have closure forever...\n\nIn response to leaving behind his blue baby, Inafune-sensei gave birth to a few new blue babies! One which had been delayed as many times as there are megaman games and Azure Striker Gunvolt. The other baby, failed Kickstarter, so to speak... Just glad it's still greelit!\n\n(Now for the real review, sorry for the ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles , guys)\n\nGunvolt is a fast-paced action platformer in the likeness of Megman Zero or ZX. It introduces a new systems and a bite sized platformer with solid mechanics. Originally for the 3DS (so is the upcoming sequel), this game was astounding! Not only does it remain traditional to the Inafune standard, it builds upon it!\n\nAlthough, lacking initially, they have patched it time and time again to make it work as it should. I would have appreciated a reworked menu instead of the shoddy double screen workaround, but it doesnt destroy the groove.\n\nIf Megaman was your ROCK. This is the AMP that makes that rock real quiet, whatever is playing. ;)\n\nLet's go Mighty No.9 and Red Ash!

Despite this, the game is actually very forgiving: You have lots of health and, under certain conditions, you can even take hits without taking any damage.\n\nHowever, despite the fact that the game isn't actually hard, you will most likely not feel in control of the situation during several boss fights, making them confusing and a drag to go through.\n\nThe stages themselves are mostly a joy to play, but the port is absolutely atrocious. It relies on showing two screens at once during menus (wasting the vast majority of your screen on black space) and the controller support is horrible. It does not support X-Input, only DirectInput, and the remapping is REALLY bad to the point that the game will outright refuse to detect some axes and buttons, forcing you to rely on external tools such as XPadder.\n\nIn general, the game is actually very enjoyable, with amazing gameplay and the musical and visual flair to match. But the boss fights and especially basically everything technical about the port brings the experience so far down that honestly I just don't want to bother with all the hassle. Ultimately, I regret this purchase, but I feel like this game would actually be worth it on a platform where the port doesn't suck ♥♥♥.\n\nI hear there's a sequel being developed. If it makes its way onto Steam, hopefully it can get a proper redesign to support a single screen and actual proper X-Input support as has been a PC standard since a freaking decade ago.","May 5","false","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you enjoyed games such as Mega Man Zero and Mega Man ZX this might be a worthy spiritual successor for them. The gameplay mechanics are neat in their own right but take a while to get used to. Grapics and details are overall well done.\n\nThe developers seem to update very frequently and address many problems in the updates.\n\nIf I had a "complaint" (though calling it a complaint is a strong word, more of a nitpick really) it's that the framerate is solidly locked at 30fps. However the game doesn't feel bogged down by this, everything still feels fluid.\n\nI would however request that the Devs consider removing the FPS lock so as to allow people who are influenced by the FPS to use the framerate of their preference.","September 2, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RockmanTheEXE/recommended/388800/","RockmanTheEXE","ノワール","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RockmanTheEXE/","47 products in account","Gameplay: Since this game made by Inti-Creates, the same company make MegaMan Zero, Megaman ZX and ZX Advent, I think the gameplay is simple to MegaMan Zero (Although the main character Gunvolt or code name 'GV' is simple to Zero for his hair). Only one thing different is Gunvolt can't learn any skills from defeating bosses but instead of that he learn by leveling up. The game locked at 30FPS but Inti-Creates not going to fix this promblem.\nStory: Kinda sadly at the Ending, but I think this kinda like MegaMan X4 (Except Gunvolt said: "NOOO!!!" instead of "What am I fighting for!!!?"). Story look interesting, but I recommend Inti-Creates should deal with the in-game dialogue cuz it kinda annoying and also blocking half of the screen while on a mission and keep messing thing. I think i don't even paying attention to the dialogue\nController: I don't know why the first version is kinda buggy, I think Inti-Creates rush making the game sprites actually use from the Nintendo 3DS, no HD Sprites for the PC ver. Controller kinda hard to controller since the first version I think Fire is J, Dash is Z, Jump is Space and Flashflied is L... not recommend at all.\nFeature: I like the feature like speedrun mode, hard mode, easy mode, and Perma-Anthem challenge speedrun and is NOT for Noobs. I think Inti-Creates should bring this to the 3DS Ver cuz it good for RPG Games.\nVoice: Good voice actor, Japanese voice always the best.\nRated: Being a MegaMan Fan, I rated this game 10/10 :))\nWell, that is my review for the game, let wait for Azure Striker Gunvolt 2 and how it look like :))","March 12","true","16.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wanted to get through it so I could give my bit on what it was, if it was fun, so on and so forth. So know I've played it, and will be going back later to get the achievements (if possible).\n\nSo, Azure Striker Gunvolt. If you've seen snapshots and gameplay of this, it's Megaman ZX with a bit of a twist. Instead of just charging up your buster and firing off either little shots or big shots, it's a much more complex system of tagging enemies with your rounds, then electrifying them. I really don't feel like going into much detail as to how the game works, cause the dash works different, the movements different, there's weapons, upgrades, and gear (oh my!), but the core of this game feels like a Megaman ZX. Honestly, I like that about this game, cause I love the Megaman X series. Part if the reason why I bought it in the first place.\n\nDown to the more sectioned off parts of the game, since I've already spoken of the overall gameplay, lets go to the graphics, sound, story, etc.\n\nVisually, the game is not great, but not normal, either. It's got a flare to it that, again, feels like Megaman ZX. I say this because the game's villans are all transforming people with special powers, a lot like the Megamen in the ZX series. The very world itself feels similar, minus the desert stages that always seem to pop up. Now, while I was more focused on the game itself, the visuals were good. Like, 3.7 out of five good. There are only a few scenes where there's a full blown picture instead of just the sprites doing their thing, which is normal, and there's all sorts of neat places that are shown. Cities, jungles, underwater places. Take note, your character can, and will, drown. Fast. So, nothing to really exemplefy in the art/graphics department. What you see is what you get. If you are an in depth guy about this, I dunno. Message me. Maybe I'll get more in detail, but to me, visuals are a game's accompanyment. Sound was fun. It was an electronic feel, each stage had it's own little theme. I didn't pay much attention to it, either. If anything, I have the main menu's theme in my head. But the sound was just as decent as the visuals, where it wasn't amazing, but it was fun to have around. Normally, I never really listen to the music and just have podcasts and what have you in the background, but I'm glad I did mine this way. Also, the game's voices are (of course) in Japanese. No voice acting, though. Not really. Just little quips here and there. Lastly, the story. Now, I ran through this game extremely fast. I did was, again, focused on the gameplay itself. The characters were fun, and I liked them. For a game where there wasn't a ton of dialogue and everything seemed to be more put into the stage creation and the gameplay, I enjoyed the story to an extent. But it's a lackluster story about super powered people, a guy who finds a girl and goes lone wolf on his organization, but still works for them because he needs the money. After doing the rebel organization's dirty work, his waifu is kidnapped, and he goes to save her. Nothing new or original here, really. If anything, the ending is interesting (though I saw it from a mile away). What the story REALLY did for me was want to come back and play the sequel. I hope it's out, cause I want to play it and finish the game. So, while there was little character development and a lackluster story that's been reused more than fifteen times, I want to play the next game, which I guess is what really matters. I just wanted to see some more character development in general, with both Gunvolt and Joule (his waifu, basically. It's more of just a joke for me). I hope that when I go back to get the rest of the achievements, I'll be able to see some more of that, but I don't think I will. Honestly, this game visually, audibly, and story wise feels like a very well done Indie game. But nothing more, nothing less.\n\nNow, the gameplay itself was fun. While I did fly through the game, I did feel like every stage was it's own place. Every stage had its own couple enemies specific to it, as well as the usual enemies that came along with every stage. The stages themselves had puzzles that didn't feel like it was a difficult task to complete, but a screw up would result in some serious punishment. 99.9% of the time, using your electricity will solve whatever puzzle you're having difficulty with. It's just how you use it that matters. Not only that, but the most interesting thing about it all is the risk and reward of using your ability. In most games, your abilities consquences are null. They don't either exist or matter. In Megaman, if you use your abilities, the most that happens is you deplete your ability gauge. So, there's management, but it's simple. In this game, while you do have to manage your ability gauge, that gauge is also what allows you to reduce damage, but only if you're not using it. It can help you float a bit, it helps with puzzles, etc. and so on. There are enemies that will come after you if you use you ability, and using it can get you hurt, but will damage the enemy as well. This risk/reward does no really exist as prominently in most other Megaman games, and it's what I find interesting about Azure Striker. Now, I understand it's not groundbreaking, but I admit they did it well, and I found it more complex than Megaman, which is just hold down the fire button, fire at enemy while dodging attacks, and repeat. With bosses, there's weaknesses, which don't exist in Azure Striker, just your skill with your ability and whatever gear you so happen to hold. If anything, the gameplay was fun and interesting, and is definitly worth a play through, if only because the game's on sale.\n\nRegardless, I'm probably going to come back to this game and complete everything. Not necessarily replay, since I want to be done with this game, but it was still fun. Give it a shot.","March 17","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

In this game, while you do have to manage your ability gauge, that gauge is also what allows you to reduce damage, but only if you're not using it. It can help you float a bit, it helps with puzzles, etc. and so on. There are enemies that will come after you if you use you ability, and using it can get you hurt, but will damage the enemy as well. This risk/reward does no really exist as prominently in most other Megaman games, and it's what I find interesting about Azure Striker. Now, I understand it's not groundbreaking, but I admit they did it well, and I found it more complex than Megaman, which is just hold down the fire button, fire at enemy while dodging attacks, and repeat. With bosses, there's weaknesses, which don't exist in Azure Striker, just your skill with your ability and whatever gear you so happen to hold. If anything, the gameplay was fun and interesting, and is definitly worth a play through, if only because the game's on sale.\n\nRegardless, I'm probably going to come back to this game and complete everything. Not necessarily replay, since I want to be done with this game, but it was still fun. Give it a shot.","March 17","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Wanted to get through it so I could give my bit on what it was, if it was fun, so on and so forth. So know I've played it, and will be going back later to get the achievements (if possible).\n\nSo, Azure Striker Gunvolt. If you've seen snapshots and gameplay of this, it's Megaman ZX with a bit of a twist. Instead of just charging up your buster and firing off either little shots or big shots, it's a much more complex system of tagging enemies with your rounds, then electrifying them. I really don't feel like going into much detail as to how the game works, cause the dash works different, the movements different, there's weapons, upgrades, and gear (oh my!), but the core of this game feels like a Megaman ZX. Honestly, I like that about this game, cause I love the Megaman X series. Part if the reason why I bought it in the first place.\n\nDown to the more sectioned off parts of the game, since I've already spoken of the overall gameplay, lets go to the graphics, sound, story, etc.\n\nVisually, the game is not great, but not normal, either. It's got a flare to it that, again, feels like Megaman ZX. I say this because the game's villans are all transforming people with special powers, a lot like the Megamen in the ZX series. The very world itself feels similar, minus the desert stages that always seem to pop up. Now, while I was more focused on the game itself, the visuals were good. Like, 3.7 out of five good. There are only a few scenes where there's a full blown picture instead of just the sprites doing their thing, which is normal, and there's all sorts of neat places that are shown. Cities, jungles, underwater places. Take note, your character can, and will, drown. Fast. So, nothing to really exemplefy in the art/graphics department. What you see is what you get. If you are an in depth guy about this, I dunno. Message me. Maybe I'll get more in detail, but to me, visuals are a game's accompanyment. Sound was fun. It was an electronic feel, each stage had it's own little theme. I didn't pay much attention to it, either. If anything, I have the main menu's theme in my head. But the sound was just as decent as the visuals, where it wasn't amazing, but it was fun to have around. Normally, I never really listen to the music and just have podcasts and what have you in the background, but I'm glad I did mine this way. Also, the game's voices are (of course) in Japanese. No voice acting, though. Not really. Just little quips here and there. Lastly, the story. Now, I ran through this game extremely fast. I did was, again, focused on the gameplay itself. The characters were fun, and I liked them. For a game where there wasn't a ton of dialogue and everything seemed to be more put into the stage creation and the gameplay, I enjoyed the story to an extent. But it's a lackluster story about super powered people, a guy who finds a girl and goes lone wolf on his organization, but still works for them because he needs the money. After doing the rebel organization's dirty work, his waifu is kidnapped, and he goes to save her. Nothing new or original here, really. If anything, the ending is interesting (though I saw it from a mile away). What the story REALLY did for me was want to come back and play the sequel. I hope it's out, cause I want to play it and finish the game. So, while there was little character development and a lackluster story that's been reused more than fifteen times, I want to play the next game, which I guess is what really matters. I just wanted to see some more character development in general, with both Gunvolt and Joule (his waifu, basically. It's more of just a joke for me). I hope that when I go back to get the rest of the achievements, I'll be able to see some more of that, but I don't think I will. Honestly, this game visually, audibly, and story wise feels like a very well done Indie game. But nothing more, nothing less.\n\nNow, the gameplay itself was fun. While I did fly through the game, I did feel like every stage was it's own place. Every stage had its own couple enemies specific to it, as well as the usual enemies that came along with every stage. The stages themselves had puzzles that didn't feel like it was a difficult task to complete, but a screw up would result in some serious punishment. 99.9% of the time, using your electricity will solve whatever puzzle you're having difficulty with. It's just how you use it that matters. Not only that, but the most interesting thing about it all is the risk and reward of using your ability. In most games, your abilities consquences are null. They don't either exist or matter. In Megaman, if you use your abilities, the most that happens is you deplete your ability gauge. So, there's management, but it's simple. In this game, while you do have to manage your ability gauge, that gauge is also what allows you to reduce damage, but only if you're not using it. It can help you float a bit, it helps with puzzles, etc. and so on. There are enemies that will come after you if you use you ability, and using it can get you hurt, but will damage the enemy as well. This risk/reward does no really exist as prominently in most other Megaman games, and it's what I find interesting about Azure Striker. Now, I understand it's not groundbreaking, but I admit they did it well, and I found it more complex than Megaman, which is just hold down the fire button, fire at enemy while dodging attacks, and repeat. With bosses, there's weaknesses, which don't exist in Azure Striker, just your skill with your ability and whatever gear you so happen to hold. If anything, the gameplay was fun and interesting, and is definitly worth a play through, if only because the game's on sale.\n\nRegardless, I'm probably going to come back to this game and complete everything. Not necessarily replay, since I want to be done with this game, but it was still fun. Give it a shot.","March 17","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

However, if you do not have a Logitech Xbox 360 style controller, or Xbox 360 Controller for PC, then your game experience will be worse most likely. I tried playing this game with the keyboard, and it is VERY clunky. That is about my only complaint about this game, though! Since I have an Xbox 360 controller for PC, it works perfectly and feels almost as comfortable as the original 3DS game felt.\n\nThe textures still look amazing in fullscreen, and the game absolutely shines as it runs in 1080p in 30fps.\nI actually think that this game SHOULDN'T run at 60fps. There is a special mood to this game, somewhat cinimatic, that would be ruined if it ran at 60fps. It feels just like an old style game, only BETTER.\n\nThe music is astounding and fits the game so well.\n\nThe story is amazing for what kind of game this is, too! Great characters, and oh my gosh Joule is so adorable I just want to hug her!\n\nAlso, the difficulty of the game was executed perfectly. There are so many different options for playing this game. There isn't a specific difficulty, but rather the difficulty of the game greatly depends on what you have equipped on Gunvolt. This allows a difficulty flexability like no other game has.\n\nThis game is a true masterpiece, and it reminds me of the great times I had with Mega Man a long time ago...\n\nWhy are you still reading this? Just buy the game. If it was $40 it would still be worth it for such a masterpiece.","December 23, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Scoring in this game works like this: You have a combo counter called Kudos, which increases by shooting enemies and bosses with both your gun and flashfield, this counter adds to your score multiplier and remains as long as you keep killing enemies and don't get hit (didn't time how much it takes for the counter to roll down for not killing enemies for too long though, but it's enough time if you keep moving on), along that, you also get extra points at the end of the stage based on how fast you finished the stage.\n\nWith better scores you're rewarded with more items at the end of the stage, but given how much stuff happens at once on the stages, unless you memorize everything and are ready for every bullet, missile, laser, etc coming at your way, odds are you're going to get hit, lose your combo counter, and have to repeat the stage/checkpoint again if you plan to get anything past A rank, otherwise it's inconsequential and totally meaningless for the average player since you can keep repeating stages to farm items.\n\nThe items you get at the end of the stages can be used with the game's crafting system, which is "Collect X, Y and Z, plus some currency, and craft items", items which range from getting more HP from HP items, double/triple jumps, flashfield recharging faster/lasting longer, weapon upgrades, etc, not a bad system, but if you want them all you'll find yourself repeating stages a lot to farm certain items.\n\nOverall the game is not terrible if you can get past the god awful default keyboard control setup, the insanely hard requirements to get anything past A rank, the cheap OHKO's the bosses can do unless you know exactly what to do, and the amount of crap going at once on the really small looking screen, the game is not bad, just don't expect the same level of gameplay as the Megaman Zero series if you came to this game expecting that level of story or gameplay.\n\nYou can play the game as it is just fine, but everything past the ranking, speedrun mode, challenges, etc are clearly aimed towards experts players, so expect an exercise in frustration if you decide to get past A rank and do everything this game as to offer.\n","June 5","false","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
