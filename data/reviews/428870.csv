Although it won't take long to find the surreal, horrific world underneath, Take the Dream IX never forgets its premise. Genre savvy players will appreciate both the lightly satirical and the dark, serious takes on the common tropes of top down RPGs.\n\nFunctionally, this game is similar to Yai Gamework's previous title "Close Your Eyes". The player controls a central protagonist to inspect various objects throughout the world, and solve the occasional puzzle. There is no(?) combat.\n\nThe puzzles can feel rough around the edges at times, but on completion and inspection are designed intuitively. The difficulty of the puzzles is nicely balanced; you won't find yourself stuck for hours, but it will take a little brain power to get through.\n\nThe main attraction of Take the Dream IX though, is the oddly compelling story. On the surface you have a generic main plot of "I must save my love!" This is satisfyingly both played straight at times, then twisted and subverted at others. The world you venture through is surreal in a way you won't quite be able to put your finger on. This is easily the biggest draw pushing you forward, to see what comes next. Like I mentioned above, you won't want for surprises during your journey.\n\nThe game takes roughly 2 hours to complete, and I would recommend finishing it in one session. There are no loud or cheap jumpscares, so you can turn the volume up without fear.\n\n\nIn summary, Take the Dream IX will, if nothing else, keep your interest. You'll find horror sparsed with moments of comedy, with writing that invokes a pointed feeling of empathy in the player. Those of us who played Close Your Eyes will find some pleasant surprises within. The game is also free and fairly small, so you can try it out with little hassle. I whole heartedly recommend you do so, as you aren't likely to forget this one soon.","April 1","true","9.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","13","15","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seigagenesis/recommended/428870/","seigagenesis","Turret Syndrome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seigagenesis/","167 products in account","This game, just as it was in Close Your Eyes, is all about perception. There is no right or wrong, no "winning" or "losing", depending on how you think of it. It's best to dive into the experience with an open mind, void of any pre-judgements or spoilers.  When the seemingly innocuous nature of the game breaks, you'll know it, and nothing will ever be the same from that moment forward.\n\nThis game has a style all its own filled with surreal original artwork, gorgeous sound design, and fantastic writing. The puzzles are fun and the game has plenty of challenging moments, though some may push you to your limit of tolerance and beyond. I think, as gamers, we are used to being spoiled with arbitrary rewards and tutorials to hold our hands, so when a game like this appears--we're not sure what to think at first. There's a strange sense of voyeurism involved when you realize your protagonist is being punished and put through hell, but you can't help but continue on to the end. Just like CYE, don't expect a sense of satisfaction at the end, expect to have your thoughts and dreams haunted for days (and possibly weeks) after completion.\n\nThe developer has stated that they will most likely be getting into commercial gaming development in the future. Part of me would truly miss them in the indie horror world, but I am equally excited to see what they can accomplish with even more resources at their fingertips. As of now, I would happily place AestheticGamer aka Dust Golem in the same pantheon as Kikiyama, Deep Sea Prisoner, Sen and Fummy when it comes to the true greats of indie game-making.","April 13","true","3.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It starts off as generic as possible, but it's fairly obvious that this is deceptive if you've seen the marketing for it. (The only way you would actually think it was a traditional generic RPG is if you went in 100% blind.) It doesn't take long to establish that something is amiss in the world, and the game does a great job at building a sense of unease and subverting expectations right when you thought you knew what was coming next. At times it feels like a traditional horror game, other times it feels like pure parody. While I personally enjoyed it, I feel like that aspect could be off-putting and frustrating to people playing.\n\nThere are a handful of puzzles throughout the game, many of which I found clever and a good balance of difficulty. The only puzzle that I felt was a bit mindless was the chemical puzzle in the last timed section, which really seemed more like a time waster than anything else. At the very least, knowing the solution made that part go by very quickly, but it was a strange disconnect from the rest of that area, which was all movement and maze based. Another part I found frustrating was avoiding the Sloppy Joes while the stick figures were in the way, as the random movements basically just made it an annoyance. At least the Sloppy Joes are merciful enough not to kill you and just warp you back to a previous section. (What even are the Sloppy Joes anyway? Their existance is so strange to me.)\n\nSome areas that particularly stood out to me were the clock song puzzle and the dark area where you're trying not to get spotted. I played it last night before the latest patch, so I'm not sure how much the puzzle changed, but I thought it was interesting and made me think without needed to resort to trial and error. The stealth area felt the most like a horror game to me because the monsters are unsettling and I felt very on edge during the whole segment, and it was intense trying to avoid being spotted, especially when you don't really know their range of vision. (I somehow managed to get through without dying once, though I was playing it VERY safe until the end.)\n\nAnother point about the game is that it's VERY meta, almost a bit too meta for it's own good. I don't want to spoil too many story points, but it's a very "Ryan" game. If you're familiar with him and his works you'll understand what I mean when you play it. Expect to see some subtle (and not so subtle) references to his previous Steam game "Close Your Eyes." You don't need to have played that game to enjoy this one, however. It is very much a standalone story.\n\nI guess the part I'm most conflicted about is the ending, but then again, given the information revealed in the story, I'm not really sure how I would have ended it either. Still, there is at least some sense of closure, even if it feels like there's more unanswered questions than answered ones. Overall though, I enjoyed my time playing this game, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys quirky indie games. It's free and a relatively short game, it took me about three hours, so it'll be well worth your time.","April 2","true","4.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_incarnate/recommended/428870/","evil_incarnate","Evil incarnate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_incarnate/","1022 products in account","A promising aspiration of the horror genre that ultimately ends in hair-ripping frustration due to oversights in puzzle design. This game surprised me for its hilarious, loveable dialogue, cute characters and well thought-out puzzles up until the timed puzzle, which I'll get into later.\n\nYou play Gwen, who describes herself as a tomboy, who is in love with another girl called Flora. But this game isn't your typical love story or yuri, as the amusing ArKun villain is introduced, sets the tone for the rest of the game. You're now on a journey to save your girlfriend by going through very creative areas, set pieces, changes of pace and atmosphere at the click of a finger, and puzzle designs that took me back to the days of the old PlayStation 2 survival horror games such as Silent Hill 2, 3 and 4. The puzzle involving the animal heads was genuinely well-made, perhaps one of the best puzzles I've experienced in a horror game since Silent Hill 4.\n\nThe hand-drawn art is awesome, it fits the aesthetics of the game and is always a pleasure to look at. However, I would have preferred better transition effects from sprite-to-artwork, such as screen fades or something. Also, the scene near the beginning of the game where Flora is looking out over the cliff could have been enhanced with her hair blowing in the wind, to give it a dramatic effect. This also ties in with how much this game feels like a JRPG despite it being made by an American. As mentioned, the dialogue is surprisingly filled with comedic value - which doesn't detract from the game's enjoyment - but adds to it as it supports the style the game is aiming to achieve. You have lots of different characters, whom I all love, some have their own artwork which gives them even more character through visual narrative.\n\nFor a free game this is amazing, there is so much variety in this short-packed adventure, such as the Sloppy Joes, dark atmosphere of the underground crypts, to your everyday Highschool life. However, and this is where I can't recommend this game, is one of the final puzzles in this game. It is the segment that you dive into a lava pit with a timer and have to escape by solving the chemical puzzle, then traversing through the maze-like structure to avoid the lava, then become swarmed by double digit Sloppy Joes (who are the enemies in this game). This is incredibly frustrating, it feels too forced and pressuring to have this come out of nowhere, and it will try your patience as a human being. You either don't have enough time to finish this segment, don't have enough health to beat it due to forced damage, either too many Sloppy Joes swarm you at once, or the horribly unforgiving checkpoint system will make you want to jump our your window. A recent patch was deployed which was suppose to alleviate this infuriating design; but changed little to nothing. So if you're reading this and want to play this, be warned this puzzle will test you.\n\nThat said, for owners of Yai Gamesworks' previous game: Close Your Eyes, there is an awesome throwback moment to it, which I really loved and found funny. I won't spoil, but you'll get a giggle out of it for sure.\n\nI can't recommend this game, however, because the instant rise of difficulty killed the game's tone, pacing and comedy value it had going for it. This kind of frustration and experimental puzzle design doesn't always work, and when it does it's usually added in a type of game that has this kind of trial and error persistent in its design. The Souls games, for example, is a mainstream series that glorifies this structured gameplay style. But in an adventure game such as this, where its value comes from the story and puzzles, stopping the player from continuing due to its own design is this game's only downfall. The developer clearly knows what they are doing in this game and, can for a fact, make good puzzles and atmospheric set pieces, but experimenting on abnormal design tradition to further the progression of what is a light comedy, adventurous game is not a mix that bodes well together. Perhaps a future patch can fix this, but I'm not willing to put up with furious design choices out of nowhere, especially after the disaster of a game that is NightCry. But with Take the Dream IX, there is clearly hope and light at the end of the tunnel that Yai Gameworks knows how to make great games.\n\nAnd no, there is no Take the Dream I-VIII.","April 1","false","1.6"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","22","36","2","4"

I felt genuinely interested in the characters, and throughly enjoyed the different themes laced through the gameplay.  Yes, this was a rougher, more experimental game, but I feel that sometimes those are the best!  Nothing is gained without sometimes just throwing things at the wall until they stick, and the atmosphere and mood created a great sense of dread in certain points of the game that I found engrossing.\n\nAddressing one of the elephants in the room:  There is a particular section of the game that is a bit difficult.  It took me about 8 - 10 attempts to clear it, and I could see people (myself included) raging a bit about it.  I think I have  very clear idea about what the creator was trying to do here, and it made especially more sense upon the next part of the game.\n\nLet's just say, it's a satire of a particular style of game - one that tends to get a lot of coverage through certain social media channels.  I tip my bonnet to you sir.\n\nAnywho, overall a very unique and enjoyable horror / comedy / tragedy / satire experience.  I will continue to look forward to future games by Yai Gameworks!","April 2","true","2.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game also has both a lot of symbolism and faux symbolism. Also, The Host! But still, despite the dev worrying that this would be the worst recieved of his games, it still is wonderful and sets the bar for future games like Red Haze.

You're on your way to meet your girlfriend, Flora, when... things happen. To say much more would be to give away a lot of the story.\n\nAll you really need to know is that, like Close Your Eyes, this is a truly bizarre, creepy, and sometimes even funny game that balances a lot of tones really well. It packs in a lot of variety during it's two hour play time, with lots of puzzles and surprises. Sometimes it's cute, sometimes it's funny, and sometimes it's flat out freaky, but the one constant is it is never boring.\n\nMy one complaint is a segment near the end that is timed. Despite the kick ♥♥♥ song that plays, it's really repetitive, tough, stressful, and tedious if you die in it, where you have to start all the way at the beginning of the challenge. It took me several tries and was imply not enjoyable.\n\nDespite that one flaw, this is another confusing but engaging horror game from the makers of the excelent Close Your Eyes. It's got unique visuals, a weird but engaging story, real atmosphere that sucks you in, and anawesome soundtrack. Great job, devs, and really looking forward to Red Haze and Close Your Eyes 2.\n\nSo, download it. It's free! Show these creative people that unique ideas are things to be celebrated. Download Close Your Eyes while you're at it.","May 24","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For instance the "Sloppy Joe" enemy has a really odd hit box that isn't too forgiving when interacting with the movement speed of Gwen (the main character) or the fast-er pace of Sloppy Joe - meaning that there are some odd waiting times and sketchy doges that occur in the game to be able to avoid taking hits from this type of enemy. Additionionally some of the sequences and obstacles (like stickmen running amuck or lava pools that I found to be hard to avoid with the semi-slow response on the controls) take away from the beautiful art style/areas and breaks the seemlessness of the game.\n\nThe story itself is a bit confusing too. Personally, as someone who can understand and create some decent art, stories, and/or ideas, I can connect with the game and recognize the meaning(s) behind parts of the story. Overall though there are many holes and deadends that I myself feel should have been covered or at least explained better so that the player can further enjoy the game, with less confusion, and thus make a fair judgement on the game off of fully explained parts of the story. There are sooooooo many good ideas and cool concepts that would have been super effective had they been timed or described in more depth. As to not create any spoilers, but give a few examples for people who have played to recognize, I will vaugely describe a few: [party] character arcs, random art flashes (also goes with the character bit), and some vauge messages (like one given to the player at the end of the game for pressing the "continue game" button after beating the game).\n\nWhew; that might have seemed like a lot of issues or nit-picking, but to be honest, these problems influence about 5% or less of the game.\n\nIt has a wonederful atmosphere and really brings the feel of a classic RPG. There are many refrences to other RPGs and games and a plethora of hilarious jokes and messages that help as comic relief in an awesome story with a cool twist ending. The puzzles in the game are awesome too, meaning that they are both rewarding when finished and fun to decipher. The puzzles themselves are very well thought out and have awesome storytelling aspects that keep the player interested and involved in the game. There are also a few other enemies that appear in the game that have awesome mehcanices (meaning that there are a few enemies in the game overall, with most of them being really cool and well designed... with the exepction to Sloopy Jaloopy).\n\nThere is so much more that is awesome about the game that I could rant on for pages, but just trust me when I say that this is a game that's worth playing and super fun, although confusing at some points. Maybe personally I'm just unable to connect the dots or missed some clues for the story and some of the gameplay issues I had were "cuz i ned 2 gt gud", but hey, then that's my problem and not the developers.\n\nHopefully this review is seen as constructive critisim and helps to better improve your future works, or maybe helps to make some updates to this game's current version whenever you have free time. I will go on record to say that I am super excited to see "Red Haze". Seeing that this game is the first and only game in your line of work I\'ve played due to my owning of a mac, I still found "Take the Dream IX" to be superb, awesome, and exceedingly fun to play, issues and all.","May 31","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The puzzles and challenges are fun but are too few. The story really holds the game back, I appreciate what the developer was trying to accomplish, making attempts to mess with the player's head. But mind-bending games only work if the early-game confusion is balanced out either by endgame understanding, or a very clear theme and message. This game offers neither, and when I finished I felt the game was too short and did not work hard enough to explain what was happening.","April 20","false","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Its silly use of tropes and unprofessional sounds/voices really take you out of the story. I hope the designer keeps trying, because there is a balance between meaningful and fun that can be struck here, and I think some more editing, tweaking, re-scripting the lines, and re-recording the voices would help make this an unforgettable jaunty adventure with a dark twist.","June 3","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wasn't given the chance to really see the relationship between Gwen and all the other four characters presented to us (Kayto, Vera, Luna and I don't even remember the last one). So all the dialogue between them end up being pointless melodrama that only got in the way to the game.\nNothing was really explained at the end.\nAlso, what was the point of starting the game with the story of a Goddess and a Demon King and a bunch of magic stones if this will be barely used in the game? Really, it was really annoying.\n\n----SPOILER ALERT----\nAlso, finishing with "it was only a dream" made me feel like that were some 2 wasted hours that I could have used to something more fun and productive.\n\n---END OF SPOILER ALERT---\n\nThe game would be ok, if it wasn't for this horribly lazy storytelling","May 5","false","2.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
