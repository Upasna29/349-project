"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/320790/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Absolutely horrendous.\n\nThe best way to describe this game is zombie-like. While the environments look lifeful, missing sounds and animations make the characters look like robots, and they act like it at times. AI is unbelievable: it will constantly walk into walls, walk past you when you're firing at it (only responding when you actually hit them). The fact that they say it's single player is in my mind a lie: the AI is not up to par to even CONSIDER it. The 4 maps avaliable are all unique, but affect gameplay too much as certain maps are a characters bread and butter (for example, the catacombs-like map for the melee class).\n\nCharacters level up and get abilities, but will cause horrible sways of power. With being able to unlock abilities such as a Radar, significant speed/strength boosts, it will cause a bad dynamic for new players going against old. While the netcode looks alright with the limited time I spent with it, the game made me feel sick at times with the backdrops/enemies put in front of me. Balance is significantly off in my opinion, as R.O.B. has one hit kill capability that outweighs the rest of the other portions.\n\nSignificant portions feel unfinished, with no fall damage sounds, or appopriate world elements. You pick up powerups, that you have no idea what they do, and the game does absolutely nothing to teach you on how to play. You'd think that wouldn't be necessary in an FPS, but when you have mechanics such as being able to put oil on the ground and setting it on fire, I should be told about that. Or that an ammo distribution center is....well an ammo distributrion center, not me running into things randomly hoping to find ammo.\n\nI will be following this review up with a video, but I want to put this up here right now to make sure no one buys this game. It's frankly an awful experience all around.\n","October 27, 2014","false","4.7"," 114 of 142 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","114","142","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vito91/recommended/320790/","vito91","Vito","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vito91/","351 products in account","It's a typical online shooter, but with an interesting steampunk/fantasy theme and some really amazing level designs. Gameplay is quite fast paced, there are bounce pads, power-ups and instagib weapons, which gives it an oldschool feel. It definitely plays more like Quake than any modern FPS, although there are ironsights. It's pretty fun and has potential but it also has some serious problems you might want to know about before buying:\n\n>it's optimised like crap. i get low fps even if i switch all settings to lowest, and my fans gets loud as hell, there are also occasional crashes.\n>classes are clearly imbalanced, also they start with only  1 weapon each, which kinda blows\n>no voice acting or music outside of menu, there isn't even a commentator\n>it's multiplayer only, there are bots but they aren't that fun to play with\n>it was just released and there are already problems finding people to play with\n>only 4 maps and very little variety in game modes, although the maps are spectacular\n\nThis is actually a neutral review. I can't really recommend this game yet, but i also don't want to bash it with a negative rating, it already has very low score as it is.","October 27, 2014","true","2.9"," 31 of 51 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","31","51","0","0"

Exotic design, with a simple level system and a gold system where you can buy skills with gold from frags. Bot mode is also available. What I feel lacking is that It kind of needs some kind of single player mode aspect to the game, as in a proper story mode in a way. Each one of the five characters are unique, and thier weapons feel like you are playing with antique steampunk guns such as cannonballs, flamethrowers, and sharp plated claws. The content still feels pretty lacking atm, but it may be a good game if you don't have the time or a good computer to play AAA titles. 70/100.","December 16, 2014","true","1.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Instead, it's a multiplayer game with Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Weapon Wrangle.  All I've been doing is playing Deathmatch against the bots because I can't find any players.  Nice art design and interesting characters can't save a multiplayer game without any players.\n\nIn addition, the FOV is too low for PC players.  Yes, TotalBiscuit isn't the only person who wishes games came with FOV sliders and I hope the devs fix this.   I purchased this in a bundle, hoping bundle purchases would generate some interest but so far I haven't found anyone.  Oh well, back to the bots.\n\nI'm going to give this a recommendation, because it is a fun game but you may want to check around to see if the player base has improved before buying.\n\nEdit: My antivirus program was blocking settings from being changed.  The problem is now fixed thanks to the devs.","April 2, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","6"

As far as I can tell there is no story mode, just good old pvp.\nYou can choose from 5 characters + a locked one (not sure how to unlock it, my guess - leveling).\nRouge - the chick with the double revolvers - good from a distance as the iron sight is pretty accurate.\nAlice - the machine gun chick - your typical spray and pray character, can have grenades.\nVlad - the melee dude - wolverine style in your face slice and dice - lightning fast.\nWolf - the dude with the flamethrower - the Firebug, can drop tar and set it ablaze.\nRob-o - the C3PO canon launcher - slow, but 1 shots people :)\nThe unlockable character is called Wild Card and can slide on the ground - that's all I've gathered from the Steam description.\nThere is character progression in the game - you level up and you gather coins from kills - 25 for a headshot, 50 for first blood and 100 for a kill. Coins and levels persist through character swap. You need level 10 and 10000 coins to unlock the secondary ( and I expect the better) weapon/armaments for each character , so 60 000 coins to unlock it on all six (600 frags). There is a skill tree for all of your characters, that provides minor upgrades like longer power up duration and less respawn time, and then one individual tree for each character, where you unlock the secondary armaments, taunts, grenades ...\nSo on the available 4 maps you can play the following match types :\nDeathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Training Day, King of the Hill and Bodyguard.\nDeathmatch and Team Deathmatch are pretty straightforward, in Training day everybody starts with Alice and as you gain kills you progress and swap automatically to the next character, King of the Hill - on of you is the King, everybody on the map can see King's location and whoever kills the King becomes the new one - points are awarded for being the King. Bodyguard game mode is like a team Deathmatch, where one of the players on each team is VIP and only VIP deaths affect the scoreboard, the rest of the team are expendable ;)\nThere are quite a few power-ups in the game in form of a different colored ball on the ground - armor, damage, big jump and a few others. At first it's hard to get, what the power up exactly does - I would love to have them all listed and explained somewhere. I would also like some Steam achievements and trading cards - to round up the game experience. The maps are fairly different, but only 4 - let's hope more will come in the future. The controls are tight and fully remappable, the combat is fluid and satisfactory, unless you're the victim :p The AI is definitely not the brightest, as it mainly reacts when shot upon, but it's good to have in the mix for more action ;)\nThe price tag is a bit high in my opinion, as there are free to play alternatives on the market that offer the same, if not better, experience, so I would recommend only to buy the game, once it goes on sale.\n\nTL:DR you can watch my gameplay video, where I play as the victim in Deathmatch mode on all 4 maps http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=332869257","October 27, 2014","true","4.2"," 21 of 46 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","21","46","0","0"
