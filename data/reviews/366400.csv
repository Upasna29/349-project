"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehfoddz/recommended/366400/","tehfoddz","Foddz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehfoddz/","251 products in account","TL;DR - Game is polished, fast paced, and fun. Well worth the price. Do recommend.\n\nFirst off, ignore the reviews that say this game has no players. Those were posted while it was in early access/beta and the player base was only around 2000 people total. Now that it has released fully, there's plenty of people playing\n\nThis game is a twin-stick shooter style MOBA. It is fast paced, easy to learn the basics, and rewards smart tactical and strategic decision making. There's 9 different ships - 3 size classes for each of the 3 races - three of which the player can choose to bring into battle with them. Smaller ships tend to be lower HP but fast and good at burst damage, as well as being able to capture bases quickly. Medium ships often have the choice between a support of damage dealing role, and have moderate speed and HP, as well as an expanded cargo hold for upgrading bases. Large ships are slow but tanky and can output a high volume of sustained damage, in addition to providing some interesting niche support capabilities such as team healing or cloaking.\n\nPlayers compete over a map containing various different bases. The bases start off NPC controlled. Once the players take them over, the bases can be upgraded to improve their defenses and to increase the number of strategic points the base rewards the team with.\n\nThe game ends when one team successfully captures the opposing team's home base, or when one team accumulates enough strategic points to take control of an ion cannon to destroy the enemy's home base. A typical match will last between 15 and 20 minutes.\n\nPlayers start off at level 1 every match. Their ships will have a base amount of shields/HP and one basic weapons system. By performing various activities in game - killing NPCs, capturing bases, killing opposing players, and upgrading bases - players gain XP and will level up. Every time a player levels up, they may choose an additional upgrade for their ship. Each ship has 4 different weapons/abilities they can put points into, plus the ability to upgrade their shields/hp/speed. The levels carry over between ships, so you can swap out ships mid-match and build it out to the same level as your other ship. The different ships and the different ways of building out each ship lends itself to a good variety of different play styles.\n\nOutside of the individual matches, ships can be upgraded through components that are rewarded based on your peformance in different point categories and also over time as your profile levels up. Customized paints and patterns are also available for each ship through the same mechanism. The upgrades provide a small, non-gamebreaking boost to the ship's systems/weapons/abilities, potentially giving you an edge in a close battle.\n\nThere is also an 'Escape Run' game mode I have yet to experience. Rarely, one of your after match rewards will be a special contract that will let you and several friends take control of a capital ship. This capital ship drops into other, ongoing 10v10 matches and effectively competes against both teams in the match. Players in the match can join forces to try and take you down within a certain time period for special rewards. If you survive in the captial ship through 3 of these matches, you instead are rewarded. Having not experienced either side of this event, I can't comment much about it, but it does sound like an interesting twist!\n\nOverall, the graphics are polished, the sound is good quality, the gameplay is smooth and generally bug-free, and I have had no problems with server latency. If you're looking for an easy to pick-up and play MOBA, or want a multiplayer twin-stick shooter fix, this game is definitely a good choice.","April 9","true","18.4"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","40","46","2","4"

Most of the controls are intuitive enough. a little clunky in some of the menu's and a little bit jaring to figure everything else out.\n\nYes, the game was released for the PS before it got to steam. And yes, the steam players have a lead on a lot of levels. As much as the ingame system does give them a gear advantage for this, It'll be player skill that really makes the difference. I've done fairly well toe to toe with some of the level 30 PS players.\n\nHonestly, It's got a lot of potential. What it needs now is more players. More players will give us more games, and will further thin out the high level PS players, balancing the play for us steam players.","December 15, 2015","true","109.9"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","16","22","2","2"

I stumbled upon a heavy armor ship that seemed almost OP as a sniper for a few days in the alpha then people started figuring guerilla tactics to take down that ship so we had to change ships for the advantage or use the heavy ship in an original way. It's been a lot of fun, even if I'm bad at it, and the early access version has some bugs (closing unexpectedly during a match, after a match) but it runs smoothly. Once we get more players, the matchmaking will pick up too.\n\nLooking forward to playing a few matches each week in Dead Star.","December 19, 2015","true","5.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

As of right now I would say it is consumer unfriendly to purchase this game, unless you are dedicated to the "early access" experience.\n\nThe game is fun. Fast paced ship combat focusing around RPG mechanics. Different hull sizes, races, ship abilities, and upgrades exist. The game is certainly promising. The game is designed specifically for multiplayer, there is no singleplayer experience (Think Sci-Fi League of Legends). However, I have never been able to find a FULL 10v10 game in the 2 weeks I have owned the game. If the devs can find a way to bring a community to their game, I will absolutely change my review to recommend. However, right now I am literally spending HOURS in queue to either time out of lobby and get booted back to the main menu, or seldomly playing an occasional lop-sided 1v1.\n\nThe devs reccommend a "peak" playtime of 10pm to 1am CST. Even during this, I find it difficult to get a game. Right now the community seems to be based off of PS4, and you will see groups of 3-4 PS4 players queuing up together, only to create lopsided and stacked teams. It's difficult as PC player to play with PS4 users, as the ingame VOIP is limited to users of like-platfroms (PS4 can't VOIP with PC or vice versa) and the consolized chat commands don't always articulate what you would like another player to do.\n\nOn another interesting note the "capital ship" gameplay mode featured in the main video advertisement on the store page, seems to not yet be implemented into the game, as of yet. I am dissapointed, as this is one of the features that sold me on the game.","February 14","false","45.1"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","21","37","0","2"

I loved that mod but with time it has seemed to disappear. So I bought and installed the game and wanted to make a little video to show my first impressions. Now in my video I only tried the single player "Free Play" option, as I plan to make another video for the multiplayer.\n\nFirst ImpressionsFirst off the game is rather pretty with lots of little details and vibrant colors.  The controls are smooth and responsive the sounds from shots and explosions are what you would expect from a space game but at the same time compliment whats happening well without being over the top. Off the start there is a good variety of ships you can choose from, during my whole time of playing I didn't feel like I was playing a "MOBA" as the game is described as. From what I experience and played its worth the price of 20$ Cad.\n\nNote I didn't see everything as this was a quick video and a first impressions. There is still more to be seen and experienced. If this type of thing interests you try it out and make your own decision of the game.\n\nSide Note This video is a first look/impressions video not a review and I am new to this type of videos so please go easy on me and share your constructive criticism. Please excuse the happy children.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9seFJq4b6A&\n\nUpdateI made a video showing the online and as fun as it was, the main problem I noticed was the lack of people playing on PC.

I've also seen a lot of people compare it to MOBA's though I don't play those so can't really comment.  Overall it comes across as simple at first but the level of complexity between the races, ships, various loadout options, etc. make this a strategically deep 2D space shooter.  Cross-play with Playstation 4 ensures you will always find a full match even if PC players are somewhat lacking at this time.  No cross-play voicechat though unfortunately.

I discovered this game at PAX South 2016 (and received the game for free). I instantly fell in love with this game, and if there were more people online, I'd play it a lot more.\nThis game takes a moba-like atmosphere and lays the popular dreadnought/space fleet theme on top of it. There are many approaches on how to play the game. You can sit back, mine ore, capture bases, and defend to win by points, or you can go on the offensive and destroy the enemy base.\nThe game has 3 primary ship classes. The light ships are like scouts. They are fast, lightly armored, and have x4 base capture speed. Medium ships have decent health, speed, and increased ore capacity for upgrading bases. Then there's your heavy ships with slow speed, heavy armor, and powerful weapons. On top of the 3 primary ship classes, there are 4 races with their own unique ships, 12 in total. All 12 of these ships have their own unique skills ranging from repair beams, turrets, and proximity mines to extremely powerful lasers, missile barrages, and cloaking fields. All of these aspects coalesce into a highly competitive and fun environment.\nJust watch out because I got on one day with my friend... we lost to 1 guy...","March 22","true","7.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Well look no further.\n\n-Dead Star gameplay pulls much of its charm from classic top down shooters such as Star Control ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Control)\n\n-There are 4 races with 3 ships each giving you a choice of 12 different ships, each with their unique variety of weapons and abilities.\n\n-Ships\nThere are 3 classes of ship: light, medium, and heavy.\nThe light scout ships are fast and capture bases more quickly. They can be pesky to larger ships as they buzz around jabbing at them.\nMedium ships are best used to mine because they hold double the amount of crystals as the other ships. They also provide a wide range of helpful buffs and deffensive abilities that can easily turn the tide of a battle if used correctly.\nHeavy ships are purely used for combat. They dish out, and absorbe the most damage and are essential for pushing the fight to the enemy base.\n\n-Upgrading\nAs you play through the game you earn componants that are used to upgrade your ships. You can buff your favorite ships over time, giving you a small advantage in the match. There is a "recycling" system that allows you to use componants to produce other componants. This part of the game is a bit confusing and can give you analysis paralysis. I like the idea but I feel it could be executed differently to achive the same effect.\n\n-Gameplay\nAll maps in game are randomly generated. This puts a fun spin on what could quickly become 'best' strategy aproach to the maps. Each tame is presented with several hex plots of space with a base in each plot. Teams get more points over time for each base they control. Bases can be upgraded to get more points and better deffense for the base. This creates a very fun area control environment that requires strateging thinking to outsmart the other team using flanking and other classic military strategies.\nThe gameplay does not feel frantic but can get very hectic when you have 8 or more players in one area blasting it out. Each base also spawns npc ships that can follow your ship if you have control of that base. This gives a feeling of an actual fleet instead of just player ships buzzing around.\n\n-Conclusion\nI really like this game. It rewards strategic play and is bessed played with people that like to communicate and plan things out during play. Rarely can a 'lone wolf' do any good. However, it can be very satisfying to attack an enemy base when and take it over while the enemy team is distracted with something else. I got this on sale but I would pay the $20 for it. Right now it lacks player base. You will join a full match at peak hours and maybe have a 2vs2 match an hour later. Dead Star is a lot of fun and feels like a cross between an MOBA and an RTS.\n\n-Suggestions\nI think this game might benefit with a commander type player that could issue commands, assign npcs to follow players, etc. If your team doen't have a mutual understanding of what is the best strategic choice, or are not communicating it can make the match a frustrating experience.","January 13","true","72.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Some are easier to master than others and the PS4 population is high enough that you will usually get a game. At nearly 40 hours in, I definitely enjoy it but I can't in good faith recommend it to others anymore at the current pricing.\n\nThe matchmaking is woefully broken a lot of the time and games can quickly turn into a ragefest as you spawn into a fleet of partied players or check the roster to see 5 of your 10-man team has quit. Squad limits are nonexistent in every mode so you may have a 5-man squad in a 5v5 or a 10-man squad in a 10v10. Worst of all, the big squads seem to almost always be the level 50 players so the matchmaker skips working entirely.\n\nThe dev team doesn't seem to have any interest anymore in the Steam population with no forum replies in weeks. At its current standing, I wouldn't recommend it at $19.99 and would put the DLC ships at even less worth overall. Buy it if it goes on sale with everything at $15 total. Otherwise, wait for some rebalancing of the matchmaker and maybe some activity from the dev team, besides new DLC.","June 5","false","71.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
