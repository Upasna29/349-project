It's still tense as anything and some parts had me screaming internally because most of my decisions are me playing by luck and some of those choices were NOT FUN oh my lord. If you haven't had the absolute pleasure of reading HR: The Prodigy and HR: The Hero Project, the first two parts of this trilogy, then you are missing out on one Hell of a time. This is a choose-your-own-adventure on a whole 'nother level of 'OH MY GAW WHY DID I DO THAT' and crippling regret. Given all of them are really cheap too, it's entirely worth it - you get more than your money's worth, so long as you enjoy reading and also shaving twenty years off your life because this stress is just too damn much.\n\nTL;DR: I will recommend this until the day I die, along with the two prior installments.","July 11, 2014","true","3.3"," 49 of 68 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","49","68","0","1"

In most games with such choices it's little more than a 2 way branch, or nothing but choosing a particular ally before going right back to the same path. Railroading bores me. Heroes Rise... Does not. The choices felt like actual choices, with actual consequences, influinced by prior choices and changing future choices you might have. This gave the game a fluid feeling and made it actually feel like those choices really mattered and influinced the world.\n\nAt the end of the game I got to see my choices come to a head, and got to see the results of those choices. I was particularly pleased when my decisions caused almost every conflict I was going to have, break down into infighting as half my enemies joined me instead. Knowing what I did made such a difference was an extremely satisfying feeling, one that most games do not offer. The focus on story rather than flashy graphics allowed the game to become something far greater than the pretty but. frankly, boring games I usually get to see or play, and certainly left me eager for more. I look forward to what this developer produces next.","October 20, 2015","true","4.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

They create their own games and host other games that people write using their software. If you care more about plot than cutscenes and running around then you will like this game, if you don't then perhaps you should go play something else. I love visual novels, and this is very similar except no pictures.\nThis is the third and final game of the original trilogy (they are supposed to release a fourth game with a different protagonist). You can import your saves from the second game or start new. There are a lot of choices and endings in this game, or at least it seemed like there were more compared to the first one. The major villian from the first game shows up as a companion this time, and now you are on the run from the law. Your parents, who were put in jail for killing a supervillain, are about to be executed, and you need to find a way to save them without getting arrested. There are several romances, and you can be male/female and gay/straight. All the romances from the firs two games show up again, and new ones are also avaliable.","December 23, 2014","true","2.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I'd played Psyhigh before a loved it so figured I'd give this a shot for such a reasonable price and loved it even more. So rare to come across supers written outside comics especially this well done.\n\nI only really have one concern with now having finished Herofall and finding out there are plans for a splinterstory of the second hero project. I'm definately looking forward to it but there wasn't a save feature at the end of Herofall. I found on facebook that it will be a new protagonist but still a lot of things in Herofall that would effect the upcoming hero project. Hope a update comes out that lets me save my world because I'd love to have another playthrough but would hate to lose Rowan (my hero) in the process.\n\nAnyway now I have to go buy the rest of the choice of games library and will be sure to pick up Versus when it comes out!","March 30, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

More specifically they are in the vein of the Chose your own Adventure books I adored so much as a kid. And like them the first in this series(Heroes Rise: Prodigy) has a bit of railroading going on. You might just want to scream at the main character.\n\nThat said I enjoyed this third installment much better than the first one in the series. Since it is the end of the main character's story the choices have been opened up a great deal and you really get to feel as if you are shaping the world you are in. In addition at first glance it appears there are many carryovers from your choices in the first two of the series, thus lending more weight to those decisions that may have felt pointless at the time. I am not sure how much that actually effects though since I only went through all three games once.\n\nThat said while I am divided on whether I would recomend the first installment, and while I am kinda meh on the Hero Project, this third installment I can say is truely an epic end. It is nice to see something end strongly for a change. All to often the last installment, or chapter of a story feels like a let down. It is rather hard to end something well.

With a plot that can keep you on the edge of your seat for hours until you realise that you have come to the dramatic ending. Using only your imagination you can "see" yourself making those hard choices that don't always have the expected result. If anything there is only one thing that you can be sure about, you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villan.

I liked it.\n\n(optional let's play footage)\nhttp://youtu.be/2kygobwgcJk\nWow the graphics of your imagination are ♥♥♥♥ing incredible! This game looks amazing lol\n\nIt's a choose your own adventure novel. In the fictional world is it common for people to have super powers, kind of like X-men. There are both heroes and Villains. Oppression and discrimination are strong themes i.e. against people with super powers. This is the third title in a trilogy. But you can play this without having completed the previous two games. But I think it's recommended that you have at least completed certain chapter of the previous books.\n\nYou have to read a lot lol. From what I can gather from these games you can't really choose to play as a Villain which is what I would like to do. But it does put in you in a situation where you can or you have to cooperate with the bad guys. Which from the look's of it will be a major element of the plot here. Okay, maybe the ideas in this game aren't completely original. I'm pretty X-men had featured same sort of stuff. And some of the scenes are kind of cliche. For example one character repeatedly attempts to warn their companions that danger is imminently approaching, but each time is ignored or cut off until the danger is right at the doorstep and that character even says 'I told you so' lol. But to be honest this didn't really bother me. The narrative seem to have enough substance to be interesting. It's far from the worst thing I've read.\n\nI really enjoyed really playing this game. I like to read. If you like or don't mind reading maybe you should give it a try.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 11, 2014","true","1.5"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

I have to be honest with you here. This is the best game in the trilogy, my actions actually matter and affect me from what I've done in the last two games, it's great really great. I start off again from the cabin from the last game and it turns out dun! Dun! Dun! Prodigal's alive. I called it ♥♥♥♥♥es. So we escape in this car and we have to drive real fast and we go to some hideout and we team up with Sonja's sister, Juhi. I bought the trilogy pack so I have ad space so I buy her all the ad space and then I tell Jenny to ♥♥♥♥ off because she's a ♥♥♥♥♥. Then we go to this place and fatass GG is there and we're at Gay Gardens so we relax at Gay Gardens and decide what to do next because I have no damn clue what's going on. So we go to some place and fight the six people trying to kill me and so I just punch a couple in the face and thinking I clicked on fight Rebellion I actually chose "Ah hell nah, I'mma go home get myself some doorwitoes and dwink some Muntain Daw fug dis shizzle." So I run away with my tail between my legs but two faced ♥♥♥♥♥ comes anyway, oh I mean Jenny. (Shots fired.) After doing that I can't gather the the power in my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to give a ♥♥♥♥ if she comes or not, so I say "Yeah your my best friend and remember how you think you saved me all those times when I actually saved your ♥♥♥? Remember that?" I decide to teleport but I need a teleporter so I go to Gay Gardens and I talk to GG and he gives me information and a ♥♥♥♥ slap to the face. We go to Millenial Tower where since I didn't tattle on the two... things? Having sex in the bathroom they don't ♥♥♥♥ me up. So after having my record of straight sex not being broken a drug addict calls "da police." So they can hook him up with some of those drugs Rebellion offered me. So I command the Millenial group to do some stuff and I succeed on every one because it's so easy. I face Rebellion after having powedered our noses in his secret little hideout place in a museum. I roll then punch rebellion then I cripple rebllion using my gun, pew, pew. I take no damage, but ♥♥♥♥♥ is in trouble oh sorry, I mean Jenny (Roasted!) is in trouble so I move her a cenimeter very awkwardly and she gets shot. My character is sad but in real life I'm celebrating my friends are over I invited the neighborhood, we opened up some beers, we have party hats, Black Magic comes and ♥♥♥♥s up Rebellion... Oh ♥♥♥♥ she's awake. I had already knocked out Rebellion on 3v so I tell Black Magic "BB, it ain't the wight fing to do, you hero, me stick my ♥♥♥♥ in you, we all happy." She is touched by my words and we awake on some boat, I then kiss her and we fortify our relationship. This won't backfire, not at all. I wake up on the boat and Prodigal's there after me and Black Magic had sex. Then I see something from the sky somethingon a magic carpet! It's a Saudian Arabian, holy ♥♥♥♥! It's Aladin! No, it's just Pressie... Holy ♥♥♥♥ Pressie! My favorite character from the entire game he's so happy and cheerful and... "I'm serious now Metal Man, I jacked off to wikipedia in the rain forest so some monks let me jack off to their old man bodies so I'm good now." Damnit, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s ruined Pressie! How the hell do you mess up Pressie, he's Pressie for gods sake? "I'm going to ♥♥♥♥ off once I get you on this boat." No! Why god, why would you do this? Pressie was amazing but you messed him up. Anyways he never says anything else and is not mentioned ever again. We're on the ship and I answer these door questions correctly. Then I see Miss Artillery being lifted into a big bowl of chili, I shoot with my plama pistol but it doesn't fire. She dies and writes "Dad VI" What does that, oh ♥♥♥♥ her dad is Victon. Yeah game, it's pretty damn obvious, I didn't need a clue or anything. Prodigal punches me but I regain my powers but this time thier infinite so I ♥♥♥♥ up some ♥♥♥♥ and I fly back to Millenia City. Is that what it's called? I dunno. After getting back to Millenia city I go to the hospital thinking I'm going to ♥♥♥♥ some ♥♥♥♥ up. No, I'm seeing Jenny. "Oh thank godd your here Metal Man, if that blast was an inch closer it would've killed me." ♥♥♥♥. I dropped the ball here, I though I killed the ♥♥♥♥♥, but I ♥♥♥♥ed up in killing her. I then tell her it's Victon and she's like, "okay ♥♥♥♥♥♥." Then she says we're even...? I let my girlfriend go into a coma because I wasn't there to protect her because you wanted to investigate some sneaky ♥♥♥♥ and then you try to help me when I didn't want you to and you get your ♥♥♥ handed to you? Then I save your life, and you did what exactly, came at the right time when I could handle myself and just beat some simple guys for me and you called that even... ♥♥♥♥ you. No seriously ♥♥♥♥ Jenny I'm fed up with her ♥♥♥♥. Jury comes and says I'm right about Victon and then I recruit him. Let's cut to the chase. I have an army and I've broken into the devoid I break out the Millenial group and that one guy that put my girlfriend in a coma, then I re-capture all of the prisoners. I do some cool ♥♥♥♥, I save my parents from getting de-powered, my girlfriend Black Magic shows up and I tell her to do some ♥♥♥♥. I then team up with every enemy I've ever made and they join my side (Except Rebllion and Victon.) I walk up and Jury an his mom dry hump while I confront Victon. Victon shoots at me but Prodigal takes the shot because she showed up just in time. I try to heal her but she's ♥♥♥♥ed so I take her blood sample and it's a 100% chance she's Victon's daughter. I punch Victon in the face, not killing him. The war is over and I get my reward I look over my options and then I see something, despicable. The Millenial Group Leader is not an option... what the ♥♥♥♥! After everything I've done for them! My relationship with Black Magic is 100% and she's a member, I've always chosen their side and I beat their leader twice. I'm the strongest infi powered in the world and what the ♥♥♥♥ do I get? Fringe guy, and sponsored hero. What the ♥♥♥♥! I changed history itself I bend physics I beat your leader, I stand by you through thick and thin, and I lead you in an army and you don't think I'm good enough to be your leader? Is one of my stats not high enough? ♥♥♥♥ stats  want my choices to matter I want to be their leader I want to be the one that in the end you give me a ♥♥♥♥ing reward not some "you got your parents back who said one word each throughout the entire game, hurray?" No ♥♥♥♥ you Hero's Rise I'm ♥♥♥♥ing done with you thank god your trilogy is over and I don't have to be dissaointed with your ending again, ♥♥♥♥ you. I still reccomend my ♥♥♥ off you buy the entire trilogy. But it's just this one is just so dissa♥♥♥♥ingpointing. I'm a swear-aholic I know. But this game deserved it's ♥♥♥ to be put on the cross for its ending, thank god it's all over. Wait, what did you say? There's some sort of sequel to the trilogy, so like a second trilogy? ♥♥♥♥ me, I have to play it and review it, Digital out.","November 24, 2015","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For a game that essentially amounts to a superpowered revolution against the President of the United States, there is absolutely no 'bite' to the piece. The writing does not improve, 'slugger' continues to be used, and all the criticisms from the previous titles are very much still apparent. You get railroaded from plot point to plot point and then it, mercifully, ends.\n\nThe worst part about it, though, is that this game has so many positive reviews, presumably because the game is nothing more than shallow wish fulfillment that (briefly and with the subtlety of a sledgehammer) mentions LGBT characters.","February 8","false","1.9"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

I waited to see if the author would change some parts in HeroFall, particularly regarding the Prodigal route before expressing an opinion, but since there won't be any change according to the guide posted on Facebook, I definitely can't recommend this trilogy.\n\nThe first opus may have a good balance between imposed choices and player choices (mainly thanks to some updates), things turn differently in the second opus. HeroProject makes the character of the player more spectator than actor of her own choices. Even if there's some improvement in terms of choices in HeroFall, the game leans more toward linearity, all of which can cause more frustration than fun for the player.\n\nIn addition to all this, clearly, some characters in the story receive preferential treatment compared to others, for example, Black Magic. Those who have played the game will understand what I mean.\n\nIf you want a linear game then this trilogy is for you. If you want a game with choices, I would advise you to look other games from Choice of games.","July 17, 2014","false","10.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","1"

My favorite part in this third installment, the romantic options and reactions. I’m a sucker for Super Hero love stories in really any medium.\n\nAs I had mentioned, I’m not sure which item affected my read through the most. There were so many big moments in this adventure that I pushed on out of rage and confusion. There was a time at which I was ready to turn as evil as possible; killing anyone in my path on my way to my answers as fast as possible.

The Writing is awesome, Storyline is one of a kind, and All the characters in the Three games all are unique. The Game is played via a Choose your option kind of way, where you choose how you want your character to act, or fight. For me, my Hero was Lawless he did what needed to be done and was not afraid of breaking the Law, and was very Violent, this lawless character changed how the game was played and how each character saw my Hero.\n\nThe game is very fun, I would reccomend this game to anyone who loved Super heros or Choices in games.","September 3, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's definitely the best out of the 3 games in the series. Thankfully the god awful alliance mechanic is gone and you don't have to worry about being 100% lone wolf or some bull crap like that and can experience the story much more organically. In it's place a much better mechanic is introduced- balancing regaining your powers and keeping your health up. The plot this time around is also much more exciting. Your characters are constantly on the run, keeping things exciting. There are some nice twists and turns along the way and I have to mention that I was actually genuinely impressed by one of the character of Prodigal. The game actually tries to experiment a little bit with the story telling with her character. Even though she is an ex villain she gets a chance at redemption and the player gets a chance to work alongside her and even romance her in a really adorable scene with very bitter consequences. Personally I'd love to see more of experimental things like that in the future, since I hardly think any Bioware game will ever allow you to form any sort of bond with the main antagonist, it's up to indie studios like Choice of games to play around with stuff like that.\nOver all I'd recommend all 3 games. They are all on the short side but for that price they are just right. They are like little pocket rpgs that you can easily digest and forget, leaving knowing you had fun.Quick, cheep and fun. Like bargain bin drugs.","February 23, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This instalment finally feels like an actual superhero story from the comics, a rollicking good Big Summer Crossover Event exploring the setting's ideas, advancing storylines, and setting up new ideas for further comics, etc, where The Hero Project was clunky and The Prodigy spent too much time filling in a science-fictional world in which to place its superheroes.\n\nHowever, it's still the only Choice Of Games product I've yet played which keeps putting the game mechanics in the text. And that's clunky as all get out.\n\nA middle act that stripped out the reality show aspect of THP while doing the same conflict with the InfraOrder and the Meek, strip out the more obvious gamist intrusions and, if the game proved too hard for people to continue on without those in-text hints, some recalibration - I mean, transferring your health to beef up your power reserves as a character option ahead of combats? What? Utterly out of genre and out of narrative - and I'd be praising this series.
