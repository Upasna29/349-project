"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/recommended/235460/","nomedemon","[AReV]Nomed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/","1050 products in account","Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a collaborative effort between Platinum Games and Hideo Kojima.\n\nWhat we’re left with is an extremely fast-paced hack and slash title set in the Metal Gear universe. Solid Snake fans will immediately be disappointed as you once again play as the ninja cyborg; Raiden.\n\nThe highlights of the game are the fast-paced combat, the stunning visuals, and the ridiculous boss fights. MGSRR does a great job with their combat system which is designed to keep you on the offensive while you chain together parries and attacks without the over-reliance on dodging.\n\nThe game also adds a “slice anywhere” mechanic which allows you to cut wherever you aim. This essentially allows you to cut enemies and objects in the environment into a million pieces. This really doesn’t add anything significant to the gameplay but it’s still quite a bit of fun.\n\nThe graphics, visuals, and environments are great. It’s a treat to watch the explosions and chaos unfold around you as you move from one varied area to the next. Unfortunately, the game is fairly linear and doesn’t allow for much room for exploration as you’re constantly hit with frustrating blue boundaries.\n\nThe game features an over the top story with plenty of humor mixed in. It’s entertaining but don’t expect the same level of depth as other Metal Gear Games.\n\nThe inclusion of VR missions, where you have to complete simple objectives in a virtual reality training program add a bit more content. The main game is very short however, clocking in at around 5 hours. Granted it’s a fun-filled 5 hours as the game features some of the best boss fights on the market.\n\nA few extra things to note:\nA controller is recommended for the game.\nThis is a console port. It does look better on the PC than the Xbox 360 and PS3 but it is capped at 1920 x 1080 resolution. This means if you're using a 2560 x 1440 resolution monitor, you won't be able to run it at that resolution, you'll have to downscale to 1080p.\n\nFor a more in-depth review, here’s a video I made:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=214546187\n\nPros:\nAmazing gameplay\nStunning Visuals\nFantastic Boss Fights\nCan cut things up into a million pieces\n\nCons:\nShort Length and a lack of content in general\nLinear with a lack of exploration\nStory isn't up to par with other Metal Gear games.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","January 9, 2014","true","11.9"," 1,100 of 1,291 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","100","1","0","55"

This stupid and pathetic type of reviews are killing me. If you can't write a few decent sentences about a game - why bother ? But enough about it, let's talk about the game.\n\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance is the hack-and-slash spinoff of the Metal Gear series, and a damn good one. Absolutely no Metal Gear knowledge or experience is required. You get to play as Raiden - a half-human, half-cyborg ninja through a 10-15 hour single-player campaign. After completing it you also get two bonus mini campaigns where you can play as Jetstream Sam & Blade Wolf, each of them having their own features. But that's not all. There are also a lot of VR missions to unlock in the main story as well as in the secondary ones, which you can play later at any time.\n\nMGR:R has a good story accompanied by a great soundtrack. Although not exactly my type of music (metal rock), it fits entirely the game's atmosphere. The game is locked at 60 fps, but that's fine with me. It has a great art design and good visuals. Still, the best part is the combat and the gameplay itself. There are some stealth features available which were imported from the Metal Gear series, like barrels and boxes you can use to hide from enemies or sneak through undetected, but don't get fooled by that, this is not a stealth game by far, on the contrary - it's a "go on rampage" type.  There are many different types of enemies, and you can cut each one of them in as many pieces as you want and also finish them with some nice looking finishing moves, including stealing the life source from their cyborg equipments. MGR: Revengeance is also very rewarding. There is a in-game currency which you can earn and use it to unlock new skills, well designed weapons which can also be improved, as well as extending your health and energy bar, and acquiring new costumes for your character, including my favourite - the Mariachi one. For some reason, slaughtering cyborgs wearing a Sombrero felt a lot better ^_^ Btw, I almost forgot to mention the amazing boss fights. I won't describe anything about it so i don't have to include any spoilers, but they are quite memorable. You'll see that for yourself.\n\nI recommend Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance without any doubt, and i assure you it is worth every penny from its full price. If you're into hack-and-slash or fast-paced games - this would be one of the best choices you could make.","November 25, 2014","true","40.9"," 515 of 597 people (86%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","86","515","597","30","24"

If you count yourself among these people, then try to forget what you know about Metal Gear. This game stands alongside other games in the franchise, but it is worlds apart in gameplay and tone. Metal Gear Solid games are primarily about stealth and story. Revengeance is about action, plain and simple.\n\nThe gameplay is phenomenal. Platinum has a gift with the Hack N' Slash genre and it shows with Rising. The combat is fluid and challenging while still being fun and accessible. The parry mechanic feature heavily in the game and while it may take some time to master for some, it's incredibly satisfying when you pull off a perfect parry and counter-attack an enemy for extra damage. There are certain fights that require you to have a decent handle of the move as well, and if you don't the game will help you out by beating it into you.\n\nWhat's truly revolutionary is the parry/dodge mechanic in the game. Rather than having a dedicated block button, Revengeance makes it a forward+attack input, which maintains offensive momentum. You need to parry every attack coming at you, but the game's window is generous, allowing for a lot of wiggle room until you nail down your timing. And once you nail down that timing? You get perfect parries with counterattacks that lead into Zandatsu (slowdown cutting mechanic where you can steal energy cores).\n\nEven if you don't get the combat, or you're an action game novice, the game features a number of different difficulty levels to tailor the experience to what is most comfortable for you as a player.\n\nThe story is filled with its own levels of abrudity, but features a memorable cast and set of bosses. The bosses... Oh, the bosses. They're some of the best of this entire generation- meticulously crafted and exhilarating to fight.\n\nThis game is seriously good, one of the best I've played. If you're a Metal Gear fan (who isn't busy whining that Snake isn't playable), a hack and slash fan, or someone who just likes fun, check this out. You won't be disappointed.","January 14, 2014","true","21.2"," 368 of 428 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","368","428","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/recommended/235460/","kenuty","Kenuty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/","1340 products in account","A fast action game with solid game play music and decent story with the metal gear charm where stealth isn't the dominant game play but will be required at higher-level difficulties. This is a side story game where you play as the bad ♥♥♥ ninja Raiden, After a short intro on the execution of a country's minister by Desperado, you'll be taken forward in time to the point where Raiden will go after the armed coup that Desperatdo started to find out what is going on and what the private service companies are up to.\nThe Gameplay is pure action, Slicing, cutting, ripping, and cutting things your way, There will be side weapons you'll earn as you defeat bosses in the game with precise cuts with the  katana. the game play slashing and slicing don't as just one-button presses, depending on where you aim and how you slice you can chop your enemies up to pieces. You'll want to chop their hands and certain places to take their spine so you can take it in as health when you need it and of course when this happens, free form blade mode time slows down enough for you to aim at your enemies on those precision cuts. Later in the game, you'll be able to do ripper mode where you'll go into overdrive. Sub weapons and extra items you can carry and use in this game, which are literally almost useless at times except for specific enemies and at higher end play.\n\nThe control for this game is better off played with a controller over a mouse and keyboard which was much easier personally to  me for this type of game, though that is a preference, there will be intense fights where the key is to actually be on point for the attacks otherwise you're going to get yourself killed.\nThe soundtrack is absolutely rocking in this game, the music is big time adrenaline pumping, and you'll love it along with the funny voice overs. Ah yes the famous metal gear voice overs. Basically if you don't know what I am talking about you been missing out. It is hilariously bad at times but still well done for being bad, and that's what makes the game great.\nOnce you beat multiple hard modes, there is an even harder mode where you are required to sneak and kill your enemies and to challenge your skills to the limit, don't believe that the stealth is the best part of this game though and only at the highest level difficulty will you be forced to use it.\n\n+ The unique system of cutting your enemies up, and things around you\n+ Rockin soundtracks during battles and game play\n+ Good variety of weapons that will be unlocked as you defeat bosses.\n+ funny comedic moments\n+ all the boss fight was intense and purely epic, especially the last boss\n+ You slice lots of things to pieces, just not the watermelon\n+ the way the battle is done is fluid, really fast paced action and the game play is smooth.\n+ love the fps and the graphics upgrade as much as we got out of it, game runs super smooth\n+ game is plain fun, FUN!\n+ raiden is bad ♥♥♥ and you'll feel immersed enough that YOU are the bad ♥♥♥\n\n+- its a spin off and it isn't a regular metal gear game, fans looking for solid sneaking game will be really disappointed.\n\n- The sub item isn't that useful at times, only for certain enemies.\n- Things do disappear as you slice them\n- The extra item you get is meh\n- The stealth isn't metal gear quality\n- Short game five hours long, you can, however, replay it on a harder difficulty, otherwise no online play or any other replayability factor, maybe some achievements.\n- The map is straightforward. This is a linear action game with short side quest to do and hidden items to find.\n- If only it was made on the PC graphics would have been crazy, but it is a port and improved one at that\n- took a year to come out on pc man but the price is reasonable and with all dlc +++\n- lol the voice acting is if you like it or hate it, it was done the way it is done.\n\nI hope there is a sequel, and I hope they improve on adding more to it to make it unique, trust platinum games when it comes to making action game, this was a collaborative effort, and it was done well, if you played their games before you enjoy it, hardcore mgs fans who want to indulge in the mgs universe will either like or hate this, and those who crave action games will love this game, worth the purchase and also my gotm (game of the month) at the time when it came out.\n\n* Follow the Gamer Race Curator*\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/strmgrp#curation","July 18, 2014","true","6.8"," 225 of 257 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","225","257","0","24"

It is a third person action hack and slash game with some epic boss battles. You play as Raiden who is a cyborg ninja/human hybrid. The story begins with Raiden working security detail for the president of an African country, they are attacked by the Desperado (A private military company) and their leader Sundowner kills the president N’mani. You fight numerous bosses. I will avoid spoilers by giving the details of the story here.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance are pretty good. It doesn’t have the best looking textures but you won’t notice them unless you go really slow. The game is supposed to be played fast and you’re constantly fighting enemies to notice the texture anyways. Game seems to be locked at 60 fps so I wish it went higher. The game is optimized pretty well as I never dipped below 50 in fps throughout the game, even when a lot was going on screen, it ran very smooth. The game features one of the best looking cinematic cut scenes, I don’t usually take many screenshots in games but this game had me take over 600 screenshots throughout the gameplay. Though the cut scenes are locked at 30 fps for some reason, they’re nothing too annoying but it is definitely noticeable.\n\nThere’s the usual options in this game like texture filtering, antialiasing, shadow quality, motion blur etc.   Graphics menu image can be seen below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685560067\n\nSound:\n\nThis game features an epic sound track. The voice acting is pretty solid. The game features a fast paced heavy metal/rock soundtrack. Even though I am not a fan of this genre of music I thoroughly enjoyed the music. Basically the music really pumps you up, especially during boss battles, you have that high rush and energy going on with this sort of music.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay of this game is amazing and one of the best hack and slash gameplay I’ve ever played. Raiden has a basic blade which he uses to slice up enemies, later down the game you gain additional weapons and even a new blade near the end of the game. Raiden can use light and heavy attacks by left and right clicking respectively. You can create a lot of combos using these attack combinations and even unlock new moves with the in-game currency. There’s a Parry move which can be used to block almost every attack in the game (though some attacks will still hurt Raiden, like the last boss battle’s MG Excelsus form). You have to hit the direction of the enemy and your light attack button at the same time to be able to successfully a parry an enemy attack. When an enemy attacks you they’ll have a red light go off in their eyes and this is your chance to parry. A good practice in parrying is your key to beating this game otherwise some of the bosses will have you raging. Successful parrying of an attack will block the enemies’ attack and an electric current can be seen as visual confirmation of a successful parry.  When you’ve nearly killed an enemy you can also go into blade mode and try to hit the red box which prompts up on the enemy, upon successful hit on the box Raiden will rip out the enemy’s heart out and crush it with his bare hands, this will refill both his fuel cell energy bar and health bar. When you’ve almost killed an enemy you may also get a prompt in Japanese to attack in blade mode or a series of quick time event moves. A lot of boss battles will also make use of the QTE’s.\n\nWhen you fight enemies you gain battle points which can later be spent on new weapons, health and fuel cell upgrades and new moves. New suits can also be bought some of which have different feature such as one of the suits can have Raiden carry more grenades etc. Later down the line Raiden gains “Jack the Ripper” mode which can be activated using the R key. When you’re in ripper mode Raiden will start to glow red and his attacks do much more damage and you can easily kill of even the super cyborg mechs with a few hits. There’s also a Nano paste pickup which basically an add-on which refills your health once the whole bar depletes. Having a few of these before boss battles can also be very handy. Raiden’s health upgrades can go up to 150% and the fuel cell upgrades can add four small additional mini bars.\n\nThe weapons/recovery menu could’ve used an upgrade as it’s kind of limited. Every time you want to change a weapon you must go through this weapon menu. This is not too troublesome for the health or main weapon but can be annoying if you switch your sub weapons a lot. Even though PC’s have enough buttons to assign every weapon their own button they still decided to use this dumbed down console version of the menu which is quite painful to use. Menu as seen below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685560115\n\nRaiden has plenty of abilities such as ninja run which is Raiden running super-fast with his sword out and he blocks bullets with his blade. Basically when someone shoots with guns you can use this to avoid getting hurt. Ninja run will also have Raiden auto jump over obstacles. You can also use this to harass enemies by moving in getting a few hits and then moving away though this method is not as effective as most of the enemies have a lot of HP and can take a long time to kill. There’s a sort of a dodge ability, when you press Z key, Raiden will attack enemy and sort of jump back, it’s not that useful, I mostly used parry throughout the game and found that to be much better. In addition to that Raiden has what is called a blade mode. It basically slows down the game and you can cut up an enemy into many pieces and you can accurately cut up the enemy or objects. When you are in blade mode you can adjust the angle of your blade and make horizontal, vertical or diagonal strikes and at the end of blade mode the enemy/object will be cut exactly in normal time as well. A short gameplay featuring combat, parrying and Ripper mode as well as blade mode can be found below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685565658\n\nEvery level has you follow a linear path and a bunch of enemies to kill. Leading up to a boss battle. There’s many types of enemies including military guys with guns and rocket launchers, ninjas with blades, heavy armed cyborgs, even cyborg hounds etc. You can hide in cardboard boxes, metal barrels just like other Metal gear games, which can be hilarious. When enemies detect you, you’ll hear the ah-so-familiar exclamation mark sound from other Metal gear games. You can also get stealth kills and do most missions via stealth as well by sneaking behind enemy and pressing F when the prompt comes up.\n\nI played on normal mode, game is not that difficult, though, the last boss can be pretty hard to beat and frustrating, others were not so hard.  The game doesn’t require too much time to beat, you can easily beat the game in less than 8 hours of gameplay in normal mode. VR modes unlocks are hidden throughout the levels and must be activated to unlocked in order to play.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nSound: 9/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nOverall: 9/10\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game is extremely fun and if you’re a Kojima fan or even a fan of action/hack and slash games, you’ll love this game. Awesome soundtrack which will keep you pumped up during intense boss battles, some of which can last up to 10 minutes. Make your way by slicing up everything that moves or go the stealth way and try to eliminate one enemy at a time. The game features awesome cinematics and an interesting story which will keep you hooked and plenty of Kojima humor. I’ll 100% recommend this game. I really hope more PlatinumGames’ games make it to the PC.","May 16","true","14.6"," 115 of 118 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","115","118","4","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deathcomesrippin/recommended/235460/","Deathcomesrippin","♆Major✠Dirtymcnasty❝.❛","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deathcomesrippin/","181 products in account","In the first installment of the "Rising" series of the Metal Gear franchise, cyborg super-soldier Raiden is dispatched on a mission against a private military company held responsible for acts of terrorism. The truth happens to be more than that in the end.\n\nThe famous (or infamous) spin-off from the original Metal Gear Solid series, Revengeance brings a gameplay shift from the usual stealth third person shooter into an action-packed hack-and-slash sword fighting game. With Raiden's main weapon being the high-frequency blade, the player is put to engage several enemies that vary from regular sword-fighters, to rocket-launching cyborg soldiers, to huge assault mechs.\n\nGameplay\n\nAs mentioned above, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance has mainly action gameplay. Implementing the occasional use of one of its main game mechanics, the "Zandatsu" (lit. 'cut and take'), used to slice off foes and extract energy units to replenish your own. Stealth is present in the game, as you can sneak past or stealth-kill a number of enemies, but at little quantity given the action genre of the game.\n\nSided with Zandatsu comes the parrying game mechanic, which will give you an extra edge (no pun intended) on combat given its often prompt to deal finishing Zandatsu attacks upon a 'perfect' parry. It's also the only method of defense that doesn't involve dodging in the game, making it your incentive to master it.\n(Note: it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED you have a controller of some sort to play this game, as mouse and keyboard gameplay is extremely complicated.)\n\nCombat in the game feels pressing and complicated at higher difficulty levels, giving an extra challenge on levels Hard and above. In addition, there is the presence of some quick-time events, as well as boss fights of the game which usually feel absolutely riveting, from fast-paced cyborg vs. cyborg combat to slicing off pieces of humongous mechs.\n\nThe only down side is an arena-style limited area during fights.\n\nPlot\n\nThe story begins in a recently-enforced African country, introducing Raiden as now a member of private military corporation 'Maverick Security Consulting Inc.'. During a guard duty task, President N'mani is hijacked and killed by military contractors of Desperado Enforcement LLC. Months later, Raiden is deployed in tasks to investigate terrorist activities found out to be backed by Desperado. It happens though, it's more than just power and money at play as Raiden uncovers a bigger scheme.\n\nThe story is over-the-top and characters are -on the least- quirky. Not that it's a bad thing, and it gives the game its distinction from Metal Gear Solid franchise. Just get ready for cyborg ninja fights and explosions.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nLead composer Jamie Christopherson did an amazing job with the soundtrack of Revengeance, both in the less-famous ambient music and in the better-known vocal tracks, perfectly fitting the situations and characters involved in the longest time. It sets the mood and gives the finishing touch of the game, being also one of the highlights of the game.\n\nBugs\n\nLittle if any that I know of or could see.\n\nOverall\n\nAlbeit opinions vary, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance surely does good work in the fighting/action game genre, even if breaking somewhat from the known Metal Gear Solid formula.Revengeance being my first Metal Gear game, in my opinion it's a game worth a play and should be taken in consideration.","April 19, 2015","true","77.8"," 124 of 137 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","124","137","11","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/235460/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","The high octane action, unique combat mechanics and craziness of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance made it one of my favorite games of 2013, so it’s great to see Konami and Platinum Games show some love for the PC platform by bringing Raiden’s latest adventure to Steam. If, for whatever reason, you missed out on this crazy action title for consoles, then you really owe yourself to check out this solid PC port that comes with both DLC campaigns for added bonus.\n\nInstead of stealthy missions that seem to be a part of a huge overall story, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance introduces us to a hack/slash/button-mashing gameplay method in the Metal Gear world, something that you would find in a Tecmo Koei title beginning with Dynasty. Laugh if you want, but that comparison isn’t too far off from the truth. You go against a bunch of enemies, slicing/dicing/shooting your way to the next checkpoint. In the Dynasty Warriors series, you do the same, though on a greater scale (and the DW games become bit lost at times because the story gets detached from the insane amount of action). So, is this comparison a bad thing? Not at all, but if you go into Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance looking for a typical MGS game that you’re used to seeing then you’re going to be disappointed a bit.\n\nLet’s kick off with the meat of the game – the combat. Platinum Games has given Revengeance a very distinctive mechanic that is based around Raiden’s use a katana. For starters, there is no dedicated block button. Instead, you have to master the art of parrying attacks – a fundamental and highly required move that you HAVE to use to become good at the game – and this is all about precise timing. Parry too late and Raiden will get pushed back from the enemy, parry a little late or a bit early and Raiden will simply block the attack, but parry perfectly and Raiden will automatically counter with a blade swipe, which you can then follow on with a combo. To activate a parry, you need to press light attack and a direction at the same time. Do this correctly within an allocated time window and Raiden puts up his sword and holds a stance. It is intuitive and clever to stick the mechanic on the same button as attack, because you can simply cancel your move into a parry when you see the enemy about to bust out a move while you are hacking away. Revengeance does its best to keep you on your toes, making you defend, so that you can go on the offensive, and that makes the game feel like it is relentlessly pushing action your way throughout the duration of the campaign. Another refreshing inclusion is Zandatsu, which in Japanese translates to “cut and take.” Initiating Blade Mode when having enough energy zooms the camera behind Raiden’s shoulder and enables him to slice and dice his opponent into chucks of flesh and metal during slow motion, then rip out that enemy’s blue, glowing electric spinal cord of energy and smash it, which transfers into a full bar of health and energy for Raiden. There’s a ton of fun to be had by dismembering people, and the game even throws optional tasks at the player, such as dissecting a left arm of a soldier so that you can open a locked security door. Playing the game on medium difficulty does not show the effectiveness that ripping out these robotic cords has, so you may find yourself not bothering after the initial fun wears off, but stick the difficulty up and you will find that the constant refill of health and energy is a godsend when Raiden often dies in a few hits. The Zandatsu is a sneaky, if brilliant, way to keep the action going without stopping for the use of items. Speaking of items, sub weapons are included, such as heat seeking rockets, but most of them are so anticlimactic compared to using the sword that they just aren’t worth using.\n\nBoss battles provide a different challenge to the steady fodder populating most levels. Defeating one of these colourful characters usually boils down to working out which attacks to avoid, which to counter and when to strike - but neat touches abound. One boss, for example, has an explosive shield, requiring you to counter him and carve the shield up with precise sword strokes before he becomes vulnerable. Revengeance remains challenging without being frustrating throughout its play-time, with harder difficulties and a score-chasing aspect to the game offering opportunity to those who want to seek mastery over the combat.\n\nRevengeance feels a little bit like what it is – a game made by two different studios, both doing the thing they're most well known for. Platinum Games give us systems and fights to test and challenge our reflexes, the occasional annoying QTE and some of the most spectacular action set-pieces you're likely to see on PC. Kojima Productions give us a storyline and cut-scenes that provide action thrills, yet are let down by an examination of the world's ills, simplifying complex moral matters into black and white (apart from one character, who manages to retain an air of mystery and ambiguity). The two aspects of the game occasionally butt heads, with certain characters advising a stealthy approach - utilising the Metal Gear franchise's signature cardboard box. The problem with this approach is that during each chapter you're graded for your combat prowess and stealthily avoiding encounters is likely to net you a far lower score. It's a case of the storyline and the mechanics being at cross-purpose, pulling the player toward different goals (although I'm sure Kojima would try to claim it's intentional).\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","June 5, 2015","true","51.2"," 98 of 105 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","98","105","5","1"

According to my system, a 5 is completely in the middle, not like IGN and Gamespot's stupidity, where a 5 is a disaster.\n------------\nVisuals 7.5/10 [Graphics - 7 | Artstyle - 8]\n\nSlightly muddy texture work, outstanding animations, brilliant character designs and a slightly drab color palette. The game looks good, and sometimes amazing when the action really picks up, it is Platinum after all. Props for the smooth 60 FPS throughout the whole game, wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nGameplay 9/10\n\nPar for the course for Platinum games, high-speed character action that requires a good deal from the player. Precise animations helped by a good combat depth. Raiden's chief trick is parrying, executed by launching an attack in the direction of an enemy, you'd be surprised at what you can parry in this game (nearly everything).\nGood diverse enemy design and higher difficulties remix enemy placements, which is always a nice touch, even more points for an unlockable difficulty.\nWhile we're on the topic of unlockables, this is a Platinum game, so expect costumes, concept art and many other goodies which will certainly wet the appetite of the completionists among you.\nMy only gripe with the gameplay would have to be the subweapon system. It's slow and clunky and I feel that it could have been all but done away with, in favor of more combat inputs, but the game was slightly rushed, so I won't hold it against it.\nThere is a light sprinkling of QTEs, but they are far from intrusive and they do help with the hype in certain moments.\n\nSound 10/10 [Music - 10 | Voice Acting - 10]\n\nOver the top voice acting that fleshes out over the top characters, great performances by all involved and especially main man Quinton Flynn (Raiden), his rival Philip Anthony-Rodriguez (Sam) and fan favorite Alastair Duncan (Armstrong).\nNo review of MGR is complete without touching on the music. It's amazing. High-speed techno-metal which brilliantly syncs up to the pace of the action on screen. The boss themes deserve special mention, at the start of a bossfight, an instrumental prelude plays, once you reach a specific point on the boss's healthbar, the lyrics start. At this point there should only be a little blood in the adrenaline pumping through your body, not to mention that the lyrics are catchy and memorable. Certainly one of the soundtracks that can be listened to on it's own, but certainly enhances the game in an amazing way, that I wish more devs would utilize.\n\nStory 8.5/10 [Story - 8 | Writing - 9]\nRising takes place at the current end of the Metal Gear continuity, taking place after the events of MGS4: Guns of the Patriots. It's story deals with the exploits of fan "favorite" Raiden after he's once again taken up his sword in the name of justice and protecting those who can't protect themselves.\nThe story is divorced from the thick exposition of the Kojima directed games and introduces us to a new, if slightly shallow, but nonetheless interesting cast that exist to facilitate the narrative and give us several people to care for. The antagonists are all colorful and rich in character, just like you'd expect from a Metal Gear game, but their absurdity has been taken to 11, abandoning most pretenses of seriousness in favor of an over-the-over-the-top style of theatrics.

Vanquish is my favorite PG game of all-time.  Even though I did not like Bayonetta very much, I loved Vanquish, and the feeling is mutual with Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.\n\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance is an action game at its core, and it should not be mistaken for a straight-up Metal Gear Solid game.  Hence, the "Solid" word is not even in the title.\n\nWhat Metal Gear Rising does right is good, action combat.  While it may not have the insane and meticulous combo options as Bayonetta, it does enough in the combat department to warrant some good action.\n\nThe visuals are spot on for what a 1080p-ported video game would look like on the PC.  There are just enough graphics options there.  The max resolution is 1080p.  It is quite a feat for Japanese developers in general to get a deecent-to-good port.  I'll take it.\n\nMy only quam with MGS:R is the awkward camera and field of view.  Now, before anyone thinks that it is fine for a game of this genre and nature, I would like to step in the argument and disagree.  There are video games like Ninja Gaiden that has a good field of view, the developers designed the game to zoom out a certain distance to give the player a good view of the third-person action that is happening during gameplay.  Platinum Games dropped the ball here.  Since it is not a claustrophobic video game like Dead Space, there is really no reason to make the field of view and camera zoom set to this restricted setting.\n\nMGS:R is best played with a controller so I hope you have a controller.\n\nThe story is somewhat cheesy, but I feel like the Metal Gear Solid series was also cheesy to a certain extent.  It is good cheese though.  It's suitable for this type of game.\n\nRaiden's voice is rather annoying.  He sounds like a whimp.  Thank goodness he kicks ♥♥♥ in the game.\n\nWhat else can I say?  Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a solid effort from Platinum Games.  While it may not match the quality of gameplay as Vanquish and Bayonetta, it is a solid entry for the Metal Gear (Solid) franchise.\n\n\nRating:  8.5 out of 10.","October 3, 2014","true","7.2"," 92 of 112 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","92","112","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Underdrill/recommended/235460/","Underdrill","Underdrill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Underdrill/","248 products in account","Metal Gear Rising Revengeance is an amazing game. My game of the year 2014. Let me explain why.\n\nI have not played a Metal Gear game before, but I jumped on this because I have heard of the acclaim this series has gotten. This may be a spin off of the main series, but it has convinced me enough that I made the right choice in purchasing.\n\nThe story is a bit throwaway, but interesting. Hell, I don't care much for it. This game is all about the gameplay. It is a spectacle fighter where you play is Raiden who, to put it quite simply, is a badass. He can slice people in half and into tiny little pieces with the 'Zandatsu' mode aka Blade Mode. This, when used correctly, can slow down time to cut parts of enemies off and even them into half if they are weakened enough. You can also rip out their spine and regain all of your health and blade mode meter. This may seem overpowerd, but it is quite the opposite.\n\nThis game is hard. Really hard, even on Normal (Which I recommend you start with). There are also 3 difficulties above it. Yeah. It gets really intense and requires a lot of skill. You will need to parry foes by attacking in the same direction as them and dodge them by unlocking a skill known as 'Defensive Offensive' and using at the perfect timings. If you are skilled enough, you can perfect parry your opponents to do serious damage. On the hardest difficulty, Revengeance, this is required. Every single enemy on that difficulty will take serious damage from it or get sliced into pieces. I found revengeance to be a nice change of pace. I even found it easier, but maybe it is because I got real good at it.\n\nThe boss fights are one of the best parts of the game. They are all extremely hard and they even have a no damage achievement to go with it. Prepare to spend hours and hours trying to beat them, but having that proper satisfaction and success when you finally memorize their movements and parrying their every move.\n\nThe game has an upgrade system where you can unlock skins, new weapons and upgrades for them. There is quite a lot of stuff to upgrade, and some of them are tied to the many collectibles, which are quite well hidden. You can get the currency, BP, by ripping out the spine of your foes, by completing battles or finding consumables. These consumables consist of one time use items, like Grenades, RPG's and Stealth items. This game has a very simple stealth system (Approach enemy from behind/above. press button) but going head first into fights is where this game is at it's best.\n\nAll of the DLC is included. This includes extra skins, weapons, 2 bonus campaigns and VR Missions, which is basically the games challenge mode. There are 20 of these missions in the base game and 30 in the dlc. They are all really hard and sometimes frustrating, but it is always satisfying to finally completing a hard challenge. Some of the DLC ones also offer a different type of gameplay. There is a very obvious nod to a sidescroller in one of them.\n\nThe bonus campaings are really good as well. They offer a different playable character, more collectables and more challenging fights. Jetstream Sam is a much heavier fighter, while Blade Wolf is more stealth focused. They both offer a change of pace and more replay value, which the base game has a lot of.\n\nOne final thing I should mention. The Music. It is f*cking amazing. Not only do they sound brilliant, the lyrics have a meaning to the boss fights, which is where most of them are found. It has, hands down, one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.\n\nFinal Verdict: 10/10. Buy it now. £4, £10, £20, it is all worth your hard earned money. I really hope a sequel is made, as the game was quite short, but it offers a extreme amount of replay value.","December 18, 2014","true","77.4"," 56 of 63 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","56","63","2","0"

How does it compare to Platnium's past works?\n\nPros:Visceral and Fun Combat!\nA good scoring system that incentivizes good performance in the game’s levels.\nCampy but sometimes ridiculous plot!\nAbsolutely killer soundtrack.\nFairly decent port.\nNitpicks:The DLC included in the full game are either cheat items or half-♥♥♥♥♥ bonus missions. Disappointing, to say the least.\nVR Missions aren’t fun to play.\nCons:Strange Game Design flaws such as a awkward camera and the lack of projectiles can hurt the experience.\nCinematic cutscenes look incredibly janky due to being 30fps pre-rendered cutscenes.\nThe Review\nMetal Gear Rising surprisingly takes place after the events of MGS4, where instead of stealthing your way through problems, you’ll be hacking and slashing almost everything as Raiden. So what does Platinum bring to the table?\n\nOf course, as always seen in Platinum Games, highly visceral combat completely steals the show. Platinum’s trademark brawling combat is visibly present in the game, but it takes a lesser focus on combos in favor of the game’s “Blade Mode”, which allows you to (when the enemy is stunned) hack and slash at enemies in almost any angle. So while you can still slash your enemies with simple X/Y button combos, you’ll be performing much better if you take advantage of your normal attacks to than attack vulnerable enemies with precision. As a result, your normal sword slashes definitely won’t feel as powerful as you’d want them to be, but that’s OK because those weak attacks will open up to insane finishers that really drive up the action of the game. It’s a good system that encourages and rewards players to play as best as possible as they can in every single combat scenario, as getting high ranks/slashing certain body parts will net you bonus BP currency needed for lots of upgrades.\n\nHowever, while the gameplay itself is really well-done, it suffers from some glaring design flaws. The game includes light stealth in it, which seems to be incredibly basic and somewhat tacked-on. The camera is a bit finicky due to it constantly automating Raiden’s backside, and the game throws tons of high elevated/flying enemies at you with a character that’s moveset mostly consist of melee attacks, making fights with them frustrating and annoying. But otherwise, Platnium still delivers a fantastic combat system that will definitely encourage players to replay the game for multiple playthroughs.\n\nThe basic plot isn’t as difficult to follow as other MGS games but trying to understand it can be massively disorienting, due to the game’s constant references to real-life events and it’s sometimes weird combination of a gritty or absolutely stupid tone. While it can make the game often have pacing issues, for the most part it’s a surprisingly memorable story with memorable characters and hilarious moments often breaking up the often monotone tone of the game.\n\nThe presentation for the game is good. The game does a fairly decent mix of playable performance and eye-popping visuals, and the overall aesthetic of the game is pretty good. The music is on a completely other level, with a stellar soundtrack filled with epic boss battle music and insanely ridiculous metal rock. It sounds like something that wouldn’t fit in a Metal Gear game but it surprisingly complements the insanity of this game pretty well.\n\n\nThe PC Port for the game marked Platnium’s first PC Release, and was fairly alright. The caps it’s framerate at a constantly smooth 55-60fps and the visual settings for the game are minimal at best. While you can change the keybinds if you’re playing with a keyboard I highly advise playing with a controller.\n\nIn conclusion, Metal Gear Rising is definitely a good romp to play through. Great combat, stellar gameplay mechanics (with some odd design choices mixed in), and a killer soundtrack really nails it in as a very good Metal Gear spinoff.\n\nTL;DR - The well-thought out combat, campy plot and killer soundtrack makes this one of the best MGS spinoffs you can play right now.\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","April 29","true","20.8"," 46 of 49 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","46","49","4","0"

Having missed out on last year’s console release, I went into the game only knowing that it was a brawler based in the Metal Gear Solid mythos. I had no idea what I was getting into. This is a game where cyborg ninjas slice their enemies into slivers with electrified katanas, sometimes with their feet. This is a game where three-armed eyeballs and chainsaw-tailed attack dogs jump from the shadows to tear at you. And if that’s not enough, most of this happens within the first half hour.If you’ve never played a Metal Gear game before, fear not. Revengeance is set within the Metal Gear universe and features a number of callbacks, but, in general, it is flavor for the fare. There is a story, as crazy and shifting and nonsensical as it may be, but newcomers to the series can easily slip right in. Unlike many games, having a crazy, shifting, nonsensical story really doesn’t do Revengeance any disservice. This is a game that revels in its outrageousness. The lunacies of its futurist setting actual serve the gameplay by elevating the possibilities to new heights.The core of Revengeance’s seriously satisfying nature lies in its defensiveness as much as the sheer fun of slicing enemies into dozens of pieces. This is not a game to be button-mashed through. Enemies hit hard and team up, forcing you to dodge and parry. Revengeance has the great quality of allowing you to feel like you are winning against all odds. This trait comes at the frustrating cost of repeated death while learning the intricacies of combat, however.Raiden has a number of moves which can be easily chained together using a mix of heavy and light attacks, as well as a secondary weapon. These can be expanded and upgraded over time, of course, and each blow carries a nice sense of impact.The most unique addition Revengeance brings to the fore is Blade Mode. Once you dispatch enough enemies to charge your fuel cells, Blade Mode can be activated to trigger Zandatsu, a combat technique which slows time and allow you to set the angle of each sword swing. This is important because Zandatsu is the primary way of regaining health. Precise cuts must be made to sever the cybernetic spine of enemies so their power can be absorbed.Using Blade Mode, Revengeance becomes something of a cutting simulator. Raiden can freely chop his environment into little bits, which is separate from the organ-severing Zandatsu.For all of the fun Platinum Games has packed in, Revengeance does have a tendency to degrade into eyeroll-worthy campiness. With the exception of the bulging American, most of the main players are disturbingly beautiful.One of the biggest things where the game gets seriously ridiculous is in the boss fights. These can be epically large in scale or a one on one fight with another cyborg. Either way, they are intense and fun as hell.It may be a somewhat short experience, but there’s no denying the fact that the entire time was full of high adrenaline action. The combat is simple and satisfying, and the presentation is top notch.","December 24, 2014","true","139.8"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","50","57","2","0"

Although there are a few minor glitches (two cutscenes seem to stutter and freeze, weird anti-gravity glitch affecting props), the game is still a ton of fun to play with great replay value and lots of extras such as costumes, two extra campaigns that allow you to play as bosses from the game (Blade Wolf and Jetstream Sam), VR Missions, and achievments for all the completionists out there!\n\nAll in all, it was a rocky start to be sure.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LtCohenG/recommended/235460/","LtCohenG","Sgt.Pepper (⌐■_■)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LtCohenG/","328 products in account","Metal Gear Rising is part of the Metal Gear Saga, albeit not in the form known to most of us. It is not a stealth game, it is a totally silly yet cool action game; Raiden, the "hero" of Metal Gear Solid 2, is back as the main character\n\nThe gameplay is based around cutting and parrying. You have "Weak" attacks and "Strong" attacks, weak attacks are faster and strong attacks are slower, which can leave you quite open; there's parry, the bread and butter of this game, you can use this technique by pressing Forward and Weak Attack at the same time, note: If you parry too early, it wil just block, you need a certain timing to counter. This will take some time to get used to, but stick with it and it will pay off, especially, at higher difficulties like Revengeance. In the Revengeance difficulty, Parry will most likely kill, break all the armor, or do massive damage to enemies. In lower difficulties this is not the case! So keep that in mind.\n\nMoves, weapons, armor, and misc items are unlocked with BP, points you get while playing the game. I'll be honest and say that quite a bunch of the moves will be rarely used, but are not entirely useless. However, you NEED Defensive Offense, this is your dodge move. Like its name says, it is a defense move that does damage! It is available since the first mission, but in my opinion it should be a standard move instead of buyable.\n\nZandatsu is another unique mechanic to this game, it is activated while using Blade Mode. Blade Mode by itself, it allows Raiden to control the direction of his slashes, this however, drains enery, this is where Zandatsu comes! When in Blade Mode, and enemies have no armor (this is important), you will see a square with a red outline, if it is slashed you will get a prompt, this makes Raiden remove the enemies' cyborg energy units, which will heal you AND replenish your energy. Done well, you will never run out of energy!\n\nThis game has a ranked system, which increases replayability, you get certain bonuses if you don't recieve damage, no kills (Cyborgs are the only ones counted as kills, UGs, or rather, robots are not), or stealth (this is really rare though). Certain ranked battles are hidden and are easily missed, those are the blank squares that show up when you finish a mission.\n\nBosses, are easily the hightlight of this game game, they are fun, badass, hard and come with amazing music. I shall say no more, however, you will know when you play it.\n\nBeing a Metal Gear game, it comes with the traditional VR Missions, they are very varied and they WILL take a while to get S rank.\n\nCONS: This game has a rather pitiful camera, so bear with me and stick with it, you will get used to. But certain encounters, due to location, are in rather tight places and it will cause you to rage and wonder why the hell it is like that. TELL ME ABOUT IT! The game is worth your time though. So give it a try, and you might have a really fun time.","September 22, 2014","true","67.3"," 49 of 57 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","49","57","0","1"

So if you liked DMC you will like MGR.\n\nThis game is a pure action game and is nothing like the Metal Gear games which are more stealth oriented games.\n\nYou play as Raiden a cyborg enhanced human soldier who fights for a private military firm. The story is set in the future when private military companies are trying to manipulate politics to suite there hidden agenda.\n\nThe game is non-stop action with high adrenaline music and epic cut scenes that tell the story. The boss fights are also quiet epic and rewarding when you finally win.\nWhen you advance in the game you receive battle points. With these points you can buy upgrades for your weapons and armour, new battle suits and health and new skills. Hidden in the game you can find upgrades for your health, grenades, ...\n\nA unique skill in this game is the ‘Blade Mode’. When the ‘Blade Mode-bar‘ is full you can activate this. It’s a sort of slow motion sequence when you can cut your opponents in slices – it’s impressive and a big part of the game.\n\nThe game is best played with a gamepad. The Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller work flawlessly.\n\nThe game can be quiet difficult and frustrating at times – especially the boss fights against the senator.\n\nAfter you finish the game you can access the included 2 DLC stories. In the first story you play Jetstream Sam and in the second you play Bladewolf. Replay ability come from higher difficulty settings, trying to get better battle scores and finding and finishing the more than 50 VR-mission.\n\nThe bad :\nThe game doesn’t support resolutions higher than 1080p. When you want higher resolutions you need to use a ‘hack-program’. I used Flawless Widescreen to play the game in 2560*1080 – 21/9 aspect ratio – this worked without problems but all cut scenes are letterboxed (with black bars).\nI believe there is a bug in the game with AMD GPU’s when you activate ‘Blur’ in the graphics options menu. With an AMD GPU you get constant stuttering. With ‘Blur’ deactivated you can play the game at maximum settings.\n\nConclusion :\nI recommend this game.","February 13","true","28.9"," 29 of 29 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","29","29","3","0"

When I found out the main character was a cyborg I thought "hang on a minute, if he's a cyborg... That means he can rev AND biff at the same time... Maybe even do a burnout with his phallic member(try this at home)!\n\nAfter playing for a while I encountered a cutscene that made me want to turn gay, or at least embrace my inner homosexual. The player character catches a knife in his elegant high heels while striking a sexy pose and showing off his nice body. On the second playthrough I equipped him in red armour just to see if he looks sexier in red heels\n\nWhen I finally unlocked customization the first thing I looked for was a V12 engine, it was not there. I then looked for twin-turbos, still not there. So I thought, at the very least, we should be able to attach wheels to ourselves so we can do a burnout, isn't that the first thing all cyborgs want to do? No wheels. No burnouts. You can, however, still get extra revs in your engine & better fuel economy, but what good is extra revs if you can't do a burnout..? Well, you still can do a form of burnout; the extra revs allow your mind to just rotate in place at around 9999RPM, spinning with such fierce velocity that it actually causes your brain to do a burnout against the walls of your skull and grind itself into a dense smog.\n\nOnce you purchase the maxed brain burnout upgrade and rev it hard you reach the point where all you can see is Hideo Kojima. Why can you see Hideo Kojima? Because you have just exceeded the boundaries of reality and entered the "Kojimaverse". I would recommend at this stage taking an entire plethora of psychedelic and narcotic substances, as the cutscenes will make much more sense that way, as will the plot and Hideo Kojima's mindset(or lack thereof) while making this game.\n\nAll in all this game is an excellent example of why drugs are bad, and should be bought for your children at a young age to properly indocrinate them against drugs. Those of you whom it is too late for such things will, however, probably enjoy the last piece of your sanity rotating around inside your skull, going up in smoke and slowly drifting away like a fart in the wind, right off into the sunset.\n\nAnd your sanity lived happily ever after.

It takes place in a world where firearms and other contemporary weapons have mostly been rendered obsolete in favor of anime style cyborg ninjas and 50 foot tall mechs. The game was made by Platinum who are famous for the Bayonetta games. And their specific touches combined with the high camp Metal Gear games are known for is very welcome. The gameplay is a very flowy hack and slash and features familiar staples to the Metal Gear series such as VR missions.\n\nSince the game released I've held the opinion Rising is the closest thing to perfectly encapsulating a teenage boy's fantasy. Everything from Raiden's appearance as a fey edgy protagonist, the 90's style anime dub metal that plays during the boss fights, the larger than life dialogue and scenes. It all meshes very well together to create this world you'd fantasize about in between commercial breaks to your favorite anime.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=466242507","June 19, 2015","true","17.4"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","29","32","6","2"

I'm not necessarily reviewing this as a Metal Gear title, because I don't think it performed well within the scope of the franchise, of which I am a long-time fan.\n\n\n\n+ Partially destructable environments\n+ Parrying system is extremely fun, particularly "blade free" attacks\n+ Soundtrack is great for the type of game it is, and is very well-timed; not necessarily the kind of music I would listen to, but it gets you pumped during boss fights, so I consider it a plus\n+ Game was very well-optimized, and looked great at max settings\n+ Character and load-out customization is very fulfilling and practical\n+ Included one of the most hilariously over-the-top final bosses of all time; absolutely ridiculous, but enormously entertaining if you choose not to take it seriously\n\n- Poor mouth animations\n- Lazy storytelling; supporting characters will fill in background info on the game world, telling protagonist things he should already know in great detail (I know this has been done before in previous entries of the series, but in this game it's just SO BAD)\n- Overly campy dialogue\n- Sub-par voice-acting (particularly Raiden's "Jack the Ripper" voice)\n- Supporting characters and antagonists were entirely forgettable\n- Camera didn't follow the action as effectively as the pace of the fighting warranted, and could lead to some unnecessary blunders throughout the game\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, please follow my curator page.

This is my attempt in which I will try to cover the problems this game has without sucking Kojima's asian pee pee too much.\n\nAt first I'd like to state that I am not familiar with the Metal Gear series. I never was a fan and i found the realistic approach behind it far to unappealing. Considering most of the titles were also developed for Non-Nintendo platforms i never had much of an opportunity to get to know these kind of games.\n\nThing i've noticed so far, MGR has as much to do with a regular Metal Gear game as a baseball bats make sense in a hardware store. Yes, they are kind of tools, but the intended use is an entirely different reason at all. You dont need any prior knowledge to enjoy it and the unavoidable brand pandering is keep tolerable low for the most part.\n\nRegarding the controls, you need to be aware that this game is next to unplayable without a game controller. And i should know. I attempted to do it on a keyboard only to learn halfway that you need more than Surgeon Simulator cutting accuracy later on to not get assblasted. Un- and relearning the control scheme while battling a boss was a pain in the ♥♥♥. The fairly incompetent camera movement and derp combat lock-on did not help either.\n\nThe machine I ran this on was 4 years old at the time of the playthrough. Although I could play the game at state-of-the-art console graphics, i can not recommend it on similar or older hardware. There's much stuff in this game happening at the same time and the physics engine can torture your CPU real mean. Lower resolutions were helpful, i barely noticed the lower performance visuals and it still worked fine. For the most part.\n\nTalking gameplay, this game is more or less a browser with inbuilt swordplay and a physics engine. You can cut most things into pieces (with the exception of trash containers, cats and the ground you walk on) while performing moves that would remind one of an adept fighting game. It's also mostly fast paced and benefits fast reactions and accumulating skill. The game has a heavy start, so make a slow approach and take your time to get used to all of it. Don't try to become a perfectionist though, the ratings system is thoroughly ♥♥♥♥ed and after a certain point won't address any advancement whatsoever besides a lightning fast no damage run. That's something you need to consider.\n\nIt feels mostly like a knight game. You confront a bunch of enemies in open combat and take them down one by one. The stealth aspects of this game are rather boring, silly and feel shoehorned in in the out of place spaces i found them in. I guess the game could do fairly well without them. I mostly ignored them right away and did battle head on. A thing i didnt like too much was the overabundance (or should i say abuse) of Quick time events. You basically can't do a single fight properly without feeling like an idiotic lab test monkey during the duty calls-esque bullet time with the hint "HOW BOUT U PRESS DEEZ BUTTONS?!!11".\n\nThe presentation in both visuals and audio is what you can expect. High quality and very enjoyable. Especially the soundtrack is excellent. The storytelling appears to be rather cookie cutter at first, but digs deeper in as you carry on, revealing deep thoughts on social commentary, war and peace and achievable technology with its following impact in mankind. It can definitely hold a candle to the movie quality experience that was Batman Arkham city. But i guess that's something you can expect with over 2 hours of cutscene footage. (These take up most the whole of the 25 Gigs download capacity btw...)\n\nSomething you might want to consider: This game has no multiplayer mode\nwhatsoever. You are all left on your own with a bunch of impossible challenge mode arenas, an avalanche of unachievable unlockables or tedious free build-in DLC that cant hold up to the main campaign and will make you question if you even know what you are doing after several hours in the game. Also, why the one and only samurai character in this game has ninja-like traits like faster running, higher jumping or double jumping while the main character who is more like a ninja himself has not is beyond me.\n\nTo make things short, if you like yourself a wapanese game with cyborgs, large mechs, lots of blood and gore, profanities, hyperbolic super villains, talking dogs, swords, loli hentai and pizza you might like this game. A little. Maybe. Its cheap for a game of this caliber. Less than 20 bucks. I sure did, at least when i wasn't busy punching a hole in my wall raging at what these shîtlords dared to throw at me this time again.\n\nTo make things short, if you like yourself a wapanese game with cyborgs, large mechs, lots of blood and gore, profanities, hyperbolic dragon ball super villains, talking dogs,regicide, swords, jar-jar binks, loli hentai, organ trade and pizza you might like this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoulDestroy/recommended/235460/","SoulDestroy","SoulDestroy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SoulDestroy/","385 products in account","I could just link you to sounds of sensual moaning, but I think I'd rather use my vocabulary to describe why Metal Gear Rising: Revengence is an astoundingly great game. Yes, I'm using sections, because a simple blurb wouldn't do this masterpiece justice. I should note that I had very little prior experience with the Metal Gear series, having only played about a half of the original Metal Gear Solid.\n\n\nPremise\nYou play as Raiden, a cyborg ninja with a very violent and traumatizing past. Part of Maverick Security, a self-titled "private security contractor", you and your agency have spent the past three years protecting a fledgling African nation while it grew into a prosperous society. All that changes when the president of the nation is kidnapped and assassinated by another cyborg, who works for one of your rivals, Desperado LLC. From there, you find out the who, what, and why of the assassination - the misery branches off from there.\n\nBeing a cyborg ninja, you have quite a lot of finesse, leaping over buildings and other objects with ease. Of course, no ninja of questionable authenticity would be caught dead without a katana, or rather, a High-Frequency blade. With it, you can cut nearly anything and anyone with ease - mind the other cyborgs with one, though!\n\n\nGameplay\nThe Sword\nBy now, you can probably tell that Metal Gear Rising's meat and bones is the HF Blade. It's most obvious application is slashing up enemies. There are two modes of attack: light and strong. Light allows Raiden to attack without breaking his run, while heavy, while more damaging, forces Raiden to come to a complete halt. There are many combos to learn and attack styles to perfect, but it never becomes quite as overbearing as a fighting game's controls.\n\nParrying. Parrying parrying parrying. The most important maneuver in the game. Without it, your enemies will make mince meat of you, especially on higher difficulties. When an enemy glows red, it is time to parry. Press attack + the direction in which the enemy is, and you will successfully parry if you get the timing right. Forgive me for typing the previous two sentences out as though I were writing a textbook, but it is better to learn it now than in-game, hair ripped out and four hours wasted on the first boss.\n\nBlade mode is another crucial element to MGR's swordplay. It can be activated at any time to slice objects or people more accurately, but people are what it's primarily used for. After widdling down an enemies health to a certain degree, you can go into blade mode and perform Zandatsu - a maneuver in which you slice the enemy in half and rip their cyborg guts out, exploding them in your hand to regain health and energy for blade mode. It's as awesome as it sounds.\n\nWith these elements combined, the swordplay is extremely smooth and satisfying, when done correctly. Zandatsu is just the cherry on top, the thing that makes everything else worthwhile.\n\nEncounters and Rankings\nEncounters (not official nomenclature) are composed of enemies of varying strength and difficulty. Most are boxed in and prohibit the player from progressing through the terrain. Not much else to say about the encounters themselves, but each are ranked from D to S, D being "you suck ♥♥♥♥" and S being "you didn't take any damage and got lots of points". Points are awarded depending on the enemies killed, the number of Zandatsus performed, the damage you took, and the time it took you to beat it. At the end of each chapter of the game, you ranks are tallied up to form a rank for the entire chapter. Those points aren't just for show, either...\n\nUpgrades\nUpgrades are what makes getting those points worthwhile. After every checkpoint in the game, you are able to go to the cleverly-titled "Upgrade Screen" and buy upgrades for Raiden. You can give Raiden's sword stat increases, buy unlocked "sub-weapons", increase Raiden's health and Blade Mode battery, and even get different skins for his armor. This system is one of the reasons why Revengence is as replayed as it is, as it allows for upgrades to be carried over to a new game.\n\nStealth\nAlthough Metal Gear Rising is primarily an action game, there are many segments where stealth is not only an option, but is encouraged. Running up behind an enemy and pressing the action button will activate Ninja Mode - which is a fancy way of saying you can slash enemies silently. The cardboard box is as useful a tool as ever, and there are even smoke grenades to help sneak past enemies. It is also worth noting that sneaking past an area that is set up for an Encounter forgoes the grade you would get for fighting, which can be quite useful for keeping a consistent grade.\n\nSecrets and Unlocks\nA lot. Magically turns 5 hours into 40.\n\nOverall\nThough it isn't in the title anymore, the gameplay is still SOLID. The swordplay is engaging, the scoring and upgrade systems are rewarding and encourage replayability, and the stealth system feels like a natural extension to the gameplay. The only complaint that I have is that the camera can't keep up with the action sometimes - like it realizes how awesome you're doing and freaks out.\n\nAs a side note, I think complaints that the story is only five hours long is misguided, to say the least. This is a game all about skill, improving yourself. As such, you'll want to go for better rankings and for harder difficulties, because you want to see how good you can get. At bare minimum, you'll keep playing for the upgrades and unlocks, which, as previously mention, add a sizable amount of time spent playing. VR missions, small challenge levels, add even more length and challenge. Even if that doesn't tide you over, at least Revengence comes with two DLCs that lengthen the experience by a few hours.\n\n\nPresentation\nThe gameplay is spectacular on it's own, but it's how the game presents itself that propels the entire experience to greatness.\n\nStory\nWithout going into much detail here (partially because of spoilers, partially because of laziness), Metal Gear Rising's story is... wild. And deep. What starts off as a simple mystery turns into a... err... complex mystery, filled with conspiracy and political ideology. Though the game has an air of self-aware cheekiness, it manages to be surprisingly engaging when the plot gets good. At the game's climax, the wackiness and the seriousness combine to create something utterly incredible. Also of note is the boss characters - possibly the coolest portrayal of traditional archetypes I've ever seen.\n\nSound\nYou know a soundtrack is good when you actively have to force yourself not to type the lyrics in all caps right this second. Much like the story, it is both over-the-top and yet extremely captivating. The lyrics to the songs are pertinent to the story and characters, with boss theme's reflecting their respective character's personalities and modus operandi. The music that plays during regular encounters is a treat as well, while the stealth music feels calm and controlled. Nu-metal was a surprisingly perfect choice for the feel of Revengence.\n\nGraphics\nHonestly, probably the weakest part of the whole package. Most of the environments look extremely drab, sometimes muddy - I didn't know a cloudy day in Denver looked that horrid. Meanwhile, the characters, while well designed, have low texture quality - it's not very noticeable unless seen very close.\n\n\nConclusion\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengence is a well-thought out, well-crafted game. It might not try to swoon the player with promises of progressive writing *cough* Bioshock Infinite *cough*, but between its fantastic gameplay, high-but-attainable skill ceiling, fun and engaging story, and rocking soundtrack, MGR lives and dies by its dedication to the hardcore. I don't like to flaunt being a gamer, but if you consider yourself to be one, a TRUE one, pick this up without hesitation.","January 27, 2014","true","71.4"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/recommended/235460/","Arrgeron","Morse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arrgeron/","602 products in account","Metal Gear Rising: Revengance, the game that made up a word just to sound cool. Well, this game does a lot more than sounding cool, it just straight up is. Every battle is epic, especially the boss battles.\n\nThere isn't a whole lot to say except the combat is simple but very enjoyable. Platinum is great at making games with incredibly fun combat, just look at Bayonetta. And every boss fight is unique and interesting, and never feels like boss mechanics are reapeating.\n\nI do want to point out some negatives. The story is just bad, I don't care what anyone says. I know people like to say "well its just cheesy and fun". No, I'm sorry, its bad and poorly written and voice acted. The cheese did make me laugh a few times, so its not the worst thing, and there are some decent moments, but overall its bad and your honestly not missing much if you skip over it.  Another thing to mention is the camera angles. Several times when I was trying to stealth my way through a section(something I think this game could have done without. I know you can fight your way through these sections but the game makes it clear when it wants you to sneak. I get its a metal gear game, but its moreso an action hack and slash, we don't need stealth), and the camera would sometimes take control of itself from a corner and push the view to an entirely different spot. Very annoying, and I did have one instance where the camera wouldn't let me see a damn thing and it caused me to die.\n\nDespite this Metal Gear Rising has a very strong combat system with some pretty cool upgrades and different weapons to make combat varied, and the game doesn't outstay its welcome. It took me about 8 hours to beat the main story. Very much worth the buy, just be warned if you don't like cheesy stories, it'll make you roll your eyes.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing Soundtrack\n-Fun combat\n-Good level design\n-Short, doesn't outstay its welcome\n-Very awesome boss battles\n-Collectables\n-Bonus missions to do when your done with the story\n\nCons:\n-Story is dumb\n-Camera angle can be wonky.\n-Shoe-horning in stealth because its metal gear.\n\nWait For A Sale","January 2, 2015","true","10.5"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","29","36","4","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/exptv/recommended/235460/","exptv","EXP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/exptv/","407 products in account","RULES OF NATURE\nToo few are the games available that offer a chance at sliding along the tail of an enormous mechanical robot atop a high-frequency katana screaming 'RULES OF NATURE' at the top of your lungs. Fewer still are those ported to Steam from console platforms with nary a game-breaking issue in sight. And yet, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (MGR:R), first launched on Xbox 360 and PS3 globally during the final weeks of February 2013 is one that has done exactly that.\n\nOn January 9th, 2014, the Platinum-Konami lovechild launched near-flawlessly on Steam at a massively reduced price (somewhere in the vicinity of twenty bucks, dependant on your territory and time of purchase) including all 3 DLC sets alongside a host of new graphical options including resolution up to 1080p, 60FPS, gamepad support, anti-aliasing, texture filtering and even the ability to adjust 'ZANGEKI' — the amount of cuts allowed on an object, potentially preventing game crashes or frame rate drops on less capable systems.\n\nI've even read reports on Steam of users testing their system on Can I Run It, with a negative result, that could then, on low settings, play without concern. Impressive, to say the least. But not perfect.\n\nNOT PERFECT?\nIt's close to perfect, but it's not entirely perfect. For instance, increasing the original FPS to 60FPS is incredible for most gamers, as is the increase in resolution to 1920x1080. Limiting it to 60FPS and 1920x1080, however, is borderline unforgiveable. When moving a title to a new platform, it's important to consider the users of said platform. In the case of PC, 60FPS and 1080p is, for many users, not even playable.\n\nTo add insult to injury, there's no Windowed Fullscreen setting forcing many players (and especially Twitch broadcasters like myself) to play windowed to avoid resolution or refresh rate issues. Moreover, there's no V-Sync option, so even if while playing Fullscreen yourself, those watching your broadcast would be forced into an unstable framerate with choppy visuals — something I could only fix by playing windowed.\n\nEven worse still are the cutscenes, which are still limited to 30FPS. Again, this is unlikely to cause an issue for most players, but for some, like myself broadcasting at 60FPS, this means insane screen-tearing and an unpleasant visual experience.\n\nI've been doing some research to determine where these issues are coming from (as, for all intents and purposes my talents lie in playing and critiquing games, not fixing them) and it would appear that the refresh rate not adapting to that of the monitor being used is the underlying cause. Playing in Windowed Mode is the current best fix, though there's a public outcry on Steam requesting a true fix, alongside the addition of V-Sync, WF mode and 120FPS. Here's hoping we get one soon - which is looking likely, as the first patch, to correct the unintended 'always online' function, has already been deployed.\n\nANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW?\nI found a great post in the Steam forums by Souzooka that details a bunch of issues I haven't experienced myself, but appear common among the community. Here're the highlights:\n\nPlayers opting to play with a Keyboard and Mouse (presumably because they don't own a compatible gamepad - it's a console game port, people: use a f***ing gamepad) have run into several issues, including the inability to map key bindings to mouse buttons and 'switch lock-on target', alongside a potentially game-breaking issue with aiming the mounted turret in Chapter 4.\n\nSeveral users have reported game crashes when failing to read the 'ntdll.dll' file. This appears to happen with users that have no C:/ directory. Others have reported crashes when changing resolution (a difficult task, I might add, as changing any of the graphical settings in MGR:R on PC happens immediately, without the traditional 'Apply Settings' option, meaning you'll need to experience the glory of every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ resolution on the way to 1920x1080 before reaching it, and the same for all other options).\n\nEven more worrying are the reports that many users cannot complete the final boss encounter due to an inability to activate the Quick-Time Event (QTE) associated with it, and too, that many cannot save their game. The latter has been linked to Windows 8.1 users who do not have permission to write to their disk, but is unconfirmed.\n\nIf you're experiencing any issues yourself, I recommend checking out  Souzooka's post here ; there's plenty of good information, and many fixes for strange occurrences.\n\nMGR vs. MGS\nThat concludes the PC version of this review, and with MGR:R having been available for almost a year I won't be providing a full review on the game mechanics here — that said, I do want to share my perspective on the inception of this title, for those of you that haven't yet picked it up, and aren't sure if you should.\n\nWhich is to say, I want to clarify something: this is not a Metal Gear Solid game. I've come across far too many comparisons between MGR:R and MGS this past year and I'd like to beat that nail on the head right now.\n\nMGR:R was developed by Platinum Games, the team that brought you Vanquish and Bayonetta, both high-octane, adrenaline-fuelled action games demanding quick reflexes and an almost insane level of perseverance. The characters, world and story were provided by Konami, and Hideo Kojima himself, creator of the tactical espionage Metal Gear and Metal Gear Solid franchises on the NES and PlayStation 1-3 (and some off-shoot PSP titles no one cares about).\n\nMGS SPOILER ALERT\nIt's the answer to a question that Konami have been trying to answer for years: what's it like to play as a Cyborg Ninja? In Metal Gear we were introduced to Frank Jaeger, AKA Null, AKA Grey Fox, AKA The Cyborg Ninja. In Metal Gear Solid, we saw Jaeger in action like we'd never imagined, slicing enemies into pieces with the flick of his wrist and providing some of our fondest memories in gaming history. In Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty we were introduced to Jack, AKA Raiden, a tactical operative similar in style (but not personality) to MGS protagonist, Solid Snake. During the course of Metal Gear history, Raiden was transformed into the Cyborg Raiden we saw in Metal Gear Solid 4: Sons of the Patriots.\n\nHaving been transformed from stealth operative to cyborg ninja, Raiden no longer fit as a playable character in MGS (as anyone who has played MGS2 will understand all too well), and given the engine capabilities of MGS presumably never would again. Unless, of course, one of the most notably epic action game developers on the planet teamed up with Konami to make a game specifically suited to that characters' new style, pace and abilities. Then, y'know, it'd be awesome.\n\nIt's understandable that many people went into MGR:R expecting MGS — after all, both titles have at least 2 of the same words — but it's not forgivable. You've got the Internet now, people, and me, and a million others like me. Do your f***ing research before you touch the keyboard to whine about how MGR:R is nothing like MGS - when, obviously, if it was like MGS, it would  be f***ing MGS, not MGR:R.\n\nWE'RE OUT OF TIME\nSteam has a character limit on reviews, so I can't offer the remainder of it here.

If you don't count Ghost Babel, Portable ops, Peace Walker, Acid, Acid 2-...\nS-...Snakes Revenge.\n\nYou play as Raiden, a skull with amazing hair and a cool cyborg body. At one point he had a people body, but it was replaced because apparently everyone had a homo crush on him and didn't want to admit it, so they just pretended they hated him. While writing self insert romance fan fics.\nLike me.\nI mean not me.\n\nThe game takes place a few years after the Guns of the Patriots, with information now flowing freely, cybernetics have become common place and do more than just look cool. But they still look really cool. Now PMC's are armed to the teeth with robot arms, and robot teeth, and swords kind of sort of made a comeback. Because this game would have probably be really lame without swords. The combat in this game is out there, involving cutting a metal gear ray in half, running up the side of a building, sword fighting a South American Samurai man, and beating up a bald man with autism. This could be considered crazy but it is honestly nothing I haven't seen after licking a toad.\n\nWhile being a prominent feature, the cut-everything system does not try to over-take the actual combo-and-dodge based combat the game is built around, usually only coming into play when you rip someones spine out for that sweet-sweet raspberry powerade to get you through yet another war crime. It is a departure from the Tactical Espionage Action (See what I did there?) from the last games, but Rising holds its own by being a spin-off instead of, lets say, a reboot that butchered iconic white-haired characters from a favorite series of which I will not name. While the story isn't that much, it's still entertaining to see what happens next as much as it is to listen to Crispin Freeman pull a southern accent.\n\nShould you buy Metal Gear Rising? Honestly, I really liked it. For a spin-off it does most things right. Sure it doesn't explain all of its mechanics properly at first, but if you stick with it, it will show its true colors as a solid action game.\n\n8.5/10, I don't want to sound gay or nothing, but if this game were a boy, I would explore with it.","November 5, 2014","true","12.6"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","83","24","29","16","1"

The parry is extremely satisfying when you pull off a perfect parry, or block many hits in quick succession. The offensive-defensive, the game's dodge move, also grants a high skill ceiling, with a few frames of invulnerability enabling you to dodge most everything that can't be parried. Mashing the attack button grants an infinite combo, though there's not any hit stun from flaling wildly for most enemies.  As Raiden, you are quite literally lightning incarnate. Raiden's not supposed to tank damage, instead you have to block, parry and dodge things.\n\nThe boss rush mode in the PC port is a very welcome addition.  All of the boss fights in the game are challenging and the variety of them is great. Armstrong's bossfight is nothing like Khamsin's. There's alot of  content just in them.\n\nOne of the other unique parts of the game, and my personal favorite aspect of it, the OST is very, very good. It's an eccentric mix of electronic-house style music with a dash of contemporary rock and power metal.  The soundtrack's vocals kick in at just the right moment in the game's action to give the music a very emotional and exciting complement to the on screen events.\n\nStorywise, the game is still a Metal Gear game. A cyborg ninja and robot dog team up to try and end modern war as a business. Raiden's character arc here is really cool. It echoes MGS2 with Raiden coming to grips with himself, instead of the identity he presents himself as. It's tongue and cheek and over the top at times, but this is nothing new for the series.\n\nThe Keyboard and mouse controls are not bad, but you'll want a controller.\n\n\nThere are a few flaws in the game, though. The game's short. (around six to seven hours your first time through.) and the camera messes up frequently. Ninja run is also pretty buggy, you'll die unfairly to messed up pathing a few times through.  The DLC, thankfully included for free in the PC port, is not the best.  Jetstream Sam's DLC is interesting, but ends too soon, not really giving you an opportunity to use your newfound (though limited) skillset for very long. Bladewolf's DLC is stealth based, but is also very short and re-uses almost all of it's assets from the base game.\n\n\nOverall I'd say MGR:R is a solid 9.5/10.","April 30, 2014","true","63.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Junoh315/recommended/235460/","Junoh315","Junoh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Junoh315/","1385 products in account","Before I get started with the review, I must inform everyone that I played with a controller and not the keyboard and mouse. Some people have had trouble using a keyboard and mouse with the game while others have said that it's better than using a controller. If you do not have a controller then I suggest that you check out other reviews and see if it has good keyboard/mouse support. I'm using what is essentially an Xbox 360 controller. This review will only encompass the main game and not the DLC. I will do my best to not spoil any of the story.\n\nThe first thing I'd like to talk about is the interface. Metal Gear Rising's menus aren't what I'd call perfect but they're functional. One of the biggest issues that I've found with the main menu happens to be pretty minor; you can't quit the game without loading your save file first. It's a negligible issue to me but I see it brought up in the Steam forums quite a bit so some people might consider it a bigger issue.\n\nMain Menu and Options Menu:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHaOCg_x7kQ\n\nThe item menu could stand to be improved but it's likely that you'll never use it in combat anyways. It pauses the game when you press left or right on the directional pad and allows you to pick which weapons you want. When you're being attacked or in the middle of an attack animation then it will seem unresponsive.\n\nThe heads up display has a lot of information being shown. Whether or not this is a good thing depends on how much hand-holding you want. It at least keeps itself out of the way during battles and doesn't cover up the entire screen.\n\nHeads Up Display Screenshot:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BNA1c5L.jpg\n\nUser Interface and Heads Up Display:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tACzan0hmm4\n\nThe gameplay is a bit more than just hacking and slashing your way through enemies. It requires accurate timing and precise aim with your sword while under time constraints. Battles are drastically different from the previous entries to the Metal Gear franchise. Stealth is now harder to pull off and there is more emphasis on the action.\n\nYou can tell that the boss battles will be over-the-top once you see the first boss. They put you up against a modified Metal Gear Ray in the first few minutes of gameplay. From slicing the armor off to even throwing the Metal Gear, it's clear that Raiden is a lot stronger than he was in previous games. Metal Gear Rising seeks to make you feel like a super-human and I feel like it succeeds in doing so.\n\nMetal Gear Ray battle from the Xbox 360 version:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVFyYqfNSVg\n\nThe bosses are unique in Metal Gear Rising. Every single boss has its own way to beat it and even their own theme songs. I feel like this is where Metal Gear Rising shines the most; the boss battles. While the regular enemies put up a bit of a fight, they're mainly just fodder for your blade even on the highest difficulty settings.\n\nThe contrasting difficulty from regular enemies to bosses might seem a bit unbalanced, especially when you go up against the final boss which is probably one of the hardest bosses in any game that I have played. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually lost against a final boss. From health regeneration to a larger pool of health and insanely powerful moves that you can only dodge, Platinum Games knows what they're doing to make a boss feel difficult rather than just tedious like so many final bosses in other games.\n\nIf it weren't for the amazing music, I probably would have had a harder time against the final boss. That brings me to my next point: the soundtrack. Metal Gear Rising's soundtrack might seem a bit strange for a video game but it definitely suits the gameplay. Each song is different and the lyrics suit the boss that they're made for. The boss battles with their amazing songs are the main reason why I'd consider replaying the game over and over.\n\nOne of my favorite boss battle themes(Mistral):\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLvgvsI5jAg\n\nThe story is one of the only parts of the game that doesn't really shine. You're a cyborg who has to kill terrorists and that's as much as you need to know in order to justify your character cutting people into tiny bits. The story only briefly references the events of Metal Gear Solid 2 and 4 so it's good even if you haven't played any other Metal Gear games. There are only around two hours of cut-scenes this time which is less than other Metal Gear games; to put this into perspective, Metal Gear Solid 2-4 each had five hours of cut-scenes while the original Metal Gear Solid had over three.\n\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance is one of the best action titles of 2013 and I'm glad that Platinum Games ported it to the PC. I feel like they did a good job on the PC port besides a few technical issues that they can easily fix in a patch. There were no noticeable bugs when I played through the game and I feel like it was a polished game.\n\nThe PC port is locked to 60 FPS and the resolution can only go as high as 1920x1080. If you're using HDMI then you may run into the same bug as I did where the game switches to interlaced mode by default in 1920x1080. The solution to fixing this problem is to run the game in windowed mode and then using the Windowed Borderless Gaming tool.\n\nWindowed Borderless Gaming tool:\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2675769\n\nOverall, I feel like this game is worth buying if you're a fan of action games. The game looks much better than it did on the PS3 and 360 due to the increased resolution, frame-rate, anti-aliasing, and texture filtering. If you haven't played this game before then I recommend buying it on the PC if your specs are good enough. It's easily one of the best action games I've played so far.","January 17, 2014","true","16.3"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","3"

I have rarely seen such an awesome hack and slash game. But before I started to have fun with it I needed to practice ALOT. Do not try to play this game on hard on your first playthrough, you will probably getting destroyed. But anyways, the gameplay is fun. It is challenging and finishing off enemies is very satisfying. The combat has one problem though: The camera can be really bad in small areas. Which means you are getting hit by stuff you are not able to see, especially on the highest difficulty this gets really unfair. It's there, it is annoying but gladly the good combat sections are more. The game also delivers grenades, rockets, etc. BUT I  hardly ever have used them becasue they are really clunky to use. I ended up to only use them when it was neccessary. this does mean you end up only using your sword becasue the sword fighting is really good, so long you know how to parry! What else can I say? The game gives you an amazing soundtrack which is pumping you with adrenalin. The port is ok, no 16:10 support. And the game has a high replay abbility.It is a spin off so do not expect it to be too stealthy even though you CAN stealth kill but it is not required. to sum it up, the only thing that sucks is the camera in some scenes AND the VR-missions. There are some missions where the AI just jumps off the mission area and makes you fail the mission. Many missions are just based on luck which is never a good idea!\n\nConclusion: Il highly recommend this game to everyone that likes Metal Gear or hack'n slash games.\n\nRating: 8/10","January 25","true","67.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"

Metal Gear Rising: REVENEVENGENVE<whatever>. This game does EXACLY TWO THINGS extremely well and they both make up for how much this game is great: Boss fights and music.\n\nOther aspects of Revengence are good or passable. Enviroments aren't impressive, normal enemies are not that interesing and the fighting mechanics while pretty awesome, are badly explained. Parry system for example is easy by itself, but game doesn't take it's time to actually show how it works in a real fight. You will find this pretty annoying when you start facing stronger enemies, when parry moves are pretty much required. If not in it's strongest, this game feels a bit clunky. Not bad, just not completetly polished (Place for sequel improvement much? *wink wink*)\n\nThat said... Bosses and acompaning music on those are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. They are fast, cinematic, adrenaline pumping, completely crazy and you never feel thrown out of action. They are designed very well both in terms of visuals and mechanics. QTEs are very unintrusive and intuitive. Music is wild, wacky and exciting. Those moments are the highlights of the game, making the experience completely worth the asking price.\n\nIn short: This is a awesome game for awesome people.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarylSurat/recommended/235460/","DarylSurat","DarylSurat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarylSurat/","776 products in account","The PC port of this game is a good one. You've got AA/AF options, plus low/medium/high settings for shadows, how long debris stays, and how many pieces you can cut things into. On my 660Ti, I could run at 1920 x 1080 with MSAA x 2, AF x 16, and everything on high and it holds at 60 FPS with no Vsync tearing whatsoever.\n\nAs for the game itself? This was my pick for best game of 2013. It's a Bayonetta/Devil May Cry style action title with stylish choreography (and it's not just limited to the cutscenes; you can and will be doing this stuff yourself) combined with the characterization and dialogue of a traditional Metal Gear title. And there's quite a lot of that, too: if you voluntarily listen to all of the codec conversations and don't just skip the cutscenes, this game is about as long as a "normal" Metal Gear Solid game. Anyone saying "it's short!" is neglecting to point this out, as most of the codec dialogues are optional.\n\nStealth exists for sections but is actively discouraged. In true Platinum Games fashion, the most critical and fundamental of gameplay mechanics is left under-explained. In this case, that's how to properly parry and dodge (you'll actually have to purchase aerial parrying and the dodge as upgrades, though they are inexpensive and among the first upgrades available). As with most Platinum games, you can go through much of the game without quite "getting" how they work, but once you've got it down your effectiveness will skyrocket. Hint: you have to move the stick FROM NEUTRAL towards the direction of the attack before hitting X.\n\nPlatinum Games are about "mastery" more than just "completion." You don't simply beat this game and conclude "well, I've beaten it, now onto the next game" like we do for most action titles. To do so would be missing out on a lot of what is offered. Here, you're graded on each encounter, and to get every encounter per level you'll want to backtrack and intentionally get spotted so as to trigger more fights. Doing better means more points to spend on character and weapon upgrades. You'll get several weapons each with several moves and their own applications. Feel free to use whatever you feel like. Replay past levels using the weapons you got from later stages. Then try out the VR challenges and higher difficulties. And now you can choose to skip straight to the boss fights upon completion (all Metal Gear games should have this).\n\nThis is the sort of game where there are multiple difficulties above Hard. The sort of game that's meant to be PLAYED rather than watched in a video playthrough in order to truly experience it. I beat it on PS3 last year, and now I feel like doing it all over again on PC. Here's hoping Metal Gear Solid 5 comes out on Steam too!","January 10, 2014","true","17.7"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","2"

The tone is a perfect match for the game, and within that tone the story still manages to take the ♥♥♥♥ out of American Exceptionalism and various other absurdities and platitudes.  This is a less philosophical game than general entries in the Metal Gear Solid series, and takes the philosophy of the series less seriously, joking with it in many cases.  This is appropriate, as Metal Gear Solid generally overreaches when it tries to do real philosophy anyway.  In place of this, we get to explore the motivations and character of Raiden in a game that greatly expands his personal story arc.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I found it very good.  Much is based on memorization though.  The camera can sabotage you at times, which is obnoxious.  Also, play it with a 360 controller.  Seriously, find a USB 360 controller online and get one, playing this with keyboard and mouse is a dumb idea.  Replayability appeal is limited to the appeal of the hack and slash gameplay and to any perfectionist tendencies a player might have, either towards this gameplay or toward the achievements in the game.

I've got some experience with the game.\n\nThis is one of my favourite games, and I'm tempted to recommend it to any carbon-based lifeform with a pulse... but ultimately it isn't for everyone. Revengeance is rightly a niche game, a strange spin-off from a mainstream franchise that abandons the Metal Gear Solid gameplay formula and only includes token nods to the stealth focus of its progenitor. In spite of the player character being a "cyborg ninja", the gameplay mechanics for stealth are as minimal as can be, while the mechanics for high-speed stylish melee combat are far more developed than anything western action games might have prepared you for.\n\nI don't want to go into the details of Revengeance's story, but I do want to commend how effectively it carries the game, without spoiling any details. Throughout the story, our player character Raiden has clear motives and goals. He also goes through an interesting character development arc, an arc that stays true to his personality in both previous MGS incarnations while also pushing him forward as a person. By the end of the game Raiden has gone through both physical and philosophical transformations. At the infamously bombastic finale of the game, Raiden and the final boss clash over distinct ideological differences. This final boss advocates loudly for a twisted worldview where the strong dominate the weak, and then demands that we, as Raiden, use our strength to prove him right by defeating him. It's a unique synthesis of player involvement and philosophy that I don't think Revengeance gets enough credit for. It's a traditional aspect of Metal Gear Solid games to have the game's villains be complex in their goals and motives, and Revengeance nails it.\n\nThe fighting in Revengeance is maybe 80% of the total gameplay, with another 10% being stealth and the rest being less-than-compelling 3D platforming. Thankfully it's in this 80% that the developers succeed 100%. It'd be hard to define "the Platinum feel", but every Platinum game (and every Clover game for that matter) has a level of combat mechanic excellence that you rarely find elsewhere. I think there's two major aspects that make this particular system so good, the first being that the player maintains total control over Raiden. Every player move can be "cancelled" out of, meaning the player never finds themselves stuck in an animation, and every enemy attack can be either dodged or parried with enough precision and skill. This is a game that politely asks you to "git gud" and gives you the tools you need to do it. Every hit you take is entirely your fault, every blow you land is entirely to your credit. When you learn to use the fundamental mechanics correctly you start dodging through previously devastating attacks and swiftly dominating previously intimidating enemies, and the feeling of satisfaction and pride is second to none.\n\nThe other aspect that makes the Revengeance combat system so fresh is the Zandatsu. When Raiden has harmed an enemy enough to shatter their armour, he can pop them up in the air and hack them to pieces. You can swing wildly and hack the cyborg enemy up into a hundred meaty slices, or you can cut carefully and pull out their cyborg heart to absorb their juices. This move is the Zandatsu and it refills your life and energy meters. When the game gives you this ability and then pits you against tough enemies, it incentivises you to chase down weaker enemies and consume them, giving you the boost you'll need to face the rest of the enemy mob. Not only does this mechanic look and feel great, it once again ties back into the philosophical thread of strength and weakness that runs throughout the game.\n\nSadly the execution of this system does have some flaws. The camera positioning isn't always on your side, particularly when fighting in hallways, and larger enemies (particularly Gekkos and Raptors) can leap into the camera and drop down onto you in ways which are disorienting. Some enemies have conventional firearms that they constantly drill you with, and the only way to avoid taking damage from them is to keep constantly running. When you're trying to beat a fight without taking damage (and therefore get the No Damage bonus to your fight ranking), one random Dwarf Gekko with a machine gun can really ruin your mood.\n\nThe game provides you with access to 3 unique boss weapons that you can purchase after beating their respective bosses, but these weapons can't be toggled mid-fight. They have to be accessed by opening a menu on the D-Pad, which inevitably costs you some momentum in a battle. I don't love the boss weapons, none of them feel as good as Raiden's sword and they seem more like novelties than necessities. I'm sure there's high skill players who can wield them in amazing ways, but as an average player I couldn't find their utility.\n\nRevengeance can be finished in about 5-6 hours by a casual player on normal difficulty. I'm sure some players get their fill and stop there, but if you love your first experience MGR has a huge amount of replayability. VR challenge missions, DLC side campaigns (Jetstream Sam's DLC is phenomenal), collectibles that you literally have to chop off your enemies, a vast wealth of codec dialogue with interesting characters, and of-course the constant challenge of S-Ranking every fight in the game.\n\nThe only thing left that I want to specifically praise is the music. Each major boss fight is accompanied by a unique boss song, with lyrics relating to that boss' internal struggles. The songs are some weird hybrid of electronic kick drums, downtuned nu-metal guitar riffs and distorted rock vocals, which isn't nearly as bad as it sounds. The songs are played as instrumental until the final stage of the boss battle, at which point the lyrics kick in. It's precisely as cheesy as it sounds, and I can't help but punch the air and sing along every time it happens. When you're mashing your gamepad in frantic excitement while battling an enemy you've come to love, and you're hearing a song decrying their loss of identity and lack of any choice other than to fight to the death, the synthesis of gameplay and mood elevates MGR to an intoxicating apex. It's so addictive you'll want to lose certain boss fights just so you don't have to stop experiencing it.\n\nAt the current asking price (£20 as of writing), I wouldn't recommend Revengeance to literally anyone. I would recommend it at that price to people who want a challenge, who are open to Japanese design eccentricity, and who need a change from the stagnation of melee combat mechanics in western game development, where everyone appears to be mimicking either Assassins Creed or the Arkham series.\n\nWere it on sale at half that price, I'd recommend Revengeance to literally anyone. At the very least you can get £10 worth of enjoyment by playing through on Easy and absorbing the atmosphere and storytelling.","May 13","true","33.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

This caused mass panic as the earth beneath him began to shatter. The ground split as if Moses himself were splitting it. Kojima crawled to safety and said "Why do you do this to me my lord?" God spoke and said "It is time, go to Kamiya and talk to him... talk to him about Rising." Kojima nodded and went on his way. God made a quick remark before closing the heavens. "Oh, and tell him to unblock me on twitter." Kojima and Kamiya met up that day and Kamiya could not believe what he was hearing. Kojima started to talk ♥♥♥♥ about his proteges and how they can't make a simple action game. Kamiya told him that Platinum Games would take it from here. Atsushi Inaba was selected to take over the project and followed Kojima back to Kojima Studios. They began to brainstorm about the game and what to do with it. The first thing they decided on was the name. It was then that the game God had inspired Kojima sculpt became to be.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RgYq22C.jpg","January 29, 2015","true","85.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","83","15","18","13","0"

Different ways to kill with sword type weapons in some combination of martial arts.

So props on that.\n\nIf you listen through the Codec calls and explore levels, you'll be entertained for a long time, because they sure talk a lot.

I see glowing reviews literally everywhere. And yes, while it's an enjoyable hack and slash action game, similar to games like God Of War and Devil May Cry, it lacks... depth. Just like those games. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this game. On the contrary. I did enjoy it. Just not the entire time. I usually get bored by games like this in a matter of 2-3 hours. MGRR is unfortunately no different.\n\nIt lacks variety in its level design; it all looks very bleak and industrial. Empty streets everywhere, except for an ocassional lost civilian. Invisible barriers that suddenly appear when enemies approach. Why does this still happen ? I thought we were past that. You know, immersion and all that stuff.\n\nWhat MGRR does right are its boss fights, and some fights with normal enemies. The boss fights are mostly challenging and require your full attention. They can get a bit frustrating until you know exactly what to do.\n\nThe fights in general are pretty awesome. The action sequences are well done and fighting with your katana feels awesome. Slicing enemies into pieces never gets old, especially if it's this fast paced.\nThe graphics look sharp and the voice acting is mostly solid, even if some of the dialog is (intentionally) cheesy.\n\nAll in all MGRR is a good game, fun for short sessions. Thankfully the game isn't very long, with only 7 chapters and about 6-7 hours of gameplay, which is, as you can read, more than enough if you're not all that into hack and slash action games.\n\n[Rating: 73/100]","January 17, 2014","true","13.2"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","5"

The game was developed by Platinum Games, and under supervision from Hideo Kojima. I didn't expect for a second that Kojima would let this game be something normal, and indeed it is not. You play as Raiden from the Metal Gear franchise, a series I unfortunately have never followed. Distinctly different from the stealth action adventure of the other games from Metal Gear, it is a nice deviation from the norm (it still has plenty of stealth). The soundtrack is great, the bosses are incredibly memorable and unique, the characters full of substance, etc.  Definitely worth the purchase.","November 14, 2014","true","33.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

My favorite of any game I've ever played in my entire life.\n\n+Awesome boss fights. (Except Monsoon, screw you Monsoon you are evil)\n\n+Very fun gameplay, fights are exciting and rarely repetetive thanks to the many combos you can perform, as well as a few different weapons.\n\n+Stunning visuals on highest settings and pretty good voice acting.\n\n+Blade mode is amazing. Cutting enemies the way you want to is very satisfying, whether it be clean dismemberment or blender-style murder. They even throw a few watermelons in the game for you to slice.\n\n-Very high learning curve. I'm doing much, much better now on Hard than I ever did on normal, because I've learned how to play well.\n\n-Really minor issue, when playing with a controller, whenever a menu pops up, the mouse curser gets planted right in the middle of the screen and I have to move it each time.\n\nOverall, 95/100\nMy favorite game of 2014.","February 6, 2015","true","24.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

I had never played a Metal Gear tittle before but this is obviuosly a spinoff with little stealth. The main campaign can be completed in under 10 hours (you actually get an achievement if you are a slow poke like me who takes more time) but most of the challenges lie in the additionnal VR missions (With an emphasis on level design  - a lot of platforming and one hit killers like flying robotic mines - that reduce any error margin). This VR missions can be completed as fast as possible to get more cash and unlock other abilities and armors in the main campaign. Although it's enjoyable and very graphic (you can chop bodies and robots in the air with your blades) I enjoyed the mini campaign with wolf even more. I felt this cyber dog and the geckos could have had a bigger role in the main gameplay (scouting out and going through places unreachable to the main character) and the amount of content pales in comparison to other fighting/adventure titles like 'Batman Arkham City' or any 'Assassin's Creed'. The storyline is cool but then again it's too short to really make an impact, everything happens too fast and the last levels are a series of epic and imaginative boss battles. The 90s like' rock soundtrack will keep the adrenaline pumping till you drop  - playing on harder difficulty levels sure submits you to a lot of grinding and rough fights you will not always survive...","July 25, 2015","true","47.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dj_malloc/recommended/235460/","dj_malloc","Malloc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dj_malloc/","1185 products in account","Wasn't sure what to expect from this and walked away pleasantly surprised. It's a lot closer to the source material than I was expecting it to be; I was dreading a Metroid Other M style disaster, where a 3rd party's take on a beloved franchise falls horribly flat. Thankfully not the case here!\n\nIt's kind of a pleasant hybrid between MGS and Bayonetta. The storytelling is Metal Gear style, which is to say a LOT of cutscenes, an openly (and playfully) bonkers plot about the nature of war, memetics, what makes us human, etc, and tons of codec conversations. While there is technically stealth, it's not the focus of the game and things seem to push you towards just going balls out in the combat.\n\nI won't ruin the story, as it's interesting enough to merit paying attention to the first time through, especially if you're a Metal Gear fan. It slots neatly in after MGS4, and while it's not anywhere near as far reaching, it works as a decent side story focused on Raiden. You don't really need to have played any of the previous games to follow along, although you'll miss some references.\n\nThe ending fight, for what it's worth, is one of the most gleefully batshit insane things you are ever likely to witness. It's a combination of a lengthy stoner discourse on the sustainability of the military industrial complex and a wrestling/shouting match between the Hulk and an amalgamation of every 80s Ninja Trope ever. With mechs. And slapstick comedy. I didn't think anyone would top Metal Gear Solid 2's fighting-the-president-with-ninja-swords-on-top-of-a-doomsday-weapon-in-New-York thing, but Rising sure gives it the old college try. The only major difference is that Rising is openly aware of how nuts the proceedings are; while it never breaks character, it's clearly not trying to take itself overly seriously all the same.\n\nIf you've seen the original RoboCop, kind of the same idea. The insanity is delivered with a straight face throughout, and that's what makes it work. In some ways, it even works better than the "main" Metal Gear series.\n\nThe PC port runs fine, I didn't have any issues at all. Not a whole ton of options for graphics but still better than usual for a console port. It comes with all the DLC baked in, so that's nice. You're going to want a gamepad, though.\n\nThe game itself isn't without some issues. Camera's finicky as all hell and can (and will, often) unhelpfully point your field of view directly into the nearest wall right as five tons of angry cyborg starts punching Raiden in the back of the head. There's also an abundance of quicktime events, some of which are instantly fatal if you fail then, which isn't horrible in and of itself but the game gets very confused if you're holding any buttons when the prompt appears. More than once I was in the middle of combat only to suddenly get tossed into a QTE, have it accept an incorrect button input because I was in the middle of hitting Jump or whatever, and result in an instant death. The best bet is to lay off the controller entirely when the QTEs surface, and just go into things aware that you're probably going to get an unfair death at least a couple times until you know what's coming next. The game has forgiving checkpoints however, so the occasional cheap death really doesn't detract from the proceedings all that terribly much, it's just mildly annoying.\n\nThis is also a game clearly designed for repeat playthroughs. I beat the campaign on normal in two sittings in one day; don't take this as a negative, though. There's a ton of unlockables, the harder difficulties ramp up CONSIDERABLY if you're looking for a challenge, and there's a ton of VR missions and other things to play around with once you've given the game a run through. If you're willing to spend some time on it, this game could actually last for quite a while and takes a good amount of dedication to really master.\n\nI streamed my entire playthrough in two chunks. Feel free to browse around if you want to see bits of the game in action.\n\nPart 1: http://www.twitch.tv/mattdjwarner/b/494718267\nPart 2: http://www.twitch.tv/mattdjwarner/b/494857660","January 12, 2014","true","16.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chopsuey444/recommended/235460/","chopsuey444","Chop Suey!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chopsuey444/","208 products in account","I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the annoucement that Konami and Platinum Games were bringing this title to the PC. Now, truth be told, I was a little bit nervous when I saw it being ported to PC simply because Platinum Games haven't had much of a track record when it came to PC games/ports, but I decided to push my luck and pre-purchase this game again. I say again because I already owned it on the Xbox 360.\n\nTurns out my luck paid off, as did the luck of countless others that purchased this title. Amazingly, Konami and Platinum Games seem to have done a wonderful job of porting the game onto PC, minus a few issues that a few users are getting, but to be fair, most games have some form of issues on a day one release.\n\nGraphics wise, turning all the available settings down to their lowest makes the game look quite similar to its console counterpart. I have not tested what the game looks and runs like at the highest possible settings, simply because I'm not sure if my machine could handle it, but I'm willing to bet the game looks rather good with everything cranked up to max. Most of the options you would find in an average PC game nowadays are included, although resolutions only go up to 1920 by 1080, so if you are one of the few rich people that have a 4K resolution monitor, you'll be sad to hear this game won't support it.\n\nGameplay wise, this game is a solid opposite of your standard Metal Gear Solid game, with a healthy focus on action as you hack and slash your way through numerous enemies, although a light stealth element is prevailent throughout the game. Most of your surroundings can be manipulated by your blade in some shape or form, with trees and cars often splitting into multiple parts. The same can be held true to your enemies as well, with the ability to slice them into hundreds if not thousands of pieces before ripping out their spines. You actually get rewarded for doing this as well by getting all your energy back, which you will need as the game goes on.\n\nThe dramatic set-pieces in the game stand out as some of the most jaw dropping moments you'll see and expreience, ranging from parrying the sword arm of a giant robot before launching it into the air and bisecting it straight down the middle set to one of the most hype pieces of music you'll ever hear, to fighting a man made out of magnets in a collosal rainstorm. No, I'm not making that up either.\n\nSpeaking of music, the music, THE MUSIC. SWEET JESUS, THE MUSIC. The musical pieces in this game are some of the best that have ever been produced by both companies, rivalling that of the pieces from both MGS3 and MGS4. Every boss has their own track that gets more and more intense as the fight goes on, cullminating in some of the most BRUTAL lyrics as the fight draws to a close. That doesn't mean that all the best music is limited to boss fights though; standard encounters with the enemy mooks are equally satisfying in terms of music.\n\nBoth of the DLCs that focus on different characters are equally impressive, providing players an insight into what happens before the main events of the game. In addition, you also get all the DLC from various pre-orders and consoles for free! BARGIN!\n\nOverall, there isn't much more I can really say about this game without actually spoiling it. If you like exceptionally hype, over-the-top action sequences set to epic music, compelte with a somwhat impressive storyline to boot, then you should definately consider buying this game. Let's hope for a sequel, eh?","January 9, 2014","true","21.0"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Liaterasu/recommended/235460/","Liaterasu","Tuna Cat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Liaterasu/","172 products in account","Okay, let me start this by saying that Metal Gear Rising is one of the best, if not the best hack and slash game I've ever played. MONEY WELL SPENT!! I think it has a lot of things you could want in a game of this genre, especially being able to slash enemies and world items into tiny bits and pieces. Like god, did any other game let you slash up a whole ferris wheel to bits? There's also a minor stealth system and a parry/dodge system, and those are really nice aditions to the game. You can also gain additional outfits, weapons, sub-weapons and skills in your customization menu as you go!\n\nAnyway, I think the port was fantastic. And I'm a keyboard+mouse user, so people saying you can't play this game with kb+m at all are dead wrong. I had no issues with anything, and if I needed to swap keys positions, I could do that no problem. All in all I'll just say the gameplay was all amazing to me and I have no complaints. All the things it lets you do in the game are seriously mad fun.\n\nNow let me throw a word in about the visuals. MGR is one of those games that looks beautiful even on low quality! So you don't really have to worry about it looking ugly if you're in need for FPS.\n\nWhat else.. oh OH, the music. Good GOD the music is amazing. It's just right for a game like this, so of course I just had to get the OSTs after I beat the game.\n\nStory and characters? It is sad that the story is quite short, but it's pretty nice and touching, and there's also plenty of humor in this. The characters are so great, too. I don't think it's possible to actually dislike anyone in this game, they seem so well developed. And before I played the game, I thought Raiden was going to be some boring killing machine, but I was wrong, so wrong. He's amazing.\nLet's not forget about the DLCs. You get to play as Jetstream Sam and Bladewolf, which offers even more fun to the game, since both of those characters have different skills. There's also VR missions.\n\nNow then, list of things that might bother other people + bugs that I know of:\n-It's a linear game. I don't have issues with those type of games but yeah.\n-Low fps will hinder you with completing a crucial part of the fight during the last boss battle. So make sure you have around 60.\n\nOH WHAT DO YOU KNOW. That's all. Now go buy this game.","February 10, 2014","true","36.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This game contains a unique style of gameplay and introduces a feature known as blade mode which takes a while to get used to, and it contains many unique bosses and an amazing soundtrack. However like all games there are downsides, the game is very short it took me less than 4 hours to complete it and it would take me one hour if i was speed running (this depends on the difficulty i play on), the vr missions are boring and repetitive and if you are using a controller (which you are most likely going to be using) the controlls are unresponsive and you are very likely to fail most button mashing sequences, luckily you can avoid all of them but it will make the game longer, however this issue is not on the ps3 version of the game and i do not have a 360 so i wouldnt know,\n\nI rate metal gear rising: revengeance 9/10","June 8, 2015","true","57.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Customization options are all there, good amount of video options, windowed mode, full keyboard control customization, Xbox pad support (though I used my PS4 controller and a program to make it work as a 360 controller), everything.\n\nI can safetly give this port a 100% recommendation without hesitation, If you've never played a PlatinumGames action game, you're in for a real treat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Serret/recommended/235460/","Serret","Serret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Serret/","894 products in account","This is the game that made me understand why everyone praises Platinum Games to the heavens.\nIt's an absolute must play!\n\nUPDATE 1:When I initially reviewed this game I mentioned the fact that you couldn't play it offline, but it turns out it wasn't intended to be that way. It wa a Steam Api related but and Platinum Games\Konami moved to apply a fix for it in less than 24h.\nSo good work on that one!\n\nUPDATE 2: I've played the game for a bit longer and it's been an amazing experience so far. The gameplay is fast paced and flashy but it's not a brainless button masher, you actually require some finesse to pull parries and combos at the right time.\nBlade mode is extremely satisfying, allowing you to slice the enemies into pieces in all directions.\nEvery battle has this epic feel to it, and the soundtrack is just the cherry on top of the cake as the battle themes slowly progress to their climax as the battle reaches it's conclusion.\n\n\nEarly Review:\n\nI haven't played for very long but so far the game seems interesting.\nThe art-style is great but the graphics do seem a bit dated for a 2013 game, I'm playing it at 1920x1080 and you do notice the low-res textures on both characters and scenario. No doubt because it's a console port, and even with these imperfections the game does look pretty and honestly with everything in motion and so much action you barely even notice it.\n\nGameplay-wise the game is very very good. As I've stated I haven't gone very deep into the game but it actually plays rather well on a mouse\keyboard, even blade mode works with the mouse which came as a good surprise since it's a port and usually developers don't bother optimizing this kind of thing.\nI'll still probably play it with a gamepad in the end, but it's good to know that they went all in to support mouse and keyboard too.\n\nIn terms of performance the minimum requirements on the page may be a bit over-cautious, considering it lists an i5 as being required and I'm running the game pretty much maxed @50~60fps on a Core 2 Duo machine I built back in 2007...\nSo I don't think performance will be a problem for anyone. The game runs surprisingly well!\n\nI don't really know the console version of this game so I don't know if it has Japanese VO with English subtitles but I was rather disappointed to find out that I'm stuck with English VO on the PC version.\nThe soundtrack with plenty of melodic death metal tracks, totally makes up for it! It has to be one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a game. Fighting Metal Gear Ray to "RULES OF NATURE" is an epic experience \m/ >_< \m/ *headbang*\n\n\nThis game may be a port, but while it's not perfect but it's pretty close!\nRegardless of it's imperfections, Metal Gear Rising's fantastic gameplay combined with one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard makes me mark it as a MUST PLAY.","January 9, 2014","true","13.7"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahodo/recommended/235460/","mahodo","General Lee Aroused","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahodo/","1002 products in account","Hands down one of the best ways a canon Metal Gear spinoff game could've been handled. Filled with explosive action (and actual explosive action), gripping boss fight designs, and an amazing original soundtrack composed for each stage of the game to fit the theme that'll expresses the story behind it.\n\nDeveloped by Platinum Games, the home of the "extreme combat hack 'n slash" genre brings a new element to the sub-genre, with precision cutting to cripple or incapitate foes. But that doesn't mean the other areas are left with less focus, still holding true to its spiritual predecessors and its roots, it retains its fast-paced combat, over-the-top boss fights, and even the surprising option to the genre to reward stealth manuevers or no-kill combat.\n\nThough that doesn't mean the game is without some flaws of its own, things that I unfortunately am not fond of are:\n\nLinear level design, while there are some different paths to go for possible stealth segments, they are very obvious when and when they don't want you to try sneak past your foes. Its a nice option, but its a limited option that is merely there for its previous roots. Its also a really bad idea to cut everything in the environment sometimes, its fun, but you could've parkour'd over it to find goodies, or use it to hide.\n\nLimited resolution options, I am unable to play the game in my native resolution of 1600x900 and was only able to play it at 1366x768. While it didn't impede my experience by much, it might have a more negative impact for people wanting to play at a much higher resolution.\n\nLocked 60 FPS, while I understand that the speed of the game is tied to the FPS, it takes a ridiculous dump when there's too much happening on the screen at once, or you're cutting something into pieces a bit too much. There isn't much of a fix, the only advice I can give you is that if you've already cut it into something smaller than mincemeat, STOP, HE'S ALREADY DEAD, JUST STOP. Its fun to see how many pieces you can cut them into, but know when to draw the line!\n\nThis is a clear console port, while it doesn't mean that you should avoid it like the plague, its designed to be played with the controller. You're punishing yourself if you decide to play this on a mouse and keyboard, go get a controller.\n\nIts a short experience, about only 6-7 hours long tops with the base game campaign, but the PC edition bundled it with the two DLC stories and VR mission pack that extends its playtime a little more than the base game would have had. It doesn't mean it suffers replayability issues, in fact, it has plenty of replayability if you wish to tackle it at a higher difficulty, or with Raiden a little bit more fleshed and loaded out.\n\n\n\nWhile MGR is not written by the infamously confusing and perplexing Hideo Kojima, the story works wonders in blending in with the MG universe to be equally confusing, but an enthralling experience and should definitely be something to consider, even if you aren't a Metal Gear veteran.","January 15, 2014","true","24.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I've had an absolute blast with it. I want more!\nThe game doesn't handhold you at all, I would recommend watching a guide on how to play to start with, but once you're aware of the basic moves and mechanics it then becomes a case of mastering them. The grading system acts as an incentive to get better because who doesn't like getting top grades, right? Fights gradually ramp up in difficulty and complexity but they never feel unfair because you unlock upgrades, skills and weapons that give you your edge back. This also gives it great replayability as you work your way through the difficulty levels earning enough BP to buy all those new weapons and stuff.\nThe soundtrack for this game is outstanding and adds to the atmosphere and pace of the game as well as making you feel really pumped for the fights. The songs really shine during the boss fights where lyrics or sections of that bosses theme kick in at certain fight cues adding to the spectacle. The lyrics help explain the bosses backgrounds and motivations too which is a cool little touch.\nOverall this is my favourite game so far this year and I love the fact that the more effort you put into this the more you get back.\nBuy it, play it, parry it.","August 9, 2014","true","127.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I didn't think much about it, having never played a Metal Gear Solid title before, and I was sort of just... indifferent. Then a bunch of my classmates played it, and heard about how good it was, and how much fun it was... and that the music was amazing.\n\nEventually, I picked this up for $15 during the Summer Sale.\n\nI don't know why I never got this sooner. It's very fast paced, but also rewards you for doing extra bits, and has a little bit of exploration for some extra little goodies. Stuff like extra health, VR missions, codecs, etc... But the combat. Oh my god, the combat. It's difficult at first. And it takes a little bit to realize what you should be doing. But once everything clicks... it's amazing.\n\nFor starters, most people will likely just try and slice/dice their way through most things. And for a little bit... it works. I'm not saying it doesn't work, but it will only get you so far. There are 2 things to keep in mind for this game, PARRYING and  ZANDATSU. Knowing how to use these techniques effectivley will not only make the game smoother, but flow better, and allow for the best enjoyment of the game.\n\nParrying is explained as, "block incoming attacks with [X] + direction". What it's not specifically saying, it basically, if they're attack in front, block front, if they're coming from behind, block backwards. Not the angle of attack (I don't know how I thought that made sense), but the actual direction they're attacking from. Don't worry, a certain boss fight will quickly teach you that ;). Also, you can repeatedly parry. It's not a "hold" type thing. You can block multiple strikes.\n\nZandatsu makes sense... at first. Screen goes "blue", you can go into Blade mode to slice up the enemy for an insta-kill. If the gauge (below your health) if full, it auto-locks onto the place you're supposed to cut to regain health. Otherwise, manual aim. You can slice vertical with [Y] or horizontal with [X]. You can also slice with the right analog stick.\n\nIMPORTANT! You won't slice when you flick the stick in that direction; that just determines the angle, releasing it cuts (this is a very important note for the final boss... just saying. Not many seem to be aware of it... or I wasn't).\n\nOkay, now that that stuff is out of the way...\n\nThe overall game makes enough sense to work, but is kind of absurd in it's own way. And yet, that's part of the charm. It's over-the-top, and every boss encounter gets progressively more insane. Once you get the hang of the mechanics, and lear to find you're combat preference (as you can decide which unique weapons to use), it's an incredibly fun romp.\n\nI'm not someone who considers themselves to be all that good when it comes to actions games, yet I still managed to beat this game. I recommend this if you've ever wanted to try this series, or are just looking for another action game fix.\n\nIt contains all the DLC, which means there's even a kick-♥♥♥ prologue (still have to work on that) and some extra VR missions to polish you're skills.\n\nOh, and the soundtrack just makes this game.","October 1, 2014","true","15.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoiamveetreeull/recommended/235460/","hoiamveetreeull","Temmonomicon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoiamveetreeull/","93 products in account","Just finished my first playthrough after buying the game today, (on easy (read first before commenting about scrub difficulty (wow, s c r u b is censored. screw you steam))) and I found it quite different. Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is part of the Metal Gear series from the same people, but don't let the name fool you. This game revolves around the action and killing, rather than stealth (although it does have stealth mechanics and the familiar things from MGS like the alert timer, the call sound, the being spotted sound, the main protagonist having a gravelly voice, a very nice throwback with the introduction of the cardboard box which made me laugh, etc) and creates a very different and unique experience.\n\nLet's start with the options and controls. When you go through the options menu and start changing visual settings, they actually apply as you do them. This is the single most horrible idea I have ever seen in a game. Why? Because of changing the resolution. When you first get the game (or at least when I did), it started windowed and in a small resolution. As I clicked the resolution meter to get it up to my resolution, it got bigger as I upped it. This was really annoying as I had to keep moving the cursor to get to the arrow each time. Imagine that on a 4K monitor. Honestly, it's better to have the standard 'apply changes' button that you click after changing the settings. Another thing I found when editing the options was that the arrow that brings something down a step (e.g. changing sensitivity for mouse movement) did not work. When I tried to click it, the game thought I'd clicked the up button instead. A little gripe I found there. Other than that, you've got standard keymapping and controller presets, which is good. Although the controls for keymapping is really dumb. To edit a keymap, you either double click(?) or press the enter key over the selected action in the list. But at the bottom, the UI says that enter is 'Confirm', which is really confusing because normally when keymapping, the confirm button is to confirm the current settings for mapped keys. Instead, you have to back out of the menu and it gives a prompt asking you to confirm whether you want to save the keymap. Why not change the instruction on the UI to 'Edit Key'?\n\nNow for the gameplay. When you click 'Play Game' for the first time, it goes to another menu which the single option of 'New Game'. This is really uneccessary to have, especially for the first time you play the game, since if you load the game again later with a saved game, there's a continue game button above the play game button. Then you're given a difficulty choice and the option of doing the tutorial (although I've only ever played the game once, so I don't know if it appears once or if you're choosing a low difficulty). I highly reccommend the tutorial once you start the game because it shows you some very basic things that you should know when you start (although it doesn't explain that moving the mouse in Blade Mode changes the angle of the slice, which is something I didn't learn until the final boss. I'm not even kidding. (It's also why I found Sundowner really hard) But that's something we'll get to later). Once you finish the tutorial, you're dropped right into the opening cutscene with no backstory of what's going on. Although it's an action game, the plot is actually one of the best things about the game and I think some details and characters were glossed over (especially Raiden). After the cutscene, you're given a couple easy fights with some cyborgs to get you into the main gameplay (especially if you skipped the tutorial). If you're like me, you'll notice almost instantly that the actual swordfighting doesn't give very good feedback. However, the feeling of fighting does get better as you play through the game and fight through much harder challenges. You're presented with some interesting choices through levels, should you go through, violently murder every single person in a place to get their points or sneak, that sort of thing and there's not really much penalty for either (unless you want to buy stuff from the shop, in which case, the fighting where all the points are). The gameplay is very good, but don't go in expecting miracles like I did, or you'll be severely disappointed, though.\n\nPlot. I have mentioned a few things about this in the gameplay section, but I do think it is worth making a section for. Like I said, some details are very glossed over, it almost feels like there's cutscenes missing between levels. The main game is very story-centric and yet it doesn't have as much story as it should do. Glossing aside, there's some very nice humour and references in the narrative along with some great voice acting. So I guess if you're not one for backstory in a story-driven game, this is the game for you.\n\nSo overrall. Or the TL;DR, if you will.\nPros:\n- Great story with a lot of feeling for the main character and a great ending\n- Great characters and voice acting\n- Plenty of humour and references\n- The feel of fighting is good after the first few segments\n- Choice between standard MGS stealthing through a level or fighting your way through for more points\n- Different, especially for a Metal Gear game\n\nCons:\n- Hiccups in options menu\n- Some controls and fighting not really explained well in tutorial\n- Some details are glossed over and/or feel like they are missing from the story\n- Difficulty level is a little silly. The final boss was incredibly hard (it's not supposed to be easy, but I was playing on easy and it was the kind of difficulty I would expect from Dark Souls or Touhou)\n\nSo I was just about to click the post review button when my left hand twitched and alt-tabbed me back into the game, as I was on the credits list at the time I was writing this. I then stared at the screen with a dropped jaw for around five minutes after seeing one name:\n\nCrispin Freeman.\n\nThat added ∞ points to my rating for this game, as he is a legendary VA and I barely even noticed him as Sundowner, because he was doing the voice so well. I reccommend this game to anyone and everyone now, as long as they can handle all the bad things I've listed.\n\n7+∞/10, Kojima, you sly sons of ♥♥♥♥♥es.\n\nEDIT: It turns out Raiden is a thing in the MGS universe, but they could have at least had a slightly thing about that instead of a few lines about his past here and there, especially for people who haven't played m/any MGS games.","October 25, 2014","true","58.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I didn't pay attention to the story and skipped the cutscenes, dialogue, incoming phone calls, and never made a call. Just wasn't what I was looking for and not having played any Metal Gear game I would have been lost anyway.\n\nThe soundtrack is incredible! The boss tracks especially are really really memorable, and going with high octane lyrical songs was the perfect choice.

Cutting your enemy in the way you want.\nAnd with the Blade mode you can use Zandatsu (Cut and Take), in which Raiden cut the power core out of the enemy and using it for himself, which is pretty useful and it looks pretty awesome.\nThe only problem with the gameplay is the camera, which can be very bad sometimes.\n\nNow comes one of my highlights in this game: The Bossfights.\nPlatinum Games used their knowedge from Bayonetta and Vanquish for the design and dynamic music during bossfights.\nNone of the bossfights were boring nor annoying. They were unique in music and style.\nThe music is changing whenever you attack a different spot, a different location , an event happens or when you are in blade mode. The music is instrumental at that time until you reach the climax of the battle. Then the vocal version of the song begin to play and you know that something awesome will happen soon.\n\nMGR is truly a very good Hack n Slash game, but because of the camera the flow of gameplay can be disturbed and the bad character recognition makes most of the characters "useless".\n\nI would give it a 8/10.\n\nThe sequel of MGR has a lot of potential and when Platinum Games will listen to the critics, MGR 2 could be an awesome successor.","January 11, 2014","true","22.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There really isn't any way to dodge attacks effictively, you have to learn how to block properly, which takes some time to get used to.\n\nThe game has a total of 5 difficulty settings, which range from pretty easy to ♥♥♥♥ing impossible.\n\nAlso, there are so-called VR-missions, basically certain scenarios with tasks you have to complete within a certain time limit - some of those are extremely hard, so if you're up for a tough challenge, this is for you.\n\nThis games main story is fairly short (5-6 hours most likely).\n\nYou get 2 more short DLC stories and as I said, plenty of VR-missions and multiple difficulty settings. People who live playing for a high score on insane difficulties should like that.\nIt's much like Devil May Cry in that aspect.","July 21, 2014","true","43.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

A couple things you might need to know, though:\n1. This is not a Metal Gear SOLID game, but it is a Metal Gear game.  It's just Metal Gear RISING, which means you control Raiden instead of Snake.  Stealth gameplay is no longer a major factor.  I hear MGSV is a thing, so you'll get your fix later.\n2. This is a character-action game.  If you usually use a controller for such things, now is the time to hook it up.  The keyboard controls, however, are surprisingly good.  I made only minor adjustments and played it comfortably.   Unfortunately, a controller is required for the Konami code, but that just unlocks all difficulties early.\n3. This game is rather intense.  You should probably consider getting everything done BEFORE sitting down to play the game; you won't be leaving that chair anytime soon.\n4. Jetstream Sam is WAY harder than Raiden.  Play through Raiden's campaign first, lest your heart explode from frustration.\n\nIf all of the above appeals to you, or at least does not offend you too greatly, you should definitely give this a shot.  The action is fluid, and the bosses are literally the best I've fought to date.","January 16, 2014","true","170.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

Thankfully a lot of the text is optional so you can just go through the game for the gameplay. Even better, compared to the original console release there's not just two chapters with very different playstyles available after you beat the main campaign, but also a set of 30 extra missions you can take a stab at if you feel like challenging yourself. And, unlike another infamous console port, this does have decent keyboard and mouse controls. If you want a good action game with very impressive moments, I highly reccommend Revengeance.

That’s just only some slice/slashes you can actually do. Giving a whole new spin to action games, we the gamers are given the power to cut-slice-slash through any object, material, plant, human, cyborg, robot, mech, and etc. In a 360 degree fashion. To be honest I was quite surprised at such a cool mechanic that I took it like fish to water. I admit, shamefully I spent half of the time slicing through any object I could find (bars, containers, watermelon, barrel, cars, etc.) to test out the blade mode. And in fact it worked splendidly; even when I had reduced a tree to just splinters I could cut through a small amount of it and further reduce it to bits!\n\nNever had I played a game utilizing this mechanic in which we the player are granted with such a simple skill. Giving me great pleasure slicing my enemies down horizontally or vertically, I am proud to say that such a fine game complements it’s fast-paced story.\n\nGranted, I’ve never played any Metal Gear games, so this first entry left quite an everlasting impression on me. To see Raiden’s story unfold past the events of MGS 4. Even if I’m the one controlling Raiden, the story isn’t lacking, there are side characters that give you a sense of break after the fighting is done.\n\nGame play wise: I thoroughly enjoyed cutting my enemies in any angle I saw fit. The enemies were pretty challenging and difficult imo. (Or I just suck really badly for them to curb-stomp me)\n\nThe bosses I would say considering the game is relatively short (You can finish the main story-line in under 8 hours.)  customization options to unlock new skills, improve your weapons, outlook, and even hp.  Stealth optional killing, if you want to go sword blazing that’s fine too.\n\nOverall the game-play was satisfying(oh so satisfying), yes I could slice up any enemy I want however I want, and yes the story complimented the game-play, yet a question comes to mind still.\n\nIs it good?\nWell.... Hmmmm It’s not bad. And yet it isn’t a masterpiece. There are only 1 thing that irritated me greatly which is just the length of the story.\n\nStory; It’s short. Clocking in under 6 hours for my completion of the main storyline, without virtual reality missions, and the side-missions. The story is short imo.

Throughout the whole game, so  speculating on my part any longer In terms of story would just become a real drag to play. Because then it just repeats in a cycle of:\n\nCut-scene! > Roaming! > Action! > Cut-scene > Roaming > Action! > Repeat.\n\nYes, the sequence above becomes a bit overbearing at times because the process goes through a linear format that becomes annoying in a sense(or they mix it up).\n\nBy no means however just because the sequence above make the experience any less enjoyable, the sequence above would become very boring and dull if Platinum Games had extended the story-line past 6 hours.\n\n6 hours and less in my run proved to be one of the most difficult, shocking runs I’ve had to accomplish. Not because I played on normal. But, because initially I severely underestimated  my enemies  A LOT  and it bit me in the ♥♥♥ for my arrogance, to even think so.\n\nThe problem is I like blocking in games where I could just block an enemy then attack.

It was frustrating, to die over and over again, but that’s life I guess to learn from failure and come back again!

You'll find yourself dodging and guarding more then parrying, atleast thats how i ended up. the parry and guard button are the same, so you might end up doing one thing you didn't mean to do, which can screw up a good chance to get a hit in. But this doesn't really effect much honestly. The story is ok, it makes the cutscenes worth watching, it is a metal gear game after all. The graphics are amazing, especially in the cutscenes, and the boss fights and themes are epic. The enemies are diverse and each have a different way of being defeated, which could require some sub-weapons that you wouldn't expect to use, like a grenade or a rocket launcher. So the game really pushes you to try out its features, and while on the topic of features, there is a feature called blade mode, which is easily the most satisfying thing ever. you get a chance to chop your enemy into pieces, and rip out their spines, then crush it. And you do this to fully regain health, and fuel charge, which is what powers blade mode. There are also customization options, you can customize your main characters weapon, sub-weapon, hair, outfit, and also upgrade his life and fuel cell gauges. The achievements are fun to obtain and have some good challenges in order to get them, and have great rewards that can help through harder playthroughs of the game. The characters are likable, and all have a deeper meaning behind them, especially the character you play as. As for DLC, this game gives two DLC stories for free, you just have to enter the konami code in the title screen. (Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a) the code only works with a controller. This gives you access to the two DLc stories, where you play as two bosses that re-appear in the main storyline, and play through their own story up until they are seen in the main storyline. Each character in the DLC stories have a different style of combat opposed to the character you play as through the main story, and are each fun to play around with. The soundtrack is the best part, awesome rock music plays in the background of every single fight, and really sets the mood of the game. Each boss theme is sounding appropriate for the type of boss, and the story behind the boss. The bosses, while on that topic, also rock. They range from big to small, and are taken town in awesome and innovative ways, especially toward the end of the game. Heck, even the title screen shows you are in for a ride. As for specs, its a big game, so make sure you have a beefy computer if you really want to experience the game fully.\n\nTL;DR: its a great game with awesome combat, bosses and storyline, has cool customization and a kick-butt sound track.\n\nOverall: 9/10","October 24, 2014","true","32.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

And that's a little something called fun.\n\nThere are various arguments as to why fun has been missing from video games as of late, ones that vary from person to person. Some people don't even think fun is missing at all. Personally, the reason I haven't been finding fun in video games recently is because they're too focused on trying to be pretentious, too focused on trying to be "Cinematic experiences", too stupidly easy to come away with any kind of self worth for beating it due to a massive lack of challenge since they want to pander to casual audiences. MGR is none of these things.\n\nFun is that exhilirating feeling that widens your eyes and puts a huge ♥♥♥♥ eating grin on your face. Fun is that motivator to do something more than once. Fun is exactly what Metal Gear Rising is. Metal Gear Rising is at heart, a Video Game. And a good one at that. When an uptempo music reaches it's crescendo as you lift a giant robot 50+ times your size and throw it several yards away to then cut it into ribbons with a small sword, as you feel your cheeks stretching into a smile, you realize that you're having fun.\n\nOn top of that, this game is actually challenging. You have to react quickly to attacks, you have to work at becoming better at the game, and that's part of the fun. Sure, I may have beaten the game in a short 8 hours or so, but I didn't listen to codecs and the game is nowhere near finished. There's still unlockables, harder difficulties, and S ranks that await me when I feel like "Rising" to the challenge. Which I will. Besides, those "Just 8 hours" contained some of the most memorable soundtracks, boss fights, and setpieces that I've seen and heard in over a decade.\n\nI've been waiting out this port for a long time. I could have just gotten it for PS3, sure. But it was so worth it to wait for the PC version. Besides, I want to help show Platinum Games that there is a market for their work on PC.\n\nThis is actually not that bad of a port. I thought it was going to be a disaster of Dark Souls and Deadly Premonition proportions considering the fact that Platinum Games is new to PC, but the port is actually not bad, and the recommended specs on the store page are slightly overblown a bit. I think I know why. This is the kind of game you want to run at 60fps due to the incredibly fast paced gameplay and have a little leeway with due to the slicing system. Totally understandable. I hope that we can see future Metal Gear installments and games by Platinum make it to PC. Platinum Games is an awesome developer and pretty much all of their games deserve your money, so if you have a console I would go pick up more by them if you like this game.","January 9, 2014","true","24.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

That’s just only some slice/slashes you can actually do. Giving a whole new spin to action games, we the gamers are given the power to cut-slice-slash through any object, material, plant, human, cyborg, robot, mech, and etc. In a 360 degree fashion. To be honest I was quite surprised at such a cool mechanic that I took it like fish to water. I admit, shamefully I spent half of the time slicing through any object I could find (bars, containers, watermelon, barrel, cars, etc.) to test out the blade mode. And in fact it worked splendidly; even when I had reduced a tree to just splinters I could cut through a small amount of it and further reduce it to bits!\n\nNever had I played a game utilizing this mechanic in which we the player are granted with such a simple skill. Giving me great pleasure slicing my enemies down horizontally or vertically, I am proud to say that such a fine game complements it’s fast-paced story.\n\nGranted, I’ve never played any Metal Gear games, so this first entry left quite an everlasting impression on me. To see Raiden’s story unfold past the events of MGS 4. Even if I’m the one controlling Raiden, the story isn’t lacking, there are side characters that give you a sense of break after the fighting is done.\n\nGame play wise: I thoroughly enjoyed cutting my enemies in any angle I saw fit. The enemies were pretty challenging and difficult imo. (Or I just suck really badly for them to curb-stomp me)\n\nThe bosses I would say considering the game is relatively short (You can finish the main story-line in under 8 hours.)  customization options to unlock new skills, improve your weapons, outlook, and even hp.  Stealth optional killing, if you want to go sword blazing that’s fine too.\n\nOverall the game-play was satisfying(oh so satisfying), yes I could slice up any enemy I want however I want, and yes the story complimented the game-play, yet a question comes to mind still.\n\nIs it good?\nWell.... Hmmmm It’s not bad. And yet it isn’t a masterpiece. There are only 1 thing that irritated me greatly which is just the length of the story.\n\nStory; It’s short. Clocking in under 6 hours for my completion of the main storyline, without virtual reality missions, and the side-missions. The story is short imo. Usually a game would be 10 hours + in my book for it to be a very noteworthy satisfactory in my book, however I’ll make an exception to this rule because of MGR:Re because it’s so action packed, and kept me on my toes!(And poor controller abuse).

The music in this game in general all very cool and she picked up very well and sets a half drive of the game. Generally, the work with the music in this game in terms of quality reminds me FLCL.\nExcellent and interesting characters.\nA large number of military philosophy.\nThe war is still terrible and disgusting.\nGreat work of director and interesting conversations.Generally the game came out a very exciting and interesting. It all performed at a very high level. The story part is very intriguing and interesting, although sometimes predictable. Gameplay is very complex and interesting, it has a poor balance and not a huge amount of ways to kill enemies. Each boss in the game is very interesting and each needs an individual mode of fighting, though confused by that one of the toughest opponents in the game - Monsoon is the second order and the boss fight with him is very difficult and exhausting. The game also has a pretty interesting "blade mode" that allows you to cut down opponents with surgical precision cutting off arms, legs, head and other body parts. Obvious drawbacks of the game I want to highlight only the outdated graphics, which may deter some players. This game I loved and I recommend it for everybody, just to be able to familiarize themselves with the magnificent universe Metal Gear.\n____\nRULES OF NATUREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","July 21, 2014","true","13.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Revengeance. Get it? Ha.\n\nThe story might be a tad confusing, but it deals with some eerily realistic near-future problems related to human transcendence, artificial body enhancements, private militaries, cyborgs and nanomachines.\nThe cutscenes are a real screenshot-fest, I was keeping a finger near my screenshot button at ALL TIMES while playing. The visuals are mind blowing and completely over the top.\n\nThe game mechanics are almost flawless, allowing you a degree of precision and freedom I've rarely seen in a game of this genre (or any genre, actually). Major props to the guys who ported the game from consoles to PC, as mouse and keyboard controls are tight, responsive, and actually offer a larger degree of freedom in a certain game aspect (freeform sword control, you control the sword trajectory with your mouse with ENORMOUS precision).\n\nWhat I loved about the game the most is that, after a while, you start getting better and better, not by upgrading your character (although that helps, too!) but by actively learning to play, run, fight and use the environment to your advantage. In a few hours you'll be curb-stomping war mechs and cyborgs alike, dodging their attacks and one-shotting them with utmost precision. It feels wonderful.\n\nThere is also the DLC from the consoles, adding some additional story and challenges.\n\nRecommended!!!","June 19, 2014","true","35.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacegiko/recommended/235460/","spacegiko","Lucas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spacegiko/","232 products in account","hmm\n\nAll signs are pointing to this being a fanservice game.\n\nIt's probably the best game that PlatinumGames has developed, maybe tied with Bayonetta.\n\nThe general tone and pacing of Metal Gear Rising is much different than other Metal Gear games, but the method of revealing lore through codec calls was retained. This was inappropriate for the pacing of Metal Gear Rising, and the resulting incongruence was disappointingly jarring. Only a small portion of the lore revealed through codec calls was of the caliber of previous Metal Gear games, which was also disappointing. The story was rickety, and the ending was especially weak.\n\nThe long dialogue between Senator Armstrong and Raiden was lacking in conviction or basis in the real world, so it was difficult to relate to. Gave me the feeling of "Hmm, this is kind of BS." This is another big disappointment, because the topic of the overgrown military industrial complex in the United States is very interesting and relevant, but its presentation in this game fell flat because the moral grayness of the industry and its participants was not explored much at all(as would be expected of a game in the Metal Gear franchise). Instead, the industry's portrayal was borderline sophomoric, shoehorned into a morally black and white nutshell that was not interesting or notable at all(not even fit for a shonen manga).\n\nThe game also makes a few statements about media manipulation and memes. Again, because these subject matters were not explored as much as they would have been in a real Metal Gear game, the fact that they're even there doesn't feel natural.\n\nBecause of the faster pace of the game, the time between boss battles was much shorter. Exposition of the villains and antagonistic organizations of the game was truncated, so I was left feeling like there wasn't enough character development(character development has consistently been adequate in Metal Gear games, even for characters that die off early).\n\nJetstream Sam is a real cool looking character that I expected to have more screen time in Metal Gear Rising, only to see him killed off in a way that could have been a lot more meaningful. Included DLC allows you to play as Sam through his story, but it feels inappropriate for this extra backstory to have been DLC; it feels to me like a concession made due to Sam's lack of development in the main story. Sam's dialogue was especially disappointing, because he seemed to be a strongly principled character that Raiden couldn't understand(only a few of the characters in this game have strong, well-defined maxims). Raiden and Sam never actually got to communicate about any of their motivations, which could have catalyzed a change in one or both of them, which would have been meaningful. Sam's similarities to Raiden were not emphasized enough for the two to have had any chemistry as rivals, and the end result reeked of wasted potential.\n\nRaiden was never a strongly principled character in any of the games he was in, which is intentional. In MGS2, his naive preconceived notions were turned on their head(at the same time as the player's), resulting in an interesting change in his character that was intended to resonate with the player. This risky move worked to great effect, and has been unmatched in video games since. Sadly, the new Raiden in Metal Gear Rising is impossible to relate to in this way, because Raiden has no well-defined moral opposition to any of the antagonist's motivations(and he doesn't make an effort to formulate any). In the same vein, his characteristic self-doubt only led to the rediscovery of his violent urges as "Jack the Ripper", which did not provide him with any new focus or direction as a character. Raiden is a character that was originally designed to be dynamic, and if a character is measured by how much they have changed, then Raiden's portrayal in Metal Gear Rising was an utter failure.\n\nMost of the characters in Metal Gear Rising are not characters I see myself remembering for a long time to come. Few of the characters had consistently clear, believable, or relatable motivations(especially not Raiden). Overly brief, insubstantial, or inconsistent dialogue between the characters muddled the already scant amount of character development this game had time for.\n\nThe game's overall message has also been stunted by political correctness. This has had the dual effect of making much of the dialogue a waste of time and preventing the game from standing out.\n\nShort version: It was nice to see Raiden again, and the gameplay itself was not half bad. However, Metal Gear games have a reputation for their gameplay and exposition working perfectly in tandem. Previous games in the franchise have been unmatched at using postmodern expression in a meaningful way, which is a saddening contrast to this game's confused and insignificant message. As a Metal Gear fan, this game was disappointing for these reasons.\n\nI give it 3.5/5 units of rating. It's a shell of the game that it could have been. It's still a good game(based on gameplay alone), it's just not very interesting, and definitely not groundbreaking.","January 11, 2014","true","25.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","6"

To put it simply, It's  a spin-off of the "Metal Gear Solid" series which features Raiden, a popular character from the MGS games, he was first introduced in MGS2 and then later seen in MGS4 cooperating with Snake.\nEither way, in this spin-off, Raiden is a cyborg ninja whose role is to provide security and peace around the world, that means hindering the plans of many terrorists and reducing all the commotion in order to avoid a "war".\n\nGameplay wise, the game seems pretty solid, if you're new into hack'n'slash games, this won't be a bad experience for you, in fact, the game is really newbie-friendly and you can always adjust your difficulty and back yourself up with some tutorials before jumping right into the game.\nThe game has replay values with boss battles and DLC missions, you can always practice and aim for a higher difficulty, the sword gameplay is entertaining and I'll go as far as to convey my experience: this is one of the only hack'n'slash games that gave me the feeling of might and power flowing through my hands as I pressed the buttons on my gamepad.\nThe sword cuts will get you addicted and pumped up, you can slash through a large number of objects, props, bodies and such, there are limits as to what you can cut for engine purposes and story advancement though.\n\nStory wise, if you haven't played the previous Metal Gear Solid games, there's no need to worry. Simply because this is a spin-off and you won't need any information in order to enjoy the plot, if you want to understand better though I'd advice you to look into the characters' backgrounds. And make sure you play the DLC missions last as they deliver a set of pieces coming straight from the main Story Mode which will spoil your experience.\n\nSoundtracks: They are well implemented, nothing to say there, everything seems to be synchronizing with the action, drama, and more, the game's soundtrack goes from dynamic to peaceful at some point, you will certainly enjoy it.\n\n\nFinally, the port is pretty good for Platinum's first ever Console to PC port, there's a good amount of graphical options which you will enjoy, the resolutions are quite limited in terms of choices, but you shouldn't expect too much from a port. Aside from that, the resolution personally never gave me any problems, I have all the options I need. From Graphics quality to Zangeki and Zantime, the game delivers a good set of choices to help you run it better and enjoy your experience. It's also well optimized, from the looks of it, you won't be needing a very powerful PC to play it, just make sure it fits the minimum requirements or slightly below to fully enjoy the game.\nIn short, it's a well made port as it even supports options for low-end PCs, just don't expect too much of a high FPS increase after having set all options.\n\nOverall? I'd give it a 7.5/10. Is it worth it? Yes, the game's price is pretty rewarding for a game of this caliber, and it comes with all the DLCs along.","January 9, 2014","true","191.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

As expected from the gametrailer, it has some button-bashing and some crazy and fun SLICING action, pretty much equal to the amount of slicing compared to the famous fruit ninja game ;P.\n\nFrom start this game challenges you with pretty hard tasks which usually needs some game knowledge. Although combo's and moves can be practised in the tuturials you can pick up from boxes, I tried to leave them out, because I found it too distractive for the storyline and just take the fun out of the play-learn-apply way I prefer (although, if you don't know how to block, the first two might come in handy). Between levels are a bit much cutscenes, which do in fact add context to the game and demonstrate great graphics, but often have long durations compared to the levels itself.\n\nUpgrades to visual appearances, moves, health or stamina is done quite nicely based on experience point acquired during levels. Of course I HAD to pick the sombrero and poncho uniform :P. Like the latter, the game has more humourous additions, which I will not spoil right away, but do make me smile.\n\nOverall a fun game to play. Time to completion might be pretty fast. Considering the fact that this is the first Metal Gear game in this particular style, its really well made and promising. Can't wait for a sequel to this one. I do wish for a bit more of an open-world sequel though (similar to e.g. Prototype).","September 3, 2014","true","10.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The storyline should not and cannot be taken seriously, but there are those themes of Raiden having to face with his past, and how he copes with it as an adult, father and husband. You see the human side of Jack, and the crazy side.\n\nIt's a classic good v evil, justice v crime storyline and I love it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueMagi/recommended/235460/","BlueMagi","Eibon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueMagi/","423 products in account","Here's a quick litmus test to see if you will like this game, hate this game, or absolutely love this game.\n\nAs a child, or an adult, did you like any of the following:\nIntense anime action\nKung fu fight scenes\nTechnical fighting games\nCyborgs\nSamurai\nCyborg Samurai\nCyborgs and/or Samurai chopping things into multiple pieces\nEccelctic cast of characters\nBallin' ♥♥♥ boss music\n\nIf you answered yes to at least 2 of those, you will most likely enjoy this game. If you answered yes to 3 or more, you will probably love it. Let's go into some detail, though.\n\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance is set up as an action RPG, with ties to games like Bayonetta, Devil May Cry, and Viewtiful Joe. Most encounters can be gotten through simply by mashing through combos - this is how I played the game the first time through, and a good default to fall back on in some cases. The entire game can be completed on Normal difficulty without learning a single combo, which I think is excellent for gamers who just want to hop in and enjoy the action.\n\nFor players looking for more challenge, or for an experience where they can optimize their performance and master the game, Metal Gear Rising provides ample opportunity. The parry system allows any player to easily block damage, but the precision timing required to counter attacks (especially boss attacks) means that the more effort you invest into learning the mechanic, the more badass you will become. The combos perform similarly: several combos will disorient and execute weaker enemies long before the game will count them as "killed," allowing you to save time and look hella ballin' out of control, rather than just ballin'.\n\nThe difficulties also provide an excellent opportunity for both casual and skilled players: the effective New Game+ will allow casual players to take their upgrades earned in previous playthroughs to encounters that feature new attacks, more enemies, and more beefy bosses. Players looking for a challenge can hop into harder difficulty modes right off the bat (enter the Konami code at the "Press Start" screen to unlock them all immediately) to face more demanding scenarios with Raiden's default loadout, which seems meager after you've finished the game once.\n\nBoss fights are also worth special mention, just because of how well done most of them are: each boss features a unique mechanic that requires you to master blade mode (discussed later) to an even more precise degree. This can make some of the later bosses frustrating if you struggle with the controls (which I do for blade mode), but also adds a really interesting layer of skill and finesse to each fight. To make each encounter memorable, each boss has an amazing music score, which ramps up in intensity as the fight progresses, and the tension and thrill of having a vocal track kick in when both you and the boss are on low health is something that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.\n\nFor the final paragraph of praise, blade mode has to be addressed: this mechanic is takes the game from good action game to over the top action game. As many movies, shows, and cutscenes have done before, Blade Mode allows you to cut opponents and objects into as many pieces as possible. Tougher enemies have damage threshholds on all their major limbs or weapons, requiring you to best them in combat before you can remove their means of attack or slice them in two, making the sensation all the more rewarding when you can finally chop off the legs of a Gecko that's been giving you hell. Blade Mode also has a special mode called Zandatsu, where time will slow down even more, allowing you to precisely aim for enemies' regenerative nano-spine, which when cut during Blade Mode (and then subsequently consumed), refills your health and Blade Mode energy.\n\nThe last paragraph or two are going to be dedicated to the major issues I found with Metal Gear Rising, but they are fairly inconsequential compared to the excellence that comprises the rest of the game. First, is how little Metal Gear Rising tells you - it will teach you the absolute basics, but it will not teach you anything complex. I had to learn the hard way that Blade Mode swipes can be manually aimed (middle mouse button by default), that the dodge move (jump and light attach once purchased and equipped) has invincibility frames, that yellow attacks are unblockable but orange attacks are just powerful, and that you can save, customize, and go to VR missions from the Codec Menu. I recommend watching Youtube videos that go through some of the advanced functionality to fully understand how the game works, as well as checking all the menus and options to find important features and a TON of extra story content from supporting cast members.\n\nThe second issue I take with Metal Gear Rising is that I found the precision controls for Blade Mode very obnoxious, which ruined my experience of later boss fights. It becomes less of an issue when you fully upgrade weapons and energy cells to extend the time you have in Blade Mode, but some boss fights required you to cut 3 - 4 boxes in a line (sometimes several times in a row, oriented in different ways each time), and setting it up felt clumsy and stressful, ruining the pace of the fight. Some of this complaint can be overcome by mastering the controls, which I haven't done yet, so take this with a grain of salt: if you are a hyper badass (or can become one), Blade Mode will not impede your enjoyment, even though it might still be somewhat tricky to use.\n\nOverall, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance is one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time: it's fast paced, super stylish, easy to jump into but difficult to master, and rewards investments into learning the combat system. The story is a little silly, but the game pulls it off by not taking any of it seriously. So next time you have the money, this game is well worth the full $30.","February 4, 2014","true","30.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auranfox/recommended/235460/","Auranfox","Auranfox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Auranfox/","266 products in account","TL;DR: Buy this game. Now.\n\nFirstly! The gameplay is quite frankly excellent. It caters to those of us who prefer to just charge in and murder things. It caters to those of us who like to be sneaky. It can be as easy or as challenging as you make it, even without touching difficulty controls - of course, you'll have a harder time on HARD than you will on EASY, but it's down to player preference.\nSecondly. Graphics. It makes a point of being excellent quality during cutscenes, and during the actual gameplay. Moreover, the simply magnificent usage of cinematics works uber well with the immense UGs you will be fighting - it takes the game from good to better, and makes it seem even more grand. Considering as well that this gameplay is very unique, it makes this one-of-a-kind. You aren't gonna find this anywhere else, certainly not in this kind of quality. Every boss you fight is different, each enemy it's different weaknesses and strengths... And all of them can be hacked to tiny pieces and have their innards torn out. Where do I sign up?\n\nThirdly: characterisation. Each character has a unique personality which is striking. All the bosses have stories, your team and your adversaries - there are even points where, for those of us not driven by bloodlust, you might actually feel //bad// about the senselessly good killing. The designs on the bosses and such are very interesting in and of themselves. It's obvious a great deal of work has gone into it.\n\nFourth: The soundtrack is spectacular. Very fitting, dynamic, just... In general, perfection.\n\nFinally: plot. If you choose to immerse yourself in the plot you're in for a good time. I won't spoil anything, but... Just, play it and enjoy it as I did. You won't regret it.\n\nFor £20 you are getting the game plus two DLC - considering you'd pay more in-store for the game alone this is already worth your while.\n\nComplaints?\n- Parrying should be drilled more. If you are playing, LEARN TO PARRY EARLY. IT WILL SERVE YOU WELL.\n- The DLC for Jetstream Sam has LQ-84i's voice actor seemingly different, and his character's attitude is different in an unprecedented way. This bothered me mostly because I love LQ, not necessarily a thing all of you will care about - I, having fallen in love with the character, detest when this happens to them. Regardless I got some closure and backstory on him which I am extremely grateful for.\n\nPlay the game. Play the game. Play the game.\nThank me later.","April 2, 2014","true","42.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Beware!\n\nIn MGS4, Hideo Kojima desperately tried to make Raiden cool by essentially giving him Gray Fox's abilities and a sword, and a metric ton of angst. He angsts, he kills some Gekkos, and angsts some more. Then he angsts and fights Vamp, and keeps angsting, angstily rescuing Solid Snake who actually has some real problems and doesn't whine about them constantly.\n\nMGR, though...\n\nDon't get me wrong.

Its plot is a mishmash of B-list animes trying to pass themselves off as a straight spy story with poignant real world commentary with ridiculous 40 minute cutscenes. The fact that the series has any success at all is a testament to the fact that the world is populated by absolute cretins.\n\nBut Revengeance is different. It sheds the long cutscenes and metaphysical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in favour of a straightforward plot with ninja cyborgs fighting each other. Gone is Kojima's vomit and in its place is a straightforward sword-wielding hero who's out to slice and dice everything in his path. Because the story goes easy on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff with AIs, clones and vampires, it actually is possible to enjoy it rather than simply wish you could punch Kojima in the mouth.\n\nThe gameplay meanwhile is superb. Parrys flow into combos, which flow into dodges, jumps and then more combos. Unlike other games of this type, using a long combo isn't just a ticket to getting hit and humiliated. When you shift into blade mode, which lets you slice the enemy apart, it gets really satisfying. The boss battles are intense, but with the exception of one stupid half fight with a guy that has boards to hide behind, they're all fair and play by the rules. No dumb gimmick 'switch controllers' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that that idiot Kojima usually does.\n\nJust goes to show that even something like Metal Gear can be great in the right hands, as opposed to the hands of a drooling idiot like Kojima.","April 29, 2014","true","13.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The regular attacks are also fun, and chaining together strings of attacks feels great when the finicky camera is not working against you. The game is in general, fast, violent, over-the-top, cheesy, and \M/ metal \M/. The cinematics are all skippable but some of them are priceless pieces of action for action's sake. Raiden will fight, and cut into ribbons, and hurl, and climb enemies of all types, genders, and many of ludicrous sizes. It's so over the top, but that also makes it awesome.\nCons:\n-The regular problems of 3rd person camera angles are exagerated by the frequent (and admittedly awesome) encounters with LARGE enemies, often in tight quarters. In these particular situations the camera can have difficulty repositioning itself.\n-Some have found that the parry system can be abused to a gamebreaking point, and I can see how it would deter people who can't close the pandora's box of this cheese method once they've opened it.\n\nReplayability:\n-The game's campaign is fairly short, but doesn't feel that way because of how much action is squeezed into it's 10 length. There are many unlockables but most are unlocked in the first playthrough, with a few requiring you to enter a New Game + with your character.\n-There are also a plethora of VR missions which have been a staple of the MGS series since the playstation's Metal Gear Solid. These range from easy to brutal to why_would_you_do_that? There are unlockables that can be obtained from the VR missions and they alot points that can be used for upgrades in your single player campaign. Some of the gold medal times are ludicrous but for every challenge there are those who will claim it's easy. Certainly mastering them all will take a long time should the game hold your interest long enough to try.\n\nConclusion: (A spectacle to behold, and a thrill ride to play, but occasional camera hiccups and a short campaign keep it from it's fully legendary potential. Come for the action, stay for the unlockables, and don't expect to think a lot nor to sneak a lot. Relish its insanity and you will have a blast.

I enjoyed it a lot, then was MGS2 which I played on my PC; despite many flaws I enjoyed MGS2 as well, but mostly for plot twists at the end (calling them "over the top" would be a huge understatement). I also played MGS3 (on my PS2), where absurdity was toned down a bit compared to MGS2 and I still liked it for some boss fights and nice setting.\nWhen playing MGS2 and MGS3 you will inevitably encounter comic/absurd/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moments (not so much in MGS1), both in action and writing portions, which - in my opinion - can be extremely cringe-worthy as most of the game is presented as serious story. And then Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance comes, where over-the-top, comic and/or absurd actions and dialogues are its bread and butter. And I love this game for that.\nI longed for a MGS game which doesn't play serious, where proportions of comedy/absurd and "serious business" are reversed and boy, MGR delivers. Fight system involves parrying lightning-fast attacks, counters and sometimes simple QTE's. Boss fights are oftenly finished with some extremely satisfying overkills and cutscenes many times are simply for comedic value, like Raiden's disguise or "otaku guard". But there are also some serious bits, with my favourite being final boss speech and realization that, to some extent, he is right.\n\nI highly recommend this game to both action games fans and non-orthodox MGS fans, as this may be the PC game you were waiting for.","March 30, 2014","true","18.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Because it's not.\n\nIf you're looking for a hack-and-slash game with non-stop action during the gameplay, this is the game for you. It's what every little kid inside us wants; big robots, explosions, a badass protagonist to look up to and so on. All of that combined with very solid gameplay and an alright story made for an awesome experience. I had a great time all the way through. The combat is very fast-paced, and it has a rather unique game mechanic; Blade Mode. This allows you to slow down time and get free control on where you slash at enemies, so you can dismember and decapitate them, or even cut them in a specific spot to expose their fuel cell so you can rip that out and use it to restore your health. You get rewarded BP for how well you do during each fight, and at the end of a chapter depending on the rank you got. This BP can be spent on new moves or weapon, health and fuel upgrades.\n\nI'm making it sound like the only way to play this game is to just run into every battle and slash your way through it. But you don't have to play the game like this. Quite a lot of areas in this game can be stealthed if you're careful and do assassinations on all the enemies, but I hardly ever bothered because I really like combat. There are also some easter eggs, hidden jokes and secret areas, which did make it feel a bit more like an MGS game. You can even hide in a box or drum can, as a stab to those games.\n\nThe plot wasn't anything special though, especially if you've played the previous MGS games. But the cutscenes still had the same quality in cinematography and storytelling as those games did, although these were considerably shorter. I personally did like the plot, but that was mainly because it featured Raiden, who I've always thought was really badass. And this game is the epitome of his awesomeness, so I was still satisfied with the plot of this game.\n\nI definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes action and the Hack-and-Slash genre. I'm not going to recommend this game for its plot, because it's just alright and not up to par with the MGS games. It's still there and it can be enjoyed, but it's far from the best things this game has to offer.","August 4, 2014","true","13.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Platinum games just gives us a reason to come back to the hero we love to hate. The game is fast paced, and you get your epic moments (supported by a strong very well made OST) when the boss battles come -even if the last one was kind of a let down to me. Game plays quickly, nervously as you get to parry which the main attack button. That makes the game both more nervous and frustrating, as sometimes you don't get the action you intended. Might take a while to get used to. Some enemies and areas aren't exactly hard to beat, more like extremely boring and annoying to take down, which isn't exactly something I like in a game. Also, the stealth system isn't working that well: You never know which area can be stealthed, or why you fail at said stealthing attempt, since the AI can be very random at times. Add to that some camera angles in corridors or small rooms that will get you to grind your teeth in despair, and you might get yourself another fix of frustration.

However, the game expands on the idea of cooking into a whole new open world, first person, Havok physics engine based, Unreal Tournament HD Vision, EA Sports; it's in the game, hamburger flipper. Though the game is critcially acclaimed to be promoting of the fast food genre in video games, I believe that it promotes our Lord and Savior Solid Snake. If you didn't notice, the first two words of this game, "Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare," is an anagram for "ANAL SEX," also known as Solid Snake's favorite side dish. Solid Snake also makes appearances in past METAL GEAR games, such as Cooking Mama: Pirate Ride and Wolfenstein. You would also think that this game's developers made it on Earth, but you're more wrong than a Chinese man not enjoying his fresh cooked dog (Call of Duty Dog).\n\nYears later, after playing this game in Full Vision Audio by Mountain Dew(TM), I found out that my dad had already completed this game, and of course by the laws of, not only physics, but also chemistry, that I had already played the game. I had wasted a good deal of time and money to construct the spaceship in order to watch this near a black hole so time could go by faster since the new Superman movie was seriously boring, but then all of a sudden Batman intruded. I had to take out my handy dandy notebook and write the names of everyone near me at the time on it, then they all died (happily of course). Of course, this feature is DLC and you can only buy it if you have the latest version of the XBOX ONE COMMAND MODULE.\n\nA few hours later, I told my friends that I could not "yeet." They murdered me to death, but of course I managed to make my way out of that sticky situation. Of course, how could I die but come back to life. "That's impossible, of course!" you would say. But of course, you're wrong. You would think that, of course, I died. However, of course I didn't die. The projectory that I set, of course, had went off course. This off course trajectory, of course, would cause a semi-modular menstruation by the off course airplane that I constructed, of course. On the contrary, I managed to, safely of course, steer myself on course, instead of off course, to an, of course, safe position. In that position, of course, I was not off course so I was able to, of course, live. If you don't get how I lived, of course, then you are, of course, off course in your thoughts on how everything works (of course).\n\nCenturies pass as Gaben finally gives me back my $7.49 that I payed for this game. However, it is not adjusted for inflation. I got 20 ruble back, but 20 ruble now is only .003 ruble back then. I ask my dad to sue, but my dad said, "Sue? What you need Sue for?" I told him Gaben make ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥. He said, "Vodka." Dad then was kill.\n\nAfter my dad's funeral, I had to counterract the off course of my life into a new direction. I moved to the United States and gained around 700 pounds. With these pounds, I moved to the Great Britain and rented an apartment. There I began my career as an artist, and here I am.\n\nThis game taught me all the basics of football without the hassle of waiting for my opponent to play E4 on his first turn as white. 10/10","January 14, 2015","true","15.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","75","6","8","11","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomebro/recommended/235460/","welcomebro","Toucan Bane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/welcomebro/","283 products in account","If you come to this game looking for a complex and intriguing narrative similar to that of games such as Metal Gear Solid 2, you won't find one. However, you will find a badass, intense, and creative hack and slash that is arguably the best of the titles released under the genre in the past few years.\n\nThroughout the 5-6 hour campaign, you'll face off with hundreds of cyborg warriors by stringing together light and heavy combos, as well as blade mode attacks. Blade mode is my favourite part of the game; it slows down time and allows you to unleash a flurry of slashes at your enemy, leaving them in pieces. You can activate it by holding down the left trigger (most likely R1 on the PS3), and you can cut by pressing X (horizontal slice; Square on PS3) and Y (vertical slice; Triangle on PS3). Or you can use the right analog stick to slice, but I wouldn't recommend this when you're just trying to kill the enemy, because it's extremely slow in comparison to using the two buttons. Analog blade mode is useful (and almost required) when cutting left hands, slicing through Sundowner's shields, and for a brief moment during the final boss fight. If there's ever a sequel to this glorious game, I would love to see improved blade mode with the analog stick. Raiden has a few different sub weapons that he gets from boss, but none of them are really that useful aside from pole arm. Oh, and the boss battles are amazing. Probably some of the best I've ever seen; they make you feel like such a badass. The combat is, for the most part, "solid", despite the lack of interesting or varied move sets.\n\nNow, on to the gameplay negatives. First, the time window you are given for parrying an attack, is way too friggin' small; you'll rarely get a perfect parry. The camera can have a seizure at times, which can really mess you up at times. I didn't like the stealth sections in game. They were somewhat poorly-done and they just don't belong in an action game like this. I don't want to sneak around in a box to get past my enemies for an S rank. I want to slice the ♥♥♥♥ out of them and crush their spines. Perhaps, I wouldn't take as much of an issue with this if the stealth sections played a little bit better. Those were my main problems. Upon replaying bits of the game on revengeance difficulty, I noticed a few more issues than I did on my initial playthough. The way you usually want to go about obtaining an S rank would be to complete your objective as fast as possible with no damage. Not taking a hit can be extremely difficult when faced with a group of enemies (which is pretty much the entire game), because you can't always keep track of them. Enemies with assault rifles and rocket launchers come to mind here. A few of the bosses can occasionally sneak in a tiny and fast hit that you couldn't defend yourself from, thus ruining your S rank because you ended up taking like 2% damage.\n\nWhen you examine textures at a very close range, you'll see that they're not all that great. But you probably won't be doing that very often (you probably will on title screen when you get a close-up of Raiden's ugly jaw) since the game is very fast-paced. The game still looks good overall. The PC port also runs very well. I only experienced minor framerate drops (60-55 and such).\n\nThis game just looks so impressive and badass. There really is nothing else like it. The soundtrack for this game is fantastic. This is coming from someone who usually hates heavy metal and electronic music. It really gets you pumped and motivated. Also, the PC port is the version to buy. It includes all of the DLC and allows you to replay boss battles from the main menu. If you can't run it, then the console versions are great choices as well.\n\nVerdict: 89/100 - If you love hack and slash games, there is no reason not to own this. It's fast, fun, and worth buying on PC over consoles. RULES OF NATURE!","February 22, 2015","true","15.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This is a decent port without bugs, issues and any other annoyances. While the FPS value does not go above 30 it wasn't a problem for me. I'd skip detailing the story as it simply cannot be any cheesier than what it is not to mention some of the ridiculous boss battles (especially the last one).\n\nWhat makes Revengeance a good fighting game is the Blade Mode our protagonist, Raiden, can use. This is a slow-mo fighting mode and is intended for close-up fighting only - Raiden can chop up his enemies into - literally - hundreds of pieces. The surrounding area is full of objects that can also be sliced up - this is done smoothly and superbly by the game's well-written engine. Usually, this is for finishing moves and it uses an energy bar that can only be filled if we keep fighting and hitting enemies.\n\nAnother funny thing employed by Raiden is the so-called Zandatsu. While we are in the process of slicing up our foes an indicator appears for a short period of time. Pressing the right button allows Raiden to take his enemies' innards. This represents energy and as enemies are mostly cyborgs it is not that disgusting. This coupled with Blade Mode can be heaps of fun.\n\nThe game, unfortunately, is pretty short. There are only 7 chapters and while the first four last almost an hour, number 5 can be completed in less than 10 minutes; chapter 6 only consists of a boss battle and the last chapter was - for me - a too long boss battle.\n\nIn any case, this is a good hack 'n' slash TPS game with some pretty funny combos and its Zandatsu and Blade Mode offers something unique and interesting in this genre. Hardcore gamers can take on other difficulty levels and some of the more difficult achievements.","November 27, 2014","true","8.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ameriken/recommended/235460/","ameriken","Ken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ameriken/","511 products in account","I have fourteen hours logged into this game so far, and that's from a single session. This of course, doesn't include the dozens of hours I've spent playing this game on console across multiple playthroughs. If you want the short version of this review: it's balls-to-the wall amazing and if you like fast-paced action, you owe it to yourself to buy Metal Gear Rising: Revengance.\n\nAs a character action game, its extremely solid. More than that, in fact. It feels incredible. The simple act of parrying an enemy's hit at just the right moment, leaving them exposed for a counter attack in which you slice them in half and tear out their still beating heart just never gets old, even after completing everything. There aren't any styles like Devil May Cry 4, and switching between weapons is kinda clunky. In terms of ranged capabilities, Raiden can use rocket launchers and grenades, but this tends to break up the action, and feels a little unnatural. It has its tactical utility, but don't expect to be pulling off combos with pistols akimbo like Dante. Metal Gear Rising: Revengance focuses on sword play, and it does that exceedingly well. Unlike other character action titles (or spectacle fighters, whichever you prefer), the game's focuses more on parrying and blocking than dodging. Doing so requires precise timing, but you generally have a pretty good window to defend yourself. Parrying just as the attack hits (otherwise known as a perfect parry) will leave the enemy open for riposte, which will quickly turn the battle in your favour. It's difficult to describe why, but parrying just feels right, and it never gets old. If you want a game that feels good, this is it.\n\nAs a Metal Gear game, it's actually pretty good. It's obviously not a stealth game, but rather a character action game set in the Metal Gear universe. Though originally designed by Kojima Productions, the game was scrapped late in development and rebuilt by Platinum Games, who handled the gameplay. If you aren't familiar with Platinum, their other titles include Viewtiful Joe, Okami, God Hand, Bayonetta, and now The Wonderful 101. They're a studio with quite a pedigree, especially when it comes to makes games with great... well, gameplay. The plot and overall design of the title was handled by Kojima Productions. The result is a match made in heaven. Despite being a spin-off, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance actually manages to move the universe forward in a logical way, moreso than Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots ever did. How does the world handle the aftermath of the Guns of the Patriots incident? How has Raiden moved on as a character? These are questions the game tackles, making it a worthwhile addition to the Metal Gear canon. In terms of its story, it's about what you'd expect from a Hideo Kojima game. It has the same quirks and cyberpunk elements, but cranked up to eleven. There are still codec calls, but they're entirely optional. The cutscenes are still here, but they're shorter, to put more emphasis on the action. Gameplay-wise, it's a character action game, so don't go in expecting any amount of stealth. There are some encounters that can be avoided, either by sneaking past or eliminating your enemies one at a time. This is achieved by moving quickly and staying out of sight, but its also incredibly simplistic. Still, it complements the action very well. Running past guards and eliminating them one-by-one really does make you feel like a cyborg ninja. Just don't go in expecting a stealth game. There are still cardboard boxes.\n\nAs a port. it's functional. It's pretty rough around the edges, but it's a port of a console action made by a Japanese developer that's actually functional, unlike say, Dark Souls. On console, this game ran at sixty frames per second, which is uncommon, but not completely unheard of. It still runs at that frame rate, and comes with a decent amount of options, though its still fairly bare bones. The resolution options are lacking, but I got it working by putting the game in windowed mode with an external program to remove the border. There have been a few reports of bugs, but in the ten plus hours I've played with this game, it runs just as good as console. Other than the included downloadable content (which includes the pre-order bonuses, which never came to PlayStation Store or Xbox Live Marketplace), this doesn't play all to differently from the console version, aside from the extra graphical options. Added in the PC version however, is the ability to play all of the cutscenes and codec conversations from the main menu, as well as a boss rush mode. If you've only had a passing interest in this game, or it wasn't your cup of tea on console, this probably isn't for you. If you're a hardcore fan like me, you'll probably enjoy this a lot. If you haven't played it at all, thirty dollars is an absolute steal for a game less than a year old, bundled with all of the downloadable content.\n\nAs a video game, it's very fun. It's as simple as that. The game is fast-paced, and for character action fans, there's plenty of depth and challenge. For those unfamiliar to the genre, this game remains accessible. If the game has one major flaw, its the length. The story is very short, and will be over before you know it. However, the game gives you plenty of reason to come back to it, with extra difficulty settings that will kick your ♥♥♥, side challenges in the form of VR missions that will test your skills to the limit, and collectibles and upgrades scattered throughout. Still, the game will always leave you wanting more, in a good way. You'll want more and more of Revengance, simply because it plays so damn well. The extra DLC chapters take you through most of the same content, but one of them adds a new boss fight, which is just as amazing as all of the other boss fights. Which reminds me: the boss rights are amazing! They're the high points of the game, complemented by 2013's best soundtrack. The newly added boss rush mode is a welcome addition for this reason, as they're easily the best part. If you want to slice a Metal Gear half, this is a fantastic action game you need to play.\n\nRULES OF NATURE!","January 11, 2014","true","46.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frawt/recommended/235460/","Frawt","Peter Pan(cake)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frawt/","304 products in account","Metal Gear Rising seems to be the product of (a) very peculiar mind(s), tailored for a narrow niche. In the world of Metal Gear (Solid), Metal Gear Rising throws out any competent stealth, rendering even the idea of crawling around in prowl of carefully-aimed headshots pointless. Instead, it opts for a much more action-oriented style of gameplay.\n\nOddly enough, even the stealthier parts of Metal Gear Rising take influences from outside of the Metal Gear Solid games. The path to infiltrating a location without getting discovered (albeit made nigh impossible in most cases) involves sneaking up to an enemy and pressing a button highlighted on the screen, which summons a killing animation and a swift death. From the more gun-oriented Metal Gear Solid games (which do have some limited melee fighting, which never quite reaches competency) where most deaths are dispensed with a well-placed headshot and then a hiding of the victim, quick melee kills from behind was something it never quite dabbled in. Metal Gear Rising feels a slight obligation to include stealth elements, but by no means should - or would - anyone ever think it's much to write home about. This is, first and foremost, a hack-and-slasher, a game where the only thinking you do is the combo you want to string together, and retaining a sense of when to press a button prompt.\n\nIn some regards, though, Metal Gear Rising still makes a case for carrying the Metal Gear name. Winding codec conversations peppered with snarky remarks and a lingering sense of (oftentimes forced) camaraderie are still present in the game, albeit not to the extent they've been presented in past games. There's a lot of left-overs from previous Metal Gears, like the presence of nanomachines that were a focal point of Metal Gear Solid 4, the appearance of Sunny, appearances by towering Metal Gears, and of course, Raiden. Purely looking at the main conflict that carries the story, however, shows a game which, while holding the Metal Gear name, doesn't lend itself to much creative liberty to do whatever it wants to with the series. The conflict centers around characters never seen before, in a premise years away from the last Metal Gear Solid, with implications far-reaching, and touching upon the previous staples of the Metal Gear series (like The Patriots and the idea of PMCs, like the Desperado Enforcement LLC, which much of the game centers around).\n\nAll in all, the story sets itself up to have a far-reaching impact on the Metal Gear universe, but ends up falling flat, mostly positioning itself in the timeline as a pocket of Raiden's life, a tour de force on a revenge path, finishing the game with the general world none the wiser about the events that transpire during, and shape, the game.\n\nAside from the bland and mostly insignificant plot, however, is a game which does make some contentions on being its own entity in the hack-and-slasher genre. Instructions are very down-played, and many players (including some reviewers who've written about the game) may find themselves (unnecessarily) frustrated. As personal experience has shown, the existence of a dodge button is hidden away under lock and key, something many players have managed to miss throughout a whole playthrough. Even with its existence, though, it's still easy to get hit in a crowd of enemies, and the life supply in Metal Gear Rising isn't cranked up quite as high as you'd expect. After some time with the game, you'll realize this is a hack-and-slasher much more built with blocking and parrying in mind, facilitating success by way of careful timing and precision. Recovering health works by going into blade mode, and quickly - but precisely - cutting through a square that's shown somewhere on the enemy's body, and then slamming on the highlighted button prompt after you manage to successfully cut into it.\n\nThere's different responses you need for different enemies, some having attacks with an area of effect that can still catch you even with a dodging attempt presented at the right time, some being unblockable (or unparryable), some triggering quickly after you initiate an offensive towards the enemy.\n\nThis is a huge focal point of boss battles. While the bosses aren't as fascinating as some of the other boss characters in the Metal Gear Solid series, all of them are intricate battles with different sections and stages that require different responses (from parrying to dodging to attacking at the right time, either normally or in Blade Mode), with most of them being, admittedly, frustrating. The game is not very accommodating with the bosses, dealing exorbitant amounts of damage to players who miss a cue for an attack or make any other mistake. This makes the absence of a save/load function especially frustrating, seeing as often you can end up initiating a cutscene leading up to a boss fight, where you might find yourself with no healing or attacking items, leaving you in a situation where you have to either find ways to abuse the game's bosses' responses/attacks (which is possible with some of them, to an extent) or just run through the strategy the developers have intended the player to go through perfectly, which can lead to some frustrating sessions, with a low margin of error (especially dealing with Blade Mode) and a high level of punishment for making a mistake.\n\nOverall, though, the game is a delight. Raiden's movement is extremely fluid, and his attacking is both flowing and complex, making you feel both powerful and poetic in combat, especially when you notice small touches, like Raiden using his feet to fight and so on. Dodging and parrying works well, and Blade Mode, while fidgety in occasions where both you and the enemy move, giving you an extremely small window of time to successfully slash through them, is functional, and is a great, interesting way to finish off enemies, never leaving even the kill of a pawn soldier unsatisfying. If there's nothing else objective to say about the game and its quality, then what can be agreed upon without room for disagreement, is that Platinum is a mechanically competent developer of hack-and-slashers. Their animation is great, the combat is refined, and the numerous costumes and weapons add customization to the game that add longevity.\n\nOverall, Metal Gear Rising is not particularly noteworthy. The story is one-note and the writing, while decent, is not as memorable as the previous Metal Gear Solid games, and trades in touching, affecting moments for comedy and angst (one particularly egregious example being George, the funny Guyanese kid whose largely defined as being the comedic relief). The combat, while extremely fluid and refined, is a different experience from most hack-and-slashers, and requires a more careful and methodical approach than others. The enemies are mosty bland soldiers and robotic constructs, and, while the bosses in the game do offer variety in that respect, most of them are still one-note characters who aren't overly memorable. The extra items are fun to discover, purchase, and use, but don't offer quite enough for subsequent playthroughs.\n\nIn the end, I would recommend Metal Gear Rising much more as a gameplay experience than a story experience. While there is a story there and it does strive to be a serious, thought-provoking narrative, it falls flat most of the time, and the characters, issues and locations it deals with are fleeting, unmemorable and insignificant.","February 24, 2014","true","18.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was a bit surprised by how well they pulled this off, being Platinum Game’s first PC port. It was an absolutely phenomenal game. By far the best hack n’ slash game I’ve ever played, ever (yes, better than any of the God of War games).\n\nRevengeance has a $30 pricetag currently on Steam. This is really low considering that it also includes the DLC that was released on the console versions. I was a bit worried when I saw this title on Steam, as Platinum Games has never ported a game to PC, but they managed to preserve everything great about the original game, with a few additions (graphics settings!). The only thing that annoyed me mechanic-wise was the camera. The camera can be a bit glitchy at times, especially when in small areas.\n\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance is a bit different from what’s expected of a Metal Gear game. No, this is not Metal Gear Solid, so don’t expect to play as Snake. Instead, the game focuses on another character in the Metal Gear series, Raiden, the sword-wielding cyborg. Raiden, along with his sword, is tasked with resolving a potential war being stirred up by a PMC (Private Military Company) known as Desperado Enforcement LLC. The story, for the most part, develops through the many cutscenes placed into the experience. This is a Kojima game, after all.\n\nThe gameplay is action-packed, really action-packed. Running down the side of a building while jumping on top of flying missiles to cut a robot in half is a very, very awesome experience. Aside from the two basic attacks (light and heavy), there’s the “Blade Mode” mechanic. This mechanic, when activated, slows time, allowing you to make precise incisions on your enemy. It’s immensely satisfying to chop an enemy into 100 bits quickly using blade mode.\n\nRaiden is able to take advantage of “Ninja Run”, which allows him to sprint through areas quickly, vaulting over and under obstacles that may lie in his path. This allows him to jump on top of flying missiles, mind you. Ninja Run also allows the use of the two running attacks, which proved incredibly useful during boss fights (especially when spammed). I managed to obliterate an entire boss without being hit simply by running around them in circles spamming X on my controller.\n\nMGR:R also has a customization menu were Raiden’s armor, weapons, and skills may be changed. Raiden’s health, energy, and blade can all be upgraded. After completing a chapter, you’re awarded a form of currency that can be spent in this customization menu. The different armors offered do not seem to have an effect on the actual gameplay and, as far as I can tell, are used purely for show. Various skills can be purchased to improve Raiden’s abilities, some of which I found essential for certain boss fights.\n\nThe game’s graphics were relatively well done, with the only problem being the fact that the game cannot go above 1080p. Other than that, no complaints in terms of graphics. The music in the game seemed to mostly consist of what I’d refer to as ‘metal’. It is a hack n’ slash game, so this type of music fits well!\n\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance turned out to be a phenomenal game. Definitely my all-time favorite hack n’ slash. Platinum Games did a fantastic job porting this game to PC, highly recommended!\n\nFull let's play uploading soon: https://www.youtube.com/cublikefoot","January 10, 2014","true","11.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Also played one of the DmC, couldn't remember which but it didn't make a great impression on me.\n\nIn this game, where you play a sexually ambivalent Raiden wearing a tight armor, you have the chance to battle with a US Senator who cannot stop screaming "MUH FREEDUM" and clapping at the same time. That in itself is reason enough to buy the game.\n\nBut seriously it's pretty fun. I think the difficulty is really strange, I struggled early on and some parts of the end game were a breeze. It took me almost half the game to actually figure out how to parry (inb4 casual).

Rather than "tactical espionage action", developer Platinum Games stuck with what they were familiar with: balls-to-the-wall action. And instead of playing as the majestically mulletted Solid Snake, we once again control Raiden - the much loathed protagonist of MGS2 who, in a Kojima twist, later became a cyborg ninja that we all secretly wanted to play as again.\n\nBy drawing inspiration from the likes of Devil May Cry, Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden, MGR realises our dream perfectly. Sword combat is fast, acrobatic and mechanically rich, relying on skill and timing rather than button mashing. Raiden's "Zandatsu" move is a particular highlight, allowing him to slice enemies into thousands of pieces like something out of a ♥♥♥♥ing anime. The most refreshing thing about Rising is that it revels in being so ridiculous - from the awesome buttrock soundtrack, to the title logo straight off an 80s VHS cover.. even right down to its tagline "Revenge with a vengeance".\n\nThere aren't many of these types of action games which release on PC, so it's even more of a pleasure that Rising is not only a solid port with all the trimmings, but also arguably the genre's best output in many years.","June 22, 2014","true","12.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The combat is fast paced and engaging, blade mode is oh so satisfying, and the controls are easy to work with. (on a gamepad)\n\nSince everybody else is spouting off all of the pros, I'll focus on the cons.  It has trouble keeping a consistent tone, often times urging you to use stealth rather than your blade (in a hack and slash game).  The camera will sometimes screw you over, but not often enough for it to be an issue.\n\nNow for my biggest beef with the game.   If you're going for the high score, trying to S rank every mission, the game is downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T.  You will NEED to avoid taking ANY damage to get the S rank.   To make this even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty, the game will NOT STOP throwing groups of insanely annoying enemies at you, that will ALL spam their own attacks from all directions.  Some of these attacks are even unblockable.   Seriously.   If you're fighting one of the sword dudes, and the as**$&@ on the other side of the room hits you with a single stray bullet (less than 1% damage), guess what?  No bonus, no S rank, restart.    The same is true for the bossfights as well.  If you take a single hit from ANYTHING,  you're restarting.\n\nIt almost seems like the devs are intentionally trying to ♥♥♥♥ with you at some points.  There is one MANDATORY fight if you want to get an S rank, that has an INVISIBLE ♥♥♥♥ING WALL preventing you from touching your enemies.  On higher difficulties, the gun turret in the room is useless.   You're forced to use the infinite ammo cheat to spam rockets at the enemies.  Thank the merciful gods you don't have to get the no damage bonus to S rank that fight, but that isn't really saying much on a difficulty that you die in one hit anyway.\n\nAnd the VR missions...  Also mandatory for 100%, they strip all of your upgrades off before pitting you against even MORE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty groups of enemies, AND THEN put you under a TIME LIMIT to get the S rank.\n\n.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. .T.H.A.T.\n\nAll of the best players all over youtube say:  Even with all of the upgrades, great skills, and the best strategy, whether or not you get an S rank is roughly 20% you, 80% luck.\n\nIf you're gonna buy this game, don't bother trying to 100% it.

Unlike the previous MG games which were more about stealth, this one is a hack and slash type of game and you play as the cyborg ninja/samurai: Raiden.\n\nThe Story in this game is awesome too and during the game you can call your allies on codec to talk to them and there is alot info regarding the previous games and raiden's origin, giving new players info about the main character, story and previous games of the metal gear franchise\n\nThroughout the game you will be able to purchase upgrades for raiden giving him new moves and you will unlock new skins and weapons along the way. the combat system is nice and you can block most attacks by "Parrying" which is a technique that you will need to learn early in the game or you will get your ♥♥♥♥ handed to you, however those new to the game can play in easy mode which will give you the choice of enabling "assist" for auto-matic parrying. "Blade mode" is a ability in this game which slows down time and allows you to cut your enemies into many pieces and the alot of the enviroment can be slashed normaly.\n\nAnd Don't worry after completing the game and losing all the upgrades or skills you bought during gameplay or having to start the game all over again just to play a certian level again just for the sake of it or getting the collectiables (yep, there are collectiables for those who are into that) because after you complete the game you can choose any level at any difficulty with all your upgrades, weapons and so on. you can even use ripper mode (which you will unlock sometime during the game) in the earlier levels which you didn't have it in.\n\nThe PC version also includes all the dlc such as the MGS4 Raiden and Grey Fox skins, The Fox blade which basically a game breaker but awesome as hell and The Jetstream Sam and Blade Wolf DlC missions which lets you play as them explains their origins before they met Raiden. As for the Pc controls compared to controller controls, they are very good and i myself use the pc controls most of the time.\n\nIn conclusion, This Is a Fantastic game and i would recommend anyone to buy this, even at full price, it's worth evey penny in my opinion.","January 17, 2014","true","29.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You know the one.\nHack and slash your way through hundreds of innocent souls as you battle a conspiracy bigger than even your own substantial crises of belief as you step into Raiden's weird dog-like shoes in METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE. (You have to write it like that. It's a law or something.) The combat is pure Platinum; wide, sweeping attacks with palpable impact, all fractions of a second long so you can combo all night and day. With a functional parry system and a frankly glorious cinematic dismemberment attack that pushes Havok to its logical conclusion, MGR:R lives up to the "spectacle fighter" title.\n\nThe soundtrack is on point. In fact, it's so on point, one point can't hold it. It's on multiple points. (Just like Raiden. Look at them toes.) Lyrics cut in when the action is at its most intense, enhancing the already stellar heavy metal and beautifully integrating the music with the game's tone. Plus, the music from the game is available on Spotify, so you can harness the raw power of "Rules of Nature" or "I'm My Own Master Now" to do other activities, like chop vegetables into way too many pieces. Zandatsu.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the rapid wiggling of the left stick that many QTEs use instead of button inputs. I find holding your thumb in place and shaking the controller with the right hand is more possible, and it uses muscles I've already developed. ;^)\n\nIn conclusion, this game is not for the faint of heart. There is blood, dismemberment and emotional trauma, and the game demands lightning reflexes. But it is hugely rewarding, in a way that few games can truly lay claim to.","January 1, 2015","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Set after MGS4, you play as Raiden, tasked with bringing down a PMC by the name of Desperado. The story is pretty standard action game fare, although it's neat to get a glimpse of the MG world post-patriots.\n\nThe gameplay is where the meat of the game is at, however. While not as deep as DMC(the good ones) and Ninja Gaiden, the gameplay in MGR is more than adequate and will entertain fans of the genre and newcomers alike. There are weapons, bodies, and skills you can purchase with BP, gained from killing your enemies. There are VR missions to test your skills and unlock new bodies for Raiden. You also aquire sub-weapons from killing certain bosses, however equipping them takes away the use of your strong attack button. This, combined with the fact that they are largely only useful in specific situations makes them much less appealing than just sticking with your main sword. Another gripe I have is the lack of enemy variety. However, the game's biggest draw is "Blade Mode", where you slow down time and are able to cut in any direction. This is used to cut enemies into pieces and attack bosses weak points, and is very well done. The game itself is a bit short, even for a game of this genre, but has many reasons to replay it.\n\nLastly, the oft-praised soundtrack deserves a special mention. The music is very well done and fits the game perfectly. When fighting most bosses, the lyrics of the song are from the bosses point of view which is a neat little touch.

Set after MGS4, you play as Raiden, tasked with bringing down a PMC by the name of Desperado. The story is pretty standard action game fare, although it's neat to get a glimpse of the MG world post-patriots.\n\nThe gameplay is where the meat of the game is at, however. While not as deep as DMC(the good ones) and Ninja Gaiden, the gameplay in MGR is more than adequate and will entertain fans of the genre and newcomers alike. There are weapons, bodies, and skills you can purchase with BP, gained from killing your enemies. There are VR missions to test your skills and unlock new bodies for Raiden. You also aquire sub-weapons from killing certain bosses, however equipping them takes away the use of your strong attack button. This, combined with the fact that they are largely only useful in specific situations makes them much less appealing than just sticking with your main sword. Another gripe I have is the lack of enemy variety. However, the game's biggest draw is "Blade Mode", where you slow down time and are able to cut in any direction. This is used to cut enemies into pieces and attack bosses weak points, and is very well done. The game itself is a bit short, even for a game of this genre, but has many reasons to replay it.\n\nLastly, the oft-praised soundtrack deserves a special mention. The music is very well done and fits the game perfectly. When fighting most bosses, the lyrics of the song are from the bosses point of view which is a neat little touch. The OST does its job and really gets you hyped up for the fights, especially the last boss.\n\nAll in all, despite a few minor flaws, MGR is well worth the asking price and will hopefully be a fixture in the action game scene for years to come.\n","February 16, 2014","true","51.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

One of the earliest instances of the use of the "monkey metaphor" is that of French mathematician Émile Borel in 1913 but the earliest instance may be even earlier. The relevance of the theorem is questionable—the probability of a universe full of monkeys typing a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero).\n\nVariants of the theorem include multiple and even infinitely many typists, and the target text varies between an entire library and a single sentence. The history of these statements can be traced back to Aristotle's On Generation and Corruption and Cicero's De natura deorum (On the Nature of the Gods), through Blaise Pascal and Jonathan Swift, and finally to modern statements with their iconic simians and typewriters. In the early 20th century, Émile Borel and Arthur Eddington used the theorem to illustrate the timescales implicit in the foundations of statistical mechanics.","January 15, 2014","true","12.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

This game allows you to CUT a ton of bodies, move like Raiden did in MGS4, and it features epic bossfights, that could be compared to tose 'Raiden vs. Vamp' scenes. PC version also holds all the DLC-packs that came out on consoles, that's simply awesome. Additionally, it has the best soundtrack possible for such a game.\n\nWhile it's all about being a badass "Platinum" cyborg ninja, it has some classic "Kojima's things" (like 20-minutes-lenght cutscenes, cardboard boxes, sarcastic jokes and the weird and tricky storyline) and has some references direclty to MGS4. The gameplay is very fast and pushes you to master combos and counter-attacks to overcome any type of the enemy. Personally, can't achieve much S ranks even on 'Easy' with [Aim assist] turned on. And without [Assist], my ninja gets kicked in his cybernetic butt everytime. Guess I'm just too old for this, but I'd spent some time learning different combinations and moves to defeat all the baddies quickly.\n\n...To sum it up,\ngameplay - A (could be a hell without practice)\nstoryline - C (not a sort of complete and solid line for a MG game)\n- characters - S (at least, way better than MGS2 and still similar - memes)\nsoundtrack - S (best of possible)\nOVERALL: A - Lightning Strike!","February 26, 2014","true","28.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/235460/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","This is the sort of game where you’ll feel clumsy and a bit crap at the start, and by the end you’ll be an unstoppable killing machine, thanks entirely to your own personal mastery of the systems, not because of any RPG systems that have leveled up your strikes. You can level up your character in-between missions, but this is a game where personal skill rules, and nothing else. This makes it satisfying on a different level from most other games, and it’s the type of game where replaying it on a harder difficulty or playing the optional VR missions makes sense.\n\nI often see interviews with developers where they claim that their games offer replayabilty because of all the collectible items they’ve strewn across the map to pad the length. It always comes across like they’ve completely missed the point of what makes a game desirable to replay. Too often their systems are so shallow that they can barely last for a single play through of their game, let alone multiple times. Hopefully they can lean on a good story to keep the player interested in pushing on, even when the gameplay itself has become routine. This is something Revengeance doesn’t suffer from, on any level.\n\nThe gameplay systems in Revengeance don’t feel like a clone from another game. At first it feels foreign, which adds to your clumsiness in the beginning. With every fight you’ll get better at timing blocks, learning when to run, when to jump, and when to do glide attacks. It all comes together brilliantly in the boss fights, which are some of the best around. Compared to other games this amount of original design feels brave. What most other developers do is clone another game and then add their own twist on top of an already proven formula. That doesn’t seem to be the Platinum Games way. They know they’re damn good at making this kind of game, even when they throw out everything they’ve done before and craft new systems appropriate for the story and characters they're paired with.\n\nBecause this is part of the Metal Gear franchise there are some things fans expect in terms of story themes and tropes. There was more than enough here to make me happy. The story touches on themes like the reasons why the military industrial complex exists, the personal beliefs of those who take part in war, and the dreams they try to realize for themselves and future generations. So many things are brought up and touched on that it feels like it’s exploding with thoughts and ideas on the world and everyone involved in conflicts on all levels. It might be overacted and blunt in its approach, but they really tried! The main character has his convictions tested multiple times from different angles by the antagonists.\n\nAs far as Metal Gear tropes go it features a protracted fist fight between two shirtless men on top of a metal gear, while they discuss their personal philosophies and beliefs between punches. It’s more than I hoped for. From the Hideo Kojima Metal Gear games you can always expect all this to be in there, but since this was by a different studio I wasn’t sure just how hard they would try to keep the spirit of the series in here. Not only did Platinum Games manage to make their own distinct spin on the franchise, but they kept the most important things that make the Metal Gear titles resonate with the players. Its heart is in the right place.\n\nI had a fantastic time playing Revengeance, and after I finished it I was left feeling that 2013 was one hell of a year for games. I've spent the past couple months catching up on several big titles that came out during the past year, and like many of them this feels like a must play.","February 2, 2014","true","8.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

But I would just like to add that If you are AT ALL interested in the other metal gear games, then do not play this one until you have played 1-4. There are heavy spoilers for MGS 2 and 4. You also won't understand a lot of the plot but you will find the game's story to be amusing anyway. I would highly recommend playing the MGS games from 1-4 because they are great games and you will get more entertainment out of this one in doing so.\n\n11/5/2014\nOkay, might as well give this game my final thoughts. I just beat this game recently and it might be my game of the year. I have never had so much fun AND challenge in a game. The concept of a "spectacle fighter" has always appealed to me. Flashy moves, lot's of stuff going on, hectic fights. But I could never really get into some of them. The biggest problem was that I could never wrap my head around the combo systems. Which enemies die to the best combos? How do I find this out? Do I experiment? Do I take notes? I usually just let the flashy characters, the silly storylines and the dodging carry me through the experience because I would end up just mashing buttons and I would win (on the lowest difficulties of course). Metal Gear Rising changes everything. The parry system is an amazing mechanic. There is no block button in this game, instead you must parry an opponents attack by pressing the light attack button and point the control stick in the direction you are about to be striked from (knowing so from a contextual red cross flash). There is also a dodging slice attack you can get later via upgrades and this game also benefits from having RPG elements. You can tweak raiden to various playstyles until you have enough points to get every upgrade. But the most innovative feature is how you slash your enemies. There is a button that let's you go into a mode called Blade Mode. Blade mode allows you to cut in any direction your joystick or mouse will allow with Horrizontal or Vertical slashes. When an enemy is near death or if you do a quick time event properly, you will be prompted to do a technique called The Zandatsu. The game goes into slow mo (slow motion can still be achieved without Zandatsu) but every cut you make is rendered on the body. This allows you to slice enemies into tiny pieces. This is also one of the ways you can recover life (Nano-paste pick-ups is another) by hitting a red bordered hit-box at the right angle to grab the enemies electrolytes (through a contextual button press) and then abosrbing them in the most amazing animation ever. By not being able to regenerate health automatically and no dodge button (at the start at least) this game can feel tough if you can't get the parry down. But when you do, it's really satisfying and the gameplay becomes much more leanient\n\nThe gameplay is so good that it would pull almost everything else on its own, even if the rest of the game was medicore. But that's one of the best parts about MGR. Even though it's a short experience (7-9 hours,  10-11 listening to all codecs, 5-6 without dying too much) it has some amazing extras that take this already great game and make it phenominal.\n\nLet's start with the soundtrack. Oh lordy the soundtrack. THIS is easily my soundtrack of the year. There is some amazing heavy metal in this game with some kick-♥♥♥ vocals. During boss fights (which are kick-♥♥♥ by the way) these songs can change up depending on how the fight is going, non-vocal at first then kicking it up at just the perfect lyrics and note timing after or during a cutscene is triggered. It blends in perfect with how the stage might have changed or what the boss is about to do or the boss's personality in some cases.\n\n\nNow, the last notable part is the story and the characters. This game is just bonkers. Like I mentioned before, I really enjoy spectacle fighters with ridiculous stories (a practice Platinum Games is notable for) and this game excells. It's funny, it's flashy, it's over-the-top perfection. I would still highly recommend playing the main MGS games. They are notable for similar over-the-top stories but that doesn't include some heart-wrenching moments. There are very few here but it doesn't really lose anything because it tries to be a silly story and nothing more. It's one of those games where you are going to be laughing because the game did something completely out of nowhere or you are going to be laughing while referncing it because if you ever describe the story in detail to anyone, you will wonder what the hell you played as the words come out of your mouth (nanomachines, son!). The voice acting is over the top, the dialogue is hilarious, and the characters are just like the voice acting.\n\nOverall, even if you are remotely intersted in spectacle fighters I would highly recommend this game. If you like games like Bayonetta for the crazy flash or God Hand for its shock humor. Give Metal Gear Rising a shot. If you are interested in the Metal Gear franchise and you don't want anything spoiled by this game, the stories compared to this game have similar quirks and they might really surprise you because you might end up deeply enjoying them more than this game, although that might be really hard seeing this game is GODLY.\n\nFor real though, this game makes my pee pee hard.","October 17, 2014","true","23.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I was worried at first, how could the Japanese make a good PC port? All my worries were over when I started cutting a Metal Gear RAY in half at 1080p, 60fps and no problems with the controls whatsoever. Don't let yourself get fooled by those system requirements. The recommended specs are needed if you want everything maxed out at 1080p with 60fps in the most demanding part of the game. So if you have a decent PC, you'll be fine.\nThe story takes place 4 years after Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, in 2018 exactly. The story is not like MGS, but it's more of a spin-off story with Raiden as the main character. This isn't also a sneaking game like MGS, that's Snake's job.\nRaiden's job is to cut his enemies in half with his HF blade. The action is awesome! It may seem like mindless button-mashing, but to let Raiden fight in style you have to use special moves and fast reflexes. The boss fights are long and exciting. You'll definitely get an adrenaline rush during the main boss fights!

In Metal Gear Solid Revengeance we play as Raiden. Raiden runs his own private military firm. When some bad guys think war is better then peace it's up to you as Raiden to stop them from starting World War 3. So how MGR Revengeance ? I had an absolute blast playing it. This game has a different pace then the other Metal Gear games. Where in the other ones you have to take things slow to get to your goal this time you have to go as fast and as chaotic as possible. The game play is awesome. It's in the style of a hack and slash game. The game also has something called a Zandatsu mode. Raiden can go into slow motion and chop everything into small tiny pieces. The soundtrack to this game is amazing and it has some of the best music for a game ever. The boss battles are on a huge scale. Some of the bosses are just insane. The game looks great and the PC port is outstanding. Everything maxed out and solid 60 FPS. Sometimes when you overkill your opponent in the Zandatsu mode the frame rate might start to drop but you shouldn't encounter any problems. The game also has two story dlc's included in this purchases witch both are around 40 minutes long. There's also a VR mini missions which increase the play time. The game has a few minor problems. The camera isn't always the best. I was sometimes struggling to see where I was shot from or where the enemy went while I was too busy dealing with other enemies. The game has a few minor bugs. Overall if you are a fan of Hack and Slash type of games this game is a must own. Everything about this game is almost near perfect and for the price you can't go wrong. This is a must own. I give Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance a 9/10","June 24, 2015","true","8.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Written part below.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/rg_V9cSc70I\n\nThe controls take some getting use it, as playing with a controller is a requirement essentially. Thank goodness it support the 360, PS4, and PS3 controllers, with the ONE also.\n\nIt's not a super looker of a game, but it's a console port after all. Even so TransGaming did an outstanding job bringing it to the Mac and the performance is fantastic. Pity it doesn't support more than 1080p as a resolution though. Even though it allows me to select a higher resolution , it's still 1080p, with just added Letter, and pillar boxing.\n\nThe gameplay is superb, and handles well. It'll keep engaged, that's for sure. Especially if you're a DMC fan to some extent. The story so far doesn't even seem to require you having played any of the previous games in the slightest. Which is fine, it stands on its own merits.\n\nThe biggest negatives, is the constant interrupting cut scenes, that can go on for a tad too long. Featuring the cringiest voice acting around, Uwe Boll's movie might have better acting than this.\nThe worst offender is the camera angles though, you control them with the right analog stick. Which is a mess; given you need to press the button just to the right of it to fight. So you can easily mangle your fingers trying to get anything done.\n\nEven so, it's a very fun game, and certainly worth picking up on a support Mac.","September 26, 2014","true","3.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Created by some of the people who worked on the likes of Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe, and Bayonetta, it certainly lives up to its high pedigree. This game is just straight up, mind-blowingly fun to play.\n\nThis game is all about combat, and the combat system is extremely well designed and fun to use. The parry system (once you've mastered it) feels awesome - you have to "actively" block every attack by simultaneously smashing the joystick and pressing light attack in the direction of the enemy's attack right before it connects, and you have to do it for every individual attack. When you pull it off, you look (and feel) like a total badass. The controls and combos are easy enough to learn, but a steady influx of new moves and alternate weapons keeps it fresh. You also have "blade mode," which lets you go in slow motion and freely slice objects/enemies with the right stick, including precision cuts so you can grab their glowing blue cyber spine and crush it in your hand (which completely refills your health and blade-mode meters, as well as looking super sweet)\n\nA typical enemy encounter: launch an enemy up into the air, jump up, attack them and then slam them back down to the ground, parry-counter an attack to knock them back up, go into slow motion blade mode, do a double side flip, slice through their juicy center, rip out their glowing blue spine, flip a few more times and land on the ground, crush the spine in your hand as body parts rain down around you.\n\nIT IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING COOL.\n\nI recommend watching ChipCheezum's "How to Play Metal Gear Rising" video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7IlIUKP64o&\nThere are a few important concepts that the game kinda brushes over that are really important - the game is challenging but not particularly hard on "Normal" difficulty, as long as you know how to parry and dodge properly.\n\nIf you have any interest in action games at all, I very highly recommend it - we don't get many Japanese third-person action games on PC, and this is one of the best.

Basicly there are many tutorials and stuff here in guides or at YouTube but you will not learn things like moving while blade mode or what exactly dodging dies and how to trigger it and many other things . Could be better implemented since the "Tutorial Missions" are a lot of fun !\n-- Close to wall combat can sometimes be rly bad due to the camara angle that makes you cry in some bossfights\n-- Items .. Well well i think the Items made this game some kind of lame at some points and weren't needed . Like throw 5 Granades and Ninja mode everyone to skip a 5 min fight ... Or Health recovery that just sets you to 100% if you are at 0 it makes the game to easy at some points !\n- George don't want to spoil you buy this guy damn every time i head his voice i was close to hit L2 and mash him into pieces.\n- Overall the Story isn't rly the strength of this game and since i think the devs know this they could shorten some dialogues .\n- Well the world is Grey . Not much more to say but some Tropical or Vulcanic stuff would fit well too .\n- The 2nd Bossfight vs Jetstream Sam took like 2 mins and was just blocking i thought he was one of the strongest :( .\n- Non skippable Credits .. come on no one watches a 10 mins Name list .\n\nThose all are just personal preferences and some little things that have to be changed .\n\n++The Fighting mechanics . I thought God of War had decent fights . Never did i know i was so wrong ! At first you jump into the game and think it's simple . But then all of a sudden BOOOOM you discover jumping over enemies combos blocking dodging slicing someone into pieces at the right time and it becomes INTENSE , the respond is perfect and on point , Raiden just does what you say !\n++The Boss battles ! They are rly entertaining and most are freaking hard ! The last one .... Hell i needed 2 Hours for that !\n++The learning curve ! You rly see how you are getting stronger as you learn more ! The character becomes Stronger yeah but at the end it's all about you as you approach a boss the 10th Time and see you don't loose 1% at the 1st Stage and Rip him apart ... dat feeling  !\n\n+Upgrade and side weapon System : Well you can play as you want and Upgrade yourselfe with weapons or slain enemies .\n+Different Ways to solve something ! You can sneak and use tools if you want , however the fighting is so nice i always went straight to the face !\n+Different enemies require different tactics . It's not all just Block and attack ;) !\n+Costumes ! Well Sombrero .\n+I thought Raiden was some kind of ♥♥♥♥♥ till 1 Part of the Game that changed everything Story and Gameplay wise  !\n\nIf you are not sure if you want to buy this or not just buy it . Read a Basic guide practise blocking and let the fun beginn ! Don't buy the second Blade if you rly want fun btw ;) ! It Destroys everything !\n\nSo buy it play it and get infected .","July 16, 2014","true","13.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You don't need a beast of a PC to play it either. The large size is mostly for the cutscenes. They're all, almost unnecessarily large, super HD footage. It's not a stealth game like other MG games. More like the DMC series or Bayonetta. Also it's quite short but with only about a year to develope the game originally I'd say it's worth the price. Comes with all the DLC too. But I'd wait for Steam sale if you're more tight on cash.\n\nThe negative reviews mostly seem to be from people who expected a MGS style stealth game or never played a Platinum game before. The only issue I do have and agree with them on is the camera in small spaces can be a bit troublesome but if you're a fan of hack and slash games of any kind you know that's an issue in quite a few of them. If you've played those this ones camera issues aren't as bad in comparison.","August 29, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Let's just make that clear. It is however, a complete joy to play. From the very beginning it glorifies the player and effortlessly delivers brutal, fast-paced action combat. Do you like cyborgs and ninjas? Giant robots? Are you aroused by the idea of filleting your enemies into chunks of man-meat? Good news friend. Good news.\n\nBuilding on the addicting gameplay mechanics of their flagship title, Bayonetta, Platinum Games has created an immensely satisfying action game. All the trademark tropes you'd expect from a Kojima/Platinum collaboration are here. Over the top action? Check. Larger than life characters? Check. Wholesale slaughter and destruction on a Biblical scale? Check. MGR:R fuses these simple pillars of fun with mechanics that are easy to learn yet difficult to master. As you slash, parry, dodge and counter-hit through the world, you almost begin to feel as if you're playing a fighting game. I believe this feeling definitely contributes to the enjoyment that MGR:R provides. The flow of combat always feels natural while delivering kills that are satisfying, rewarding and really fun to watch.\n\nThe story of the game is typical of Kojima Productions. Evil PMCs are doing bad things. As a member of a good PMC you have to stop them from profiting from the suffering of innocent people. You'll fight villains who yammer on about something philosophical while you're severing their various appendages, but any depth this game tries to achieve is quickly overshadowed by the insanity that makes it so enjoyable. Most of the dialogue is tiresome and the English V/O is cringe inducing. This made the omission of a Japanese dialogue option even more frustrating. However, despite these flaws the story does have its humorous moments and I genuinely laughed out loud more than once.\n\nWhile the combat mechanics of the game are intuitive, mastering them will take time. It took me most of my first play-through before I felt like I could execute moves and combos competently. It also does lack some explanation on what I would consider key mechanics and I didn't feel like I fully grasped their nuances until about halfway through the main story. If you're going to dive in, take some time and browse the "Help" menu to familiarize yourself with the controls and basic combos. There are also several VR Missions that you can use for practice. Navigating the menus in-game can also be somewhat frustrating, especially when switching secondary weapons and items in the middle of combat.\n\nBottom line: If you're a person who enjoys frantic action, over-the-top ultra-violence and feeling like a complete badass, than Metal Gear Rising: REVENGEANCE is a game for you. At a $30 price point that includes the full game plus the entire catalogue of DLC, this experience is a steal. As long as you don't expect more than what is advertised, you won't be disappointed.\n\n-ZC","January 14, 2014","true","47.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You can go into a mode where you precisely slice up whatever is in front of you. Even when not in this mode the slicing mechanic is the most impressive thing I've seen like it.

There is stealth, and you can easily play through some segments completely stealthy, but I haven't.\n\nI honestly don't know what more to say about this game.

Not only that but the actual fighting mechanics are not the best, for eg. you can only block when the opponent is attacking, you also have to push the joystick in the direction of the attacker and when you remember the camera is awful this in itself can become a challenge. Give the game time though and it soon becomes really enjoyable, one you will happily play again. You cant beat the cut scenes, there trully awesome and I myself loved watching them and still do. The bosses just rock and are easily some of the most bad ♥♥♥ characters ive seen..... Monsoon is awesome. The music aswell really get the heart thumping. I paticularly loved the final boss fight. The achievements in game imo are real tough and to 100% this your have your work cut out...... I dont see myself putting the time in required. Overall then im really impressed, if it wasnt for that damn camera n mayb a few other small problems I would rate this game 10/10, as it is though a 8 to 8.5/10 seems fair. This is actually the first Metal Gear game ive played other than a quick go on a friends console....... believe me if more are realeased on pc it wont be the last!\n\n","September 25, 2014","true","67.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The boss fights and their musical scores are a pure bliss\n* The story, the dialogs, the characters, everything is over-the-top and corny but extremely self-conscious about it\n* The PC port is decent enough, the price is cheap, and all the console DLCs are included\n\nCons\n* It feels slightly rushed once you finish Chapter 3. The rest of the game is short and sometimes feels a tad repetitive\n* The camera can sometimes be a bit wonky, a shame in a game focused on reading your opponent's moves and parrying or dodging them\n* There isn't exploration or real infiltration. That isn't a problem in itself, but for a Metal Gear game, that's probably a minus\n\nMy advice - there is no shame in reading some gameplay guides if you find it too difficult. The game isn't hard but the tutorials are too basic to teach you how to excel at it.","February 23, 2014","true","24.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Combining fast-paced arcade-style swordplay with a cheesy metal soundtrack straight out of the 80s makes for an awesome fun time. In many ways it reminds me of God Hand, so if you enjoyed that you'll likely have a good time with this game. It's also worth noting that the PC version comes with all DLC included, so if you want to beat the game as it was originally made, then steer clear of the DLC armour sets and weapons on your first playthrough.\nIn conclusion, METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE deserves its offically all-caps title, which should be screamed as though it were a lyric from an 80s power ballad.","July 12, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Basicly there are many tutorials and stuff here in guides or at YouTube but you will not learn things like moving while blade mode or what exactly dodging dies and how to trigger it and many other things . Could be better implemented since the "Tutorial Missions" are a lot of fun !\n-- Close to wall combat can sometimes be rly bad due to the camara angle that makes you cry in some bossfights\n-- Items .. Well well i think the Items made this game some kind of lame at some points and weren't needed . Like throw 5 Granades and Ninja mode everyone to skip a 5 min fight ... Or Health recovery that just sets you to 100% if you are at 0 it makes the game to easy at some points !\n- George don't want to spoil you buy this guy damn every time i head his voice i was close to hit L2 and mash him into pieces.\n- Overall the Story isn't rly the strength of this game and since i think the devs know this they could shorten some dialogues .\n- Well the world is Grey . Not much more to say but some Tropical or Vulcanic stuff would fit well too .\n- The 2nd Bossfight vs Jetstream Sam took like 2 mins and was just blocking i thought he was one of the strongest :( .\n- Non skippable Credits .. come on no one watches a 10 mins Name list .\n\nThose all are just personal preferences and some little things that have to be changed .\n\n++The Fighting mechanics . I thought God of War had decent fights . Never did i know i was so wrong ! At first you jump into the game and think it's simple . But then all of a sudden BOOOOM you discover jumping over enemies combos blocking dodging slicing someone into pieces at the right time and it becomes INTENSE , the respond is perfect and on point , Raiden just does what you say !\n++The Boss battles ! They are rly entertaining and most are freaking hard ! The last one .... Hell i needed 2 Hours for that !\n++The learning curve ! You rly see how you are getting stronger as you learn more ! The character becomes Stronger yeah but at the end it's all about you as you approach a boss the 10th Time and see you don't loose 1% at the 1st Stage and Rip him apart ... dat feeling  !\n\n+Upgrade and side weapon System : Well you can play as you want and Upgrade yourselfe with weapons or slain enemies .\n+Different Ways to solve something ! You can sneak and use tools if you want , however the fighting is so nice i always went straight to the face !\n+Different enemies require different tactics . It's not all just Block and attack ;) !\n+Costumes ! Well Sombrero .\n+I thought Raiden was some kind of ♥♥♥♥♥ till 1 Part of the Game that changed everything Story and Gameplay wise  !\n\nIf you are not sure if you want to buy this or not just buy it . Read a Basic guide practise blocking and let the fun beginn ! Don't buy the second Blade if you rly want fun btw ;) ! It Destroys everything !\n\nSo buy it play it and get infected .","July 16, 2014","true","13.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You don't need a beast of a PC to play it either. The large size is mostly for the cutscenes. They're all, almost unnecessarily large, super HD footage. It's not a stealth game like other MG games. More like the DMC series or Bayonetta. Also it's quite short but with only about a year to develope the game originally I'd say it's worth the price. Comes with all the DLC too. But I'd wait for Steam sale if you're more tight on cash.\n\nThe negative reviews mostly seem to be from people who expected a MGS style stealth game or never played a Platinum game before. The only issue I do have and agree with them on is the camera in small spaces can be a bit troublesome but if you're a fan of hack and slash games of any kind you know that's an issue in quite a few of them. If you've played those this ones camera issues aren't as bad in comparison.","August 29, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have not been playing for very long but the gameplay is very fast and engaging. The choreography is gorgeous. the learning curve is appropriate for an action game of this type. After watching a playthrough while waiting for the release, I will say that the campaign is a bi short but replay value is present making this a solid single player game. As previousely stated, the art is fantastic. The aesthetic beuty of both the characters and the enviornments is particularly awe inspiring. Even if the price of this game is what it is, I'd definately say it's worth it. I was intrigued by the voice acting. Characters sounded different than what I expected but this is not a detrement to the experience by any means. The characters themselves start out a bit cliche in the exposition but unfold as the game progresses. All in all, so far, this game is at the very least worth a look. With it's memorable aesthetic beuty, unique concepts and enemies and large gamut of enviornments that you will traverse in the short but sweet campaign.","January 9, 2014","true","50.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The boss fights and their musical scores are a pure bliss\n* The story, the dialogs, the characters, everything is over-the-top and corny but extremely self-conscious about it\n* The PC port is decent enough, the price is cheap, and all the console DLCs are included\n\nCons\n* It feels slightly rushed once you finish Chapter 3. The rest of the game is short and sometimes feels a tad repetitive\n* The camera can sometimes be a bit wonky, a shame in a game focused on reading your opponent's moves and parrying or dodging them\n* There isn't exploration or real infiltration. That isn't a problem in itself, but for a Metal Gear game, that's probably a minus\n\nMy advice - there is no shame in reading some gameplay guides if you find it too difficult. The game isn't hard but the tutorials are too basic to teach you how to excel at it.","February 23, 2014","true","24.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

From button masher to deep tactical combat. On higher difficulty settings enemies not only have more HP and deal more damage to the player but also act totally different (much more aggressive, flanking, attacking simultaneously from different directions, dodging your counter attacks etc.)\nLots of collectibles and customization options.\nVariety of VR Missions.\nAll DLC included.\nCons:\nGame is short (10-15 hours FP on HARD difficulty, under 2 hours when you know everything)\nDLC is fun but poorly implemented, differentiates gameplay mechanics in some doubtful ways.\n\nOverall - an amazing experience, 9/10","April 22, 2015","true","262.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is one of my favorite genres and Platinum is one of my favorite developers and I'm a long time fan of the Metal Gear series. What could go wrong?\n\n(I should mention that my playtime doesn't reflect the actual time I played it. I played this game a lot more on PS3 when it came out. I beat it on Hard and Very Hard and got bored in the middle of my Revengence playthrough. I played it once again on PC for the DLCs.)\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe edgy music works somehow. Some characters are really enjoyable (some are terrible). Story itself is ignorable (and hopefully non-canon to the already ruined canon of the series).\n\nThe cutting is very gimmicky. It gets old and boring quick.\n\nThe core gameplay is what should matter in this genre. Here, it gets some things wrong. My main problem with this game is the way it expects you to play it. The "correct" way to play the game is to get those perfect parries and use finishing moves. You get rewarded with this long finising animation with a cutting finish to get full health. That long animation takes you out of the action for way too long and it happens way too often once you learn the timing. In a fight with 3 or 5 regular enemies around you, you often get that perfect parry + finishing for all of them one after the other. It gets so annoying to watch that same animation play out (the Sam DLC actually did it way better as the animation is way shorter there). The combo possibilities being low doesn't help much either. New weapons have too few moves and you can't switch between them on the fly.\n\nAnother major flaw IMO is that this game is too happy with healing items. I don't use healing items in games of this genre and I played this game without ever using rations. The equivalent of rations, item that instantly revives you at 0 health, you get way too often in other games is usually rare or really expensive (games like DMC, Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden Black). You get them often and you get them in the middle of boss battles. I feel like they were too concerned with making this game accessible they missed the chance of making an infamously hard game like Ninja Gaiden Black or DMC3. I actually know someone who was able to beat the game on Normal without EVER learning to parry which is supposed to be the core mechanic of the game. He was able to do that because the game gives you too many healing items.\n\nIf they were given more time to balance the combat and weren't given constraints to make it accessible and weren't forced to include cutting gimmicks, this game could have been much much more.","January 18","true","14.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

During one of his mission, a mysterious cyborg ninja called 'Samuel' attacks Raidens convoy and the president that Raiden protects. Company , that Samuel works for 'Desperado' launches and attack to presidents convoy and leave Raiden to save the president. Knowing that this would be no easy job, Raiden quickly reaches his katana and begin to slice his enemies with his new nano-cyborg enchancement and tecnique, Zangeki and later on Zandatsu. After some events, Raiden left to die and swear revenge on the group who attacked the president and injured him. After three weeks , he begins a new mission with new enhancements , in which his path crossed with the enemies he searched. 'Desperado'\nFor Metal Gear fans : Raiden is changed , in the way that you don't like. He seems to be more 'Jack' than Raiden. The events of this games might not affect Metal Gear series, which I don't know, but there are also quite good things for MG series also, which is that Raiden meets with Sunny after Guns of the Patriots crisis.\nFor Hack'n Slash / action / DmC lovers : Zangeki / Zandatsu and blade combos are just for you. Slicing the enemy just the way you wanted and counting their parts are amusing most of the times. BUT, but, the most amusing part of this game are boss fights and their soundtrack. During these encounter you just let your self flow with Raiden katana while you destroy your enemies and sing alongside the soundtrack during you perform Zangeki.","January 13, 2014","true","32.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not to mention there are also tougher difficulties to unlock (which you can also unlock right from the start by using the infamous Konami code), and it has very high replayability.\nI find that using a certain style of music, by which I mean with actual lyrics, can be really hit or miss in a game. Fortunately, I find it was pulled off well in MGR, and a little thing they implemented being it's just the music throughout the fight, but as you get nearer actually defeating your enemy, the lyrics will come in. Just something about how it happens in the middle of it all that makes it quite exciting.\nCombat itself is quite fun. You are able to parry/evade all attacks, which is nice, however it will take some practice, as you might expect, to become very efficient at it.\n\nAlso, it's a good port, the system requirements being a bit overblown, if only more devs could do at least what Platinum Games has done for MGR.\n\nConsidering the game is only $30, or $20 when I got it during the 2013 Christmas sale, I'd say it's well worth the money.","January 13, 2014","true","68.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I can't say I'm really suprised; a majority of the publishers are realizing that there's a decent market for PC players. Whether they can create a decent PC port/Game (see the Batman: AA) or fall flat on their face (see dark souls pre mods) is the real question.  Konami/Platinum did a pretty good job!\n\nGraphically wise its so-so.  They give you a few options to spruce it up;  1080p (I believe thats the max, correct me if I'm wrong), some AA and better texture quality/filters.  However, I did notice some polygons and poor textures that could only be from its Xbox/PS counter parts.  You can see it from the title screen that its not exactly up to PC standards, but then again this is a beatem up.  Cutscenes suffer from this as well, so don't expect too much of a graphical bump.\n\nThe most worrisome part of any PC port is how well the developers can manage to translate the controls to PC.  I understand that you can just use your xbox or PS controller, but the mark of a good port should be its translation to keyboard+mouse, other than graphics.  A lot of games have flopped on this; Capcom's RE 4 + 5 were god awful, as was Dark Souls, to the point they were unplayable without a controller.  Thankfully, MGR takes after Batman: Arkham Asylum. A little bit of customization and you are all set to slice and dice your way to victory.\n\nThe two issues with controls I found in MGR were Blade mode and item use.  I cannot speak for how blade mode runs on a controller, but using the mouse during quicktime blademode events such as Armstrong or Monsoon was frustrating.  Aiming was a bit of a challenge and took some time getting used to how sensitive the blade tracer would act resulted in a few unncessary restarts.  However, I did not seem to have a problem in regular fights for zandatsu hits, so perhaps I just needed some time to adjust.  Using items were a bit of a chore and slowed down the flow of fights, or simply made some points of the game that could be really challenging too easy.  Red Phos/EMPs could be abused to an extreme degree with a combination of ripper mode.\n\nListen to the sound track.  Enjoy the sound track. Be the sound track.\n\nGame play is alright.  It's a simplistic.  A little too simplistic.  It comes down to parry everything if u can and offensive defense the rest.  Easy to play, easy to master, which can cut into the replay for some.  Keep in mind, it hasn't stopped me from doing a hard, very hard, and soon a Revengence run.  It is a fun game, it's just that its dumbed down compared to what you'd expect from this kind of game.  DMC veterans might be a little disappointed that its pretty bland, but I found the combination of techniques, weapons, and other items to make up for this bit of lacking.  Others may not see past it, which I will sympathize with, but give it a chance and on Revengence mode you will start to get frustrated.\n\nI'll give it a thumbs up for now.  There will be points where you will scream KOOOOOOOOOJJJJJJJJJJIMMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAA, but enjoy it for what it is.","February 2, 2014","true","46.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Wonderful, wonderful tracks to suit the action.\n-The parry system sits on a different level from usual dodging or blocking in hack 'n' slash titles, rewarding skillful defense with offensive opportunities.\n-The Blade Mode gimmick remains fun to use and doesn't overpower regular swordplay.\n-There is 'a' stealth mechanic, but it isn't very strong or even necessary. It's mainly good for knocking out larger enemies before you're spotted. Besides, that's not what 'this' Metal Gear's about.\n-Raiden's pretty strong. He lifts heavy things.  He's also the hero of Mexico and Snake's personal stalker.\n\nI'm generally glad to accept this spinoff as my first Metal Gear PC game.","February 5, 2014","true","32.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Not to mention there are also tougher difficulties to unlock (which you can also unlock right from the start by using the infamous Konami code), and it has very high replayability.\nI find that using a certain style of music, by which I mean with actual lyrics, can be really hit or miss in a game. Fortunately, I find it was pulled off well in MGR, and a little thing they implemented being it's just the music throughout the fight, but as you get nearer actually defeating your enemy, the lyrics will come in. Just something about how it happens in the middle of it all that makes it quite exciting.\nCombat itself is quite fun. You are able to parry/evade all attacks, which is nice, however it will take some practice, as you might expect, to become very efficient at it.\n\nAlso, it's a good port, the system requirements being a bit overblown, if only more devs could do at least what Platinum Games has done for MGR.\n\nConsidering the game is only $30, or $20 when I got it during the 2013 Christmas sale, I'd say it's well worth the money.","January 13, 2014","true","68.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/recommended/235460/","suspectfenster","fenster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/suspectfenster/","150 products in account","As a long time Metal Gear Solid fan, I was really intrigued by the concept of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.  In many ways, what you see is what you get with Revengeance -- it’s the kind of insane, high octane thrill ride we’ve come to expect from Platinum with Metal Gear tropes and characters crammed in.  Revengeance treads the “over-the-top” line extremely well; despite having a total nonsense story, the characters are surprisingly endearing, the cutscenes are very well produced, and the action is simply a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nIn Revengeance, you play as Raiden, the main protagonist from Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and the cyber ninja from MGS4.  Fans who hated Raiden in MGS2 (and you’re certainly not alone) can take solace in the fact that this is more of the MGS4-style Raiden; Quinton Flynn voices Raiden in a gruff, jaded tone and there is little Rose to speak of.  The story is something about a corporation harvesting brains and a senator fueling a war economy -- truthfully it is even more nonsensical than a normal MGS storyline (which is saying something), but it fits the theme of the overall game well.  Metal Gear Solid fans will find subtle nods to past games and many of the hallmark oddities of the series are present here (see: cardboard boxes).\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that cutscenes are done extremely well, and while voice acting is pretty subpar, there are some standout performances among the group.  The cheesy dialogue classic to the MGS franchise is present in spades, which may be grating for newcomers, but for series fans it is always great to hear.   There are a fair amount of long cutscenes, which I think worked against the game’s momentum at times.  I love MGS cutscenes, but in an intense action game like this, they sometimes killed the pacing of the gameplay.  There is a codec in Revengeance, and while the conversations are interesting enough, I again felt like they killed the pacing a bit.\n\nGameplay itself plays like other Platinum action games -- the focus is on quick reactions to enemy attacks and building combos.  The action is incredibly over-the-top; within the first few minutes of the game you destroy a Metal Gear Ray by slicing it in half, only after running down the side of a building and jumping on rockets in mid-air.  It may be a bit too ridiculous for some, but if you can embrace the crazy, it’s actually pretty amazing.   Occassionally I felt like Revengeance wanted me to really try and be stealthy, but to be honest I think stealth is best left to the Solid series.  The mechanics for stealth aren’t nearly as satisfying in Revengeance and I almost wish they had forgone the option altogether.  Regardless, the parry system is satisfying, boss fights are incredibly epic (mostly), and there is a lot of side content for those who want even more of the combat system after the game is over.\n\nRevengeance is relatively short but packs in a lot of side content, including tons of VR missions and two DLC missions (in the Steam version). I’d recommend playing both DLC missions.  The second is definitely the weaker of the two, but I enjoyed both and they provided some longevity to the game.\n\nThose looking for a balls-out action game should find themselves very pleased with Revengeance.  The Metal Gear theme is the icing on the cake for longtime fans, but it’s not even remotely necessary to understand the lore to enjoy this game to its fullest.  The action is satisfying, cutscenes are frequently fun to watch, and the craziness is set to full throttle.  Check out this game.","February 1, 2015","true","18.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/235460/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","I'll be honest: I have never been a fan of Metal Gear. I like Stealth based games, but this series just has TOO MUCH STORYLINE on it. I like good stories, but when most cutscenes take from 5 minutes to 10, I just get bored. Because of that, I've been trying to stay away from this game, I though it was more of the same sh#t... Until this Holiday sale, where I saw it at 4€. I had arround 5€ left on my Steam account, so I decided to give it a try, and see what is this madness all about. So, where did they ♥♥♥♥ it up? Simple, they didn't. I will talk about the bad things first, though I have to say it took me sometime to find bad stuff to talk about, and most of it are just little problems:\n\nFirst and foremost, even if the gameplay is nearly perfect for a Hack n' Slash, the game does not teach you the controls properly. Now hear me on this one, I HATE when a game holds your hand, it's terrible when games keep throwing tutorials after 6 hours into the game... But that being said, I had issues with it, let me give you a proper example:\n\nOne of the main moves you'll have to learn during the game, is the Parry. It's nearly Impossible to play this game without parrying your enemies. Where's the issue? The game tells you about parrying enemies after you have already defeated a boss, WHERE PARRYING COULD HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY USEFUL! This example isn't enough? Let me give you one 10 times worse:\n\nAnother move that can be EXTREMELY useful during the game is the "dodge" moves. Some of the enemies are extremely difficult to dodge without it (more on that later). And when does the game teach you to do this move? Uh...Never? I watched videos in Youtube about the game, and I saw people doing the move, so I got curious and tried to do it. When I was already 12 HOURS INTO THE GAME, DOING THE DLC'S, I found out how to do it. WHEN I DIDN'T NEED IT ANYMORE! There's no excuse for that, even the most basic "Hard-core-♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥♥" games out there, like the Over-rated Dark Souls tells you how to do crap in the Tutorial stage.\n\nThe second problem I had are a few bosses of the game. As usual, I play the game from start to finish in the "Hard" difficulty because games these days are just too easy. And well, I had no issue on it, the game felt challenging, and the bosses were amazing... Except the last boss. I did die a few times with some bosses, but because I couldn't follow a proper way to defeat him in the first try. The final boss instead throws attacks that are just confusing to follow and fell cheap as f#ck. Let me explain it properly:\n\nWhen an enemy is going to do an attack that you can parry, you can see a red light comming from his eyes, that's what tells you that you have to parry. What happens with this boss? Of all the attacks he has that you can parry, some of them have this light come up too early. And what happens if you parry too early? You get hit anyway. I don't get it, did the devs miss that? Or they tried to punish people with extremely good reflexes? I was playing in the Hard Difficulty, and his hits did extreme damage, but I was getting hit because of a game flaw. That's not a challenge, that's unfair. And not only the Final Boss has this issue, a few other enemies have it as well, like the Wolf-like robots, and the Gorrilla ones also have a few attacks were the red light appears way too early and makes you get hit for no reason.\n\nAnother little issue I had with this game, is maybe a strange one to explain: How the story is done. During the game, a character joins Raiden, a robot named Blade-Wolf. He's cool as f#ck, he has a nice personality, good and memorable quotes... And yet he's not playable in the game? OH WOW NEVERMIND, he's playable in the DLC, so it's good...UNLESS THEY DECIDE TO MAKE HIS STORY LAST ONE HOUR. And that's including the 15 minutes of cutscenes. What the hell, man? I was really looking forward to play as Blade-Wolf during the game alongside Raiden, but the game only gives me the chance to do it in a painful cheap DLC (that thankfully it's already in the PC version of the game) that uses maps from the original game, with only a new boss and some new tracks. And the same goes with the other DLC, Jetstream's story: 3 bosses that are ALL RECLYCLED with one or two new tracks, and a character that we all wanted to play way more than the game allowed us to.\n\nMy final issue with the game are both the camera and the stealth sections. Now I understand the game has "Metal Gear" on the name, but Stealth feels like a joke. It's hard and boring to pull-off, and feels dumb when you can just kill everyone in arround a minute, anyway. The camera was getting in the way through the entire game, specially when you lock into an enemy. The worst part about it is that you need to move in the direction the enemy is attacking to Parry, and with the camera moving in all directions, parrying can become a pain if you use the Lock option. I recommend only using it on bosses, and even then it can f#ck you up at times.\n\nNow that being said, let's talk about what's good about the game... That's pretty much everything.\n\nThe story doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's great. Why? Metal Gear itself is just TOO SERIOUS in my opinion, and this game instead was quite entertaining. Everything moves arround some sort of "Cyborg-Ninja" named Raiden (or Thunder-bolt, for people who want to ♥♥♥♥ him off), who for what I know was in Metal Gear 2 or something, and everyone  though he was a f#cking sh#tty character, who goes into a quest of vengeance because of what happens in Africa, during the tutorial mission. I won't spoil much, but I'll stay that you don't need to know about the Metal Gear Saga, and that the story is great from start to finish, even though the final battle looked a bit... Rushed.\n\nCombat feels amazing (when it doesn't glitch like I said before), and even if it feels like it ripped-off some stuff from the "Afro Samurai" game (I recommend that game too, but it's a console exclusive), it manages to stay original and true to itself. You have your own sword, and can get new weapons when defeating bosses. I didn't use those weapons much though, because it's a pain to switch weapons during combat... But the "Spear-like" weapon was really helpfun for when you get surrounded by enemies. You can also use Secondary weapons that you find during the game, such as Rocket launchers and grenades. I didn't used them much, they were helpful in their own way. During the game you get "Battle Points" (actually f#ck that, for me they were Badass Points), that you can use to upgrade yourself, or purchase new armors, something that makes taking more fights helpfun, something that makes stealth even more pointless by accident, but believe me; f#ck stealth in this game.\n\nThe best part of the game is probably both the Bosses and the music. I'm not joking arround, this game has one of the best soundtracks I've heard so far. It comes close to Bastion's soundtrack, AND THAT SOUNDTRACK WAS LITERALLY PERFECT. I'm still listening to the soundtrack while making this review, THAT'S HOW GOOD IT IS. The bosses in the other hand are just over-the-top, and that's something that confuse me: Wasn't Metal Gear a realistic game? BECAUSE HERE YOU HAVE AN AMERICAN CYBORG-NINJA DOING MULTIPLE SUPLEX TO GIGANTIC ROBOTS, AND THE FINAL BOSS IS LITERALLY MIXING MECHA-HITLER WITH HULK HOGAN. That being said, I had LOTS OF FUN with the bosses, they're just... Beautiful to watch in fights, have solid animations, EXTREMELY BADASS SOUNDTRACK, and insane quick-time-events that make it look like an episode of Dragon Ball Z, with so many explosions, it seems like the game was made by Mr. Torgue and Michael Bay.\n\nFor 4€, I feel like I've stolen this game. Personally, 10€ for this is already an extremely fine deal. Of course, if you're a cheap b#stard, you can wait for better deals, but it's up to you. You better learn the Rules of Nature, though!","January 7, 2015","true","22.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","8"

You can easily beat it under 4 hours if you skip cutscenes and know what you're doing. Otherwise, you can squeeze a good 10 hours from the campaign and two DLC stories. The DLC is fun, giving you two completely different characters to use. It's too bad you can't use them in the main campaign. There are VR missions which are basically "complete this objective" trials like stealth or kill all enemies.\n\nThe combat can be confusing, but once you understand it then it becomes addicting. Invest a few minutes into reading or watching some tutorials otherwise you'll miss out on the depth of the gameplay. It's satisfying to slice apart an enemy and rewarded with health. You literally rip out their spines and crush them in your hand. The story is a campier take on Metal Gear. Don't take it seriously. It has a fantastically cheesy (but catchy) soundtrack to match. I strongly recommend a 360 controller because the thumbsticks allow for precise control of your sword.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sir_Sanity/recommended/235460/","Sir_Sanity","Sir_Sanity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sir_Sanity/","129 products in account","The game is a massive departure from the typical Metal Gear series, essentially giving new life to the in between period before MGS V. The game is based around the former whiny little ♥♥♥♥♥ named Raiden who now returns as a cyborg ninja badass because reasons. Well, we all know it was ♥♥♥♥ing Japan. The gameplay is extremely simple and is mucked up by the inclusion of an almost useless upgrade and spec system. The music is pretty much overly dramatically, whimsically, weird J-pop of some screaming teen about to climax over hatsune miku. The ♥♥♥♥ing Japanese virgin he is. Anyway the boss battles do hand you a whole lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t after the first two, the parry system only works when it wants to, and the camera is not free form in the slightest, always locking back to its default position after trying to look around which kills the stealth mechanic. Also, THERE'S A ♥♥♥♥ING STEALTH MECHANIC. You may be reading that as if I'm excited when in reality I want to go to the specific ♥♥♥♥ face of a man who came up with that idea, hire a 400+lb transvestite hooker to sit on the man's face for at least 36 hours strait doing nothing but forcefully queefing all over his now uglied mug. Yes, I know the stealthing is easy to the skilled but ♥♥♥♥ him specifically like I'm the rain god that only rains upon that flaky ♥♥♥♥♥ in the coffee shop. The game isn't taxing until you turn up msaa to 8x and that CPU death setting to its highest setting. The game is locked at 60fps and has dodgy textures but who gives a damn? I don'. And whoever does is the stealth mechanic guy who is already on hour 4 of his queefening, Overall the game is good, not amazing, but good in a badass sort of way. If you like that ♥♥♥♥ then buy that ♥♥♥♥, simple as that. Well, no but shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and buy it,","July 20, 2015","true","8.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

So after the patriots (other games) hes in a group Maverick Security Consulting, Inc., he became a Vip cyborg guardian putting his killing days to the past. He told himself that his sword was a tool of justice, but he himself was lying to himself and so Jack the ripper slowly came back "I am Lightning. The rain transformed"\n\nPros:\n1.

This game however is borderline not involved with that universe. Raiden is here.. Luckily for cheap on early on you get to change your outfit to Frank Jaegar proper. You still have to hear Raiden whine about crap in the cut scenes though.\n\nHowever, I will base this review on the games own merits. Drawing no further conclusions by comparison to MGS.\n\nPros:\n- You get to be a ninja, GOTY. Seriously though Ninja's are awesome.\n- You get to cut everything up real good.\n- I ran up a barrage of missiles and cut a helicopter into 1000+ pieces.\n- You get to cut everything up real good.\n- Really great soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- The enemies are tired and repeat too often.\n- I didn't find the combos between weak and strong attacks compelling (Left me yearning for DMC/Ninja Gaiden Black)\n- The parry system is fine but its inconsistent. Leading to excessive frustration.\n- There really isn't a dodge system (Offensive Defense is just striking and dodging at the same time, which I also found to be inconsistent. Maybe it was just me but I consider myself on the high end of average at character action games)\n-HE IS A NINJA, WHY IS THERE NO ROLL ABILITY. Major oversight\n- The camera is unruly. I found it easier to control with Mouse and Keyboard. But that hurt my pinky as ninja sprint and Zandatsu are on Ctrl and L.Shift respectively. I couldn't find a happy replacement for these key bindings either. Apparently it doesn't like my mouses side buttons.\n- Often the best strategy to kill things was to Zandatsu the crap out of everything and run away, rinse and repeat. That got boring, however you get to cut stuff up real good(see the Pros section lol)\n- Even though its only around 6 hours, I don't see myself finishing it. Never say never except in this sentence.\n\nI can't truly recommend this even as a Metal Gear fan but it is a fun diversion. For whatever reason there is no mixed option and I wouldn't recommend that you NOT play this at all.","December 21, 2014","true","4.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlloyMorph/recommended/235460/","AlloyMorph","AlloyMorph","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlloyMorph/","145 products in account","What there is to love about this game:\n\n- Cutting EVERYTHING to ribbons and watching as your CPU tries to properly calculate where all those physics objects you just created should be.\n\n- Spectacle Fighter combos that both look badass in their own right and make callbacks to Cyborg-Ninja-Raiden's first appearance in MGS4. You want to suplex a Metal Gear? You can. You want to slash a bunch of gunmen up with a sword you're holding with your foot? You can. You want to ambush some unsuspecting guards by climbing inside a barrel and rolling at them? It's not optimal but DO IT ANYWAY 'CAUSE YOU CAN!\n\n- The most ridiculous Metal Gear ever written that is simultaneously more self-aware of its own absurdity than any of it's predecessors.\n\n- The best boss fights I've ever experienced in any game, hands-down. Hard as nails, but satisfying like nothing else once you master them. If you're not experienced with Spectacle Fighters, I recommend buying the White Armor body as soon as you can because you'll die a LOT if you don't know what you're doing.\n\n- An iconic soundtrack that will get you STOKED for the action that unfolds on-screen.\n\n- Huge replayability. Like every other title by Platinum Games, you don't really "beat" the game until you've attained the maximum rank for each of the fights. Combined with huge amounts of collectibles, "secret" fights that you have to backtrack at times in order to find and two bonus difficulty modes that only unlock once you beat the game on the hardest available difficulty, there is plenty of pull to keep coming back to this one after your first time.\n\n\nWhat this game could disappoint you with:\n\n- Controller is a must. The PC port is functional, *except* for proper mouse support: you can't bind more than the standard Left, Middle, Right buttons to anything and there appears to be negative cursor acceleration that becomes very obvious when in Blade Mode (how you make presicion cuts). On top of that, parrying is finnicky with the keyboard because it requires you to press the movement key that is facing the enemy about to hit you; easy with an analog stick but far more limiting when done with 8-way digital movement.\n\n- The game has a difficult time explaining itself to you; the initial VR tutorial only covers 4 mechanics that the prologue level teaches you anyway and many of the subtleties are never shown to you at all. I recommend watching Chip Cheezum's How to Play guide for this game, else you may find yourself very frustrated with something that you don't understand. http://youtu.be/C7IlIUKP64o\n\n- The level design is adaquate at best and uninspired at worst, though this is somewhat limited by the Metal Gear mythos. And though it technically isn't completely linear (as many collectibles are found in dead-ends that branch slighttly from the main path) your chances for exploration will be very limited.\n\n- The main story only has a duration of 5 hours give or take, and unless you go through all the codecs to hear what Raiden is saying to his crew between setpieces you won't find a lot of the complexity that Solid presents.\n\n- The cutscenes are lower-resolution than the gameplay and run at 30 FPS, which when going from a smooth in-game 60 can be a bit jarring. On top of that they are also uncompressed; meaning that out of the 25GB space the download takes up, only 2GB or so make up the actual game.\n\nRecommended: The guys behind this game made Bayonetta, and the director of this game was the director of Viewtiful Joe. If you know what those games are or if you love DMC but hate the new Dante you should probably own this. For everyone else, expect a well-made action game that will give you more enjoyment the more time you spend mastering it.","October 26, 2014","true","172.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I like the MGS series, maybe not as much as the die hard fans but when ever I played them I always seem to spend most of my time in the VR missions playing as FOX or Raiden since I am more into those two characters and their fighting style. With that said the MGS series is full of very interesting characters and has some of the most awesome war/comedic plots I have ever seen in my life. Any MGS fan should definitiley give this game a go.\n\nAs you can see Im writing this review withought finishing the game but I just felt like I had to touch up on a few things just incase anyone in my friends list seen me playing this game and was on the fence with this one. Like almost any game out there this game has its flaws like. At times the plot takes a twist into the awesome teretory with its comedy, like those moments when you are on the radio with someone just like in any other MGS game and you see characters interacting with each other, it brings life to the game in many ways and you start caring for the characters, its cool! there is a ton of dialogue and its all well put together, its like whatching real people have conversations.  At times it can feel like you're going from point A to point B with the levels (which is what you will mostly be doing) but being able to interact with the world a bit by slicing things keeps the fun going and its awesome how you can custom Raiden's looks and weapons. ( I love the FOX suit!! *fan boy scream*)\n\nNow for the gameplay, Its good! really fun!! and next to the dialogues its the second best thing in the game. Its such a satisfying feeling to be able to not only control where your blade goes, but also to have control over the speed of the gameplay as you switch from fast paced action to slow motion with the simple hit of a button to cut targets precisely how you want to cut them. The animations are superb as you slice your foes into bits (I sound like a sicko hu? lol) and anything else from cars, tanks, boxes, fruits, helicopters and much more.. even beautiful female foes :[ :D\nBoss fights are top notch and fun but the game could go without the QTEs during these fights if you ask me. The VR missions which are playable at anytime will give the game some replay value.\n\nThe presentation in this game is awesome, nothing beats being a Cyborg Ninja in a battle field in the world of MGS.. Raiden looks hawt. Character designs are out of this world crazy and the music is cool, a mix of action movie style themes with some metal. Enemies spand from cyborgs, Geckos, helicopters, a robotic wolf, tanks,  an awesome samurai like cyborg and much more.\n\nOn the Cyborg Ninja scale, I give this game an 9/10. Kojima did good by giving this one to Platinum games, I cant picture anyone else doing anything better but hey.. feel free to surprize me Mr. Kojima.","January 14, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CommanderFlynn/recommended/235460/","CommanderFlynn","=SM= CommanderFlynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CommanderFlynn/","415 products in account","Firstly, from so much playtime from the Console game, I was skeptical at this being ported over. Platnium has never done a PC game before, let alone a port - and that is somewhat evident in this port. However if this is the quality of ports we are going to have in 2014? It's looking to be a good year.\n\nMy first small gripe is the texture quality. It's somewhat evident that the game is using low-res textures even on the highest of settings. It's a small gripe, because believe me, the only time you'll notice this is during the cutscenes when you're not actually doing anything and paying attentiont to...what this game has for a story.\n\nSecondary are the options, the resoltuion will auto apply every time you select one. A small gripe but I know some users that have experienced black screens from selecting too high of a reoslution (for some reason) so take it slow when doing this :).\n\nControl wise I have no complaints. It's fairly well done with each key being rebindable. However the blade mode is somewhat...broken using a mouse. Precision cuts are fairly difficult to do and you're not simply offered the same precision as using an analog stick. For that reason alone I would highly recommend a controller for MGR:R HOWEVER - given time I think it can be manageable.\n\nMetal Gear RISING (please note the RISING part of the title) is a spin off game developed by Platnium with Kojima helping them out. Instead of the tactical stealthy espionage of Solid Snake (albeit slightly present with stealth kills) You play as Raiden - yeah, the weird wimpy guy in MGS2 turned badass in MGS4. A cybernetically enhanced swordfighter. After a protection job goes...very badly to say the least, it's up to Raiden and his team to stop the enemy before ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan.\n\nAs a standard in a Metal Gear game, the story is of Kojima quality, albeit can be confusing at times if one isn't paying TOO much attention. I feel that many pure PC gamers will be very conffused as it does play reference to the older games on the console. (I'm surprised the collection wasn't ported to support this) However the use of the Codex to call your allies is a nie way of explaining some stuff to the player that may or may not have had the chance to play the earlier games.\n\nThis game is an over the top hack and slash game. And when I mean over the top, I'm not sugar coating it. If you don't think blocking a huge arm sword from a huge robot, and then throwing it into the air is not over the top, well...it is. And it gets better as you get further into the game.\nBoss fights are...well actual boss fights. Challenging and making use of the Blade mode is usually a must to gain an advantage. The old ways of learning boss patterns and attacks are present here but not really needed untill you get to the harder difficulty levels.\n\nThe game has SOME replayabiliy, but not too much of one as  compared to other sinlge player games. The story will take about 7-10 hour, mayber longer and then you got the DLC stories (which I haven't played but I can promise are excellent, diving into the head of the slick samurai Jetstream Sam and Raiden's companion Wolf) After all that you simply play to unlock all the weapons, costumes (which are plentiful minus the ones that come with the game) weapons, and difficulty level. Including Revengence difficulty which is pretty much dark souls in the case that YOU WILL DIE.\n\nOverall it's a great game that is loads of fun. I can't recommend it enough.\nAlso the soundtrack is awesome, one of the few that really goes well with the game!","January 15, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Easily the best deal ever. I have currently played through the game one and i’m planning a second play through. My first playthrough took around 8 hours. I dont know weather to proud It took me two days to beat the game or sad I played 8 hours of one game over the weekend.\n\nThe story of the game is that a was has just ended. You are a bodyguard for some rich politician. Its take place in a dystopian future where technology has become very advance. You are Raiden who is a badass cyborg with a big sword. Some other badass cyborgs attack your car and they kidnap the politician and kill him despite your best efforts. They killed him because, he was passing and act that would ban certain types of war. The war lords did not like this and they hired a hit on him. Later you figure that the people who killed him are really bad and they and are killing kids who living in third world countries and they take their brain and put them in cyborgs. You put a stop to this. I would say if you are very big on story in game the story is only ok.\n\nThe gameplay of this game is flawless. The third person hack and slash feels very natural and the parry system is easy to learn. The combos are all easy to execute. Also each level of the game has parts of combat that specific to that part of the game. When you fight the tutorial boss you jump from missile to missile then you run on top of him with your sword while slicing him to bits. Each level feels like the developers spent a long time working on its and feels awesome. The camera angles were great and the every fight felt good. This is easily the game best feature. I would say the only thing that needs work is the stealth. There was no crouch button that helped you go slow.\n\nThe graphics of the game were also amazing. My outdated build still ran this game at a high frame rate while keeping the game looking great. All the lighting and textures were crisp and the game was very immersive. This is possibly the best PC port I have ever played.\n\nYet another amazing part of this game was its sound. The kinesthetics of slicing some cyborg to bits was greatly complemented by the sound. Whenever you hit someone its sounded like it hurt. It felt real. The music of the game also greatly complemented the game. It has a kind of emo rock music that makes you feel like a bad ♥♥♥. The music worked. There was never a soundtrack that felt out of place.\n\nAll in all this game is my favorite game I have ever played. It was well done and I recommend that everyone buys it who has not already.","January 26, 2015","true","22.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Combat is focused on well timed parrying and dodging at the later levels, so it can pose quite a challenge while still giving you that feeling of being badass once you master it.\n\nThe story is, well, nothing special. Generic anime revenge story with ham fisted moral questions. Not the greatest aspect of the game, however it has some memorable quotes and lines.\n\nHowever, the spectacle is downright crazy. You literally throw a Metal Gear into the sky by its blades and slice it in half on the FIRST LEVEL. Some of the attack animations can be bonkers, and the enemy finishers, while canned, are cool to look at and entirely optional outside bosses.\n\nAnd the MUSIC. Just search on youtube 'Sams theme MGR' or 'Monsoons theme MGR'. Some genuinely cool J-Rock which suits each battle perfectly (However if you are not into that kind of music, you might not like it much). They also have a layered system for the sound in boss fights to make sure that the coolest parts of the music are well timed to the boss in question for ULTIMATE BADASSERY.\n\nWeapon variety is pretty weak. Always have to use the katana (With 3 Identical moveset varieties with different stats), and a choice of 3 secondary weapons and a few support items like RPG's and grenades. The katana is fun, but don't expect much else weaponwise.\n\nOverall, a fun game to try, and a MUST PLAY for spectacle fighter fans. If you like Darksiders, God of War or Bayonetta, you will also love this!\n\nTL;DR: Yes","April 2, 2014","true","28.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I used to be, but then Metal Gear Solid 2 came out, and I realized that the series has lost it's mind.  That's fine and all, it's great for some people who enjoy it's brand of crazy, but not for me.\n\nSo I was reluctant to play Rising, and the title didn't do much more to endear me to it.  But that said, I'm really glad I did.\n\nMetal Gear Rising: Revegetable is a spectacle fighter akin to Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, God of War (more or less), or Ninja Gaiden.  You push buttons and chop people up.\n\nWhere Rising succeeds is that it's mechanics are really good (the developer, Platinum, is top notch at these games) and the boss fights are EXTREMELY good.  You *will* need to learn and master new mechanics to win most of these fights, and that feels great.\n\nThere are two criticisms of the game that I think are worth noting.  First, the game is not as deep as other spectacle fighters, with fewer combos and abilities.  Honestly, I'm okay with this, as I'm not very good at these games, so if you're new to the genre, consider this a plus.  Secondly, it's not very long.  About 5.5 hours is all.  But that said, I played through it normally, then on the Hard Mode New Game Plus, then on Even Harder New Game Plus Plus.  Then I played the DLC.\n\nBecause the game itself is just plain fun.

I bought it launch day on the Playstation 3 and had a blast. I gave it to my brother-in-law for christmas, now I have the definitive version on PC!\n\nIt runs great for me - I run windows 8 64 bit, GEForce 630, Nvidia grapics card.\n\nIf you're looking to pick this up for the next chapter in the Metal Gear Solid franchise, you're gonna have a bad time. Yes, they left an option to sneak through mostly all of the missions for those who love the feel of running around in the classic cardboard box. However, that's not the focus of this game. You're a cyborg ninja who's taking revenge for himself and for the whole world. It's a ridiculous high-octane, high-frequency hack n' slash with wacky political overtones of world domination. In no way does this game take itsself seriously, and neither should you. Just go have fun and cut dudes up. Earn some BP. You have a Blade Mode, which slows down time so you can precise aim to cut off limbs of your foes and perform special kill moves to earn more precious BP. You have a small inventory split into three categories: Recovery/Main Weapon/Side Weapon. There are mutliple outfits to unlock with different augmentations to give you advantages in the field. Also, different types of swords to unlock which you can upgrade individually to max out it's potential. I currently am using the Gray Fox Blade with the Fox Blade+ augmentation. Let's just say I can cut through anything like butter. And I do mean anything. Did I mention you can upgrade your move set too? The more you purchase, the more unlocks for you to potentially get.\n\nThere are five game modes, three at the start I believe: Easy, Normal, Hard. Beat Hard (Possibly Normal) to unlock Very Hard Mode & Revengeance Mode. Since this game is based on hacking robots and people to bits to receive BP points, there is replay value. Once you beat the game, you can continue - meaning you restart your campaign and your previous augmentations carry over. TALK ABOUT DOMINATION.\n\nAnywho, don't listen to the nay-sayers. Any game can have potential problems with how many different rigs there are out there. I, for one, can vouch that i've experienced none yet. It's this developers first port, so even if there are any issues they will get hammered out.\n\nThe full price while I type this review is 30 dollars, and it is worth it, hands down, for the next year. I'm not so sure what singularity passed over the human race and made it so people are delusively greedy when it comes to game titles to where $10 is too much to spend on a few hours of game play. I hope they realize it costs thousands of dollars to make a video game...of any caliber.\n\nAnyways, yes, the rumors are true. It is about 5-8 hour campaign depending on how you play through your story. May I stress again, if you aren't playing to kill and upgrade, don't buy this game. The whole point is to keep replaying it until you are maxed out, playing on revengeance difficulty and declaring you are a god. This version of the game on PC comes with every single DLC to ever be included in the game. And I mean pre-ordered content from Amazon/Best Buy/Gamestop and God knows where else. Yes, it is worth it. Here's to hoping one day we can pay 29.99, not say ♥♥♥♥ except HOLY HELL THAT WAS AMAZING, and go buy another fully priced title. Enjoy, my friends.","January 13, 2014","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Easily the best deal ever. I have currently played through the game one and i’m planning a second play through. My first playthrough took around 8 hours. I dont know weather to proud It took me two days to beat the game or sad I played 8 hours of one game over the weekend.\n\nThe story of the game is that a was has just ended. You are a bodyguard for some rich politician. Its take place in a dystopian future where technology has become very advance. You are Raiden who is a badass cyborg with a big sword. Some other badass cyborgs attack your car and they kidnap the politician and kill him despite your best efforts. They killed him because, he was passing and act that would ban certain types of war. The war lords did not like this and they hired a hit on him. Later you figure that the people who killed him are really bad and they and are killing kids who living in third world countries and they take their brain and put them in cyborgs. You put a stop to this. I would say if you are very big on story in game the story is only ok.\n\nThe gameplay of this game is flawless. The third person hack and slash feels very natural and the parry system is easy to learn. The combos are all easy to execute. Also each level of the game has parts of combat that specific to that part of the game. When you fight the tutorial boss you jump from missile to missile then you run on top of him with your sword while slicing him to bits. Each level feels like the developers spent a long time working on its and feels awesome. The camera angles were great and the every fight felt good. This is easily the game best feature. I would say the only thing that needs work is the stealth. There was no crouch button that helped you go slow.\n\nThe graphics of the game were also amazing. My outdated build still ran this game at a high frame rate while keeping the game looking great. All the lighting and textures were crisp and the game was very immersive. This is possibly the best PC port I have ever played.\n\nYet another amazing part of this game was its sound. The kinesthetics of slicing some cyborg to bits was greatly complemented by the sound. Whenever you hit someone its sounded like it hurt. It felt real. The music of the game also greatly complemented the game. It has a kind of emo rock music that makes you feel like a bad ♥♥♥. The music worked. There was never a soundtrack that felt out of place.\n\nAll in all this game is my favorite game I have ever played. It was well done and I recommend that everyone buys it who has not already.","January 26, 2015","true","22.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Combat is focused on well timed parrying and dodging at the later levels, so it can pose quite a challenge while still giving you that feeling of being badass once you master it.\n\nThe story is, well, nothing special. Generic anime revenge story with ham fisted moral questions. Not the greatest aspect of the game, however it has some memorable quotes and lines.\n\nHowever, the spectacle is downright crazy. You literally throw a Metal Gear into the sky by its blades and slice it in half on the FIRST LEVEL. Some of the attack animations can be bonkers, and the enemy finishers, while canned, are cool to look at and entirely optional outside bosses.\n\nAnd the MUSIC. Just search on youtube 'Sams theme MGR' or 'Monsoons theme MGR'. Some genuinely cool J-Rock which suits each battle perfectly (However if you are not into that kind of music, you might not like it much). They also have a layered system for the sound in boss fights to make sure that the coolest parts of the music are well timed to the boss in question for ULTIMATE BADASSERY.\n\nWeapon variety is pretty weak. Always have to use the katana (With 3 Identical moveset varieties with different stats), and a choice of 3 secondary weapons and a few support items like RPG's and grenades. The katana is fun, but don't expect much else weaponwise.\n\nOverall, a fun game to try, and a MUST PLAY for spectacle fighter fans. If you like Darksiders, God of War or Bayonetta, you will also love this!\n\nTL;DR: Yes","April 2, 2014","true","28.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I used to be, but then Metal Gear Solid 2 came out, and I realized that the series has lost it's mind.  That's fine and all, it's great for some people who enjoy it's brand of crazy, but not for me.\n\nSo I was reluctant to play Rising, and the title didn't do much more to endear me to it.  But that said, I'm really glad I did.\n\nMetal Gear Rising: Revegetable is a spectacle fighter akin to Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, God of War (more or less), or Ninja Gaiden.  You push buttons and chop people up.\n\nWhere Rising succeeds is that it's mechanics are really good (the developer, Platinum, is top notch at these games) and the boss fights are EXTREMELY good.  You *will* need to learn and master new mechanics to win most of these fights, and that feels great.\n\nThere are two criticisms of the game that I think are worth noting.  First, the game is not as deep as other spectacle fighters, with fewer combos and abilities.  Honestly, I'm okay with this, as I'm not very good at these games, so if you're new to the genre, consider this a plus.  Secondly, it's not very long.  About 5.5 hours is all.  But that said, I played through it normally, then on the Hard Mode New Game Plus, then on Even Harder New Game Plus Plus.  Then I played the DLC.\n\nBecause the game itself is just plain fun.  And that, for me, is the important thing that makes me recommend it.\n\nTL;DR - If you are new to spectacle fighters and this is on sale, pick it up.  Looking for a deeper game?

Platnium has never done a PC game before, let alone a port - and that is somewhat evident in this port. However if this is the quality of ports we are going to have in 2014? It's looking to be a good year.\n\nMy first small gripe is the texture quality. It's somewhat evident that the game is using low-res textures even on the highest of settings. It's a small gripe, because believe me, the only time you'll notice this is during the cutscenes when you're not actually doing anything and paying attentiont to...what this game has for a story.\n\nSecondary are the options, the resoltuion will auto apply every time you select one. A small gripe but I know some users that have experienced black screens from selecting too high of a reoslution (for some reason) so take it slow when doing this :).\n\nControl wise I have no complaints. It's fairly well done with each key being rebindable. However the blade mode is somewhat...broken using a mouse. Precision cuts are fairly difficult to do and you're not simply offered the same precision as using an analog stick. For that reason alone I would highly recommend a controller for MGR:R HOWEVER - given time I think it can be manageable.\n\nMetal Gear RISING (please note the RISING part of the title) is a spin off game developed by Platnium with Kojima helping them out. Instead of the tactical stealthy espionage of Solid Snake (albeit slightly present with stealth kills) You play as Raiden - yeah, the weird wimpy guy in MGS2 turned badass in MGS4. A cybernetically enhanced swordfighter. After a protection job goes...very badly to say the least, it's up to Raiden and his team to stop the enemy before ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan.\n\nAs a standard in a Metal Gear game, the story is of Kojima quality, albeit can be confusing at times if one isn't paying TOO much attention. I feel that many pure PC gamers will be very conffused as it does play reference to the older games on the console. (I'm surprised the collection wasn't ported to support this) However the use of the Codex to call your allies is a nie way of explaining some stuff to the player that may or may not have had the chance to play the earlier games.\n\nThis game is an over the top hack and slash game. And when I mean over the top, I'm not sugar coating it. If you don't think blocking a huge arm sword from a huge robot, and then throwing it into the air is not over the top, well...it is. And it gets better as you get further into the game.\nBoss fights are...well actual boss fights. Challenging and making use of the Blade mode is usually a must to gain an advantage. The old ways of learning boss patterns and attacks are present here but not really needed untill you get to the harder difficulty levels.\n\nThe game has SOME replayabiliy, but not too much of one as  compared to other sinlge player games. The story will take about 7-10 hour, mayber longer and then you got the DLC stories (which I haven't played but I can promise are excellent, diving into the head of the slick samurai Jetstream Sam and Raiden's companion Wolf) After all that you simply play to unlock all the weapons, costumes (which are plentiful minus the ones that come with the game) weapons, and difficulty level. Including Revengence difficulty which is pretty much dark souls in the case that YOU WILL DIE.\n\nOverall it's a great game that is loads of fun. I can't recommend it enough.\nAlso the soundtrack is awesome, one of the few that really goes well with the game!","January 15, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Raiden, is eventhough he is not exactly a hero, or maybe especially for that reason, a great Protagonist. Plenty of cutscenes with lots of action and some bits of humor make the story in this game far more visible than just some voice telling you about why exactly you are killing whom you are killing.\n\nLets get over to gameplay. For my standards, the graphics are more than solid and it felt pretty fluent, even on my not exactly top notch computer. The gameplay is quick, visceral and with a special focus on the blade. Your main weapon feels powerful and versatile, and lethal. All the combos you can perform with it by lining up light and hard attacks are, for information, listed in the help menu. Stealth also exists, but i found myself making little use of it since it seemed more appealing to go for the fight. Other weapons apart from the blade, such as grenades and rocket launchers are available but (at least to me) using them felt far less intuitive than going into melee. The levels follow a format of moving forward disposing or avoiding enemies and going through various action sequences until fighting a final boss, a simple layout which I did personally not mind all too much since the main aspect of this game lies in the combat itself which is just incredible satisfying. Who does not enjoy slicing cyborgs apart to then rip enhancements out of their bodies and using launched missiles as stepping stones in order to slice helicopters apart in a single blow? Raiden feels incredibly swift and powerful but not overpowered and the boss fights are quite challenging.\nMetal Gear Rising also has an amazing soundtrack of futristic/rock/metal tracks, that just make the boss battles even more epic.\n\nThere are 2 concerns however which resulted in a bit (who am I kidding, a lot) of frust. Camera and controls. The camera is automated and sometimes this means that it ♥♥♥♥s you over. There were times where i found myself seeing borderline nothing due to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera angle. And when playing, you will notice that the controls are catered to a controller, so if you own one,  I would recommend using that instead. As an example you may sometimes find yourself stunned and to rid yourself of it, the game gives you instructions to press ctrl wasd. After a while I figured out that this would mean to keep Ctrl pressed while pressing wasd in that order and then to repeat. Which is stupid, try for yourself.One of the combat functions the so called Blade mode also did from time to time feel lackluster to me. In this time freezing mode you are allowed to freely slice yourself through your opponents while looking for weakened spots to attack which are marked on the screen.  In some fights you will have to cut a straight line through an object  but to line up year weapon in precisely such a manner may often times prove very time intensive which is especially annyoing because the Blade Mode can only be activared for a certain amount of time.\n\nAnd admittedly, I died in this game. A lot. And got a lot of bad combat scores which I felt ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for. Those were the moments in which i was in dire need of a cat. But Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was the kind of game in which I would just keep on playing anyway because I loved it.\n\nFor 5€ it is essentially a steal. As long as it is on sale I would 100% recommend purchase. Otherwise the pointed out flaws result in me giving it an 8/10 with room upwards.","December 24, 2014","true","27.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game rocks.  As someone who used to be a huge Metal Gear Solid fan and was bored to tears over MGS4 this is a huge breath of fresh air.  It only took me like 6 hours to play through this but its the funnest 6 hours I've had in quite a while.  I was hesitant to try this game out because ♥♥♥♥ing Raiden... Guy nearly ruined MGS2 and got way too much screen time in 4 for my liking.... Then I finally got this on the holiday sale and I'm so glad I did.\n\nThis is a game that is all about just being entertaining just for the sake of it.  They stopped trying to be serious at all and just went for as much cheese as they could put into it.  This is like if Expendables was a parody.  Not one moment of this is meant to be taken seriously.  From the cheesy voice acting to the over the top plot that just pokes fun at itself at every turn.\n\nThen there's the gameplay.  Some of the tightest controls and combat I've ever experienced in an action game ever.  Platinum is known for this kind of tight gameplay but this my first from them I've ever touched so now I know exactly what fans are talking about.

Raiden, is eventhough he is not exactly a hero, or maybe especially for that reason, a great Protagonist. Plenty of cutscenes with lots of action and some bits of humor make the story in this game far more visible than just some voice telling you about why exactly you are killing whom you are killing.\n\nLets get over to gameplay. For my standards, the graphics are more than solid and it felt pretty fluent, even on my not exactly top notch computer. The gameplay is quick, visceral and with a special focus on the blade. Your main weapon feels powerful and versatile, and lethal. All the combos you can perform with it by lining up light and hard attacks are, for information, listed in the help menu. Stealth also exists, but i found myself making little use of it since it seemed more appealing to go for the fight. Other weapons apart from the blade, such as grenades and rocket launchers are available but (at least to me) using them felt far less intuitive than going into melee. The levels follow a format of moving forward disposing or avoiding enemies and going through various action sequences until fighting a final boss, a simple layout which I did personally not mind all too much since the main aspect of this game lies in the combat itself which is just incredible satisfying. Who does not enjoy slicing cyborgs apart to then rip enhancements out of their bodies and using launched missiles as stepping stones in order to slice helicopters apart in a single blow? Raiden feels incredibly swift and powerful but not overpowered and the boss fights are quite challenging.\nMetal Gear Rising also has an amazing soundtrack of futristic/rock/metal tracks, that just make the boss battles even more epic.\n\nThere are 2 concerns however which resulted in a bit (who am I kidding, a lot) of frust. Camera and controls. The camera is automated and sometimes this means that it ♥♥♥♥s you over. There were times where i found myself seeing borderline nothing due to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera angle. And when playing, you will notice that the controls are catered to a controller, so if you own one,  I would recommend using that instead. As an example you may sometimes find yourself stunned and to rid yourself of it, the game gives you instructions to press ctrl wasd. After a while I figured out that this would mean to keep Ctrl pressed while pressing wasd in that order and then to repeat. Which is stupid, try for yourself.One of the combat functions the so called Blade mode also did from time to time feel lackluster to me. In this time freezing mode you are allowed to freely slice yourself through your opponents while looking for weakened spots to attack which are marked on the screen.  In some fights you will have to cut a straight line through an object  but to line up year weapon in precisely such a manner may often times prove very time intensive which is especially annyoing because the Blade Mode can only be activared for a certain amount of time.\n\nAnd admittedly, I died in this game. A lot. And got a lot of bad combat scores which I felt ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for. Those were the moments in which i was in dire need of a cat. But Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was the kind of game in which I would just keep on playing anyway because I loved it.\n\nFor 5€ it is essentially a steal. As long as it is on sale I would 100% recommend purchase. Otherwise the pointed out flaws result in me giving it an 8/10 with room upwards.","December 24, 2014","true","27.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game rocks.  As someone who used to be a huge Metal Gear Solid fan and was bored to tears over MGS4 this is a huge breath of fresh air.  It only took me like 6 hours to play through this but its the funnest 6 hours I've had in quite a while.  I was hesitant to try this game out because ♥♥♥♥ing Raiden... Guy nearly ruined MGS2 and got way too much screen time in 4 for my liking.... Then I finally got this on the holiday sale and I'm so glad I did.\n\nThis is a game that is all about just being entertaining just for the sake of it.  They stopped trying to be serious at all and just went for as much cheese as they could put into it.  This is like if Expendables was a parody.  Not one moment of this is meant to be taken seriously.  From the cheesy voice acting to the over the top plot that just pokes fun at itself at every turn.\n\nThen there's the gameplay.  Some of the tightest controls and combat I've ever experienced in an action game ever.  Platinum is known for this kind of tight gameplay but this my first from them I've ever touched so now I know exactly what fans are talking about.  The boss battles are some of the best things in any game ever and I can see some replay value in trying to better my score and trying the different secondary weapons.","December 26, 2014","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics also pretty good with 60 fps and maps with multiple ways to approach and face your enemies stealth (with stealth kills) or face to face combat. The bosses are actually pretty imaginative and some of them  prove to be a real challenge. Maybe against a few enemies you might feel overpowered but when that number rises (or a more powerful enemy comes by) you start to feel overwhelmed.\nAnd of course classic metal gear long ♥♥♥ videos about stuff maybe a bit too overcomplicated.

The story and writing is so ridiculous that it's AMAZING, the gameplay is fast, fluid, smooth and responsive, the swords cut EVERYTHING, the bosses are so much fun to fight, it's always satisfying to cut your foes into itty bitty pieces, and you play as a cyborg ninja with all the stupid quotable dialogue ("NANOMACHINES, SON." "DON'T ♥♥♥♥ WITH THIS SENATOR") that you've come to expect from the Metal Gear series, and you play as a CYBORG NINJA.\n\n♥♥♥♥ yes, you should buy this game. In fact, you should buy it yesterday.","January 13, 2014","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only ♥♥♥♥-poor stealth mechanic it has is sneaking up behind enemies to get a cheap kill. But i've only played one other metal gear game besides this, so i'm not too biased.\nInstead, i'm going to talk about parry mechanics.\nParry mechanics can be a good thing, in Wind Waker the parry is satisfying and it leaves an enemy vulnerable to attack.\nIn Dust, a parry has weight to it, you get some flashy effects and the enemy is stunned, it feels awesome!\nIn this game, you just mash WASD and left click to parry  Especially during the Monsoon battle  and it dosen't have the same feel to it, you just hear a CLANG and the enemy continues attacking, BUT WAIT! if all the stars are in order and the planets align, you can STUN an enemy with a parry. Cool right?\nAfter some practice, you can parry efficiently and the game kind of forces you to.\n\nI'm going to stop ranting about the parry mechanics and talk about the music.\nAHEM\nThe music is awesome.\nSeriously. It's the best part of the game. The music. Is ♥♥♥♥ing. Awesome.\n\nNext: Bosses.\nThe bosses are the best part of the game, next to the music. Each one has their own weakness to SOMETHING and it shouldn't be hard to figure out.\nBut holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, when you get to phase 2 of the boss fight, ♥♥♥♥ GETS REAL.\n\nWhy are you still gawking at this review? i have nothing more to say about the game, go buy it. now.","July 4, 2014","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now you may say games like DmC and other hack n slash games exist on the PC, but this game is entirely different, it just feels so awesome and fills your body with adrenaline unlike any other game. And this game has blade mode which I think should be a part of every hack n slash game ever to made from now on because it just is that f**king good. And aside from all that, you play as a cyborg, half human, half machine how is that not ♥♥♥♥ing awesome??? LOVE THIS GAME 10/10","September 25, 2014","true","35.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game itself is very enjoyable overall. The main characters and the bosses have great personalities and they possess unique abilities, finding out what they do and how to counter it is the best part and makes you feel accomplished once done. The final boss fight can be a little overwhelming but after many tries, you'll be sure to beat it.","May 28, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
