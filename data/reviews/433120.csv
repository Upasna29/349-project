This is honestly the first time I have ever requested a refund on anything.  I sincerely hope the developer works to patch this game and make some much-needed improvements.  My original review follows:\n\nWhen I read in the description that this game "follows in the footsteps of...Alien Breed or Shadowsgrounds," I was super-psyched.  The two Shadowgrounds games and three Alien Breed games are my favorite top-down shooters of all time.  However, my excitement quickly gave way to disappointment and, after about 70 minutes of play time, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.  There's a lot of potential here but the game feels like an unfinished late-alpha or early-beta release.\n\nThe setting is good (if unoriginal) and the beginning of the story is somewhat intriguing (if uninspired) though I don't think I played long enough to evaluate how any of that pans out.  Even so, it's hard to care much because of the horrendous voice acting.  The ship's AI seems to have more emotion than your character does - you seriously sound indifferent that the ship has crashed and the rest of the crew is likely dead.\n\nThe controls are clunky from the get go and movement is terribly slow.  There does not seem to be a way to run - the control for "dash" causes you to roll forward, like an evasive maneuver.  There is very little to interact with in the environment - what you can interact with will be glowing, including pickups, computers, door controls, etc.  Not sure what to think about weapons.  You start with just a pistol but you find weapons components along the way, yet there's no indication what they do, if anything.  I did not play enough to find and try any other weapons.  There's no inventory management at all - the few items you can have are displayed in the HUD.\n\nAnother criticism is the save system - you have one save slot, regardless of which difficulty level you play.  There's simply no excuse for that in a modern game.  I should also mention that, in just over an hour, the game froze twice, forcing me to kill it and restart.  I could go on and on about everything that's wrong with this game and how disappointed I am but I think I'll cut it short.  In conclusion, this game has a ton of problems.  It's a combination of being unfinished and bad design decisions.  The game most definitely needs some severe patching but even that won't fix some of its issues.  And it will certainly never rank up there with Shadowgrounds or Alien Breed.  NOT RECOMMENDED.","February 10","false","1.2"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

I like the crafting, enemies, weapons, story, and the options menu is good. The game still has room for improvement though. I can never get a break from enemies, and always have to be conscious of them spawning behind me. I can't even stop to read one of the text pickups, and they keep coming when I am trying to craft a weapon. I also noticed my frames kept gradually dropping from 60 until I was at only a couple fps, then the game crashed. One tip I found is that the best experience is probably to play on easy difficulty, because at normal or hard there is so many enemies everywhere and they take so many bullets to kill that you will be reloading every 5 seconds and you'll die pretty quickly. Overall, the game is fun and good but could be fleshed out a little more.","February 6","true","1.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","10","21","2","0"

Can tell the developer put a lot of time into it. Great art style.\n\nFew small things I would recommend changing:\n- The protagonist voice acting is pretty dull. Would recommend looking at that.\n- Auto-reload of weapons. I think it would make sense to do what other games do: reload weapons automatically.\n- Doors opening automatically when player is in proximity. I sometimes have to bump into doors to open them.\n- I didn't like the bugs showing up behind me in rooms I had already cleared.\n\nBut overall, I like the artstyle and there are some slick elements to the game; especially for an indie. Would recommend checking out.","March 6","true","2.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

It might sound weird, but pressing left shift and not going for a sprint is, at least to me, highly unsual and quite disturbing in term of gameplay.  The absence of any kind of map which is replaced by a light spot moving around to show you where to go also points to the developper taking shortcut to go on a quick release.\n- The absence of a game logo in your library (you can see the Unreal Engine instead) as well as the voice over in the game also reveal that the game was probably done on the cheap.  There is nothing wrong with that, but with the quite visually appealing graphics, there is a big clash between what you see and how the overall game really feels making not one that you will be willing to spend hours on.\n- Additionaly the game misses a tutorial.  I generally don't like tutorials but since some of the controls here are unusual, a tutorial will be quite handy (possibly using the first sort of useless level to indicate what keys do what...).\n- Dying at your first monster encounter (I don't think I spoiled anything here) because you are in a dark area and nothing told you to press F for the flashlight brings too much frustration on my side to keep playing.\n\nIn short, Crash Landing could have been a good game without necessarily bringing anything new to the genre but some bad development decisions make it an average game.  Will I give it a try again? Probably yes... But I am quite sure at the moment, I will probably never attempt to finish this game unless the developer does major upgrade...Simply because I got better ones in my Steam collection.\n","May 27","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
