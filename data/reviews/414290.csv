The game has different classes that you can go through the dungeon as, and artifacts that can sharpely change the game fast. I was just reviewing this game when the developer randomly posted an update titled "FULL RELEASE!" This update changed almost nothing, and gives me mixed feelings on the game as it stands. So keeping that in mind, lets go through the gameplay.\n\nGameplay\nYou start your dungeon run by selecting one of 7 classes. Each class has a unique playstyle, with certain skills the others lack (speed, strength, crits) are quite balanced, and lead to strong replayability. Any character you choose will start you off with 3 bombs and 3 keys, with bombs you can blow up walls, and with keys you can open any locks on any doors or chests. After you spawn in you'll be running room to room, slaying monsters, blowing up crumbling walls, hoping for green chests, entering shops, picking up items, unlocking doors, solving jump puzzles, defeating bosses, making dark deals, upgrading your weapon and hopefully having lots of fun :)\n\nPros:\n+Unique class system\n+Randomly generated levels\n+Unique artifacts that alter gameplay\n+The game tests your reaction and patience\n+Great soundtrack\n+Steam cards and achievements\n\nCons:\n-In need of more enemies and artifacts\n-Bosses need to be balanced\n-Rng plays too heavy of a role in succeeding\n\nOverall...I highly recommend to any player that enjoys rogue-lite games. The game is all about how you react, you can go hacking n' slashing through rooms, but you could fall in acid, be too timid and you could get hit with a fireball, the result of someones run is a reflection of balancing strategies and having the scale tip in thier favor. The different classes and game changing artifacts strongly give the ability to play the game more and more, and even though the game cut out most of the story elements, and it would be nice to have more enemies, the game accomplishes a fun 10+ hours of mastering each class, and the weakness and strengths to items and powerups in the game. Despite having a number of flaws, I continue to come back to the game and is now one of my favorite games in my library, and I dont say that lightly. The game could have been the platformer successor of Binding of Isacc, it could have been the next new, great, rogue-like game out there, development has ceased, but trust me, NO ONE will be happier than me, if this project is picked back up again.\n\nRecommended 7.5/10\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","April 19","true","25.8"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

It's an easy platform with nothing new, you could enjoy a run, just out of curiosity, then you could do another one hoping that it will surprise you some way, but it doesn't happen and there's no reason to keep playing.\nThis has a pure roguelike style, there's no kind of progress, when you die you are done, you unlock nothing, you don't achieve anything, and this totally kills every interests.\n\nI won't say the game is bad, it just has no reason to exist. It's nothing better than a lot of other games of the same genre. There's nothing new, and there's no effort, no character in its concepts.\n\nConclusions:If you think you could like this game, just buy Rogue Legacy, it's way better. If you already played Rogue Legacy, then look for something else. There's no much content in the game, and that's ok, considereing the price, but even if this game was free there's no quality, no reason to spend your time here, buy something else, or even if you can't afford something else, I'm sure you'll easily find a better way to spend your time.","April 17","false","0.9"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","31","46","4","4"

I would get this game on sale than $5 though, despite how long you may be playing it.\n\nThe screenshots reminded me a lot of Rogue Legacy, but more pixelated. Apparently I was wrong on that... so much.\n\nI see this more as arcade style than Rogue-Like though. Difficult with randomized level layouts, but doesn't seem that all punishing as other Rogue-Likes are when you die.\n\nThe controls feel... very awkward and difficult getting used to. Be great to rebind them. Pretty much the only issue I have.\n\nThere's no bugs or glitches, doesn't crash, story is purposely generic with a reason.

The combat leaves a lot to be desired, it's just simply too easy.  Nothing poses a challenge to a player who knows NES-era dodge tactics (...move left and right).  Even the last boss is so incredibly easy that I sat there expecting a "this isn't even my final form" type of encounter.\n\nBut, I still recommend the game because it does have some replay value and for $5, that can't be beat.  If you're decent at games, expect about 2 hours to beat it the first time with less than 1 hr required for subsequent completions.  The achievements add some incentive to keep playing for a few run throughs, but you'll be burnt out if you try to complete it consecutively with each class in an effort to 100% the game.\n\nIf expanded upon with some content that adds more depth via levels, monsters, and bosses could really shine.","April 16","true","5.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwolf29/recommended/414290/","redwolf29","RedWolf_29","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwolf29/","145 products in account","DISCLAIMER: I recieved this game as a gift from a friend. It doesn't affect my opinion in any way, I just thought I'd mention it.\n\n\nWhat's it about?\nPrincess.Loot.Pixel.Again is a rouge-lite action game with a procedurally generated dungeon. It follows the tradition of games such as The Binding of Isaac and most prominantly Rogue Legacy by allowing the player to collect and purchase upgrades throughout the adventure in order to make their character stronger.\n\n\nHow does it play?\nTo the game's credit, the controls are tight and responsive, and the characters move with a satisfying sense of speed and agility. It is also very well optimised and could easily run on a microwave. Unfortunately, that is where the good points end.\n\nThis game suffers from a desperate lack of balance. On some runs I got all the upgrades (figuratively), and on others I got nothing (almost literally). No matter how many defense upgrades I collected, enemies did the same amount of damage to me. Most baffling of all, there are several large rooms and sprawling corridors throughout the stages with nothing in them at all. No traps, no enemies, nothing. There is also no permanence to speak of, which makes attampted runs feel pointless in the end.\n\nWhile a lot of rouge-lite games are deliberately vague with their item descriptions to encourage experimentaion and discovery, Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again has descriptions that make no sense and tell you nothing about what certain items or powers do. There is not even a glossary that explains the properties of these elements. As a result, I still don't know what the Paladin's special move does. Is it a shield? A retaliation attack? I couldn't tell you, because the game sure as hell doesn't.\n\nSpeaking of which, Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again has a selection of classes that runs the gamut of standard fantasy archetypes, with classics such as the warrior, the rogue and the wizard all accounted for. However, out of all the classes, only the archer is really worth playing, with the wizard coming a tentative second. This is because the reach on melee weapons in this game is so small that it is extremely difficult not to take damage, especially against bosses or enemies that have ranged attacks. The archer is overpowered in this case because he can shoot enemies on the other side of the screen, he has a stupidly high critical hit ratio and his poison arrow special does too much damage for a starting ability. The fact that many of the new abilities found throughout the game are weaker than his poison arrows smacks of the lack of balance mentioned earlier.\n\nOn that note, the second boss in this game is totally unfair. The way in which it attacks means that it is extremely difficult to not take damage, at least as far as I could tell. You might say "but it's a rouge-lite, it's supposed to be hard", but just remember; The Binding of Isaac had a sense of balance with its boss encounters.\n\n\nHow does it look?\nPrincess.Loot.Pixel.Again has a very bland and utilitarian pixel art style that is devoid of life and vibrancy. I can respect creators wanting to pay homage to the 8-bit and 16-bit eras of gaming but, to paraphrase the lovely Totalbiscuit, developers of that era were dealing with a lack of technology, not a lack of talent, when it came to videogame graphics. There are some nice lighting and mist effects present in this game, however; I can appreciate that.\n\n\nHow does it sound?\nThe soundtrack of this game ranges from listenable to downright obnoxious. I enjoyed a couple of the tracks on offer, but others (one of which appears to be ripped off from Rogue Legacy) were like having hot screwdrivers driven into my ears, even with the volume turned down.\n\nOn another note, dubstep in a fantasy game?\n\nReally?\n\n\nLong story short...\nSorry, but Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again is not very good, which is a shame. A lot of love and effort has clearly gone into making this game, but in a world where genre-defining experiences like The Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy and FTL: Faster Than Light exist, new rogue-lites must do something different in order to stand out, or at least be extremely good at what they do. As it stands, Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again brings nothing new or interesting to the table. It feels like it is still in Early Access, which is an issue for any new game, not just this one.\n\nOverall, Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again is a hollow shell of a rogue-lite that is best given a miss, especially when there are so many better, more fulfilling titles on the market.\n\nAnd another thing, referencing things that exist is not humour. You are not Family Guy, which isn't funny anyway.","May 6","false","1.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

This game is perfect if you have a child with around 3-4 years of age because this will mostly challenge him and not frustrate him as much. So far the gameplay is pretty simple, along with a nice catchy chiptune background music. But if you're looking for a challenge or neat mechanics or ANYTHING fresh and new, there are none... there's nothing much to offer except a great price for this game, which reminds me of the golden era of MS-DOS and NES gaming, mostly MS-DOS.\n\nFor the devs: Considering this is early acces, the game is quite simple so far, somewhat entertaining but extremely easy... if that's your dev team goal, keep it that way, if not... you need to increase the difficulty past floor 1, because... seriously... you don't give much of a challenge, everything seems TOO fair on the player.\n\nThe game needs more sound effects, I know it's early access but... a sword swing sound, a jump sound and a body land sound wouldn't hurt you know? Also the animations are too stiff and rusty, retro things are memorable and nostalgic but... try to remember why we got past that era... like, add ladder climb animations, a jump animation and most importantly a hit knockback animation, to feel like you're getting beaten. You got a decent project in your hands, try to polish it the most, but as it is in its current state I can't recommend it, but I won't refund it because I got it on sale and I'd like to have a kid someday and probably show him this game to get him started on gaming. If my child enjoys something like this out of ignorance, when the good stuff comes, IT'LL LOOK BETTER! Like he plays this then he meets Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past UMFFF...

That is the main reason I'm submitting this review. This is my opionion, yours may differ and that's fine. I'm not trying to pick a fight here but I honestly believe that even for the asking price this game does not yet offer a good enough value proposition to warrant a purchase.\n\nI bought this is part of a bundle for under $2. I love indie games of this genre (e.g. Rogue legacy) but I still don't want to play this since there are free games that are better. I believe this should not yet be on early access since it's too unpolished and does not offer anything novel to set it apart (it's painfully generic). The animations are close to static for sprite character movement (shifting a few pixels when walking an "floating" up ladders). I am also not given a reason to care for the game or the unnamed characters in it and I have no idea what is actually happening in the story. At least there could be some dialog or a "note from the developer" at the beginning that lays out the direction of the game and its goals.\n\nIn light of this, consider the write up for the game by the developer:\n"The story is about an enamoured Young Man who dared to go and ask the King for his Daughter's hand in marriage . But he is just a roturier and an Executioner is commanded to behead the young man. That very moment, a Evil Mage bursts into the castle and kidnaps the King. Our fearless hero rushes to the beast's lair to outfiht[sic] it and prove that he is worthy of blessing. There are several game's endings which depend on quantity of attempts and chosen routes (there is some branching in the structure of the castle so a gamer should to make a choice)."\n\nWhy is that not in the game?\n\nIf the animations are improved and some sort of dialog is added to the story section (or at least a a more elaborate set piece) that would already help immensely. To the developers: Please get a domain name so your support email isn't @gmail.com it evokes the feeling that you either A) Don't care enough about the game to register a domain or B) Don't have the money to maintain a basic hosting (which is very worrisome and does not bode well for the game).\n\nThe different characters play differently and does give some variety but ultimately this game still needs an incredible amount of work (even for a greenlight project). I'll be happy to see this game reach it's potential. In a sea of incredible indie game, ambitious greenlight projects and deep digital special this one just does not measure up.","December 4, 2015","false","0.8"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

The game lacks a story. Because the story is, you walk up to the Queen or princess(They didn't specify) & the King gets captured from behind by some demon. Your goal is to climb your way up the floors and survive to save the king. The game has 6 Hero's you can play. Necromancer, Paladin, Mage, Rogue, Archer, and a Knight. Each hero has their own different abilities. Some classes are just plain out terrible. For example, As in the video, when i was playing the Rogue, he took a lot of damage and was fast. But he lacked defence to the point where, if I would have got hit 1 time from the enemy. I would take a tremendous amount of health. Also his range sucked so bad that you had to hug the enemies ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to hit the darn thing. Necromance just sucks in general. Knight/archer are by far my favorite. Knights has high defence so you can survive longer and archer has range where you dont have to be near the enemy. Another problem about the game in my opinion is the traps. Once you step on a trap, you have a split second to react. Like Jesus ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, atleast give us 2 seconds, lol If you are interested in the game. here is a link to my video. The video contains all the hero's. Thank you for your time.

The roguelike elements are consistent, and everything makes sense in context.\n\nThis game strikes me about halfway between Metroid and The Binding of Issac, with a touch of Mega Man. The only downside compared to those games is that you can only attack to left and right, and even those characters with ranged attacks can't aim above or below.\n\nI would like to see a female character/class, but that's a me thing, and the Dev should absolutely not add one just because I've requested it. If you're going to do it anyway, then by all means carry on.\n\nOverall, Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again feels like a game that the dev wants to play, and just happened to decide to share with the rest of us.

All the current problems can be justified by the fact that the game is still in development.\n\n\nPROS:\n\nThe controls are very responsive, which is essential to have fun on a game like this. The difficulty level can be challenging for a casual player, took me a few attempts to finish the game. I wouldn't call this game hard, but it will kill you quite a few times until you learn the patterns and traps.\n\nThe game flows nicely and you can jump right back to action after each death. Even though this is early access, it's very polished and I found no bugs or crashes.\n\nThe current trailer reflects very well the gameplay.\n\n\nCONS:\n\nRight now the main thing lacking is content, but that is expected since it's a game on early access.\n\nWe only have 4 bosses and 8 stages, that can get boring after some hours. Some items appear to have no function or no clear explanation (sadly, many roguelikes follow this "trend"). Steam achievements are still not implemented. The story is incomplete, there is no ending and no reward for finishing the game, I would like to see some element of progression, like new perks or characters.\n\nYou can find some spelling errors here and there and the game could use more balancing. Some items are too powerful, the guitar can kill the last boss in 3 hits. Again, remember this game is IN DEVELOPMENT, so all those issues could be fixed soon.","December 9, 2015","true","6.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

An easy recommendation for anyone who likes rogue-like platformers. Don't let the early access status put you off, the experience is already smooth and bug-free.\nFor those who factor trading cards into their purchasing decision, be advised that as of January 19th, 2016, they have not actually been implemented, and there's been no response on the forum as to whether this is a mistake, something that's still being worked on, or if there will never be cards.

Its like rogue legacy but a bit different and this has a bit bigger story than just going into a castle and killing stuff. I had a lot of fun playing this game but there are a few things that were missing. Like sounds , there were plenty sounds missing (Loot pickup , footsteps , weapon slashing and some others that I dont remember). The next complaint that I have is the difficulty. The normal enemies are pretty easy , even in the last levels. And the bosses are a bit of a poor show , the Eye twins just float around (pretty easy) , the Cobra didn't even attack me , it was just moving around , and Gideon for a last boss was still pretty easy , just a few blocks with a shield and hits with a sword. But it might not be so easy with other characters. But still the bosses can be better! And the game can have more areas , towers , whatever , just more of the game. I finished it in an hour , and I wanted to keep on plaing , but there wasn't anything more to it. Just doing the same stuff with different characters. So yeah , more areas. I hope all this will be added later. But I still think that this is a good game , it has lots of potencial. Also the music is awesome. Almost like Crypt of the Necrodancer. Almost. All in all a good pixel game. I would give it a 7/10   (And one last thing , THE GUITAR IS THE BEST THING EVER! , nice one developers :)  )","March 31","true","3.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

If you're looking for a bigger challenge and longer game, go there.  This is a lot of fun, and was surprisingly short...  I sat down to play just this morning and made it through without trouble in under an hour as a Warrior.  So of you want that little sense of accomplishment from "beating a game" and having a little fun, this does it.  The bosses are fairly easy when you notice their patterns, and the game has a total of 8 stages.  Each "level" has 2 parts to it, and the second has the boss fight.\nI don't know why "Princess" is in the title presently, as I rescued the King, but...hey.  It's a game, and I would say, "Try this out, buddy."  Maybe not pay about $5 for it, but it Does have a lot of replay value still.\nPS: The game music is a blast!","April 18","true","10.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

I figured there would be more coming, but at this point I feel the game was released a little early, and could have used some more polish.

The roguelike elements are consistent, and everything makes sense in context.\n\nThis game strikes me about halfway between Metroid and The Binding of Issac, with a touch of Mega Man. The only downside compared to those games is that you can only attack to left and right, and even those characters with ranged attacks can't aim above or below.\n\nI would like to see a female character/class, but that's a me thing, and the Dev should absolutely not add one just because I've requested it. If you're going to do it anyway, then by all means carry on.\n\nOverall, Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again feels like a game that the dev wants to play, and just happened to decide to share with the rest of us. I absolutely applaud that attitude, and wish that more would.\n\nWell done.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbHGWIay6f0","March 26","true","0.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

I had technical issues playing this game but managed to play it for a few hours but play time was not tracked.\n\nAbout the game\nThis is a pixelated dungeon game, you are trying to reach the top of the dungeon so you can rescue the King. Pick through a variety of classes to ascend the dungeon. Each class has their own unique weapons and abilities and maps. Each new game has a brand new map and different kinds of loot in chest and the shop. As you ascend each floor collect money, slay monsters, avoid traps and upgrade your loot and survive until you get to the top of the tower and fight the final boss. As you acsend the floors you will face new traps, new monsters, new bosses, you will need all of your luck and skill to survive.\n\nPros Lots of classes.\nVery difficult.\nLots of weapons and items to collect and use.\nDifferent types of monsters.\nHidden traps.\nBoss fights.\n\nCons\nOnly a few classes right now.\nVery challenging at higher levels.\nTakes a bit to get used to.\n\nMy final verdict\nAll in all I rate this game a 8.7 out of 10, this game is really fun and quite a challenge. I wish there were more classes but more will be coming soon.  There are some great boss fights and unique items that you can purchase for your character.\nThere are a bunch of floors to complete to save the King. This game takes a lot of skill to dodge all the enemies and traps as you collect gold to upgrade your weapons and prepare yourself for your journey.\n\nIf you liked this review and would like to see more please follow our curation group Here","November 20, 2015","true","0.1"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Since it's in Early Acess right now the game might lack some content, but it's a great foundation for further expansion. So if you are looking for some dungeon crawling + platforming action you should probably grab this game.\nThe only real complain right now is boss battles - sometimes boss just pins you into a corner and you can't avoid some of incoming damage. I hope that attack patterns would be changed in future so you can complete the game without taking any damage at all if you are hardcore enough.\n\nP.S.\n\nMjolnir + poison is the best way to go.","November 23, 2015","true","1.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

Not much a fan of the soundtrack. The Binding of Isaac references are neat and you can tell the creator get's his influences from edmund Binding of Isaac. This ia great dungeon crawler but NEEDS more content. I found the mage to be the funnest. He's a combo of warrior and archer in my opinion. Make sure to watch how much an orb actually to use if you're mage, a 20 dmg one cost orb is WAY better than a 30 dmg 2-5 cost orb since you can spam the magic.","December 1, 2015","true","10.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

This is not a complicated game with killer graphics.  This is a simple little retro-platformer with all the things you'd expect from a game of that genre.  Jump challenges, hacking and slashing, keys, gold, shops, hidden areas you need bombs to find, boss battles, and the music isn't bad either.  Keep an eye on this as it's still early access but I really like it so far.","December 6, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Then it deserves a reccomendation in my opinion.\n\nCurrent state of game is 6/10 :)\n\n(EARLY ACCESS REVIEW! 20 January)\n\nOverall great game, good balance...\nI like the game, but to pay such a price for 5 levels isn't fair :l\n\nPros\nit's a decent roguelike.\nReminds me about The binding of Isaac.\nmany lovingly items, hopefully much more will be added when released.\nOverall good looking simplistic design.\n\nCons\nThe music\nSome might dislike the visual style\nToo simple boss battles\nlack of scaling between dmg and def between hero and monsters\ntoo short (I know It's early access, but don't buy it right now only 5 levels are published)\n\nI really hope that there's still someone working on it, it could be a little 1 time hit :)\n\nEarly access 3/10","January 20","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
