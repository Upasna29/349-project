Instead of feeding into the drama and instigating any more flame wars, I want to use this last edit to set things straight and try not to be biased.\n\nI still don't recommend this game due to my own personal opinions. I think that the writing is bad, the artwork is cliche, and the plot was made to stroke the egos of the self-inserted "fursonas" that are part of the game. I see no real reason to enjoy this game other than the fact that it revolves around anthropromorphic characters, mainly those based around furry stereotypes.\n\nThe drama involving reviews [attempting] to be censored has subsided. Although the developer has admitted to trying to shut them down in the past and has apologized for doing so, I still believe that people have the right to know that it happened in the first place. I do believe that he has learned his lesson and will use his criticism to improve, but I can not guarantee that history can't repeat itself, no matter how improbable it seems.\n\nPeople have sent me hate mail because of my review, but they were mere insults and trolling that could have been easily ignored, much like the troll reviews for this game. I do apologize for acting hostile toward the community for what has happened, as I believed that my anger was justified after feeling like a target for having an opinion. If I have not retaliated, there would have been less drama to deal with. Klace has posted a public apology about this issue and has attempted to convince the community to tone down on their hostility toward negative reviewers. Whether or not this is legitimate damage control, he is only trying to negate the flame wars, which is the right thing to do no matter which side you're on.\n\nI do believe that this game has room for improvement, but it's going to be a long way to the top. The problems I have with the game itself are opinionated, so you could possibly enjoy this game if you are a "hardcore" furry. The developer and the people behind this game also need to improve on their behavior toward people outside of the furry fandom, or furries who aren't as involved in the fandom as much. They have already shown that they can improve and take an unbiased approach to the situation, so I thought it would only be fair if I did the same thing too.","December 8, 2015","false","0.2"," 1,584 of 1,754 people (90%) found this review helpful 90 people found this review funny","90","584","1","90","517"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/curuskeel/recommended/417990/","curuskeel","Curus Aurora Keel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/curuskeel/","1123 products in account","To those who are interested in Major\Minor, I highly recommend looking at Impulse! instead. Like this game, Impulse! revolves around a murder mystery involving in-universe musicians, much like this game. However, every single aspect of the game appears to be done RIGHT, even just using the store page as a judge. Better UI, clearer description, well edited and still very honest trailer, more interactivity, characters that have multiple expressions and animations, full voice acting, and art that, while not perfect, looks better than what is used in this game. The only thing missing is the furry aesthetic, and if that's the only reason that got you interested in Major\Minor to begin with... honestly, look elsewhere or wait for a better furry game to come out.\n\nAnyway, this review has gone through many prior changes:\n\nPrevious Versions:\nFirst Version[archive.is]\nSecond Version[archive.is]\nThird Version[archive.is]\nI don't recommend this game, it is a complete waste of time that only serves to promote the developer.\n\nIn M\M's inspiration, Persona 4, you had plenty of choices within the game world, some of which are beneficial in their own right and tie into core aspects of the game. Here? You're shunted into a linear story path with little variation, or even alternative stories to try out for increased content. The extent of your interactivity is advancing in RPG Maker dialogue boxes, for the entire game. So not interactive that there's a pamphlet sized guide on all the choices within. Obviously, this gets very boring after a while, something especially funny considering that the player character is explicitly handed a reality warping power from the outset. It's both lazy to give an ultimate Deus ex Machina power to the main character, and ironic when framed in a visual novel that's isn't very interactive even for them. It baffles me that the developer uses RPG Maker and has no ambition to use much of it besides the dialogue. When others say "the game has potential", I agree, but the developer's clearly not using that potential.\n\nThe plot? It can be described as Persona 4 with the interesting bits replaced with fur, so you are left with a skeleton version of the "Midnight Murders" plot in urban Japan, from the perspective of a foreigner who got all their knowledge of Japan from other anime and visual novels, and nether bothering to research beyond that. As such, it feels like a theme park mish-mash of Japany things, with furs for basically no reason other than community appeal. It's clearly trying to mime Persona 4 with the basic setting, a magical another world, and a mysterious cataclysm that only you can stop, but completely misses out on the elements that makes that game good.\n\nThe art? Well... on further reflection, it's actually quite good. The game still doesn't use multiple expressions despite being promised since the start and being "worked on", and the clothing design choices on the female characters are rather questionable, but overall the art is very well executed. It shouldn't suprise you to hear that this was not done by the dev, but by independent artist PawziClawzi. This will be the only positive thing I say about the game.\n\nThe characters? A good majority of them are self inserts. Like the developer Klace, an -in-universe pop star who somehow gets away with wearing this fetishistic mishmash of an outfit in public[archive.li]. Yes, this is how he looks like in the actual game. He dies early on, but is still a posthumous focus. In fact, nearly everyone else is a self-insert, to the point where you could throw a stone in the world and hit someone's OC. Everyone's played flat, and you'd be hard pressed to really care about others in the world.\n\nIn essence, this is an uninspired visual novel that isn't good at what visual novels should be good at. It could have been released for free and be ultimately inoffensive, but for $10, are you freaking kidding me? Not even worth it as a joke gift, and once you get over the furry parts, it's not even that good even as a joke. Let's not forget that the developer chose to flag this review and another highly helpful negative review for superficial reasons in an attempt to get Valve to remove them, and tried to cultivate an echo chamber where he could pass off negative reviews as being made by internet trolls and have people believe him. And even after he apologized, the developer chose to passive aggressively insult me behind my back on his Facebook after I made a truce with him. All that and more are recorded in this document.\n\nThis game looks good if you are casually observing it, but look any deeper and the cracks show. At least the next game which the developer is publishing looks like an actual game, but since this has been a major stain on his reputation... will it really fare that well?\n\nADDENDUM 1 (04/10):\n\nOn further inspection of the characters in the game, it turns out that every single male character in this game and the heavily featured yellow/purple female wolf, Daz, is someone else's fursona. Yes, seriously. Of the 24 characters planned for or appearing in the game, only 4 - Eclair, Trish, Max, and Jade - are actually original to the game. This may explain their bizarre lack of design unity, seemingly ill-fitting traits (such as Kila's blue fur or Rook's inexplicable green augmentations/patterns), or how some seem to have characteristics unfitting of their backstories or role in game. They made sense for the fursona, but the developer couldn't figure out how to have them make sense in the game world.\n\nSeriously, if you search for a randomly selected character's name on FurAffinity, you will find at least something either related or unrelated to the game that depicts the character and links to the person that owns said character. The few that I couldn't find there have their own accounts on Facebook depicting their characters in some manner. The only purpose of this game, from what I have seen, is to be a vehicle for these self-inserts and the developer's wallet.\n\nDespite this, I do not condone harassment of those whose characters are involved in the game. I will not publicly link the accounts of those involved.\n\nADDENDUM 2 (04/10):\n\nI found the game's writing to be very bad and very boring, but this takes the cake:\n\nThere is a particular scene in Chapter 4 where one of the main characters, Singe, is holding a press conference to reassure safety after Klace's own mysterious death, stipulating that nobody should leave, and promising that he's using hired guards alongside equipment from the Armstrong security corporation to ensure safety. This provokes the hired guard in question, Acheron, to chew Singe out for lining the building with explosives from said security corporation in order to defend the building. Yes, a character who is not supposed to be a villain, deliberately lined the building, filled with many innocent people, with extremely destructive explosives. That is just shameful writing.\n\nWhen I think of Major\Minor, I now think of defensive explosions.\n\nADDENDUM 3 UPDATE (5/22)\n\nThanks for making this review a pre-release one by messing around with the release date. And further thanks for rubbing salt into that by telling affected people to delete and remake their review entierly.\n\nIt wasn't a glitch, it was your change to begin with. Stupid.","December 8, 2015","false","0.5"," 1,184 of 1,348 people (88%) found this review helpful 97 people found this review funny","88","184","1","97","336"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorPony/recommended/417990/","DoctorPony","Doctor Pony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorPony/","608 products in account","I am going to be as spoiler-less as I can be.\n\nThe first chapter is short, I got through it in one playthrough in roughly 40 minutes. This game is not very well written. The two characters you interact with the most are insufferable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (whether knowingly or not), and the way the protagonist responds to them are entirely unbelievable. The amount of chill the protagonist has is ridiculous. Not only does Kila sell you out as soon as he can, but you're also blamed for an event that is 100% out of your control (a train being delayed); when the train was delayed you could respond to a text sent to you from a person you're supposed to meet at the station, asking when you will arrive. Since the train was delayed, I decided to be honest. The protagonist figuratively nods and says he will explain what happened face-to-face and sends back "I don't know". He never does, and instead just lets him-/her-self get walked all over by these two "potential friends". The amount of ♥♥♥♥ the protagonist is willing to take from people whom he doesn't even know is staggering, especially when the game keeps hammering in that you're supposed to befriend these people.\n\nKila portrayed as a dopey idiot who can't keep things to himself, getting you in trouble on more than one occasion. Rook is just a jerk. All he does is complain and treat both you and Kila like ♥♥♥♥. Jade seems to be a somewhat reasonable person, although she has trouble acting like a person (you'll see what I mean by that if you do buy this game). Inumi has one line of dialogue. Eclaire, so far, is the only person who seems like an actual person. A person hopped up on coke, or has bipolar disorder, but a person nonetheless.\n\nIf I had to describe the writing style of this game, then it would be.. Fanfiction as written by a person whose idea of a personality is taking articles from TVTropes and plastering them all over a character. I sort of doubt we will be seeing any development in terms of character in these upcoming chapters.\n\nIt gets worse as you progress through the "story". I suppose I should be thankful that chapter 1 is so short. But speaking of the story, there is none. You arrive in Tokyo, you speak to a grand total of 5 people and then the game is over. 42 minutes. The game wants you to keep loading up saves and trying out different choices, but I honestly wasn't too interested in that. If I wanted to hang out with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and probe them in various ways to see how they will demean my pushover of a character next, I'd hang out with my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ friends in real life thankyouverymuch.\n\nAnother complaint I have is the fact that there is just one static sprite for each character. You meet 5 characters during your playthrough (Kila, Rook, Jade, Inumi, and Eclaire) and each of them has one, and only one, portrait. Unchanging, each forever staring off to one side. That said, the portraits are very nicely drawn. There are some very minor issues, like the level of detail kind of fades along the edges of the characters, but other than that I have no actual complaints about the quality.\n\nI feel sorry for the author and developer of this game. I think that the idea is solid, but the writing is not there yet and the game itself is entirely unfinished. $9 for 42 minutes of gameplay where most of it is spent being talked down to and backstabbed? Eh. I'm not going to presume to tell these people what to do, but this game is clearly not finished. The least they could have done is put it on Early Access or something.\n\nEDIT: If you do decide to check the game out anyway, I think you should. $9 is not that steep of a price, and since the game is ridiculously short (averaging between 30 and 80 minutes for one playthrough from what I can see from other reviews) you can easily ask for a refund after.","December 9, 2015","false","0.7"," 480 of 546 people (88%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","88","480","546","30","5"

I really wanted to like it, but I just can't.\n\nMost of the character designs are bad, I felt like I was browsing people's OC's on FurAffinity. From the blue furred rodent with the purple triangles under his eyes for some reason to the guy with the glowy neon tattoos and thousand yard stare, it's hard to take them seriously. This is made worse by the fact that there seems to only be one sprite for each character, so they are always talking to you with the same facial expression.\n\nThe writting's not great either. Right off the bat, the game treats you to a weird monlogue about forging your own destiny through your choices, then asks you the hard hitting question of "Do you want to go to the maid cafe?". The game is framed very dramatically but the actual choices and setting feel mundane (Admittedly, they could take a more dramatic route in later episodes). There's also the issue of Klace. Everybody loves the great and amazing Klace upon whom the plot hinges. It's hard to look past this obvious self insert character.\n\n\nI hesitate to label the characters shallow having only played the first in a series of chapters. I will say that they didn't really capture my interest. It's possible that this opinion is colored by my dislike of their design, however, so take that as you will.\n\nNot much to say about the music, other than it's super generic. I didn't hate it, but I'm not chomping at the bit to buy the soundtrack.\n\n\nThe game is episodic, so maybe later episodes will prove me wrong and this will turn out to be a great game. I honestly hope it does. If it goes on the way this first episode did, though, I don't see that happening.","December 9, 2015","false","0.8"," 420 of 479 people (88%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","88","420","479","31","9"

It's free and will probably be longer.\n\nUPDATE: Chapter 2 came out.\n\nSo, chapter 2 was certainly alot more fun than the first, still a lack of emotion on the characters, but I'm okay with that. The story really picks up here and now I'd give it a 5/10, still not worth $10 but at this rate, will be in 2 or 3 chapters. The game in it's current state is still- just not worth it.\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nApparently, soon 'multiple expressions' will be added for each character, plus there will be a 'talking' animation aswell! I'm actually pretty happy with this, it's a good step in the right direction.\n\nUPDATE 3:\n\nOkay, so now Klace (the Dev) is rewriting the first chapter to make it fit in with the story better- and to make it MUCH less boring to read through endless lines of overly-detailed basic actions.

I'm okay with that, but there's one thing that made me request a refund.\n\nThe concept of "no playthrough will be the same" doesn't quite work when there's not enough dynamics involved. All of the choices you make trigger a pre-written action that goes on until you get the next two option that triggers another pre-written action and so on and so forth. It's such a shame that there couldn't be anything inbetween that to go with the story, and it just feels like a lie to sell the game with that there would be anything new and unexpected to justify playing it again and again just to get a different ending. I've played my share of furry dating sims, obviously, and while Morenatsu does have sex in it, I still decided to play through it several times due to the characters being interesting and having more of a choice with what I wanted to do and where I wanted to take the story. Sure, it's unfair for me to compare that game with Major\Minor since it's still in early access but from the experience that I got from playing it, the lack of player interaction isn't enough to make me feel like I have a greater control then getting to name the player character and getting thrown two choices from time to time before having to save and continue. Did I mention that this game makes you save quite a lot, cause it does. My first savefile managed to get corruped, and that pretty much killed it for me in the end.\n\nPretty much everyone that will buy this game will probably only buy it because of the anthropomorphic animals that you "interact" with, but I'd like a lot more then just pretty art and furry characters. And it's current state, I just can't see how Major\Minor can be worth playing through more than once. The writing and the characters won't hold you for long if you've even touched a visual novel before, and I can't see what path the game will take in the long-run. Considering the price and what you get for buying this game, I'd wait a while before picking this up.","December 3, 2015","false","0.7"," 558 of 688 people (81%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","81","558","688","36","21"

Second, I'm going to ignore a bit of the stuff that is currently happening in the community portion of this game that i read from other reviews (i.e. Pop star based of Dev, reviews getting flagged, players banned from forums, ect.). Finally, there will be a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nWith that being said i'm going to say that this game isn't all that bad, it has potential to be good. but it isn't quite there yet. The writing itself is decent, a few spelling errors here and there, but it's nothing to write home about. The monologue at the begining almost drove me away and feels rather unecessary, i felt as though my character could of easily been introduced to the higher plane of existence in a better way, but thats just me. Theres a huge focus on the theme of not making snap judgements and the whole "Don't judge a book by its cover", and it does a decent job of this depending on the choices you make regarding characters. And even though some of the characters have "cookie cutter" personalities from other stories, they're tolerable and one or two of them (so far) are a bit unique. What leaves me wanting more from this game is the visual aspect of this game. Now, as i said i'm not really into furries or anything of the sort, but the characters are well-drawn for the most part disregarding some of their weird designs of colorful explosions. However, throughout the entire game, they all have one expression/stance and never change in the slightest. It would be nice to see characters look like the expression instead of being told "They look defeated", show me don't tell me. Theres also a lot left desired for the backgrounds, but nothing to bad. Another big thing that this game advertises is that the choices you make matter. I played it twice just to see how different certain things are. For the most part there are noteable differences, for example on one playthrough a character known as "Rook" i earned a bad first impression with him and he would stare at me angerily when mentioning a contract i didn't uphold and we had a bad start, however on the second playthrough the character was more fond of me, and eventually near the end he had a confession scene that i previously didnt hear before. With that being said though, alot of the dialogue between choices doesn't change to much, but there are clear differences especially how one choice led me to a whole new location with new diaologue exchanges and choices and i didnt even meet a character i had met previously. But at this moment it isn't really clear of how these choices will affect the future or if i will ever meet or miss certain characters. All in all, it was interesting, but there are definitly things that need to be fixed and reworked.\n\nSo far i've kinda enjoyed it when i came in with low expectations, but with the current state that this Visual Novel is in, i can't recommend it, especially since its early access and the story is unfinished and wont be finished for another year, which makes reviewing it hard since i can't really say if a story is truly good enough based on one single chapter alone, no matter how interesting i found it.\n\nTL;DR: The game isn't nearly as bad as people are making it out to be, but its not by any means a great/good game either . I cannot recommend the game in its current condition; so-so writing, a few cookie cutter and a few interesting characters, has potential but needs alot of work. Upon full release i'll change my review as necessary if it warrents it.","December 9, 2015","false","2.9"," 239 of 282 people (85%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","85","239","282","12","22"

I start up the game, i see some interesting title art, and hear some very enjoyable title music, i sat there for a few minutes listening to it, getting myself prepared for a great furry based game!\n\nUnfortunately, the title panel is where the enjoyment happens to end, because immediately you are met with what can only be described as the super-tsunami tidal wave of text. That's literally all this is, layer upon layer, upon layer of text, and literally nothing else. The game continuously boasts choices but in the entire first chapter (Which SHOULD be the set up for the entire coming game) i was only really given about two choices that were likely to change anything. Meaning the whole point behind this game, i.e the choices actually crops up an exceedingly small amount, however the game seemed to have no problem forcing me to save the game every 3 minutes, meaning any choice you do make, you can just quit and restart and make a different choice, making the game completely pointless to begin with because it saps any sense of adventure you have.\n\nThe characters are extremely one dimensional and extremely unimaginative, they have less personality than a satsuma, and their unchanging expressions are ridiculous to look at. This lack of variation completely destroys any sense of immersion and any sense of connectivity to the characters you may have built up, which you would be lucky to.\n\nThe story is somewhat interesting, i mean, it has a lot of mileage it was just executed extremely poorly. The dialogue seemed like it was cut and pastes from a particularly boring roleplay two people had on skype, and it was just full of complete ramble. So much ramble, literally nothing of importance is said within the first thirty to fourty walls of text you have to sledge your way through, by which point the game has already lost my interest and my tension headache is slowly caning its way back into my brain.\n\nThe soundtrack is mediocre at best, there is nothing memorable about it so i have nothing to say about it... it's just... yeah, it's music... nothing great.\n\nThe game, well, "interactive text wall" as i'll now personally dub it, has a shred of a chance of being somewhat interesting if the developer just manages to do more with the future chapters, if the future chapters are anything like this first one, it'll be worth burying. How this game has mostly positive reviews is beyond me. The point of a game is the content which you play, not how it looks aesthetically. Obviously it pleases me that there is a game out there for furries, but the content is simply not up to scratch to be worth anything near to a thumbs up.\n\nYou have a good idea and a good ground to do something decent, how many people really want to see boring art, boring dialogue and hear repetitive mediocre music? Nobody, that's how many.","December 12, 2015","false","0.8"," 151 of 181 people (83%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","83","151","181","12","14"

Nearly TWO HOURS of my life is now in the oblivion between the two worlds, whatever that's supposed to represent. And no, this isn't some hate speech, basically. This is honest to god, legitimate thoughts.\n\nLet's get down to it, huh?\n\nOkay, immediately as the game begins, I'm given a message saying that this supports controllers. Why? Why would I need that? When I can just as easily perform actions based on the keyboard that you JUST GOT FINISHED telling me. There really isn't a purpose. Basically the arrow keys and enter button are the most frequently used keys. If that's an excuse to make me feel like I'm "playing a game", just because I'm holding a controller, then woah.\n\nSecondly, our main character, FROM THE FIRST LINE OF TEXT TO THE END, is a buffoon. Even then, that word doesn't adequately define that dunderhead. I despise him! If you want to have a great and compelling story... what's one of the most important aspects? HAVING A LIKEABLE MAIN CHARACTER! He literally wasted like 10 seconds in the beginning explaining that he laughed at his own pun, ha! He said "train of thought", on a train! Ingenious! To make matters worse, he goes ON AND ON. Like, my lord, he says things that are irrelevant to the story in its ENTIRETY! Paragraph length nonsense... and good god, why does he say "I hunger"? That doesn't even make sense from a comical viewpoint! Last thing I'll touch on this guy, is that HE TELLS EVERYTHING THAT WILL HAPPEN. You need to SHOW, and not TELL in a story. SHOW. He literally gives away things, and it's just the epitome of annoying!\n\nThird, the music is tiring, to say the least. Thought I'd freak out about that? Well, you'd be only half right, slick. Listening to the same looping track for however long it takes you to read through the tongue-in-cheek dialogue will cause a sane man to either mute his speakers or, I dunno, put on some Rush or something. Not like any of the characters SAY ANYTHING.\n\nFourth, we have the dialogue that goes on FOR AGES, and ages, and ages. I could lick a Tootsie Pop simultaneously and get to the center before one scene is over. Things that are unimportant are said by everyone. Why do we need to know if the other contest winner will be cool, or easy to get along with? You have to SHOW, I say again, not just have the main character voicing basically everything that is bound to happen regardless of what choice is picked.\n\nFifth, when a new character appears, or when something is said that should confuse the player, it's blatantly obvious. I mean, come on, I went into that cafe under the impression that soon I'd be meeting the hostess... Eclair. So then, who's the first one who pops up as I get into the cafe, besides the painfully clueless squirrel? Oh, "???", I wonder who that could be. Well two lines later, yeah! It's Eclair! Shocking. Come on.\n\nCall me butter, I'm on a roll. We're already to the sixth fatal flaw. The unchanging backgrounds. The uncredited backgrounds faded out slightly that are quite possibly some of the most generic things I've ever seen. And when that stupid random "???" guy approaches you in the train, it just swaps into a GHOST pallette and flips upside down. At first, I didn't know what the hell that was about. I thought the train crashed or something. What happened to his space background? Also, the limo... yeah, I think Paul Bunyan could fit in there.\n\nSeventh... the characters themselves. What I wanna mention first in this, although I might've mentioned this earlier... I sat there wanting to just slap myself in the face too many times over what was said because their personalities are that of just mixed cement with a happy face. Rook defining the word "Strict". Okay? That was important to our plot. Two or three characters, including the idiot you're controlling, basically try to teach teach the player a lesson that famous people are just "acting on stage". Oh, would you say that about Justin Bieber? Is he acting up there, when he's getting all salty to his fans? When he does that basically to everyone else? Yeah, and Klace himself... why? Why is this game's focus basically "how much can I sell out a pink husky wearing panties, which also happens to be my main fursona"? Just why? For god's sake, he basically ruled the world these characters were in. Isn't that just a tad bigheaded? That's like if I made a game called "I, Francis, Have Been Declared the Supreme Ruler of the Galaxy and I am Putting Me as the Final Boss Who's Invincible!"\n\nBut wait, why does only Eclair have a change of expression every now and then? Nobody else? Everyone else is just smiling away! Even when it says "He looks defeated", I went, "Uh, no. He seems to be pretty happy." Because HE WAS STILL SMILING IN THE PICTURE! Did you ever watch a movie where only one character had any dimension at all? Besides Troll 2, that's cheating if you were gonna say that. Also, that "???" guy, yep, going back to him again, I get sick of him scolding you for freaking everything you do, and telling me that the world revolves around my choices, the little I get. I literally wanted to clock that dillweed.\n\nNumber 8! The progression & story. It's slow. It nearly put me to sleep, but you can't blame me when the characters have little importance in the things they spew out: "Midnight Murders, blah blah, Klace, blah blah, I'm Eclair, blah blah blah! By the time I regained my consciousness, I would be greeted with an even more stupid thing. Like the quiz? It wasn't even a quiz if you don't let THE PLAYER answer. Come on, what am I, five? It basically taunted me by playing the buzzing sound like I got it wrong or something. Every time I thought I was doing something right, it just turns out I get nagged later, and the stupid protagonist even has the nerve to scold the player, no matter WHAT choice is picked, is my belief. "I don't think I should do that, but okay." Like, all right! Did Mario ever turn away from an enemy and interrupt your game and say, "I don't know if I should walk that way!"\n\nBy the time I got done with the game, I was hysterically laughing at the message basically telling me to play again. Don't let this shock you or upset you, but... if I ever sit through that again, I think I'm going to need to get a dose of Advil PM.\n\nSo, yeah. I'm done. Apologies to those whom it might offend, but this is a big fat stamp of disapproval. I even liked the idea back then of this. But wow. 112 minutes, people! Non-stop "gameplay action" from this guy!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CarnivoreJJS/recommended/417990/","CarnivoreJJS","Carniburr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CarnivoreJJS/","224 products in account","I was on the fence about this game, and the developer; Klace, was so kind to give me a key!\n\nSadly, I couldn't recommend this game to anyone, anywhere, at this time. It's not the worst game per-say, but if you've never really played Visual Novels that are inherently creepy or bad, like 'Nippon! My Trip to Japan' or the such, that all basically revolve around softcore porn or imaginary dating. Thankfully, there's none of the first, and the rest of the game is rolled out like a "friend simulator" where you get to be dragged along by one or two other characters and have them talk to each-other or at you for painfully long times. It totes a dynamic choice, but within the first thirty minutes I unknowingly agreed to accompany a character to a maid cafe and was never even given the option to refuse or take it back, because story-line related stuff happens and people berate your decision. Also on decisions, you don't get many! They usually boil down to either "be nice, be rude"/"yes, no"/"i know about that, i don't know about that" and are sparsely located. It took me a full hour to get two choices, and only two. Maybe if I chose one differently and wasn't strong armed into going a location I could've done more, but I wasn't allowed to go back on my previous decision on what should've been a choice that would hurt my progress with one character and restore it with the other.\n\nBefore a patch that was released days after the game was apparently left to ship, there was a benevolent spiritual guide who'd literally tell you "Wow, you didn't reply nicely to that guy. That's seriously bad, you shouldn't of done that. But hey, whatever, not my business" along with other characters having unreasonable reactions to simple topics. On top of this, the full release saw quotation marks surrounding all text, so characters even though they didn't stop talking, would have multiple quotes in the same box like "Four is an unlucky number in Japanese!" "It sounds like death!", a simple break of basic English structure when writing stories.\n\nThe game does a terrible job at keeping your interest. Almost all the music is simplistic songs that should be expected from a pre-2010 Flash game on the likes of Newgrounds, it's easy to get sick of the repetitive songs as scenes last for almost ten to twenty minutes at a time, with only a single character sprite for every single character, who don't even show any emotion or movement on themselves. It's just a static image, the whole game, with to my knowledge; not even an outfit change. The backgrounds are just real life photos, blurred, with raised contrast. It all gets a little annoying to stare at because the characters are these inky, brightly drawn characters but the backgrounds are all washed out photos that often don't match the previous. I've played flash-based dating sims and visual novels almost identical to this but shorter, it doesn't feel like a complete product to sell in many ways. Down to the fact much of the RPGmaker engine's assets and useless bloat are included with the game's install.\n\nMy biggest gripe, above all this basic negligence, is the characters are not interesting. They all aren't particularly striking socially, most of them falling to the most simple of tropes for all their introductions until you forcibly get to know them. I know these characters are based off of real people and I mean absolutely no offense to them as I'm sure they're nothing like these game counterparts, I find it hard to gain any interest in the generic manager who doesn't have time to get in touch with emotions or spare any kindness and should be given the right-away for being offputting because he's so busy. Or the quirky, socially inept squirrel that's terrified of everything and overreacts at the slightest disruption while not being outgoing in the slightest. I've seen this all before a million times, as many of the characters I could force myself to meet, anyways. Otherwise the plot is a smooth rip of the basics taking place in Persona 4, revolving around the mysterious "Midnight Murders", which obviously mean people die every night at midnight in strange, violent ways. Oooh, so spooky, if it wasn't already done multiple times before. The first chapter won't offer any answers, or interesting questions, on that subject either, so don't get your hopes up!\n\nThe game has the potential to improve itself, I wouldn't be so stinging in my review if it was an Early Access or in-development game, but they've released Chapter 1 and stated it's a full, complete chapter even though basic typos weren't fixed on the day of publishing. I'd hope that the future chapters, which honestly shock me for being a year to develop as it's a simple text-based exchange built on RPGmaker to the point where the whole game is available to edit if you have the newest version of RPGmaker, improve on the dull uninspired characters and provide us with something that actual provides horror in some way, and characters to care for.\n\nPROS:\n-The character art is nice, even if I don't like neon-bright animals.\n\nNOTSOPRO:\n-Choices are few and far between despite the store-page claiming it's many choices, maybe they'll come in the next ELEVEN chapters.\n-When not dealing with the story, you're dealing with people. The protagonist, who is supposed to be you, has internal monologuing about everyone, everything they do, and everything around, but never many choices or ability to conversate when with more than one person.\n-Characters are basic tropes when you meet them, and usually suffer from the same issues those characters are generally faced with. (i.e "i'm too busy don't like to make friends and be nice because I split with the person I loved, so now I'm not nice")\n-The conversations are downright awkwardly written, most of the time being forced "hey did you know [interesting fact about japan]?" that transition into the exposition\n-The characters only have one sprite for the whole first chapter.\n-Music is simple, repetitive, and easily gets on your nerves.\n-Bloated by extra RPGmaker assets that aren't used at all\n-Is a perfect satire of the tropes in visual novels and dating games without realizing it.\n\ntl;dr: I mean no offense to the creators, crew, or any affiliated persons on this game. It is of my personal, non-credited opinion that this game lies about it's core elements and downright fails at meeting the rest. There is room for improvement, but right now it stands like a first draft or an early alpha with basic singular assets included.","December 13, 2015","false","1.7"," 123 of 150 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","123","150","7","50"

The F4 to switch between fullscreen and windowed mode is not saved between sessions, and the story thus far felt fairly short.  The fact the story is not finished is an additional point against the game.\n\nThey need to work on more emotions for the stills, as during a scene people discussing the death of a character (though I would say that putting yourself in the game is a bad move) is offput by the characters all having mile wide grins.   Some of the claims like the SMS system and going on Dates is not put in yet.  And it is definitely not the length of several novels at this point in time.

The "story," is one part Willy Wonka, one part Persona 4, and one part fetishizing Japan. It's about 30 minutes long, and does nothing at all. It spends nearly the entire time on your main character thinking about railings on a train and talking about how great things in Japan are, and talking about how cool the game creator's self insert character is. I wish that the person that bought this for me would of just taken the $7 he spent on this pile of garbage and burned it instead.

Here's the reason why:\n\nFirst the positive points that goes for this game:\n- Nice drawings of the characters, all look good\n- Musik does fit the context of the text\n- ... nothing else that I can say.\n\nNow, it would be better to not to call this a game, it is a visual novel. It does claim it and does fulfill that.\nBut it also claims to be inspired by greats like Steins;Gate, Tales of Symphonia and Persona 4. Biggest and most devestating problem with all that is while Steins;Gate is a visual novel, Tales of Symphonia and Persona 4 are games. While the stories of the later two are good, they are reinforced and made great through play, interaction. Major/Minor tries to use those stories as a kind of template as a visual novel.\nFrom what I could bear of the whole story it felt like, those stories mashed together and then put into the mechanics of Steins;Gate. It felt like a parody of the very enjoyable stories of those two games. Much of the narrative is bland. It mostly works as a info dump. The thoughts of the character you play as is undistinguishable from the narrative. No person that has a personality thinks like that. The reader/player is a puppet master that directs the puppets down the path he/she wants. Those puppets are characters, fully developed characters. Here it felt like I'm looking at cardboard cutouts of stock characters.\nIt may all just be a failing of writing there though as to me, the writing compares to lower-grade mediocore fanfictions. The whole story even starts out making the main character like a Mary Sue. To use fanfiction tags: godlike, AU, OC.\nIt all doesn't blend well together. It might have been that I, myself, had some higher expectations of Major/Minor and it failed to even come close to the expectations but even with the expectations of it not being engaging, this product would have failed to meet that expectation. It felt insulting to the place this whole plot plays in, Tokyo, Japan.\n\nSo I would not recommend this game. My reasons are stated above.","February 16","false","1.1"," 69 of 83 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","69","83","9","1"

I'm a firm believer that a game should be finished before it is put up for sale, so "massive overhaul" or day one patches are inexcusable. I DO intend to play to the end and give final thoughts.\n\nMajor Minor is a game about blank name McJapan fetish going to see a pop icon known for being popular world wide. The developer. I won't go into detail and I've long gotten over self insert tropes, and the dev is most of the time quiet about himself in the game. However, that doesn't excuse making your name the central point of conflict on the opening chapter and the appearing in the second chapter to thank me for playing. Without pants...A small detail yes, maybe I'm just nit picking, but still jarring if you really want me to invest in the story.\n\nBack to blank name McJapan. This isn't a bash fest I swear! There are things I like about how he is introduced, and the conflict set up with a swift "There and gone" effect, If that is what you choose to do, then you did it well. So as McJapan goes on, we find out a lot of conflict is actually waiting in Japan, but thankfully not too much. An odd murder, an odd otter, and an odd cafe. Cool, I can deal with that. My gripe is that the conflict between the characters and not the action in the world seems to be driving at different speeds, leading us to a sobbing character we know nothing about and then are forced to make a decision. It's like a ball and chain, of the two are mismatched, then your effect won't follow through quite was well.\n\nChapter one ended and I felt happy that it was over. Riddled with, yes fixed, but still glaring issues of run on sentences and an overwhelming amount of detail and repeating sentences that was wholly unnecessary. This was my first impression, and the first part of your game is the most important. Again, i'm not here to just bash and I don't want it to seem that way, but on the subject of bashing...I know every visual novel is different, both in art style and amount of character reaction, each one costing more money and more time to program. I understand a lack of expression changes, but your maid cafe girl had her thumbs switched to the wrong side of her hands when you flipped the image to move her around. After that I started to notice more and more how the images never changed, but were flipped, and even could see when a image was first show to me and I could tell that it was a reverse. A small detail, but one that me a my friends laughed at for a while seeing as so many had their thumbs broken by the reverse fairy. The artwork itself is pleasing to the eye, soft brush use makes the characters appear simple in texture so you can focus more on the important parts of the game and avoid being distracted, but color use is key when designing a character. The assassin's apprentice has a color palette made my head strain trying to understand where it started and where it began. https://www.youtube.com/user/SpindleHorse this artist has the best and simplest ways to design a charater and just by color alone you can see what this person is about, what their personality is and still find it pleasing to the eye. Also if your servant fox character is as poor and in dire straights, maybe avoid hot pink hair on clashing orange and a gold piercing with brown rags for clothes. I can't tell if he's about to get whipped or go to a really weird rave.\n\nEnough about the art. Lastly is the writing itself. It isn't bad. Really, it isn't the worst thing ive ever seen; you convey your intent well and have a few interesting characters running that do keep me in the story. Avoid pitfalls that take a lot of writers down; an easy one to fall into that I myself have trouble with, is trying to build your characters faster than your world, or vice versa. Call it the Lucas effect, and say you have this vast world like Avatar or Star Wars, then decide to never focus on the characters. Or take great heros and villans, then put them in boring worlds. Pacing is the most important part of writing, and I've sorta fallen in love with this game and just want to see it reach it's full potential; the ideas presented are new and refreshing, so don't let hype or just a desire to finish detract from the quality being pushed out.\n\nOverall, I want to see this become better; it has a good foundation and the strength is there, it just needs more polish and time. I can't say I recommend it right now, but if I'm proven wrong in the end, I will gladly take this down and put up a positive review.\n\n\nAs an added note, Klace, if you read this, I have been a write for seven years, if you ever have the want or time, I'd gladly help in shaping the writing out more where I can.\n\n","February 15","false","5.7"," 74 of 93 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","74","93","8","5"

At least we're not being charged per chapter. The developer has removed negative comments before, so I hope he takes this as constructive feedback.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxerinoMang/recommended/417990/","FoxerinoMang","El Rino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxerinoMang/","95 products in account","(POSSIBLE SPOILERS) Firstly, was never interested in this game. I've refunded it a while ago, and only bought it just because I wanted to do a playthrough of it on youtube to see if it was as bad as everyone was claiming it to be. They were not wrong, and even unfortunately it wasn't even that bad to the point it was humorous, it was just overall not fun to play, and frankly I didn't even finish the game, so this isn't a full, but only partial review of my experience with the game. The characters were boring, and uninteresting. Kila was an average over-worried, clutz. Rook was just pretty much there to help you progress further into the "rich" plot. Jade was the cliche, cringey, humorless person trying to get better at humor, and Inumi is your painfully average shy donut steel oc from furaffinity. Oh, and you can easily find the mysterious "man's" name by going through the game files. Speaking of the game files, it's painful to see that there's literally only two pictures pratically for each character in the game, one standing on the left, then flipping the image to make them appear standing on the right. Only for one character I saw there was a picture for a emotion they would give off in the dialogue (that's if it even shows), and I felt like if the game made the characters have more than one facial expression, it would make the game THAT less boring to look at. I've heard it's because the patreon for this game hadn't reached that milestone, which I think is silly, because I felt like there could've been different facial expressions if the artist's goal wasn't to make sure to shade the everlasting heck out of each of the characters to make them look realistic and such. Personally, I would've taken facial expressions over the quality of the art anyday.\n\nGoing back to the dialogue, there's too much of it, and if you're a fast reader, from what I've heard, you'll finish the game in under a hour, and you've just participated in what people are calling a Left Click Simulator. Along with there being so much, there's a lot of pointless dialogue that shouldn't even be in the game, like some of the dialogue tries to remind you of a joke if there was one, to go back and play the game with a whole different 2-3 choices, or just some pointless details about the enviorment and such. Speaking of the choices, for a game saying where your choices matter, it really doesn't feel like they do. Your first choice of the game is to tell Rook if you're going to be late or not when arriving. Really? This is a choice that will drastically change the game? I mean I heard of the butterfly effect, but I mean come on. Not to mention, the game stresses out that if Rook does find out or if you told him if you're gonna be late, he'll go absolutely go crazy and slit his wrists or something. The second choice is telling Kila that you're part of a contest or not, and then if you want to go to a Maid Cafe with him. Then the third choice I don't even know exists, because I gave up on the game before then because after those first two choices. There's such a large gap between that last choice to the next one if there even is a next one before Chapter 2! So get ready to read A LOT of stuff before you're allowed to experiene some type of "gameplay" again. And the writing? Like I said before, not interesting, and nothing to write home about. You can find fanfictions that are worth more of your time than dealing with a game you spent 10$ on.\n\nFinally, the price tag, and the game. 10$? 10$ for a game you pratically read for an hour, then it just stops, and you have to wait another month before the next chapter comes out? That's a joke. There are full fledged books out there for 10$ that can keep me more entertained and worth my money. This game in its current state, should not be priced for 10$, hell even on the sale, it wasn't even worth 7$ in my opinion. With the game's current content, playability, and "gameplay" it should only be 5$, once again, in my opinion. Now if the game had more chapters and content, then it would be worth 10$, if there was another 2-3 chapters right off the bat, but since this game is going to be episodic that ain't happening. If the game is episodic and/or lacking content, shouldn't it still be in early access instead of you know, out of it right now? I mean, according to the patch notes, the game isn't even at version 1.0 yet! If this game was still in early access, the price tag and everything would make much more sense, but since it's out of early access, well there's nothing much to say or do. This game should've still been in early access, or released with more content, but since there is no other content currently, and it's out of early access, this a game you should not buy until a third or fourth chapter comes out, and you're ready to endure on a whole bunch of reading and characters that will possibly not even interest you. Funny thing about the game's lack of content is that if you finish the first chapter, don't like it, and didn't have it in your library for more than two weeks, then you can easily refund the game.\n\nOverall, this game should not be bought until more content is brought in, and even then, do not have high expectations of the game's writing or characters, or it being worthwhile because more content does not automatically mean a better game. The writing is nothing to write home about, there's little choices to be made, the characters are uninteresting and only have one facial expression and if they're standing on the left or right, and prepare to hit that left mouse click or space bar A LOT. It's also saddening to know the majority of the target audience this game was supposed to appeal to doesn't even like this game either. If this game is still in the positive ratings, don't fall for it, it would be understandable if it was in mixed, but the only reason I feel that it's even in the positive ratings is because of furries. You can make anything as bad as you want, but if you have furries in the mix, then you better believe furries are going to support the everlasting hell out of it. It's "pawful" I know.\n\nyiff/10 needs more game\n\nUPDATE 1/18/2016 - News has been told that the game will be getting multiple expressions for the characters of the game, as well as maybe even a talking animation. Despite this may not even be close to saving the game from the other problems it has right now, it's a much needed feature and it will make the game much more pleasing to look at, and nowhere as near boring.\n\nUPDATE 4/14/16 - Still no multiple expressions, still no talking animation and the writing was lazily overwritten in the first chapter, though at least there was new stuff which didn't make it god awful to go through again and I found out what the hell is going on in the game. Though the writing is still meh, and everything still is meh. Nothing much has changed and even with revamped writing in the first chapter, I can only feel that even adding multiple expressions and such will not even make this game better. There are good visual novels out there, even interactive ones with choices, this is not one of them.","January 6","false","1.4"," 45 of 63 people (71%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","71","45","63","9","3"

The game is a very bare bones, shallow and methodical VN with little left to the imagination. Whatever promise it showed is thrown away in order to pander to the furry fandom, most of which is smart enough to stay away from the game. However, as can be seen from reveiws and the widely reported cases of harrasment, there's enough of an audience for this that it still made back a hefty profit, leading the dev to attempt to shill out even more.

As a disclaimer, I don't care that it's a game about furries. I can enjoy any game as long as it has good content. I don't care that it's a visual novel, because frankly there are visual novels that I have enjoyed.\n\nNo, what makes me absolutely hate this game is the fact that it is a game without GAMEPLAY. The most interesting and "fun" thing you get to do is make a name for your character. Other than that, the spam the Enter key for an hour and a half, and then you're finished. The game is over. Granted, that's just the released content, and the developer has said that there'll be more, but you're paying $10 for an hour and a half of pressing one button.\n\nEvery character is a blank slate with only one facial animation. The wall of text that assaults you throughout the game is boring, uninteresting, rambles on to the point where it completely changes subjects, and is very poorly written. Almost all of the backgrounds were, no joke, taken from other websites. I will add that they were acquired legally, but is it really THAT difficult to make an environment yourself? Apparently, it is. Not to mention, there was an attempt at stealing character artwork from someone, but that artist was understandably unhappy to have that happen, and was able to have it taken out of the game.\n\nThis is my third time reviewing the game on Steam. Why? Because I initially posted a negative review, and it was immediately flagged. In fact, almost every negative review was flagged by the developer, an egotystical maniac that just so happens to be a character in the game. Not only that, the entire game revolves around him. This forced me to make an ironically good review in replacement, and make a video review where I could voice my displeasure with the game without being taken down. I won't get into the fiasco I had with the developer, Klace, which resulted in me making several Youtube videos on the subject that spread across the community and at least positively influenced the removal of flagged reviews, but the developer puts the bare minimum amount of effort into the game. Calling Major\Minor a "game" is frankly an insult to other games. Dare I say it, Ride to Hell: Retribution had better writing, graphics, music, and gameplay than this. At least Ride to Hell was enjoyable for about 15 minutes before you were ready to bash your head against a brick wall. Major\Minor has absolutely no replay value. The few choices (and I mean literally, a few) in the game are arbitrary and don't affect anything no matter what choice you make. The most influential decision you make in the game is the naming of your character, wherein other characters will call you by that name. Otherwise, spamming the enter key to read text (of which contains a good deal of grammatical and spelling errors) isn't what I'd consider fun.\n\nDo not purchase this game. Don't do it on sale, don't do it at full price, just DON'T DO IT. Don't fund this developer. Don't let his little scam get the better of you. This isn't a good game. The writing is awful, the "gameplay" is horrendous, the music is mind-numbingly awful, the art (both original and taken from the internet) is uninspiring and dull, and the story is absolutely reprehensible. Major\Minor, congratulations; you are officially the worst game ever made.","December 10, 2015","false","1.2"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","25","37","7","16"

The More I Think On It Though There Are Small Details Like The Music Which Personally I Just Muted And The Art Not Having More Than One Frame Except For One Character, But Other Than That The Writing Is The Largest Problem I Have And The Reason For The Negative Review I Wish You Luck In Future Games.\n\n\nIve Heard Of All The Reviews Getting Taken Down So Im Going To Keep This As "On Topic As Possible"\n\nI Feel That The Story Of The Game Is Incredibly Stale The Characters Lines Made Me Cringe Alot What They Say Isnt What Anyone Would Ever Say Ever.  An Example Was The Train Scene Who On Earth Doesnt Understand How A Train Works, It Moves Fast Then Stops Thats About It Nothing Scary, The Wordiness Is Obnoxious And Just Made Me Mash Enter As Fast As I Could, Example Rook Literally Defining Words For You And Explaining What Happened If You Chose The Other Option; Shouldnt That Be Left For The "Other" PlayThroughs?  The Idea Of Choice Is Kind Of Irrelevant For Example The Rook Choice How Are You Suppose To Know After Never Having To Met These People Know That They Would Rather Be Lied To.  This Is Just A Personal Gripe But I Am Really Not Into Klace Being "god" Of This Game Everyone Constantly Alludes To Him Being Some Insane PopStar Look I Get That The Universe In Which The Novel Takes Place Loves This Guy But It Honestly Is A Pretty Bad Way To Represent It Try Letting The Actions Be Shown Instead Of Having Everyone Everywhere Mention How Amazing He Is.  I Get That This Is Someone From The Furry Fandom *Which, While I Do Like Anthro Animals, I Would Not Consider Myself A Part Of; Too Much Of A Bad Name Associated And Drama When Mentioned* Wanted To Make A Game And I Admire That I Like It When People Are Active In It, What I Do Not Agree With Is The Expensive Price For One Chapter Of A Novel Which Is Poorly Put Together It Is Not Worth It At All.  The Only Reason I Ever Thought This Would Be Nice Was Because Emotes Cause Well They Are Cute And One Of Those Emotes Are Worth More Than The Game Itself.\n\nOverall Verdict:\nDont Buy Unless The Story Is Changed To Something More Tolerable And Less godmoding One Character\n\nI Do Not However Think This Novel Will Take Off As Something I Would Enjoy And It Is More As A Thing Created As Just For The Dev's To Enjoy Which Again Is Fine For Them But As A Review For Others I Recommend Staying Away From This Product It Is Not Enjoyable\n\nThis Will Be ScreenShotted And Catalogued Just In Case This Review Is SomeHow Considered "Abusive" Although I Tried To Be As Constructive As Possible","January 4","false","7.1"," 35 of 56 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","35","56","7","10"

There is no gameplay other than click to read and make choices that will present to you. If you're expecting this to be an RPG of some kind, you're sadly mistaken.\n\nIf you find heavy text boring and complain like, “It's just enter, read text, enter, read text, enter, read text...” you’re better off avoiding all Visual Novels and sparing your sanity along with sparing people from hearing you whine about what the game actually is suppose to be.\n\nIf you’re disgusted at the sight of anthro characters, well if you buy this game and complain, you’ll most likely be seen as a whiner for wasting your own money and time on a product you knew yourself wouldn’t like.\n\nReview\nI’ve been following this VN since the month it was released. At the time of this review, there are 4 chapters out. Upon one chapter after another I was getting more and more glued into it. I even made a guide regarding the choices you may see and what effects they’ll have later on down the round in your playthrough. (Warning: My guide may have minor spoilers.)\n\nThere are two stories being told: One on Earth, another on Terra. They have no direct connection with one another and I find this format very unique to me and interesting. There are at least 2 plots going on with a possible third, or so I like to believe.\n\nEvery character stands out differently from one another. The music fits in with the mood nicely and well timed with the text. Choices prompted up may trigger another one later or cause an alternate route to some degree (note my guide). You may find yourself thinking hard of what to pick whether it’s moral or philosophical to you on some choices.\n\nThere are a few things to note:\nThere are no expressions (however en route at this time). It is normal or common for VN’s to have character expressions to help the reader feel more immerse to the story and the world, but this didn’t have them initially. I wasn’t at all bothered by this, but a lot found it unease or immersion breaking.\nThere is no voice acting.\nThe VN is episodic; despite it might feel it’s Early Access. There is currently no steady schedule for chapters after people wanted expressions so badly. There will be delays in new chapters arriving for quite some time.\nThe VN is for the general audience with the occasional minor violence it portrays time to time. If you’re expecting fan service, go to Sakura series or Nekopara vol 1 and 2 (you’re welcome in advance).\nYou can’t save freely, only when prompted. However, you may see them before or after a serious choice is prompted or a serious moment happened. They are far in between, however.\nAt this time I would say wait for a sale unless you have the money to spare for the full price, or till all chapters are out.","March 31","true","14.0"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","17","31","0","2"

FURRIES LEL... this "graphic novel" if you want to call it that, actually redeemed itself thanks to the added chaptures. Although i am keenly frustrated with the kinda obvious ending. and i don't mean by story wise. the story is pretty unique in of itself. i'm just not saying what it is for the sake of spoilers. it's the cliff hangers.....\n\nthe game is going for a furry graphic novel with branching paths, that much is clear. but due to the fairly recent controversies this game carries on it's shoulders, and the cons this game carries, I can safely say that if the developer just went with the simple route of turning his content into a book that anyone could own, he could of easily avoided all of this nonsense that's lead up to this point.\n\nI understand that He was mainly going for an interactive story that can be told in a multitude of ways depending on what you, the player chooses to make. It sounds good on paper, but what he failed to realize is the little subtle details that Make graphic novels good. and that's just simple things like more expressions on the characters, or small animations attatched to the characters, you don't neccessarily NEED voice acting, but it certainly can help with the quality of the product.\n\nbeing able to have more ART effort into the game WOULD OF BEEN NICE. little distractions like those can go a long way. seriously, the art is just mainly reused busts of the characters mentioned within the game. EVEN THE GOD DAMNED ACHIEVEMENTS ARE REUSED. If that's not lazy design i don't know what is. and i'll mention this one more time....\n\nIf the developer just went with the simple Idea of turning this graphic novel into a book that anyone could read, with an interesting front page and all that. he MORE THEN LIKELY wouldn't have all these people trying to sue him. Or having people making an effort to personally attack him.\n\nwith that said, I hope the developer see's his mistakes on this journey of his and does his best to make the right decisions to not only make his content better, but to also protect himself from legal issues. The story is interesting enough to stay entertained, but I wont say it's a FANTASTIC story. it's a fairly unique one, something worth reading to pass the time, but everyone has their own tastes in stories. But as much as I know, every story out there has already been told time and time again, cliche's and or cheesyness will always be there. But not once in my own opinion did i notice any cliche's and or cheesyness. just a whole lot of confusion and questions that are unanswered.\n\nIt's totally up to you if you want to play this game. but note that it's mainly the story that keeps it held up.

Im going to be honest and not do some ballsucking either. ive been following the drama towards this games very closely since it first came out, i just want to say some of the negative reviews leave some good point (those I will cover later in this review) others are just plain stupid so here i go:\n\nIve never really played a visual novel based game before and I didnt expect any less of it ethier. Its a VISUAL NOVEL guys not a feature length game. Its very anime like espcially how it takes place in Japan for a part of it, dont expect so much. however, more dialoge options would be nice chapter 2 did pretty good with that when it came to asking the player a bunch of questions but it died down from there\n\n\nGameplay:\n\n- Controls are very easy i mean theres not much too it really HOWEVER i could not for the life of me figure out how to exi the game or choose my name, i think the controls were broken because i tried everything. so my name in the game is stuck to \"Frstname Lastname\"\n\n- Pretty lengthy dialoge which is important in a visual novel so thats good, like said in some of the negative reviews Klaces name is mentioned ALOT, but what shocked me is that  Klace died right away and i thought Klace was going to be all over this game but what a turn of events.\n\n- Interesting story i will admit chapter 1 was a total mess as the story was jumping everywhere and your player likes to bump into people quite aot as well, interesting mix of medival and modern world.\n\nCharacters:\n\n-Ok this is my biggest pet peeve. Kilas colors are REALLY bright and theres just waaay too much blue escially with the blue clothes. an outfit change should be considered for future chapters. Another character is PB there overall deisgn just doesnt fit well with the other characters as a bright pink emo bunny in a medeval setting. i know some of these are other peoples fursonas but some revising should be considered.\n\n- a nice mix of species. I was happy to see it wasnt just all canines so bravo\n\n- Very nice outfit designs. Hoever most of the males have open shirts or crop tops. Very femboy look on most of the males, this game is defiantly meant to be appealing to those who are into femboys and busty chicks with little clothing. Hwever the medeval styled outfits were very well  put together, sam reminds me of jessica Rabbit. Also Endymion reminds waaay too much of Sailor Moon as he is the prince in that anime haha\n\n- would be better if the characters had different expressions and poses. yes its quite a bit of work but for the price of this game you have to put more effort into it. I would like to see rooks pose be changed as he has the \"clamp neck tilt\" {if you watch/read any anime made by clamp you know what i mean)\n\n\nMusic is pretty good too some songs i could not stand but the rest was good. Overall if your a fan or visual novels/RPGs this is a good game for you. if your only playing because your a furry and expect a full length game then shoo.\n\n\nAlo quite frankly i dont really care if i get attacked for this review or not because i have been realizing that was happening with previous positive reviews might have gone away now im not sure.","May 31","true","1.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Expectations going in were not good. However, I know that there was a guilty, small part of me hoping this would be an enjoyable experience. It wasn't.\n-the characters are flat. No other way to describe it. The writing simply isn't good. The only character who seemed like a character was the red and black assassin guy from chapter whatever. The rest just feel 1 dimensional. ie: Rook is neurotic, Klace is perfect, the MC is a pushover.\n-the MC is in relatable. The MC is supposed to be me, right? So then why does it feel like he is constantly spouting opinionated bull that I don't agree with. Also he's a total pushover. What this game needs is a text option that lets me act like a belligerent ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI can't recommend this game in good conscience. In its current state, it's abysmal. However, it has potential.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raxyz/recommended/417990/","raxyz","Raxyz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raxyz/","440 products in account","[edit below]\nSome games just can't be simplified by "Thumbs Up" or "Thumbs Down", this is one such case. So I save "Not Reccomended" cases to games that are busted, broken, bad DLC practices, harmful policies toward customers and similar cases. Major/Minor doesn't fall into any of those categories.`\n\nSo, you're reading this to know whether you should buy it or not, let's start addressing the elephant in the room (pun kinda intended):\n-Eeewww, furry\nThis issue tend to plague a LOT of things. I've had my share of heated discussions about Dust AET or Zootopia, those are two examples of awesome games/movies that people dismiss for thinking that "it is furry". News flash, when aiming for a rated E genre, something meant for all ages, a fantasy world is required. How to better to unbind ourselves of reality than not having human-like characters? Walt Disney knew that, look at his characters. Most kids show tend to use this, it's not something new, nor it's something "furry"\nBut Major/Minor might not look like it's neutral nor like it's a kid's game, does it? Indeed, the game page adverstises that “This game stands alone as a great introduction to those who want to get a first-hand immersive experience in furry culture and furry fandom.” And that's not something it would appeal to anyone who isn't a furry. However it also says that Major/Minor is "A visual novel inspired by greats such as Steins;Gate, Tales of Symphonia and Persona 4.". If you're anything like me, you'll think this is a tall order to beat, but it'll definitely pique your curiosity.\n\nSo yes, the game is indeed "furry", if you're part of that fandom the game will easily appeal to you, but what if you're not? Then there's two cases, either you'll be the purebreed hater (which by no means will read any review marked as "Reccomended", making this part pretty pointless) or the regular guy who doesn't care about "furry fandom" and neither having anthro characters. Believe it or not, this is where I am. I mentioned Zootopia and Dust because those are two things I love, and it angers me people dismissing it due to having anthropomorphic characters, no one cares about the beautiful story, artworks, characters or moral lessons in those, only how they look. That's just sad.\n\nBut I'm deviasting from the topic at hand. For those who do not consider themselves furries, and would have no interest in a visual novel just because of a specific fandom, how does Major/Minor fares? It definitely doesn't come close to the overall quality P4, Steins Gate or Tales of Symphonia has, but there are clear references of it in the game. Think of it like this, if you've played any of those, odds are your brain thought of some "branches" that weren't explored in the games. This game's developer gathered those ideas and made his own game. But how does it compare to those other games? There's some clear references, right in the beggining of the game, you'll be greeted into the Velvet Room Ark and not much longer after that you'll know about the MidnightChannel Murders. At that point I wondered if I was about to play a furry re-telling of Persona, but not long after that the game took a drastic turn, taking you to another world entirely. After 3 hours into the Novel, I can say that the story references those games while being it's own thing.\n\nThe problem of a Visual Novel, is that you don't really know whether it's good or not until you've read the whole history, and I'm not there yet. But here's what I CAN say about it:\nTL;DR+ Does a good job using aspects of other stories while still being original\n+ Story branches are very well done, not every VN can make such radical changes at how the branches play out.\n+ OST is catchy. Some VN's are plagued by annoying songs, however that does vary from people to people.\n+ Good diversity of characters. (Personally, it reminded me of Borderlands 2)\n- Character artwork is a bit awkward at first glance\n- No characters animations/emotions, meaning sometimes they break some sad news to you while smirking. It breaks the immersion a little.\n- No custom saves or interims. Meaning the game decides when to save for you.\n- Quick text skip is still too slow if you're re-doing large sections\n\nSo the bottom line is: I suppose this game is great if you're interested in the furry fandom, disposable if you outright hate it. And if you're somewhere in between, liking VNs while not caring about being furry or not, try the demo first (Demo is no longer around. I wrote this review after playing 3~4 hours in it. Now it's gone). I intend to update this review after completing the game, to say whether the story is worth it or not.\n\nEDIT: So far the game only has 5 chapters, and that's not very far into the story I'd bet. Color me impressed though, it REALLY grabbed my interest. I love stories that drop a ♥♥♥♥♥torm after another, reminds me of the book series Escape from Furnace, not a single dull moment. Though be wary of cliffhangers, the story isn't finished yet. So far I'm liking the story.","April 29","true","4.7"," 24 of 47 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","24","47","3","5"

That kind of game you can't stop playing once you've started.

And they are clearly not as black and white as it may seem at the beginning.\nIt seems to have a lot of replayability too, because of the different choices you can make all along the way, but that I won't verify until the whole story is out, since I want to keep my first feeling choices all along on my first playthrough.\n\nAnd another bonus point, the art and music are gorgeous and make the story really immersive.\nPerhaps it would be even more if the characters' artworks, or at least the small portraits in the text boxes were give multiple expressions/emotions, but I can understand how difficult it is, and not all visual novels have that, so it doesn't tarnish the experience anyway.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent game, and I hope the next chapters will be out soon.","June 2","true","5.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

You pass through various characters, face different choices, a common example being chosing a name for your character.All the while trying to save both the Worlds.You make various friends who give you options as to what should you be doing next, and you must choose.\n\nThe real problem of this game starts with the choices.For they ultimatley lead to nothing.No matter what choice you make, you go through the same rigid storyline. Where nothing changes,you meet the same fate you are supposed to just like the other player online like you.However it is mentionable, that the game is episodic. In essence you recieve a new chapter every month.\n\nYou start off in Tokyo subway make your way through the grander scheme of things,and no matter what choices you make you end up meeting the same fate just like the next person.Its supposed to be a visual classic but it fails to implement the term infinitesimal number of endings , in the gaming genre.Thats why its a grand failure.As you make your way through to the end you meet various characters like Endymion,Kila but no matter what choices they give you the outcome is always the same.\n\nThere is potential rather was potential in this game,but its negetivities ruins it\n\nPros\n\n+ Full of furry creatures(if you are into furries!)\n+ Episodic gameplay\n+ Smooth music\n\nCons\n_ Lack of alternate endings to a situation\n_ Rigid storyline\n_ The characters lack depth\n_ The game play could have been more well presented\n_ Developers negetive actions\n_ Its overpriced\n\nAll in all even if you love furry animals, stay away from this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/56564/recommended/417990/","56564","Foxe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/56564/","27 products in account","Okay. This game is very intresting and it's really holding my intrest. It's nerve racking and keeps me on the edge of my seat. This game is amazing to the story to the art. I believe the story needs some work, not because of the things that you do but it get's very confusing. I try my best to not make mistakes but still, I can't see to detrime which side is right. There's a thing called a "Ark" and it's basically the main source of the game. It's confusing and makes me second guess myself. When I play like this, I stop thinking that they're AI and start to think everything I do, act, and say will affect my desions. I wish there was more desions to be made on the game because it's leaking you chose what will happen. I'm on chapter 5 and the plot just becomes more complicated. The game is overall good and I would play it again to get make the oppisite choices. The game does have it's problems for example, not enough choices. I wish there was in the later chapter because we're the player. The person that's going through the game and we shouldn't feel like as if I'm just some guy that's there. A guy that can't say sh*t and just sit there like "Um....Yeah....Let's go with that." I want to be the guy who decides what I want to say and some of the text is just "..." and that's by almost EVERY character. You can not save your game manually. It appears at random points asking you if you want to save it. I want to save it manually but also want that system to be there. The game is great with the plot, the confussion, and second guess your self...BUT! This is not a game I say would be a "Story telling" game. It's more like a movie that you choose at random points. I want to have a choice say whether I should keep my mouth shut or speak up. I also want to type what I'll say and read the text from them. This game is good none the less with the problems it has. Overall the game deserves a 7/10. It's nice to play and I know this is early beta. I want them to them to fix this or when the game does finish and it still has all these problems, it'll be a much lower score. I'm not asking for much but get us to choose what'll happen at certain points such as the office in chapter 5. I mean inside the office. I get what you're doing but I want to say something there and I want to protest what he's going to do. Maybe that will come up in the later chapter and all that. I won't till then.

I had only just started the first chapter and I found myself interested in the story. While it does feel a lot like Persona 4, it has enough to seperate it for the moment. The soundtrack is pretty good, and it does seem memorable, and it tends to match the tone of the scenes. The art style is beautiful, atleast to me, and the characters are interesting to meet and understand.\n\nOne problem is I feel like the first chapter was slightly rushed a bit, as you basically go from getting of the train, meeting new people and then the first victim, who ends up being important to the story, dies. It makes me feel as though I missed something or did something wrong, like maybe there was a hidden path I could have taken, but I just haven't found it. It may just be me though because I'm always looking for secrets and alternate paths to unlock things or keep optional characters alive. Another problem the game has is that not all of the characters don't have their other sprites in the game yet, so when it says something like "He seems defeated" and it shows the character's happy face, it can feel weird.\n\nLast of all, I did learn about the past incidents with reviews for this game, and I did read Klace's apology, and to be honest, game development is never an easy concept, and I know that from my own personal experience. This game has a lot of potential and I believe he can do it.\n\nTL;DR: Overall this game is actually pretty fun and it can definitely keep you immersed, in my opinion. I will admit that it does have a few problems, it doesn't overall always affect the gameplay, and while 10$ might be somewhat steep, you can always refund it if you don't like it.","May 18","true","2.4"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","10","22","0","2"

This game has not delivered, not one bit\n\nFirst before I go on my tirade I would like to apologize for my initially positive review, it was skewed by previous playings of dating sims and interactive novels to fully realise that this "self-insert fan-fic I am so damn special look at me like mummy and daddy never did" was never anything but a waste of pixels and hardrive space, and I apologize for having convinced anyone if they even did to play this game.\n\nAnd now for the main event, my angst and outrage.\nAs some of you know this game was released on December of 2015 as an interactive story, something in the veins of any of Kevin Gold's games but with a twist in the form of parralel dimensions and what was originally talked up in the first and second chapters as a big doomsday event. What we have however is a sad misunderstanding of how you make a game, allow me to elaborate the point of a game is to introduce a main character in this case you the player like so many others. Then the second step is to throw challenges, questions, and the odd special event where they get to do something relatively "Groovy" as the kids nowadays say. Such is not the case with this game as it openly tries to take focus away from the main character and shine it on all the unfortunate side characters, we get it they're all so special and unique, but while I'm sitting here in bum#$%^ main character limbo with nothing to do or even interact with besides reading how some wanna be rockstar is now going to be the main event for the tour and how she totally isn't a relatively nice person. Well #$%^ you woman, I'm the bloody main character I should be front and center, how am I supposed to stay emersed in the bloody narative when you lot decide that the #$%^ing spotlight should be on some random dragon looking man-♥♥♥♥♥ discussing security measures.\n\nThe game seems to be suffering from what can only be described as "Taking to long to set up the board", I get it you wanna introduce loads of mentaly challenged bounce boards and self-inserts, and that's fine in moderation. But when half the bloody game is everyone else doing things without you to set up an easy ending or their own issues is pretty bad. When a character needs to be introduced, introduce them to the main character, have them go through their troubles with them, how else am I supposed to get attatched to your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed mary sue when you keep throwing me in bum#$%^ limbo.\n\nAll this ranting about characters points out another glaring hole in the game, the characters, namely the main one. You do not even truly describe yourself or your appearance till chapter 3ish and even then it's along the lines of a "Yes I will help" or "No let the baby drown". I don't even know what I bloody look like, and it's even worse when your main character acts like a gibbering imbecile, I swear the dialouge options for your character are the worst, just let us answer the querries and make the talks damn you, I don't care about some lame ♥♥♥ pun that "I" supposedbly just came up with. When you compare this dialouge with that of the other characters however that's when things make sense. In actual fact the main character isn't your's, never has been never will be they're just another side character to everyone else, you can write yourself better than anyone else, which is why most of these games feature a mostly silent protaganist.\n\nnow to sum up my poorly worded grammatical splurge that I won't even dare to call an essay, this game is bad, in five months you expect a story to go somewhere, or at least to have some manner of attention on your character besides a sideways glance.","January 18","false","3.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","7"

You learn that you have been granted the power of saving and loading the game, which makes you a very important person. The story quickly gets more complex and never fails to surprise.\n\nMost of the game is spent reading dialogue over illustrations of the scene and characters, while occasionally making game-affecting decisions. The character designs and the accompanying artwork are cute and well made, but perhaps not everybody's cup of tea. I found it charming!\n\nThe game has been called a dating sim, but I'm sad to say that thus far, five chapters in, Major\Minor hasn't provided me with a virtual animal boyfriend. Fortunately, I find myself quite hooked on the bizarre story, and I'm constantly interested and excited to see what happens next.\n\nThis game appeals most to quite a niche audience, but if you're into furries and visual novels, go for it!","April 26","true","9.8"," 16 of 36 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","16","36","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKingOfSilverFoxes/recommended/417990/","TheKingOfSilverFoxes","Scier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKingOfSilverFoxes/","10 products in account","As of the this review, only the first chapter has been posted for play. This review is only for Chapter 1.\n\nAs far as visual novels go, this one is pretty standard. You do a lot of reading, make a dialogue choice every so often, and move through diverging story paths accordingly. This game is nothing out of the ordinary, save for perhaps it's furry covering.\n\nI notice a lot of people complaining about the graphics. I myself think the characters look good. However, not all of the characters have different art for their different emotions. After a single playthough, it seems only one has multiple expressions. Adding more for each character would be a major boost to this game, putting it more in line with other VNs.\n\nThe story is nice so far. Each character introduced in the first chapter develops and gives motivations as the story progresses. The overarching story is touched on a bit, but enough to drive interest in the future of it.\n\nOne complaint I have is that it seems to summarize itself a bit often. At the end of the chapter, it gives you a recap of each choice you made. While this is fine for chapter one, given that players might just be learning the style of gameplay, I'd hope that they are more subtle for future chapters.\n\nDespite it being early in the game's story, I must say I enjoyed it to this point. I'm looking forward to future updates, and I hope they add more art for each character as the game is updated. If they stick to an update a month as promised, the price will be well worth it. As it stands, $10 is a bit much for a one hour playthrough.","December 28, 2015","true","0.9"," 16 of 36 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","16","36","0","9"

Yes I'm a furry, but I can control that bias.  And honestly, how many people looking at this game aren't furry?  It's kinda like who would look at a game like Sakura Spirit other than people who like anime?\n\nAnyway getting on track.  By the reviews I read going in I was expecting something a lot worse.  It's definitely not great, but it's not bad either.  Here's what there is to say:\n\nEDIT:  There's been some updates, so cutting out old complaints that don't count anymore.\n\n\n* Volume Trouble - Maybe most people won’t' have this problem, but this game at 100% was way to loud.  However it gets lowered by 20% intervals.  %20 was probably good if you're doing this on your own.  But for Let's Playing it was still too loud.  I don't think it's too difficult to add a slider or more intervals to choose from, so hopefully that will be patched.  So I had to put it to zero and play my own music, which was unfortunate because I heard the music was actually good in this game.\n\n* Bit Cliche - Avoiding spoilers.  The setting is you're an English speaker traveling to Toyko for the first time.  Japan is just so overdone in visual novels.  There's a lot of interesting places in the world, we don't have to keep going there guys.  Also I was able to guess plot points before it happened, which is not a great sign either.\n\n* Choices a Little Arbitrary - It was worse on release but its been adjusted a little bit since.  In a nutshell the first choice you encounter in the came is a really trivial thing, letting someone know if you're going to be late or not.  I decided to be honest and say I might be late.  Originally the game really hounded me for that, even at the end with a recap it was almost acting like I might lose the overall game because of it.  It was toned down with an update, but the guy I told I'd be late too still hates it way more than I think is realistic, even for the most anal person.\n\n* The Art is Good - I listed all the bad, so here's the one good thing.  The character art is awesome.  I’d personally love to have my character drawn by that artist.  However, unfortunately...\n\n* No Animation - Yeah animation is hard work.  Now I don't expect full motion all the time or anything like that.  I mean just, less like animation and more just, extra frames.  Other visual novels have frames drawn of the characters with differant emotions on their faces for when they feel them.  I feel that its not that much to ask for to have that.  It would also be nice to have an occasional full screen art for important events.  Sakura Spirit or Hunie Pop at least reward you time to time with that. [Note:  Extra facial expressions was promised for future updates.]\n\n\nSo you might be asking, why with all those problems am I still giving a thumbs up?  Well I can't in my right conscious thumbs down a game that's not finished.  Yes it says it's out of early access but given the monthly patch system to give the rest of the story it's not a complete package.  So I'll treat it like a Early Access.  Maybe this review will be read and they will fix what I explained here.  I think it has the potential to be amazing if they did.\n\nIf you want to see more of the game before making a decision, I'm Let's Playing it.

Currently in its infancy, two out of twelve total chapters is currently released, but I see a lot of potential here! Can't wait to see how many ways the story can unfold!\n\nUpdate: Chapter two was released the other day, and the promise of a changing interactive story began to unfold. What really had my attention (caution: Potential spoiler) was the inclusion of the character census, which allowed you diversify the actions your character would make in the future chapters. One of them (though would almost seem redundant to ask if you were the character asking it) would ask you which gender you were, to eliminate the genderless pronouns, i.e "they" when referring to you (It would've made more sense to add this selection at the beginning of the game when naming your character).\nOther questions would start branches that would have future effects on the story narrative, such as which actions you would take in the coming chapters, based on your character's claimed personality.\n\nSo far, I was more impressed with this chapter than the previous one, as some more exciting scenes began to show up and the story begins taking some darker turns.","January 10","true","17.0"," 32 of 70 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","32","70","0","44"

Its a beautifully made game for the first two Episodic chapters. I wish I could have my character Xander (a red and blue) dragon put into it, but I don't have the skills or the resources to get a good picture of him to get into this amazing game. Though if you don't like the art style or the choice of the type of "spiecies" the developers had decided to use. Then please give it a try and if you don't like it ask for a refund, but I gerentie that you will not, because the game has lots of good vibes coming from it.\n\nThe game itself is well put together, emotional, impacting on the player, and over all mysterious! I love how I can put my name in the game and have it be me! I love the machinic of the "Power" you have, and I can't find out who I can trust and not trust! It is so much a mind exploding conumdrum of thoughts and action I have to take to avoid certain actions that could end up ending badly. I wish for those thinking of getting this game to really give it a good go! I can't wait till the next chapter comes out Next month.\n\nMy likes about the game are pretty much described above. I love the characters, I love the emotions it gives me, I love the thoughts and feelings I have for the characters. Nothing about this game is bad! But there is one thing I wish, if I could choose what my character looks like. That is my only thing I wish for the game, which is so minor (haha sorry) that it would most likely go unnoticed. Furthermore, The game really nails it when it comes to the story, I haven't stopped thinking about it, even at 3:46 AM. But lets move on, the game is all very good and has all rights to continue and I wish it too! Please support the developers and the artists that pour their hearts into what they love! If I could ask to have my character put in I would in a heartbeat!\n\nPlease give this game a look and don't hold back on letting yourself get immersed into a world of dark mystories and wonderful secrets. I wonder who that lady was that you bump into in the first chapter... WHO IS SHE!?!?!?","January 28","true","7.2"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","11","27","0","0"

I have gotten a game that is as, if not more ,immersive as morenatsu. When I play i really get a sense of belonging in the game. Being the severely picky gamer I am, it is very hard for me to find good games to keep me enticed long enough for me to set aside an extended period of time into playing. The visuals are stunning and the latest update has me gazing in wonder at the great art work. Shiva has done a great job fleshing out these characters with a unique look and style. Every fur on the screen is very visually appealing to look at without a single dislike.\n\nThe soundtrack at the starting menu is perfect for getting you psyched up to play the game. Every time it meets my ears, the sense of adventure intensifies (insert lame meme joke). As someone who avidly listens to music wherever he goes I can honestly say it is a breath of fresh air to hear something original and unique. Maybe release it on ITunes?\n\nAnother noticeable aspect is the writing good god I am in lov with writing style. It is funny, intense, saddening, and downright wonderful. You can really feel the emotions of the characters in this game to quite a profound point. Lots of them are very relatable such as Rook, the ferret obessed with order and his trusty tablet. He has a sharp tongue which often leads to him being misunderstood, However, deep down he is a gentle soul that just needs some love and attention.\n\nThere are tons of people out there that are like that. I know quite a few of them. Seeing that in this game gave it a new layer of depth for me. Something I can relate to  in real life as well as the game puts an entirely differnet outlook on the experience. But, I digress.\n\nMajor/Minor is an outstanding entry in the fandom and for visual novels over all. My few gripes would probably be the occasional dialogue error or grammar screw up. That being said, recent patches have fixed those problems mostly.\n\nMy final rating for this game is a 10/10. If you are a furry, you will love this game. If you are a fan of visual novels, you will love this game. If you love games, you will love the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.","January 20","true","10.0"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","11","27","2","45"

Nonetheless, not like it says this is an early access review, because while it should be labeled as such.. It's not. While there's no bugs as far as I've seen, there's plenty of grammar mistakes as well as simple things like spelling some words incorrectly and a good handful of clichés.\n\nMajor/Minor is a game that can get your attention and hold it, does it have the most firm grip? Nah. Despite making my choices, I felt like my 'Character' was more... Flat. Nonetheless, the rest of the characters are indeed characters, they are each different and unique of themself, some are more strange than others, some are more serious, so why they insist on putting you with possibly the most serious character and the least serious in the first chapter is beyond me.\n\nThis game is pretty okay, it was gifted to me, was not certain what to expect from it.. But honestly? It needs work. This game is not worth the ten bucks that it is right now though. Ten bucks is worth something like this as a final product, but ten bucks for a single chapter that we have to wait a full month for the next? The one chapter we did have was.. Pretty short. There's not a lot, and what is there need some polish, however I digress.\n\nThis is a pretty okay game, but I suggest just putting it on your wish list and returning to it in the future, checking in with the reviews.. Should you have to for this game? Nah, but if you're genuinely interested in playing this, then yes. Can't post the review without a recommendation and leaving it in the middle, so, in terms of my scale I'd say it leans towards a "yes".","December 29, 2015","true","0.9"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","10","25","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049006358/recommended/417990/","76561198049006358","Adept Omega","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049006358/","206 products in account","After some deliberation, I am giving this a reluctant thumbs up, with the caveat that this game isn't going to do so much for a person who's not already head-deep in the furry fandom. There are a few issues, but I see potential here.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the game is updating on a chapter-by-chapter basis, and was originally released only as Chapter I. As of this writing, Chapters I, II, and III are now in the game, and the developer plans to add more and has been improving content based on feedback. Don't come in expecting a complete narrative arc, but if nothing else consider it the equivalent of a seasonal pass to game content.\n\nI feel that the setting and overarching narrative pose a great deal of interest, and could be better realized by sharpening weaknesses in prose and dialogue. The actual setting concept, the situation the main character finds themselves in, the twists - I enjoyed those aspects very much. I also appreciate the developer's use of gender-neutral dialogue in the early game, and was a bit surprised that the gender question came up as late as chapter 2.\n\nThe prose and dialogue, as mentioned, need work. This includes some segments where the game feels the need to spell out lines of reasoning redundantly (An example from early in the game: "Before? I thought he said this was his first time on a train. That statement just now seems to imply otherwise."), and occasionally the use of "it's" in situation that calls for "its." There are also times where I feel the game is pushing a little too hard to decide players' reactions for them – after meeting the first two characters in Chapter I and garnering first impressions of them, I was rather taken by one, and found the other a too naïve. My character’s internal monologue seemed rather biased against the character I was interested in pursuing as a romantic / friend interest – and after replaying the game, it seems like a lot of the internal reactions play into the assumption that the player planned to visit the maid café with the first character. The result I’ll internally go ‘Thank god, Rook actually said what I was thinking, and I like that he’s honest and straightforward’ and my character will internally go ‘Wow, Rook is blunt and rude! That must just be his nature I guess…’\nThe game gets better about this in later chapters, but doesn’t ever quite shake the tendency.\n\nThe game has excellent art assets. Currently characters are static, but the developer has commissioned an expanded set of expressions, which will do a lot to enhance the quality of the game. The aesthetics and character designs are decidedly very 'furry' in ways that most games with anthropomorphic characters usually aren't (think bizarre fur colors, large expressive eyes, heterochromatic eyes, atypical species), but I'm a sucker for that stuff, and I imagine that the target audience will be people who embrace that characteristic of the game as well. Whoever they're hiring for this, they're good, and I look forward to seeing what the expanded poses / reaction images will do to bring these characters to life!\n\nA few gameplay / input suggestions for improvement: If a simple menu could be added to the corner of the screen to give access to save and quit functions, it would enhance the gameplay experience significantly. Currently, the game allows a soft reset with F5, but it's very hit or miss whether mashing / holding escape will bring up a menu that allows me to quit or create a new save, or whether it will instead power through dialogue at lightning speed. Because the game explicitly encourages savescumming, it would also be useful to make it easier to scroll through dialogue-heavy segments without accidentally registering a hit when a player decision comes up; on replays, I've had to reload multiple times because holding 'A' on my controller or 'ESC' on the keyboard would immediately power through a player decision box (frequently the choice I had decided to revisit in the first place). It represents a similar problem for save slots – when the save screen pops up as it occasionally does between legs of the plot, if you’re still holding A it will automatically override the most recent save, similar to the dialogue option problem above.\n\nWhat I found strong about the game as it currently exists (2/16/16): it has good art assets, a good setting, the characters have distinct personalities, and despite all of the misgivings above I found myself playing it from start to finish in a single session. The developer has done a great job of drumming together great artistic and musical talent, they've created an engaging setting, and although the prose and dialogue can be weak at times, the plot is solid. Despite everything said above I will be waiting with bated breath to see how the plot continues to develop, and hope that the promising beginning develops into an involved plot that explores the characters we've met and helps us to understand their motivations, how they tick, and the world they live in better. And I'll be waiting to see if future updates will give me the opportunity to date my sweetheart Rook, who despite things I've learned in a different timeline is still my endearingly straightforward crush.\n\nGood luck, Minor/Major team! I'm legitimately looking forward to the continuing installments of the game.","February 16","true","8.4"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","10","25","0","1"

It's interesting so far and as it's only the first episode it may really unfold into something bigger.\nMusic - I swear this eerie theme always gave me creeps when it started playing. Music fits the scenes and builds up the athmosphere as it should! Good job there!\nChoices really matter - Ya decide something and ya face the consequences!\nCharacters - Welp... this may be personal, but every character here has its own motives and well... character. Of course some may be more cliché than others thus they may be less interesting but for me the characters were fine and distinctive in their own way.\nCharacter Design - It's wonderful. The characters are awesomely drawn, they are distinctive and colorful so you can really hook your sight on them while taking break from reading.\n\nCons:\nLack of choices - This depends on what level of interactivity you expect. I really like the fact that your choices really matter though it bothers me that there are so few of them. I hated when two characters were talking with each other and my hero was just standing there when I'd like to take part in this conversation too! Another situation was when I made my choice, walked to some place and then dialog moved to some point where I was just presented with message saying that my character agreed, asked something or stuff like that.... I'd really like to choose what my hero would say in situation like that.\nLength of the episode - It's sad. I tried out different choices and replayed the game three times. It took me about hour and a half. It's too short and I hope that the upcoming episode will be much longer.\nFiller Text - It's not that common but sometimes your characters thoughts just go on and on needlessly. Like I said it's not so frequent but I had a moment or two when I just wanted to spam-click it only to get the action going. Inner dilemmas are fine but not for too long.\n\nWelp... Major\Minor in my opinion is not that bad as some of the negative reviews says. Hah I say it's good as for its early state!\n\nThe whole thing depends on what you are expecting from it. If you expect that the first chapter will be a long story, with new choices around every corner and with new character every minute you'll be disappointed.\nThe first chapter really serves as a  prologue. It shows ya characters, gives them a lil' bit of developement and presents you part of main plot that ya'll be diggin' in the next episode. If ya expect just that ya won't be dissapointed.\n\nThe only thing we can do now is wait for new episode.","December 29, 2015","true","13.2"," 21 of 48 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","21","48","2","22"

In fact, it's hard to call it a "game," per say. It has the feeling of a visual novel, created in what seems like an RPG maker software, but has the whole, "your actions will decide your fate." And by that I mean the game changes based on your choices. And to say the least, all these factors put into one "game" is different to me. But that's not to say that it's bad, the exact opposite really.\nI love games that allow you the choice for you to "forge your own path," if you get what I'm saying. And altough I'm not a huge fan of visual novels, I was strangley entranced by this. Not only that, but the use of anthropomorphic animals (or, Furries, if you will) was a nice take on things. Most visual novels I've come across are mainly based on anime/ manga characters.\nAnd not only that, the art is amazing! The characters look great and the use of backgrounds fits beautifully. The only real problem I have is the sound effects, which don't always fit too well with the scenario. With that aside, the story is rather nice, and the novel is portrayed greatly.\nIf you're like me and are looking for a visual novel that alters based on your desicions, has great art and story and fun characters, I'd definetly reccomend this.","February 16","true","0.6"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","9","23","0","4"

M/M was released in December and honestly, from what's been added so far, the potential for the deveolopment of this game is infinite!\n\nThe characters, story, and interactions you engage in during the course of events within M/M make things seem almost real, as if you, as the player, are actually taken to Terra. Each person you run into is unique and everyone seems to have ties with everyone else, and (at least, when this review is written), there's no signs of the bottom of the rabbit hole yet. So many story elements have been considered and worked into the game carefully, making this a truly unique experience for fans of the story driven game genre.\n\nOverall, the game itself is interesting, the story is left at a cliff-hanger (at least, for now) that leaves you begging for more, and all of the character dialogue is well thought out.

I've played alot worse than this. Little tip though, try adding just a bit of backstory to characters along the way. The characters seem to be a bit thrust up into your face without much context of what or where they were before. Much like that one character who was mentioned to be Klace's brother. He was there for one line, and that was it, just kinda confused me.\n\nSecondly, the writing is kinda same old same old. The story is probably written by now but still, it'd be nice to see a little something different and unexpected from it.

I read the description and didn't think I would want it that bad, but since it was the only truly furry game I had seen on Steam i decided to wishlist it. Then recently I discovered it had profile backgrounds and emotions so I checked those out on the market and realized most were more than the actual game. So i bought it without any real high hopes. So since i expected nothing I was pleasantly surprised by the amazing art and interesting story. I've been interested in parallel universe stuff for a while and I got pretty excited when I realized part way through that its what the game was about.\nI am a little disappointed with the story not actually being completed yet, but at least the new episodes don't make us pay more so that's nice i guess. I also wish the characters at least had a few more expressions. Seems like so far only the girl at the cafe has more than one. I think its awesome that this is officially on the store and everything. It's gotta be one of, if not the first totally furry game on Steam. Can't wait to see how it turns out, keep up the good work guys!","February 27","true","8.8"," 21 of 49 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","21","49","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/valenastrasz/recommended/417990/","valenastrasz","Valenastrasz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/valenastrasz/","173 products in account","Well for starters this review might have most if not all of its content mentioned by someone somewhere in past reviews but even so now that i finished first 3 chapters i feel the need to point few things out. Firstly i am huge fan of visual novels, i have played quite a few and Major/Minor despite it's flaws has great potential. So i'll start with the most important thing to a visual novel aside from visual aspect, the story. For starter there is this aura of mystery that from one point is very cool until the point it makes you feel like its overcompensating for lack of character development. Some things are just being thrown around to fill in the blanks. Here it seems like writter/s attempted to make story more interesting by adding plot twists on every turn, just when you think you figured it out it turns around 180* degrees and makes you reconsider everything so far. It just seems very forced to me and while no story ever is perfect i would love to see more tact and smoother transitions. Because after first or second, for some, plot twist you start to expect it and it boggles down your choices making it seem like no matter what you pick you won't be comfortable with the choice for the current playtrough. Which brings me down to second flaw, the save and skip system. It's crude and leaves lot to be desired. For a visual novel ability to skip parts over converstations that you've already read multiple times while trying different choices is one of important factors and the sluggishness showed here is one big minus from me. Also the saves seem more like pre-designated checkpoints at irregular intervals, and no menu during the storytelling is seriously limiting. Especially since the "feature" of the game, so called rollback essentially forces you to quit to main menu and load the previous checkpoint save. It needs a LOT of polish there and it seriously needs to implement ability to save game when you want  at least from my perspective. It would give a lot more fexiblity to the gameplay along with improved skip feature. I could drone on and but this review when i look at it seems to be turning into unsatisfied moaning at some point and i hate that so i will just narrow it to pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Story has great potential\n- The furry note is a refreshing one\n- Art is cute\n- Price is affordable in comparsion to some other titles\n\nCons:\n- Story tends to be forced, at some points lacks fluidity\n- Some game mechanics are completly lacking and one it does have can get frustrating at some point\n- Needs more options\n\nIn short this could be refreshing visual novel with great potential if few things are tweaked and more focus was added. Quality over quantity :)\n\nAt the end this is just my own personal opinion, some will disagree, some will partially or completly agree, some will put it on a pyre but i felt i said what needed to be said. I hope to see more of this Novel. Peace out :>","February 27","true","3.3"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","9","25","0","3"

First chapter was a little bland and felt a little rushed into the whole paranormal Ark scene but I can forgive that, I write stories as well and I know how hard a good intro can be and how difficult it can get to get things moving. After I got through the first chapter I thought I already had everything figured out (Klace faked his death to stop media barage being an example) but once I got to chapter two I was thrown for a bit of a loop. Now in chapter two there are so many more characters that have been introduced with much more personality and in all honesty I really want to learn more about these characters. Even if you're not a furry I reccomend you at least try out the first two chapters and if you don't like it go for a refund (I personally rather you didn't but hey your money).","January 13","true","14.9"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","8","23","0","4"

This review will be ignoring all of that.*\n\nI enjoyed this game very much. I got it at a little bit of a sale, $6.99, and I feel that in another episode or two, it will warrent it's current pricetag. The art is fantastic. It is some of the best I have seen in the genre and style. The story has some similarities with Persona 4, as a few other reviews have mentioned, but it is headed in a different direction altogether. I am satisfied with the amount I spent and I would reccommend the game to others. If you are the cautious type, wait until another couple episodes are released to buy, just to be sure. Otherwise, the I welcome the first Furry Visual Novel to Steam. May it live long and prosper.\n\n(At one episodes released)\nStory: 7.5/10 (incomplete, more episodes pending.)\nArt: 9/10 (Fantastic. Unblurred background art would be nice at times though.)\nEntertainment: 8/10\nReplay Value: 7/10 (Choices at present yield a lot of time spent rereading dialogue with a semi-clunky save system rather than something like a branching diagram which would show the player how much they have seen of the choices available and allow the player to jump to that point to experience only the new content, rather than rereading a lot of unskippable dialogue.)\n\nTLDR: Great VN.

As much as I love VNs, the music featured tends to make me sleepy without fail. I ended up continuing it promptly before it ended and then I realized how short it is. Not a bad game for what's out now although I'm not too sure how to feel about the main protag--They seem like the stereotypical Japanese VN main char tbh, which I'm not sure if that was intentional?? If so it's a bit overdone imo but it helps give the feel of a VN--to me, at least. I suppose it also fits as possible realistic reactions to the situations at hand. Good music and decent art (if you're into the anime kinda style). I look forward to seeing where the story goes.

I hit the point where I spent too much time on being able to refund it, so I kinda just decided to keep going with playing the game. And you know what? It surely is very cheesy and bad in the beginning and I also don't understand why every single character has to be super duper colorful and all that, especially on Terra (where the hell did they get dye?)\nAll that aside though, as I decided to keep going through the game, it's...actually not half bad. The choices actually get kinda dicey, and you get to be pretty nervous about your choices when the foreshadowing is shown. Not sure why other people are getting irritated about the lack of animation, it is a visual novel after all, they cant all be like the glorified Nekopara. Also I see a lot of people are being pretty quit to judge, seeing as a lot of people's play times are under an hour. My suggestion is that if you give this game a chance it actually has a bit to offer and does get better and throws around some good drama. You can take it from me, after all I bought the game thinking right away that I wasn't going to like it.

I did this for two reasons, i just finished a book and was in the "Oh God, I Gotta Start Another Book" Phase, and Im a furry, and will fully support any furry content created.\n\nMy first play-through of the game was interesting. I never have played a game like this before and thoroughly enjoyed my time spent reading and making some hard choices. This alone was a whole new atmosphere for me. I have never been able to make decisions in a novel before. Despite some negative reviews, i thoroughly enjoyed the storyline. I like the characters i have met so far, and cant wait to see what happens in the next chapter.\n\nI know the Devs are facing a lot of adversity with this title. Furries get a bad rap as is. On the internet they are hated twice as much. But now here is a game on the internet putting you in a furry world! I believe the main developer (I believe his name is Klace) Is not only a brilliant writer, but very VERY brave.\n\nIn conclusion\nIm really looking forward to the next chapter, and cant wait to make more tough decisions. Don't make your decision on buying the game based on a few negative reviews. After all, a story is written a chapter at a time and each turn of a page  brings you closer to something amazing. And i have a feeling this will be no different\n\n~Lulu","January 7","true","2.6"," 9 of 28 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","9","28","0","14"

But honestly, I actually really enjoyed the firs chapter and want more! The negitive comments im seeing just are missing the point.\n\nBut in my honest opinion, everyone being so harsh about this game is quite annoying. Is it the best? No, but its not the worst either. Its pretty good! Again, I think a lot of people are just missing the point.\n\nNow, i do agree with other reviews on some of points, I would just say wait before buying this game. Don't buy it right now in the state that its in. But keep an eye on it! I see this game has a LOT of potential! wait for a few more chapters.\n\nI am reading the other reviews and it makes me kind of sad to see how they are tearing it apart, but they are not looking at it for all of its potential.\nYes there is poor character development, not many choices, and blah blah. But there is just so much this game can become and is going to become. And instead of tearing it down we should SUPPORT it so it can become a great game.\nI think a lot of people need to realize, this is ONE chapter. There is still improvement that can be made. Not only that but this is a graphic novel and most graphic novel games (at least all the ones I have played) have started out this way. You just met new people, you're in a new place, certainly there is going to be a lot of text and not much explanation. They wanted to create suspense so you will want more. The writing could have been portrayed better yes, but again improvement will come to the best games. I personally enjoyed the story.\nAnd another thing people keep saying is how bad the characters are, but I don't believe this is true. Again, YOU JUST MET THEM. Of coerce they are going to be flat, they haven't had much development yet. I find them to be interesting. I WANT to learn more about them. Why do they act this way? Why do they enjoy what they enjoy? This is THE FIRST CHAPER. Most graphic novel games do start out without much to look at, we are just getting into the story. Hell if you watched the trailer to the game you would notice you haven't even met over half of the characters yet. In time, we will learn more and I don't think there would be this much hate to a character that we don't even truly know yet. Give it time.\n\nThis is a new game, I love the idea since I myself am a furry I have wanted a game like this. I personally am indifferent to HOW the characters look, but the art here is WONDERFUL. I do agree that there could be more emotional pictures of each character so that were there would be less text explaining how they look and more about dialog and what's going on. I think that's a improvement for the future. When i was reading reviews I did see one of the developers comment that they planned to add emotions on the faces, maybe that would give people less to read as they went though the story.\n\nThe soundtrack isn't bad ether, it could be better but its not a bad start.\n\nAll in all, I think this is a GREAT start to a wonderful game that just needs time to improve itself, and to the developers and artist, great job working and publishing this. It must have been hard. I'm sorry so many people are harsh and just don't see the potential growth this game can and WILL have. So to that, I wish you good luck. Take what we are saying and improve a pawn yourself. I believe in you and I hope I will stick around to see a great came get made :)","December 18, 2015","true","11.8"," 25 of 64 people (39%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","39","25","64","3","31"

That this game is wonderful and i really enjoy playing it and look forward\nto every new chapter that has yet to come.\n\nEveryone Attacking Klace are just self centered Prick's\n\nTo The Furrys who Abuse, Attack and bully him over this game, It is very UnFurry of you, and you should be Ashamed, Being a furry Means appreciating art and artistic Talent, in my eyes any kind of Novel is a form of art.\n\nWho cares if Klace has writen the whole game around him, It is his game, he can do what he wants with it,\nDon't Abuse someone because they have made a game where the story revolves around a character that happens to be themself.\n\nIf you're going to Abuse Klace, of course he is going to Flag your Review, Just dont post anything at all if it's going to be negative and Abusive.\n\nThis Review Is my own thoughts. I am not just saying this because i am a furry\nThis is what i honestly think.\n\nYes i would pay for the game again\nYes i will Defend Klace, Because people are Abusing and bullying him.\n\nEven if i Disliked the game, i would Not abuse him. i would still defend him regardless of my opinion.\n\nBullying is wrong. If you Abuse people and/or Bully someone, You are a Prick\n\n\nKlace, If you read this.\n\nThis is 100% my true opinion and thoughts on your game\nI truely Look forward to future chapters.\n\nKlace, Please do not listen to the Haters\nThank you for a game i enjoy.","January 29","true","13.0"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","8","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fox234/recommended/417990/","Fox234","Fox234","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fox234/","288 products in account","After beating the 1st chapter when I had time I have a few complaints. It's not as bad as some reviews make it out to be, and can be enjoyable, but the game needs improvements. Disregarding the drama around the developer (I think most of it was over-blown having looked into it)\n\n1) The UI sucks, why? Because it's non-existent. The game offers you a save point at random times. Pressing escape just advances the dialog. So if you want to quit, and save your progress, you're SOL. This is why It shows I've played for over 4hours while chapter 1 is an hour long at most, but that doesn't matter because....\n\n2) Chapter 1 has 3 choices total. You really are paying $10, and hoping the content pays off in a year. None of your choices have any real impact on the story so far. Hell, those 22 characters? Yeah, you only meet 4 (kinda 5, but all he says is hi, and then disappears) of them in chapter 1. On the topic of characters.....\n\n3) 22 characters, and 6 females. For a game that advertises going on dates Klace probably should have focused on more females (located on the Klace patreon page). But, again, the only female you can kinda talk to in Chapter 1 is Eclair. Jade has no dialog choices. Rook, and Kila are the 2 you interact with most. This also means the dating, and forging friendships? It's not in chapter 1. Again, you're really hoping future content makes the $10 worth it because.....\n\n4) Most advertised content doesn’t exist yet. Chapter 1 is what we would have called a "demo" in the 90's. A lot like how Duke Nukem 3D released it's chapter 1 as freeware. It gives you a taste of what the developer wants to do, but it doesn't have all the features.\n\n"Length of several novels"- Maybe when it's done, but chapter 1 was a pamphlet. A good pamphlet, but it's still a pamphlet.\n\n"22 characters"- Not yet. 5 total, and 1 has no dialog.\n\n"Go on dates, and forge friendships"- 3 choices, and 1 of them is if you should comfort someone having a breakdown. If your date starts with someone crying then you've done something wrong. The other 2 are 1)if you violate a NDA, and 2) if you go to a maid cafe. Riveting. My chair is useless because I'm on the edge of my seat.\n\n"SMS send and receive messages"- You send 1, and it's pre-typed 2 choices. Meaning it's a regular dialog choice with an iphone.\n\n"Multiple endings, and many choices"- 3 in chapter 1. The game did tell me I didn't get any "true ending flags". What are these? Are you really telling me there's a cannon ending for a choose your own adventure story? If you're selling the game on multiple choices then you probably shouldn't have a "true ending". That's just telling the player they made this choice, but they're wrong.\n\n"Trading cards"- They're there.\n\n"Controller support"- WHY? it's a visual novel that doesn't use anything but the RMB. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe future chapters will need a controller.\n\n5) Main character is too introspective, and too relaxed. A lot more of his attitude, dialog and motivations should be left to the player. This is a game about choices, right?\n\n6) Art is good, but there isn’t enough of it. This means scenes make little visual sense. For example "SPOILER WARNING, kinda", if you choose to comfort Eclair she has the same picture as she does when you first met. This makes no sense since you found her crying at her desk. Why is she still holding a tray, salt shaker (I guess), and has a huge smile? I don't require full animation, but the picture should match the context of the scene. This also means every time Kila gets scared he still has an upbeat smile. And lastly on the topic of of scenes, visuals, and dialog.....\n\n7) No voice acting at all. It's 100% silent, and has sound effects from the SNES. The furry community is fairly large, could the developer really not find volunteers? Even free Skyrim mods have voice acting now. As far as sound effects, scroll down and look at the system recommendations. See where is says "Sound Card: Whatever makes bleeps and bloops"? That's NO JOKE. It does however bring back fond memories of Playing Mega Man X on the SNES. So free points for nostalgia.\n\n\n\nIn summary- It's not worth $10 as it sits. Many visual novels are cheaper, longer, have more art, and more sound. However I recommend Major/Minor because what's there isn't bad, and I want to see where it's going. Nothing is really offensive, it just has areas that could be great, but stop at basic. If any of my complaints have already been addressed then please disregard them. These are just my opinions based on playing the game. I haven't studied the game, nor have I paid for a patreon membership to get developer updates (how silly. Dev updates require $5 a month). As a furry I'd love to see this game succeed since most of the furry community is perfectly fine sitting in their deviant art comfort zone. It's good to see someone in the community with some drive to do more. Even if this game fails I hope it encourages more in the community to give game development a shot. As far as this game goes, it has potential, but potential is worthless if no one puts in the hard work.","December 12, 2015","true","4.1"," 16 of 45 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","16","45","2","35"

The story is okay during this time, but this game is still in early parts.\n\nDo I enjoy it so far?\nYes. While it has it's flaws(cliche moments), the story itself has good start with its settings/plot so far. The character themselves are pretty good and there is interest to see later as this game goes deeper into the story.\n\nShould you get?\nHonestly, wait for the 2nd chapter to come out and try it out. Having one chapter may not be enough for some players to get into the story.\n\n----\nUpdate:\nSo after playing the 2nd chapter of the game, it still seems to have interest on story. Newer events in the story is adding complexity of the story. It's still in the rising action and still too early to tell. While it still has a few flaws in story, the game has improved and is still improving.\n\nShould you STILL get it?\nYou still have time and you can still wait for chapter 3. With aleast 2 chapters in the game, it's taking off somewhere. The story has gain more interest with 2 chapters. If you're still not sure, wait for chapter 3.","December 14, 2015","true","18.9"," 14 of 41 people (34%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","34","14","41","0","0"

I wasn't aware of this game before it showed up on Steam, and as such hadn't had previous contact with the devs, nor was I part of the Kickstarter.\n\nThat being said, I was certainly impressed with it, and in retrospect would have funded it on KS if I'd known about it. I'll get the one negative out of the way first: as it stands, there's only one chapter available, and as such playtime is about 40 minutes only. As such, it means the price is currently a little high for the present amount of content, so those expecting a complete story straight away might want to wait. However, there are 12 chapters planned in total, intended to be released monthly, so if they end up being roughly equivalent in run time, it puts Major\Minor in the higher tier of VN length.\n\nOnto the more positive aspects. The writing is of good quality and I only noticed one small spelling/grammar error, which tends to be something I'm picky about. The story thus far is quite mysterious, as you might expect from an opening chapter, but there's enough hooks to keep me interested in finding out what happens next. The artwork is similarly good, and more to the point, it's consistent -- I've seen some VN's with clashing art styles, which tends to take you out of the story, but here it's obvious that the same artist worked on each character.\n\nThe general feeling of the game is somewhat reminiscent of other furry visual novels, but at the same time it's not obviously derivative of other titles, and has its own flavour and style; it doesn't seem like it's trying to be something else. If anything, it most reminded me of the VN elements of Persona 3 and 4, certainly a favourable comparison to bring to mind.\n\nOverall it's made a good impression on me, and I'm keen to see what happens next. I spoke to the developer to give feedback and see if I could assist the project at all, and I'm pleased to report he's a friendly sort and evidently keen to engage with the community. If you like visual novels, it's recommended; and if you've never played one but the art style or any other aspect appeals, there's a good chance you might enjoy it anyway.","December 13, 2015","true","4.2"," 15 of 45 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","15","45","0","7"

Simplistic RPG Maker visual novel, gameplay comes in the form of the occasional choice you have to make. Story is obviously not going to be for everyone, though you can get the gist of the setting and type of character you play as by looking at the screenshots and reading the descriptions on this page; so for the love of God, don't be surprised if you find the narrative yucky after making a purchase. Chapters are being released in an episodic manner over the course of a year, truthfully, I don't like this, or at the very least am wary of this. Yet, the first chapter seems to have plenty of content to it, as I've already put an hour and a half into it with no real hint at the ending being close; and let's say it's only going to take me two hours to finish it, if two hours is the average length of each chapter, that's a total of 24 hours of content for ten dollars.\n\nAll in all, I suggest that you do your research on this one, maybe wait until a few more chapters are released. That said, I'm certainly not upset to own this game.\n\nAlso as a side note, as far as all the controversy goes in regards to the game's designer...

It doesn't got many memorable tracks ATM but wait for it and it might be good.\n\nThe characters are memorable however there are quite a bit that get introduced and not flushed out untill later chapters which gets frustrating for those who want to learn about the characters more in depth right away without scouring each of the words they say\n\n\nIf the music turns out to be really good then buy this game for SURE. And Don't skip out on it. It's worth buying now.\n\nThis game is fairly replayable, considering you can "skip" a lot of dialogue by holding the mouse or Enter keys on your keyboard any scene you want to get through can be done in about 5 minutes. A huge improovement over the 30 minute sessions to get to ONE decision.\n\nThe game has some amazing storytelling and concepts it slightly lacks in displaying everything that it can by rushing you with information It's not a huge issue just a small one that'll probably be patched next update.\n\nBuy the game I'd say.","December 13, 2015","true","4.2"," 10 of 35 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","10","35","0","0"

There is plenty of room for improvement ofcourse however I would more then reommend it if you are willing to follow along with the episode releases month to month.\n\nIf anything this may not be everyones cup of tea but I say its a good start to something amazing and don't be quick to knock it till you least give it more then a months chance.\n\n+Great music\n+Interesting characters\n+A feeling of choice\n\nThese are only afew of the many things that I personally liked about the game. Its alos not that expensive so I say give it a go.","December 11, 2015","true","10.2"," 17 of 55 people (31%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","31","17","55","3","0"

The story kind of to me feels like it plays it self, and I feel like there needs to be lots improved on. Other than that this game is nice not too bad not too great but it can improve from here on out. I hope i am able to recomend some things here cause the few things this game needs is animation. Its hard to truly enjoy it fully with out some character expretion or motion theres a few other visual novels that have animation either alot or a little, but this is my own little gripe about the game it just need animation with characters and stuff thats all, I will love to be able to help out to make this come true and i hope others will help out make this story grow more with the future chapters to beable to make it possiable. So i will close off to say This game i will recommend cause it can still grow in the following months if possiable and its not too bad so just keep on going ^^ and i hope no one haves too much trouble with what im saying cause i have a speech problem.","December 9, 2015","true","15.8"," 15 of 77 people (19%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","19","15","77","3","0"

The story also looks very interesting, though it feels very Persona-esque. The main thing that irks me is the fact that it's made in RPGMaker and not something like Ren'Py or its own engine. Though the game still functions like a normal VN, the lack of ability to save whenever you want can mess you up if you're used to saving on every choice. I'd say the game actually incorporates this pretty well though, and I'm excited for the next chapters.\n\nA solid base with some potential.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oditogre/recommended/417990/","Oditogre","Oditogre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Oditogre/","205 products in account","tl;dr up front: I enjoyed the game and would tentatively recommend it. If the wind snatching a $10 bill out of your hand would ruin your day, give this game a few months, but if you're vaguely interested and the price tag isn't high for your budget, give it a whirl. It's definitely rough around the edges, but still a promising effort, with plenty of time to grow and improve.\n\nFirst, a quick thing that seems to be causing some problems for other reviewers, where it's understandable why they'd be upset while not being the fault of the game: This is a visual novel, not an adventure game.  It's more akin to a 'choose your own adventure' book, where the reader makes infrequent decisions, but mostly is just reading a story, except with some character and setting art to augment the experience. If you're looking for more interactivity or player-character agency, this isn't your thing. If you're just in it for a laid-back story with a few different branching possibilities, read on.\n\nPros:\n- There are a few different subplots that are interesting. This is, at the end of the day, the make-or-break factor for the genre, and so far, I'm feeling good about it.\n- Characters feel like they have distinct and consistent voices.\n- Character art looks good.\n- Music is pretty nice.\n- Furries. If you're into them, obviously, this is a win.\n\nNeutral:\n- Controls and options are minimal, but good enough for the genre and for Indie.\n- Finite number of save slots - Not huge, but doesn't seem to make sense, either.\n- Trading cards - may be a 'Pro' to some; I don't really care either way.\n- Furries. So far at least, it's not at all yiffy-murry-purry. If you're on the fence about furries and the character art doesn't bother you, don't let it turn you off of this game.\n\nCons:\n- Writing could use some tuning. Dialogue feels stiff in some places, which is a greater-than-normal detriment for this kind of game.\n- Only one image per character. It can seem awkward or dampen emotional impact of some scenes or dialogue when the speaker is portrayed behind the text with a friendly smile, when the appropriate expression would be shock, anger, sadness, etc.\n- Felt short. If each chapter is this long, the full game will be a steal; a wonderful length for the price. However, a single chapter on its own feels like a too-short tease.\n- Furries. Obviously, if you hate furries, this game is not for you.","December 9, 2015","true","7.9"," 24 of 125 people (19%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","19","24","125","4","4"

I do not identify as a "furry", or even a fan of virtual novels.\n\nHowever, I find myself strangely looking forward to the next chapter of this game. I'll be waiting out the month until I can see how my choices effect the next part of the story.\n\nMajor/Minor has a lot of prominent flaws. The presentation and interface is not quite a polished as it would appear in the promotional video. Some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy, and the subject material is a little far fetched, in a sense. At first I was going to complain about the sound effects of the game, but the options menu gives you the choice to quiet or mute the sound of the dialogue text.\n\nThe thing I found most "offensive" about my first playthrough, was that when everything was said and done, and I finished the chapter, I received a message telling me what I had done right and wrong, and whether I was elligible for a perfect ending or not. While there is a great deal of fun to be had in going back and seeing what alternate paths have in store, this seems like something you'd want to do at the end of the game. Not every chapter.\n\nWhat stands out most prevalently about this game so far, is that I feel that you are presented with choices that actually have an amount of weight to them, and that you are presented with them often enough that you really will make a lasting impact on the story. The characters have a little more depth than you would expect, and even in the brevity of the first chapter, you're presented with a couple surprises and interesting relationships between characters.\n\nThe music that is used in the actual game does not reflect the music that was used on the promotional video. Though, this isn't a bad thing. Once you get past the generic "ominous choire" music at the beginning, the rest of the background music is really pleasant and oddly uplifting. I'd imagine that because a certain percentage of the characters involved in the main storyline are all music-related, that music used in later parts of the game will sound a bit heavier.\n\nIt must also be acknowledged that it seems that the author of this game has inserted himself as one of the main characters. When I found this out, I immediately drew the worst conclusions (as It is a common sin to write one's self as an overly-important facet to the worlds we make). But after my first playthrough of the first chapter, I found this character's influence on this version of Japan to be kind of charming. He really is presented like a person that we've heard of.\n\nIf you like virtual novels, or you're a fan of furry art, or anthro characters interacting with one another, then you'll probably enjoy this game. I'd even go far as to saying this would be a good introductory game for anyone who is curious as to whether or not they'd like the virtual novel genre. When the next chapter comes out in January, I'll be interested to continue my interactions in Anthro-Tokyo.","December 9, 2015","true","1.1"," 17 of 107 people (16%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","16","17","107","2","0"

That being said, I saw little to no diffrence from this game and a traditional 'choose your own ending' visual novel. And I'd like to quickly point out, that such a thing isnt nessisarily bad. It just has a specific audiance.\nAs with any form of 'art' (music, drawing, game-makeing) there are going to be critics. This is definetly a work in progress.\nIf you dont like waiting for more, dont buy it.\nIf you dont like furries, dont buy it.\nIf you dont care for traditional animie-style visual novel story telling with branching paths, dont buy it.\nAm I biased due to being a fur? Sure, frankly I like the characters. They're an intresting lot. I even have 'waifu' matirial to look at all the while. Wich is a bonus for me ;D . Voice acting might be nice, but A: work in progress game, B: games don't NEED voice acting to be fun, and C: its furrys, I'm going to say nice things about it no matter what.\nThats as far as my bias goes.\nI have played for one hour. I have reached the end of chapter one. I certainly have the option of going back, trying diffrent routs, but currently I have been left with a honestly cheesey clif-hanger. The writeing is slow, as it's obviously the begining of the story, but I feel a small bit cheated. I think maybe because JRPG aspects were mentioned, and only vaugely implemented. I'd like to break away from the main story, explore, get to know the characters a bit more.\nI don't like to rate games in early development, so my current rateing is honestly just because I want this game to end up good, even if it is rocky at the start. Oh and because Eclair. I'm a sucker for the cute ones.\nKeep an open mind if you open your pocket book (for what is essentialy a pocket-change priced game).\nIf you cant do that, then this game isnt for you.\n(edit: I'd also like to point out that Klace, the maker of this game, put his charcter into his own game, and has recieved some stick for it. Kinda BS if you ask me. Two words 'creative lisence'. If I ever made a game, I'd probably do the same thing... except, ya know... not being a popstar... I'm pretty sure my character isnt supposed to be famous anyway. ^.^ Musicians place themselves in thiere songs all the damn time, is this (placeing one self in the game they made) any diffrent?)","December 9, 2015","true","1.0"," 13 of 101 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","13","101","0","2"

Not all dialogue options are likely available at the moment, and the creator, Klace, will fine-tune this in due time with his deadline (and likely beyond!). You may find a few typos and spelling errors, but if you message Klace, not me, with a screenshot of the error, you'll see it promptly fixed!\n\nIs it worth your money? That strictly depends on you as a Steam user. Are you into intense action, things blowing up, raunchy, censored sex scenes, and headshots out the yin-yang? If yes, please turn away and go try Fallout 4. The experience you will have with Major/Minor is slow, with deep, thoughtful undertones. It's a little jerky at times with pacing and seemingly major plot points thrown at you in the first chapter, but if you set aside some quiet time, hook up some headphones, and just relax with a glass of cold pop and a bowl of smarties, you'll certainly smile, sob, and maybe chuckle, unless you're super into the things listed earlier in this paragraph, in which case, I would also suggest The Witcher 3 as a viable alternative.\n\nSit down, shut up, and hold on to your britches, because the Feel Train is just about to leave the station to who-knows-where!","December 3, 2015","true","16.4"," 39 of 191 people (20%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","20","39","191","5","3"

I believe, as creator of the game, which has set the bar high with the fist chapter, he has every right to insert his character wherever he likes in the game. He worked hard on it, so it's the least he deserves as a reward. Rant over, the game itself is very choice based, a bit like most "different" games that are coming out, like Until Dawn and Undertale. I feel however, that due to the split nature of this game, the game could end up being more successful than Undertale, and may become one of those well heard of games that people like Markiplier and JackSepticEye play. I would recommend getting the game, and having to wait for each episode that comes out monthly, really adds suspense to the game, and allows people to discuss and guess what happens next.","December 9, 2015","true","2.9"," 9 of 95 people (9%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","9","9","95","6","0"

The only problem I had in the gameplay was a saving error - i chose  "save and quit" and when i tried to reload that file, it bugged out and brought me back to the title screen.

(i know absolutely nothing about making games but if i were to suggest somthing it would be to have the facial expresions on the characters, that was the only downside to this game. in my opinion)","December 4, 2015","true","1.4"," 24 of 150 people (16%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","16","24","150","0","1"

The art style is beautiful (my compliments to the artist), and I enjoyed the way the colors worked well together.\n\nThe description of the text not only adds to the sense of wonder, it keeps an engaging and realistic feel to the world that isn't too overwhelming. Texting people was a very intriguing concept in a game and I've never seen it been used like this before, it was actually quite entertaining to see Rook's reaction to the text message you send him; I also really enjoyed how similar the phone setup is to that of an iPhone (especially with the clever reference to verizon wireless).\n\nAnother thing I like is the concept of being able to choose your own destiny in this video game, and I look forward to playing it many times over to get all of the possible endings, it makes the video game feel more alive. Though the chance to date other characters hasn't been recognized, as far as I know, I still look forward to it and have one of the characters in mind. ;)\n\nBut I digress, I very much liked what I've been able to play of Major\Minor and I've yet to be disappointed by it; I highly recommend this game and I will continue to torture my family/friends by repetitively bringing it up in conversation in my vain attempt to get them to play it (I'm sure they'll crack eventually).","December 7, 2015","true","9.8"," 18 of 130 people (14%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","14","18","130","5","1"

I really like what I've seen so far with it's beautiful art, and a robust storyline that changes based on your choices. Just what I've experienced so far is fantastic and I really can't wait for more. Right now, the biggest flaw I can see is the fact the when you're naming yourself, you can't just use the keyboard(or at least Backspace to delete letters instead of Esc) and you have to clear the name field before you can begin entering your choice of name. Keep up the good work, looking forward to more.","December 6, 2015","true","2.4"," 26 of 158 people (16%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","16","26","158","4","0"
