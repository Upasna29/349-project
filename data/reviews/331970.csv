"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaeo/recommended/331970/","kaeo","Jibber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaeo/","1460 products in account","I first got my hands on this game via a demo disc from McDonald's back when it was first released. The disc came with a trailer for Kingdom Hearts, a music video for I'm Still Here from the Treasure Planet movie, and some images/desktop backgrounds. Needless to say, I wasn't expecting much from an incomplete, licensed game demo bundled with a Happy Meal.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nI played the demo for many, many hours. It defied my expectations with thrilling action, simplified but tight strategy mechanics, and an above-average soundtrack that really puts you in the mood for, well, being in a ship out in space. I remember being astounded the first time I sailed through a nebula, eager to find whatever mysteries lay behind the pink clouds. I remember watching in fear as a black hole swallowed ships, tearing them asunder. All this in just a demo!\n\nJumping back into the full release, I thought that nostalgia would have dulled my senses, or maybe I wouldn't remember how to play, or maybe I would be biased. Again, I was wrong. I jumped right back in (speaking to the ease of the gameplay) and was immediately surprised to find that it was just as fun as I remembered! That's something that can't be said for many games.\n\nTo sum up, I really enjoy Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon. It enhances the story of the original film and raises the bar for licensed games everywhere with stunning space combat done correctly, solid voice acting, graphics and sound that really put you in the world (or in space, if you prefer), and just being plain fun to learn and play. I wholeheartedly recommend it for fans of action-strategy games, space combat, or video games in general.\n\nTORPEDOES AWAY!","February 24, 2015","true","2.0"," 166 of 172 people (97%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","97","166","172","18","15"

The game gives more depth to the treasure planet universe and, to be honest, is a bloody damn good example of a RTS ship game. You can board and steal enemy ships, set up skirmishes, and play a very well put together campain.\n\nIt kills me this game didnt end up a classic in the minds of all gamers. People should scoff at new games and say "Dear god, why couldnt you do what a disney game thats demo was given away for free with kids meals at mcdonalds do, why cant you even manage to be as good as "Battle at Procyon"\n\nIn the main game you can only play as the Royal Navy, as jim hawkins, however in skirmishes you can play as any of the three factions (Navy, pirates, or "Procyons" the raccoon like massive military empire that specializes in badass warships) and you can individually construct your fleet and crew with the minutest details under your control.\n\nJust some examples of the things you can have happen in this game, often at random\n\nLure enemies into a nebula where their sails stop providing energy and they must be tugged out or be left as easy prey.\n\nSteal enemy ships and use their talents to help you win battles.\n\nStick a "REALLY BIG GUN" on your warship and blow anything within 10 parsecs to a billion pieces, you can fully customize your ships firepower\n\nDefend forts in space and use their guns to aid you\n\nCommand everything from a torpedo boat to the impressive Fast Frigate\n\nGet sucked into a black hole and legitimately be scared to death as you watch your ship vanish from reality, or even better, get sucked into a supernova and have the same experience, but on fire\n\nAmelia is back for all the people like me who had a crush on her in the movie! she leads you through the campain\n\nBig ship thinks your torpedo boat is whimpy? knock out its engines (Yes you can target specific places) then launch a line into it and tow its ♥♥♥ over to a black hole, or better, to your own fleet and let them ravage it.\n\nWhile this is a RTS game, the projectiles move realistically and arent "Click, auto hit" meaning you can dodge things, or put guns on your ship dedicated to shooting down enemy projectiles, you are very free to mix actual talent for naval battle with talent for military tactics, think of it like playing Black Flag's ship segments while controlling a whole fleet in the background. You are also wholly able to move and touch any vessel with your own, letting you push around ships and block fire with your bigger, stronger ship if you so desire.\n\nAnd so much more! seriously this is a classic and you dont even know it, if you love strategy then bloody get it and wonder why your AAA title cost 60$ and is half as good as this game","May 24, 2015","true","11.5"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","0"

The combat gameplay is fast-paced, with everything from cannons to mortars available to arm your ship with, each with its own set of models, sound effects and animations, and based on ship-handling as much as simply carrying the best weapons and crew.","April 28, 2015","true","17.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This game shortly came out after the Disney movie Treasure Planet. As a kid I loved this movie, it combined space and pirates! When the game came out I went nuts. Sadly, Battle at Procyon never started a series of games, which could have happened. In my opinion, the developers nailed this game, simply, a masterpiece.\n\nPros:\n-Great storyline (for a game at that time)\n-Pirates\n-Space... Ships? (instead of battling through space from the future, you battle with ships from the past  Man-o-War, Iron Clad, etc. )\n-Lengthy missions, where it is entirely possible to just explore the map.  12 missions\n-Skirmish mode\n-Surprising textures for a game from the early 2000's\n-The ships actually take damage instead of static textures!\n\nCons:\n-Cheesy voice acting (adds more humor to the game in my opinion)\n-I had some performance issues with Windows 7; glitchy mouse (would stutter at times when precision was needed), and some broken textures in max resolution. These were fixed when I ran the game in XP compatibility mode, and then running the game in XP\n-Multiplayer is pretty much dead. If I remember correctly, there is a LAN mode for skirmishing\n-Unfortunately, there is no windowed mode but that is only a nit-pick\n\nBottom line: Nostalgia! If you can get this game on sale, buy it. I love this game, and I am sure I will come back to it now that I have the digital version.","February 27, 2015","true","8.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","4"

The game and world files can easily be edited in notepad to create all sorts of weird inconvieniences/improvements. There were official modding and map tools made for the game when it was released, however these tools have never surfaced.\n\nOnline multiplayer has been broken since (insert year here) when DIsney shut down the servers. But it is possible to play long distance on Tunngle.\n\nSimply put: It's a good, simple, nostalgic RTS space battle game based off of a good movie. Although it's still identical to the retail version, the biggest difference is that it's more accessable to fans and people who have never played it.\n\n(P.S.

Review points : -\n\nPros : -\n- Great if you're a fan of the movie and wanted to know more\n- Pretty darn good story\n- Voice acting is nice\n- A skirmish mode to keep you playing the game for a while\n- It's an old game, so it runs very smoothly on high settings on a modern day computer.\n\nCons : -\n- The ships don't have people walking about like in the movies (imagine boats, talking to other boats)\n- Ships are slow AF. (No seriously, I run faster in TF2)\n- Some parts have weird color combinations, but tolerable.\n- Disney still hasn't made a sequel to the movie, and to this game.\n- Combat can be quite repetitive (just spam and ta-dah).\n- Old game, so no online play with others.\n\nBut if you're willing to spend a bit for a game. It should keep you here for about 3 hours or less. And even longer if you continue playing the skirmish mode. As a fan, still a pretty fun game while it lasted.\n\n","February 13","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It looks like it was slapped together in less than an hour using a couple of leftover assets. But more importantly it fails to provide basic information; there is no way to determine the firing arc of a weapon other than feeling it out; a selected ship's health values are displayed as three not immediatly obvious meters just off the bottom center of the screen between some camera options and a chat log; unselected ships only display a rough approximation of hull strength in the fleet window, no information relating to weapons or sails are dsiplayed.\n- the game's speed is also an issue, often campaign missions will ask the player to travel across the map from point A to point B taking about 2-3 minutes assuming the ship is both very fast and travling at maximum speed, during this period of time absolutely nothing happens. This issue could be corrected if there was some way to change game speed during play, and it would only need to be there for singleplayer, I can't really say anything about pacing in multiplayer, but I assume its fine.\n- not that many keybindings, you can cycle through ships or change a ship's speed and thats it, everything else can only be accomplished with mouse clicks.\n- unskippable cutscenes, but dialog in cutscenes can be skipped.\n- most of these issues and then some would be fixed if the game had a better modding community, there's alot of potential but it dosen't have much of a follow through.\n\ntl/dr: game's good, not great.\n- maybe get it if you like AssCreed BlackFlag, but wished it was more strategic/focused/involved.\n- must buy if someone manages to mod some anime boat girls in.","December 31, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
