(you can't freeze time and put some turrets)\n- You can speed up the time (x2), but if you do that the turrets will be less effective!\n- There is no minimap and you can't zoom-out to see the whole map.\n- You can't change the targeting priority of your turrets.\n- The interface is failed ! It was designed to play with a controller, which is cool for people playing on consoles, but isn't effective with a mouse and a keyboard.\n- The first half of the campaign is boring : no difficulty, no mazing, no original turrets. Fortunately, in the second half, you gain acces to more interesting turrets, you can start mazing and levels become challenging.\n- There is no other game modes, just the campaign.\n\nThe level transformation idea is interesting, though it isn't used a lot. The graphics are good and I like the mecha-style of the turrets.\n\nThe game isn't entirely bad, but it contains a lot of frustrating things. Buy it only on big sale, prefer Defense Grid or Defenders Quest.","March 25, 2014","false","39.3"," 144 of 158 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","144","158","0","0"

If you are looking for a nice TD, just go for anotherone, there are so many good TD´s out there (Defense Grid for example).\n\nGraphics (4/10):\nNot really that impressive. Considering this is a PC version, it has crappy animations, the framerate is just taken over from the android version and overall it could have been much better.\n\nDesign (2/10):\nAs this is a TD, especially the leveldesign. It´s just.... aweful. They tried to copy what DG did right, a mix between maze and standart. I hope you already know: they failed. The first levels are actually ok, but as they get bigger comes a confusing layout. That doesn´t change with the "blockers" standing on each map (things the enemies will stop at and attack till it´s gone).\nFor the overall design: The enemies are nicely diversified which doesn´t count for the towers. If a tower is level 1 or 2, you will not see it.\n\nGameplay (7/20):\nYou can upgrade your towers, so thats a plus. But what else? You always have to place your towers on the exact spot it was supposed to stand in order to block the enemies path. How strategy is that. After the first level, the fun is just gone. It gets repetitiv really quick as you don´t get any new useful stuff. The real killer are the blockers tho. Having to build towers which you than have to sell later is just stupid.\nYou also don´t need to adjust any towers to the enemies spawing as they nearly all do the same thing.\n\nControls (4/5):\nWorks overall. Sometimes the camera pans a bit strange but thats ok. Annoying is the zoom tho. You will never use it. You don´t need to, but it´s really bad.\n\nInnovation (2/5):\nCopies DG, every tower has already been seen in other games and there are no new enemy types to speak of.\nTho you have a upgrade system of each tower and the blockers are (even tho really bad) new as well.","November 26, 2013","false","1.5"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","38","50","0","0"

Tower Defense games are one of my favorite  arcade/indie genres.  I'm quite pleased with this one even if it doesn't  offer up anything new apart from the crystals that enable you to occassionally reveal  the most  optimal placement of turrets or the luck based card system that offer enduring bonuses such as reduced build costs.  Sadly   these crystals  take an age to  save enough to use effectively.\n\nIf you're new to TD games, I'd give this one a miss at least until its on sale as it can be quite   hard to win once you've passed the first  several levels.

There's little introduction or explanation to gameplay concepts. For example, the 4th level introduces its first weather effect, except it doesn't really tell you when this is happening, or what its effect is. You have to go out of your way to find such simple things.\nYou know what other amazing feature it possesses? Enemies drop a cube of additional resources upon death, which you are required to hover your mouse over to collect. Maps become several screens large even from the first level, so if you create a few killzones, you have to constantly cycle between them to scavenge your rewards. It's kind of ludicrous in a terrible way, honestly.\n\nI would best describe Defense Technica as a half-hearted mash-up of Defense Grid (in look, feel, and mechanisms [you quickly acquire what is essentially the orbital laser, towers pop out of the ground in little boxes, etc]) and Kingdom Rush (towers are limited, but gain upgrade paths). Maybe somewhere in there is a kernal of a good idea, but it's not easily accessable, and it's hugely unpolished.\n\nSadly, this is a purchase I regret.","September 24, 2014","false","3.0"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

The tower upgrade system is a lot of fun. To have more than one core that is attacked by the enemies is also a great idea. Another nice feature: Some of the stages change during play (for example an area with another core that is under water at first becomes accessible after a while).","January 11, 2014","true","33.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I don't think the other reviewers have played through this game entirely.  While there may be similarities between this game and the Defense Grid games, there are also very significant differences.  Since so many other reviewers are comparing the two games, I will as well.\n\nOne of the biggest differences is that you can add upgrade ability to your towers between levels which carries over.  In Defense Grid there is no overarching upgrade ability.  Every level is brand new with the same vanilla towers.  The upgrades in Defense Technica can significantly change the way a tower behaves.  In Defence Grid, upgrades just increase damage and range.  For example, the basic machine gun tower can go up the machine gun path which will give it longer range and more damage against biological enemies.  Or it can become a mass driver which allows it to penetrate all enemies in a line specialized again mechanical enemies but with a much slower rate of fire.\n\nThere are very distinct catagories of enemies and damage.  One type of damage is optimal for a certain type of enemy but may be very weak against another.  Defense grid has shielded and unshielded.  This game has shielded, unshielded, heavy, light, bio and mechanical.  If you specialize in one type of damage, you will become vulnerable to enemies that are resistant to it.\n\nUnlike in Defense Grid, when enemies make it to your core, they do damage.  They are not stealing cores which float back to your base.  They stay there until your core is destroyed at which point you lose the game.\n\nAlso, the core itself has a couple of finite abilities.  It can do a smart bomb a few times or heal itself using ether.  Once the ether runs out, then you have no more for the rest of the level.\n\nI found the game to be enjoyable.  IMO it is tactically more challenging with the added complexity of upgrades available and the more varying enemies attacking you.","January 31","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ultimately this game comes across as the scrawney adopted younger sibling to Defense Grid-- you feel absolutely no loyalty to it, and it as it cannot surpass it's older sibling you wonder (no matter how bad a person you think this might make you) if you might be able to return it from whence it came.","June 1, 2014","false","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's about what I'd expect from a $15 game. Although, there are a few things I'd change if I could. The game's sound track is basically one song on a loop. Before I had finished my first tutorial, i had gotten sick of the one song playing in the background. To be perfectly honest, the song led me to believe my sound card had driver issues. It was beyond repetetive.\n\nAfter playing a few matches, the game seems to have a persistant leveling system, which is nice. But the Interface leads me to believe the developers never intended it for PC. The mouse controls feel sluggish at best, and The tutorial help windows abruptly stop, despite introducing new towers regularly, leaving me to guess what my strategy should be. The level design seems to be the best thing about this game, as you can maze your towers to some degree, while still deciding what's most effecient with your customized towers.\n\nIn summery:\n\nSoundtack: 1/10\nRPG elements: 7/10\nVoice acting: 0/10 (There isnt any)\nControls 3/10 (I'd say one, but they atleast added mouse controls.)\nStory 1/10 (basically nonexistant, but thats a tower defense for you.)\n\n\n","October 6, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It tries too hard to copy Defense Grid, but without the story, or interesting AI voice, and without a decent difficulty too. Boy does Defense Technica's difficulty spike like crazy, with Defense Grid, there was checkpoints and you could hit backspace to go back to the last checkpoint in case you made tower placements mistakes, it was also a bit more forgiving in terms of tower effectiveness versus vertain enemies. With Technica? You're restarting the map, and you will be doing that, often.\n\nTreat this more like a Roguelike Tower Defense, because it's highly unlikely you'll finish a level on the first attempt, it's about experimenting with different placements and towers and upgrades until you get a combination that works. You NEED the best tower for each kind of enemy, because other turrets will barely scratch them.\n\nPersonally I don't have the patience to do the same level a dozen times just to defeat it for the first time.

There are tons of different ways to make the enemy walk through the levels, and tons of different ways to take em out.\n\nI really don't understand why this game only gets 63/100 on Metacritic. I found it very very enjoyable. 10/10.","May 9, 2015","true","40.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gotta say I was really disappointed.\n\nThe game has quite a few strong points that will surely raise your interest but somehow it still manages to change your initial opinion in a very short time.\n\nI really liked the artistic direction. Defense Technica has a very nice futuristic sci-fi look and feel to it that goes very well with the detailed graphics and the soundtrack.\n\nUnfortunately this impression is ruined by the level design. While some levels are great and allow you to plan your strategy and try multiple approaches, some are incredible badly designed.\n\nSo, while on some levels the enemies seem to respect the level design, on some everything is chaotic.\nEnemies come on multiple paths that don't intersect, from the first wave, when you are very limited in resources and force you to use them all to block the extra paths (if you can, that is) and then rely on the default towers that tend to fail a lot. And as if this was not enough, sometimes enemies refuse to go on the designated path and they either take a different path that is unprotected of they keep attacking the tower that's blocking the way until they manage to go through.\n\nAnd if you think that's all, think again. Some levels are so badly designed that it's virtually impossible to plan something because the concept of strategy seems to vanish. There is only one approach, and you can only place the exact towers in the exact spot to succeed or you will get bored and frustrated trying, no matter how logical and right you think your choices are.\n\nAll these make Defense Technica incredible inconsistent. Some levels are very easy and some are very hard. Some levels can be finishes with 0% breakthrough rate while for some you will have to replay dozens of time until you get the strategy right.\nI really wanted to love this game for all its good parts, especially for the artistic direction and graphics but it turns out, as if we had to be reminded, that graphics aren't everything.\n\nI'm not even sure if I should give this game another try of ditch it right away, if I should upvote it or downvote it but what I know for sure is that if you like games like Defense Grid or Anomaly you should be aware if planning on playing this. Buy it only if you find it on a sale for $2 or so, otherwise it's not worth it.\n\n5.5 / 10 potatoes from me.","September 27, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
