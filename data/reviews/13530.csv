"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/recommended/13530/","Luriam","Luriam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/","307 products in account","The last game in the fantastic Prince of Persia trilogy. This time, the game changes radically. Again.\n\nThe new gameplay now includes elements of stealth and the ability to do more damage without being seen or heard. Exploration and making progress through climbing, swinging, jumping, sliding and wall-running are still a huge part of the game, which is awesome. They even added some chariot levels. But the biggest change and probably the most important is the appearance of the Prince's alter ego.\n\nThe Dark Prince is manifested by an internal voice that speaks to the Prince... at first. The Dark Prince is cold, cruel, arrogant, and sarcastic, and attempts to convince the Prince that they are the same person, and that the Prince should strive to serve only himself, using the Prince's vengeance as a catalyst for his other emotions. On many occasions, the Dark Prince seizes control of the Prince's body and the Prince is fully transformed into a kind of hybrid sand monster with abilities that allow the Prince to pass otherwise insurmountable obstacles.\n\nWhile searching for the Vizier, the Prince encounters Farah, who does not remember him, and is surprised that the Prince knows her name. Despite this, the pair begin to grow an entirely new romance together.\n\nYuri Lowenthal's soothing voice is back. The Prince would not be the same without it. Beautiful monologues scattered through-out the game make it so much more enjoyable. The music is having Persian influences, but is much more epic than Sands of Time. Epic as in a theme of grandeur and heroism. Majestic and impressively great moment that you are experiencing, with lots of well-done cliffhangers. I still like the original more than everything.\n\nSome of the characters are familiar to the player, others are new and provocative. But with no doubt, both look unique and interesting. The Prince changes his appearance several times, as the corruption keeps getting further. And eventually transforming into the Dark Prince. Besides that there are a lot of weapons, secrets, and other hidden items.\n\nThe game looks fantastic, as it shows you the very roofs of Babylon and then down into the depths of the city's dry well.\n\nAs well as the Warrior Within, this game has a secret ending. The good ending requires a bit more effort, but it's totaly worth it.\n\nSolid gameplay, amazing music and voice-acting, great and intruguing storyline, with lots of plot twists, and nice looks. The last part of this trilogy really mixed all of the best from the previous games. Thus creating an incredible game that feels great.\n\n\n\n10/10\n","January 22, 2014","true","19.4"," 65 of 67 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","65","67","0","2"

Some of the jump puzzles are devious. But overall, this game is definatly worth a playthrough. dont even mind the crap graphics, about 5 minutes in, u wont even notice. and besides, its better to have a great game with crappy graphics *cough, zelda, cough*, then a 1080p game that sucks ♥♥♥. *cough, COD Ghosts, cough*.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/papertiger2071/recommended/13530/","papertiger2071","QuidProBro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/papertiger2071/","62 products in account","This was a huge favorite of mine back when it was originally released, so in spite of my reservations about haphazard ports, I was happy when this unadulterated version was released on Steam. As far as I could tell, it seems to be a pretty direct copy of the original. The graphics have been touched up a bit, but the gameplay, content, menus, and music all remain the same as they were a decade ago. Steam has this tagged as “partial controller support”, but aside from a few things on the menu, the whole game is controller friendly.\n\nHow does the actual gaming experience hold up, though? The graphics are outdated, Ubisoft has moved on to bigger and bolder things with the Assassin’s Creed series, and many avid fans of our favorite wall-running protagonist would tell you to just stick with 2003’s seminal Sands of Time if you want the true POP experience. So what makes Two Thrones worth playing a decade later?\n\nThere are a number of less important factors I could point to. The music is crisp, regionally appropriate (thank God), and diverse. The voice acting harkens back to the more subtle days of Sands of Time, and the schizophrenic conversations between the Prince and his dark alter-ego are funny, illuminating, and cleverly deployed in support of the game’s overall narrative. The boss battles are varied, make clever use of the game’s mechanics, and, particularly in the case of the final two fights, are truly epic in a way that was often missing in previous series installments. The game is linear, but within that linear construct, it offers you multiple ways to accomplish your objectives. And that brings us to the true strength of this game:\n\nTwo words: visceral satisfaction. In other words, the quick-kill system. It sounds odd to say that a repetitive system of QTEs positively defines a game, but it isn’t the physical act of button-pressing that makes this mechanism tick; it’s how you get there. In Two Thrones, there are basically three options for combat. You can avoid large parts of it by just platforming past enemies and keeping your eyes on the prize. You can cover yourself in the blood and sands of your enemies by flinging yourself headfirst into combat,  where you can breakdance, roll, and slash your way to gruesome victory by means of the same combat system from Warrior Within. The final option, though, is the most satisfying, and the most clever from a game design standpoint. In Sands of Time, platforming and combat were kept largely segregated, and combat was just something you reluctantly waded through so you could get back to traversing the gorgeous landscapes. In Warrior Within, you were still frequently forced into prolonged moments of repetitive hacking, albeit with a mechanically improved combat system. In Two Thrones, however, platforming and combat are finally integrated, and dear lord are they integrated effectively. Instead of just serving as the means to getting from point A to point B, platforming is now also deployed as a way to get the jump on your foes. Instead of waltzing in daggers drawn, you can now climb above, around, and past your enemies in order to sneak up behind them, hear some satisfying middle eastern beats, and quickly dispose of them with some brutally efficient killing strokes. It’s difficult to overstate how satisfying this mechanic is. You will seldom feel like more of a badass than when you’ve executed a series of precise quick-kills to silently eliminate a group of enemies. I found myself replaying parts of the game just to determine how best to utilize the environment to surprise my unsuspecting sand monster friends. That thrill, that desire to maximize the glorious synthesis between your dagger strokes and your gravity-defying stunts, is what drives this game, as well as what keeps you coming back.","January 11","true","23.3"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","22","22","2","0"

Then theres some somewhat clunky chariot races of death straight out of The Prince of Egypt, except more death hazards and extreme faceplants into fortified walls.\n\nOne of the new/best parts of this game is some new parkour elements, and stealth (sometimes right after a parkour sequence, for example: where you slide down a crevice and assassinate the dude while his buddy isn't looking with quicktime events varying in difficulty depending on how tough the enemy is). Instances of stealth can vary, but one of the most useful parts is the sand portals: Parkour and execute the stealth QTE right, or get a ♥♥♥♥ load of reinforcements to kick your ♥♥♥ for failing.\n\nThen one of my favorite parkour areas, the massive (probably shorter than Dubai's, LOL.) tower. In which you will ♥♥♥♥ your pants the first time one of the invisible enemies hit you.\n\nAssassinating enemies whilst on a chain as Dark Prince is always fun, and bosses are (mostly) fun and challenging to fight.\n\nSo if you liked the first two games in the trilogy, this ones a no brainer.","October 15, 2014","true","16.0"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","0"

It begins exactly where Warrior Within ends, so I recommend you to play, not only WW, but also The Sands of Time, because of the strong storyline connection.\n\nWhile the first two games of this trilogy are a wonderful masterpiece from the very first second to the end, in TT we experience a quiet slow and weak beginning, mostly because of the sloppy fights and small, uninspired scenarios.\n\nBut the game will get stronger and more interesting soon, by adding brand new concepts and systems to the PoP series, like a satisfying stealth combat system, some funny chariot races, new platforming elements, and, what's more important, the dark prince as a playable character.\n\nAs the dark prince, you will have more strength, more powers, new platforming abilities... It helps to make the game much deeper. Add this to great boss fights, excellente puzzles, some beautiful scenarios plus a full controller compatibility and 1080p resolution, and you have a HUGE game, with an epic and unforgettable finale.","December 31, 2014","true","7.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

If they had a system closer to future Spider-Man: Web of Shadows, that would make this game at least equal with WW.\n\nWeapons are a complete disappointment, seems such a downgrade comparing to WW - small set number of weapons, easily breakable, no characteristics. To know, for example, that the sword of a Sand Guard replenishes the sand by itself was a very useful piece of information that I found on some website. Not in the game...\n\nWhat was definitely an improvement - boss battles. Comparing to feeble SOT battles and somewhat repetitive (yet awesome) battles from WW - here we have a battle with acrobatics and speedkills before the actual battle, battle with both Princes fighting, dual-duel (even though it's kinda repetitive) and the Vizier (second stage is imbalanced and too can be hard without slowing the time).\n\nPity that some monsters were transferred and made worse (Silhouettes from WW now slower and less intimidating).\n\nStill, it is a good conclusion to te series.

I read several reviews online that gave glowing reviews of this sequel and said that it was far better than Warrior Within.  I completely disagree.  If you've played through Sands of Time and Warrior Within, then of course you should buy this game and see how the story ends.  But I finished the game feeling dissatisfied.\n\nThe game offers two major improvements over Warrior Within:  the speed-kill system and a better atmosphere.  The speed-kill system lets you dispatch enemies from stealth, like an assassin.  I guess it was pretty cutting edge back in 2005, but I didn't feel the magic.  Sure, it opens up an entirely new play style, but it takes some trial-and-error to get the timing right.  This killed the mood for me.  What's the point of a cool, cinematic fight sequence if I have to keep retrying it because I missed the timing on a single click of the mouse?  I didn't master the speed-kill system until about halfway through the game, and by that point it had lost its appeal.  My verdict:  the speed-kill system is great on your second play through, but be prepared to invest some practice before you can pull it off consistently.\n\nI won't say too much about the atmosphere, except that it's an improvement.  The designers set the game in Babylon and got rid of the gothic Warrior Within vibe.  So that's a plus.  Oh, and there are some very cool battles where you can fight with chains.\n\nSo what about the problems?  Well, there are several.  To avoid spoiling anything, I'll just mention that the prince has a certain "dark companion" in this installment.  Their dialogue is meant to be a witty banter but it really falls flat.  The "dark companion" dialogues are cheesy and his voice sounds whiny rather than menacing.\n\nMy major annoyance has to do with the boss battles.  In my opinion, what made earlier installments of Prince of Persia so great was their level design.  A reasonably skilled player could fight through entire levels and puzzles without having to reload constantly.  Sure, there were a few mindbending challenges, but generally the games were high-paced and exciting.  Warrior Within is the perfect example of this:  the Dahaka chases were fast-paced races that kept you on your toes and that rewarded quick-thinking.  You didn't have to practice over and over again just to succeed on a Dahaka chase sequence.\n\nTwo Thrones is just the opposite.  Most of the bosses can only be killed if you know the specific trick sequence necessary to finish them off.  For almost all of the bosses, there is no way you will figure out the trick on your first try.  The boss battles completely kill the pacing of the game because you have to stop and figure out the specific trick you have to use to get through the challenge.  It's not at all appropriate for a high-speed adventure game series like Prince of Persia.  Also, just because you've played through the first two games without any trouble does not mean you'll be ready for this third game.  I spent the first 25% of the game just learning the new timing and figuring out the new sets.\n\nTo sum up:  Two Thrones has a cool speed-kill system and a better atmosphere than Warrior Within.  These features are great for your second and third playthroughs, because by that point you'll know the game's tricks and you'll be able to play it at an exciting, high speed.  But otherwise it's a definite downgrade from Warrior Within.  Sands of Time and Warrior Within are still fun to play in 2015 (and great bargains these days)--Two Thrones just kind of sucks.  But you should play it anyway if you've already been through Sands of Time and Warrior Within, because that way you can see how the story ends.","August 29, 2015","false","23.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

I'd previously played both Sands of Time and Warrior Within, the latter of which I particularly disliked, and also the first Assassin's Creed game. So I've had enough experience with these Ubisoft action-adventure games to be able to say I don't like them.\n\nPerhaps this is why I chose to play the game on Easy, but whatever the reason, it was the right choice; it made the bad parts tolerable and left the good parts untouched. And there really are some genuinely good parts. No, fantastic parts, to the game. And all of them are in the form of the parkour-style climbing, which on it's own makes the Sands of Time trilogy an important milestone in platforming games.\n\nConversely, the fluff that pads the game out is the combat; understandably dated, but none-the-less dull as drokk. The problem's not that it's too simple, but that it takes so damn long and as I said, I was playing on Easy, so I dread to think what it's like at the harder difficulties.\n\nUltimately, the reason I can't recommend this game is because of a glitch on The Middle Tower level (the penultimate one, no less). Right near the end of the section there's one of the springboards that flings you 45 degrees, in this case towards a knife pad. For whatever reason, no matter how many times I tried, I landed to the right of the knife pad, about two feet out of reach. I'd exhausted all my sand tanks three times before I called it quits, if it was nearer the checkpoint it wouldn't be such a big deal, but I was having to repeat the same combat sequences each time and that was really the nail in the coffin for me.","July 22, 2015","false","9.0"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","6","0","0"

An example: If I move my mouse switftly over my mousepad, the change of angles is about 160°, but when I do so more slowly, then the camera rotates several times, which I feel is completely unnatural. On the other hand, the game tries to figure out what you want to look at (I suppose), so you also get stuck and mouse movements are being ignored. Settings to significantly improve upon this situation are non-existent.\n\nThe second issue I had was that at several points in the game white/yellow blobs exploded on my screen, soon making it completely white or yellow. Certainly not intended to happen as alt-tabbing in and out clears this temporarily. I use Windows 7 and a GeForce GTX 650 Ti and tried suggestion to disable fog and vsync as well as to change the compatibility mode of the binary, neither of which helped.\n\ntldr; Not recommended for keyboard+mouse users with low frustration threshold. As an aged game this might not work well on every modern PC.","March 21, 2014","false","1.4"," 5 of 20 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","5","20","0","1"

The game was really short and rushed. The story and dialogue were poorly written  and inconsistent. Rather than tweak and enhance the formula that has been established in the previous two game this game chooses to do the opposite. The mulitple endings in the previous game have been ditched for a single one. The nonlinear play style has also been ditched. The new 'Speed Kill' mechanic is annoying and I found it to be rather hit and miss for me. I was contantly rewinding because I missed my window. This was even more infuriating during the boss fights when I was the only way to defeat the enemy.\nUsing speed kill as the dark prince was much more satifiiying. It felt more stealthy and was just easier overall. I really like playing as the dark prince, the change in fighting stlye was nice, but it felt unpolished. I hated the banter between the prince and the dark prince. It was so annoying and after dieing/rewinding and having to hear it over and over again, i just ended up putting it on mute. And I never really understood where the dark prince came from. Was he a side effect of the sands, or something left over from sand wraith?\nI didn't like how the game forced you to use the dark prince only during certain times. It would be cool if you could choose and depending on how much you use him or for what events it triggers differnt alternative plot lines and areas on the map. Say if you defeated the Vizier as the Dark prince you would trigger the bad end and would simply take the vizier's place and a sand god.\nOverall this game is not as sophisticated as it's predecessor. I do not mind the lightening of the tone and color pallette but it would be nice if that came about because of your actions in game.","May 8, 2015","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't have as much combat as Warrior Within but when it does you get to fight as the Dark Prince, and there's multiple fun boss battles which adds some spice to the recipe. I think it has the perfect balance between puzzles from the first game and combat from the second. It brings all the great aspects of both previous games to the table.\n\nPuzzles are probably the most fun in the trilogy, the level design and environments are ♥♥♥♥ing great, the new parkour mechanics are cool as well and serve as a great compliment to the already established parkour system from the previous games. The soundtrack is also top notch in these series as always.\n\nThe story picks up right where Warrior Within left off and we get to see a less edgy prince who wants to make up for his mistakes. There's an immediate connection with the first game with the return of the original voice actor and the constant conversations between characters and head narration just like Sands of Time, there's never a dull moment thanks to the random serious or funny interactions and it feels much more personal. If there was one thing about Warrior Within that I didn't like was the absence of narration and the only conversations you'd get would be in cutscenes. Even though the game is a direct sequel to Warrior WIthin storywise if feels much more like what Sands of Time 2 would look like.\n\nOverall, a great sequel and end to a trilogy.
