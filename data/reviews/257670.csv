I did not find the ingame tutorials particularly helpful.\n\nI've never played the board game version of this, but I am a board game fan, so I took to this game pretty quickly. Great fun, played it with my girlfriend, we both played two different characters (though this game is not technically multiplayer). This game is hard, perhaps thats why it really gives me "roguelike" feels while playing. I really enjoyed it overall, I'd recommened it to friends looking to kill time. Unfortunately it being single player I feel the game loses some of the charm and fun that it would have as a board game played with friends.","November 29, 2013","true","6.5"," 69 of 85 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","69","85","0","0"

I would like to see an online multiplayer because playing with other makes it so you are not gonna die alone and just to make it a bit more "fun", make it so you can choose ancient one at random.\n\nI like this game both digital and physical and this just scratched the board game itch.

I wondered why they said this, and bought it anyway. Having put quite a few hours into this game (enough to have almost finished once, plus more) I definitely don't think it's luck based. I also own the board game and believe me the computer based version is much easier (mainly because the rules are about as clear as mud for the board game - playing the PC version actually helped clear up some questions with the board game itself)\n\nHaving said all that; the game can be frustrating. Often you fail a quest a few times and you can't see any reason why accept bad luck, but luck doesn't determine the whole game. It's extremely important to pick the right characters and use their abilities to the fullest. For example, Kate the Scientist is immune to terror effects and really this is one of the most useful abilities in the game. Amanda is able to complete multiple tasks per roll, again an amazingly useful ability. Mandy has a built in ability to (once per day) re-roll two glyphs. Very handy. Sister Mary ignores locked glyphs completely. Last but not least in my go to list of characters is Mark who can complete tasks in any order. This can be extremely advantageous when facing several rooms with numbered tasks.\n\nAnother way in which this game isn't just luck is the way in which it takes practice. Practice to know when to use a character and when to heal them, and which tasks to give them. Having no prior experience with Elder Signs you can't just pick up this game and be fantastic at it. That would prove it was luck based more than it being difficult I think.\n\nOverall, this game is really good and definitely worth what I paid for it. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind being occasionally screwed over, but wouldn't recommend it to people who frustrate easily or want to rage quit a lot. The Elder Signs and the surrounding story is also really interesting, especially for fans of H.P. Lovecraft.","March 11, 2015","true","11.2"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","23","23","0","0"

Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos monsters. It plays like a Yahtzee-style game, the artwork is gorgeous, and the setting's fun. The game is very challenging and that challenge is not for everyone. The final three Old Ones are BRUTAL to try and beat - Cthulhu likes to sap both health and Sanity, the Dark Pharaoh/Nyarlathotep is a marathon run where you must contend with draining sanity and constantly spawning tough monsters, and Ithaqua's got a mechanic where you have to constantly keep your supplies and rations up or your whole team will die in the cold, unforgiving wastelands. The random number gods are cruel and seem actively against you in this game, making it feel nearly hopeless and as if the game itself wants you to lose. Very fitting for the themes of a Lovecraftian tabletop game!\n\nThat said, there's still a few things wrong with it.\n\nFirst of all, no multiplayer support. This is a problem, since the original tabletop game is best with a bunch of friends. Also, only four Investigators? Really? In the tabletop version you can have as many Investigators as you have players. There is also no optional rule to choose a new Investigator when one of your group dies as in the tabletop version, a decision which absolutely baffles me. Also, where are Shub-Nigorath and Yog-Sothoth? They've been removed entirely from this version and are nowhere to be found, which truly saddens me as both had some interesting mechanics in the original tabletop game. I hope the developers add them in via patch later, but seeing as this game hasn't been patched in months I doubt that will happen...\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, I do, if you love Lovecraftian horror, the original tabletop game or Arkham Horror, or like the feeling of gambling without losing any actual money. Otherwise, you'll likely find it much too frustrating for your taste...","July 30, 2015","true","46.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","1"

It said that drawing of the tokens is random, but it doesn't explain that the tokens are actually d6 dice, so in the beggining you have no idea what the odds are. Also I think that it didn't explain, that blocking of the dice by monters, etc. is global, so removing these blocks are usually do-or-die decisions.\n\nNow that I have come to understand the rules better I am extremely happy with the game, and must admit, that it gives exactly the same kind of thrill as much more complicated Arkham Horror.

The player takes control of four investigators and chooses who they will be dealing with, with each adventure having their own opponents with their own effects on the game. At first, you'll find easy tasks to do in your home museum. Later adventures expand past the museum, letting you go to other locations as well as giving you entirely new tasks. These adventures can be played in any order as well.\n\nWhile I can not say I know the original boardgame, it does appear to have been four player. It seemed odd at first that they would turn it into a singleplayer game then, but after some playing I can safely say that the four investigators only barely interact with eachother, so instead of four players each playing a fourth of a game, they instead have one player playing the whole thing. Controls are not awful either, as one would expect from a boardgame made into a video game.\n\nIf you do not like random chance, this may not be something for you. The entire game exists of smaller adventures, in which you get what are essentially dice and need to match dice with the situation's requirements to pass. You may be lucky and complete a difficult quest in one try, or you may spend 3 turns failing at one of the simplest ones.  Luckily, you have items and investigator special powers that will help you get through them. In the end, you will always have an element of random chance in it, but even then, it's a pretty good way to spend some time during slow periods.\n\nAnd, of course, Lovecraft. The adventures have plenty of flavour to them and seem to be pretty close to how one would play through a Call of Cthulhu game, although clearly with less pen and paper roleplaying stuff and with more singleplayer set-in-stone stories that you can progress through.\n\nPh'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn\n\nBe sure to keep him that way, it would be a shame if he woke.

If this game ever goes on sale for $10 or less, I think that many people would be satisfied.\n\nThis game is essentially a solo-player board game. You can play it with friends, but being huddled around a computer isn't exactly the most satisfying experience for playing a board game. So play it solo or at most with one partner. If you want to play with four people, buy the board game. Now it may sound rather unappealing having only one player control all of the characters, however this allows that single player to develop strategies that some parties would not be able to come across easily.\n\nThis game is surprisingly deep and is very replayable. I will admit that I had thought that playing and completing each board once would be it, however my 51+ hours thus far in this game will say otherwise. Each character brings enough to the table for the player to enjoy mixing things up. The more difficult boards also bring a great deal of variety as there are multiple stages to these campaigns. The more difficult campaigns also do have small variations for example, the Dark Phaoroh board has two final bosses that you can face.\n\nIn a way, this game is like a rogue-like adeventure game. If rogue-likes are up your alley, this game may be able to satisfy your preferences.\n\nThe game is difficult at start, but as the player is able to better strategize, the game becomes more manageable. The only difficult part of the game that the player cannot exactly control is the randomness of the glyph (dice) rolls. In this game, the player can somewhat control the random factor with items but complete control is impossible. This may be a put-off for some players as RNG isn't exactly appealing for the masses. However, good strategy will prevail over the RNG factors.\n\nThis board game is based on the Cthullu mythos which may be appealing for some players. For those looking for story here, well, it's a board game and you can't really expect any story. The game does come with snippets and references to Lovecraft's writings. If you have read Lovecraft's writings, you may be amused to recognize some quotes that are in the game.\n\nThis game retains its touch interface gameplay which can somewhat be a hindrance on the PC. Worry not though, it's still easy to navigate however it would have been nice to see better optimization for screen space usage and actually have tooltips. If you are one a Windows 8 PC with touch capability, then you'll find the retention of touch interface to be nice however the screen space usage issue still stands.\n\nThis game is a nice one to play while traveling as its a low pressure game and good for casual playtime. So putting this on your laptop/Windows 8 tablet is fairly nice. This game also features a save (only one save though) so if you are ever interrupted, you can always come back to your game later. One disappointing thing is that this game does not seem to work with Steam's cloud save. So as a player who uses a desktop and a Windows 8 tablet, it's unfortunate to see that my progress isn't saved on both devices.\n\nI must warn you that this game is excessively power hungry. It's rather surprising seeing a game with low PC requirements hog so much power. This game also starts making my desktop fans whirl which also leads me to believe that optimization, in general, isn't there. It would be nice if the developer can better optimize the game for the PC so that it doesn't drain so much power. Expect to plug in your laptop/tablet after one round. I can even run the game, Dark Souls, for twice as long which is rather ridiculous. With this, it's hard to suggest this as an on-the-go game for your laptop/windows tablet.\n\nI think I've said enough here, want a number rating?\n8/10\nIt's good.\n\nIf you ever want to see the game in action before buying it, my YouTube channel features this game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/gameshoes","February 19, 2014","true","62.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

I like this insecurity, sometimes dice will get locked... which of course even offers more suspense and frustration at the same time.\n\nAlways keep the special abillities of your investigators in mind - it will give the edge you need to get your foe down.\n\nSolid 9/10 for playabillity and fun.","May 3, 2014","true","42.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Now if you know board games you'll have just gotten interested cause these guys are the bomb when it comes to table top gaming. They make Arkham Horror, Battle Star Galatica, Relic and several dozen more awesome games.\n\nThe game play looks complicated to start with (shame there are no tool tips), but soon it feels natural and you zip through turns. There is an element of chance, as you roll dice, but careful use of investigator's abilities and items lets you stack things in your favour. There are Lovcraftian chalanges, evil books, evil libraries no evil libraians :( and naturally portholes to other dimensions. Suceed at these you get prizes, fail and bad things happen (monsters, injury, madness and the destruction of the world.)   It's hard as nails latter on, though how hard it is depends very much on the investigators strength and weaknesses. I highly recommend taking a random selection as this makes the game both more challenging and more replayable.\n\nThe PC version contains all the DLC from the tablet versions, basically extra boards and new ancient Lovcraftian beasties. This make for a game that will last 10 or so hours on a speed run through, but it has excellent re-playability if this is your genre.\nIt's also a port from ISOs. Like most ports it has its share of porting problems; game assets are up-scaled rather than true HD so they can look a little blurry at 1080p, menus needlessly cover up other menus and there are no tool tips.\n\nOverall I recommend this to anyone who's into the cthulhu mythos and/or board games. The game play is excellent, but single player only and tablet port problems can irritate.","December 4, 2013","true","42.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Sure, I can easily pick out a handful of complaints - there's nothing new, for example, which is a thing you have to consider when rereleasing an older IP. There's the philosophical ickiness inherent in selling a game birthed in what is inherently a social medium for single-player enjoyment, though that, too, can be argued as a means for board gamers to enjoy their favorite products without the necessity of trying to wrangle four separate schedules and convince people to help you lose at a piece of cardboard.\n\nShould you buy it?

You will spend an hour picking out the perfect team, completing tasks, aquiring items, earning money, and advancing slowly to the boss battle, which you will loose because - at the end of the day - the system is based entirely on a 1 in 6 chance that your die will land on a specific face.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like this game. I owned the board game before I bought this, and they play exactly the same. It's a good time vampire, and they do a nice job with some basic naration and cinematics. Another plus is that this game plays nicely on Linux and slower computers. There IS some fun to be had in the strategy of this game, and when properly deployed, can usually defeat the easier Ancient Ones.\n\nPS - If anyone over at Fantasy Flight Games is reading this review, WE WANT A DIGITAL ARKHAM HORROR GAME!

I'm also a big fan of the so-called "Cthulhu Mythos" (i.e. the one owing as much to Sandy Petersen as H.P. Lovecraft), so given that Elder Sign is apparently the somewhat simplified "dice game" version of Arkham Horror, and it's put out by none less than Fantasy Flight themselves, and has the SAME CHARACTERS AS ARKHAM HORROR for that matter, how bad could it or its video game adaptation possibly be?  The answer to that queston, in my ever-so-humble and highly subjective opinion, is that it's NOT "bad" at all...but whether or not it's my "thing" is another matter entirely...\n\nLet me put it this way: As much as I do like board games, I'm not so much of a fan of the Monopolies of the world.  I don't really care, for example, about moving around a board which vaguely approximates a modern urban landscape buying properties and dealing with banks and ♥♥♥♥.  Now, you adapt that kind of board to a cheesy fantasy world like that of Talisman, with taverns instead of banks, and you get to play a troll instead of a dog or a thimble, and as well as rolling the dice to see how many spaces you move you add some "combat" rolls and spells and what-not to the equation, then you're starting to get me interested.  You translate THAT game into Arkham in the 1920s with gangsters and Cthulhoid beasts, and now you've REALLY got my attention.\n\nThe point I'm making is...while we all know, at the end of the day, it's still just rolling some dice and moving some markers around a board, it's the CONTEXT of what said dice-rolling and marker-moving REPRESENTS, in your imagination, which is the thing that makes all the difference as to how much an individual might enjoy a game.  Now, how does all this relate to the single-player VIDEO game I'm currently supposed to be reviewing right here and now, I hear you ask in frustration?  Well, HOLD YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING HORSES, I'M GETTING THERE, ALRIGHT!!!  The thing about Elder Sign, at least in this computer game version, is that unlike, say, the recent video game adaptation of Chainsaw Warrior, where it DID feel like every virtual, simulated dice roll WAS to see if you hit the zombie with a projectile from your laser-lance and so forth, Elder Sign ultimately just feels like a Solitaire-style "card" game with slightly prettier/"spookier" pictures.\n\nNow there's absolutely nothing wrong with this...if you like computer Solitaire.  If you're someone who DOESN'T require a facade of adventurers and monsters and spooky museums and so forth in order to be engaged by the gameplay mechanics, then there really is NOTHING WRONG with this game; bar perhaps that the "luck" element does, at least to judge from my meagre one and a half hours of gameplay thus far, weigh in just a little too heavily compared to the "strategy" element also inherent in such cardy-type games.  But I CAN see how people would get into this, I really can...personally, I just couldn't, but that's just me...\n\nIn the Arkham Horror board-game, if one is playing a gangster with a tommy-gun, he/she rolls the dice to see if their weapon successfully kills a monster.  In Elder Sign, you conjure "glyphs" to do battle with such things, and I'll be ♥♥♥♥ed if I know why a gangster with a tommy-gun is conjuring glyphs when the hulking great be-suited brute should just be firing off lots of bullets in the monster's general direction.  I know it's all just a mechanical REPRESENTATION of what's occurring in the player's imagination and blah-blah-blah, but honestly...I guess I just feel this is requiring a little TOO much of my imagination.  I can also play Solitaire and pretend that the kings and the jacks and what-not represent some kind of in-depth political interfacing, but really, at the end of the day, I figure they just had to put SOMETHING on the cards more interesting than the numbers 1 through 10.\n\nWhat I'm saying here, then, is that this isn't really a game for those of us who want to be taken on an escapist "journey" when we play a video game.  This is more for the types of people who like relatively context-free "strategy" games, the types which usually come for FREE when one buys a computer.  Which is why, after seemingly sitting on the fence on this one, I'm going to ultimately NOT RECOMMEND it.  Fifteen bucks is a tad steep for this type of game...even half that would be pushing its luck, even with the pretty pictures and all.  If you're the kind of person who DOES enjoy a nice, quick, super-challenging game of Solitaire etc, I WOULD perhaps recommend this to you...but even then, maybe wait for it to be five dollars or less, on sale.\n\nNow here's hoping they turn Arkham Horror into a competent video game...that one, I promise you, would be well worth the fifteen bucks...\n\nVerdict: 4/10.","May 25, 2014","false","3.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

I like the original board game. I don't mind difficult games.\n\nBut....\n\nThis digital version kinda ruins the original.\n\n- The probability gen for the dice rolls is WAY broken. Example: I need 1 scroll. I roll 6 green dice to completion and never get a single scroll. Chances of this happening are 2.2% (97.8% success chance). Yet It happens all the time.\n\n- They've removed some of the original rules to make this even harder (being able to stop a mission after completing a step). This rule NEEDS to be in the game, because sometimes a misson is impossible. I've had missons come up that ended up with a monster attached to them later. The mission + monster sometimes requires more dice than what you can even have (your max dice is 8 but the misson may require 9).\n\n- Really difficult missions popping back up RIGHT AFTER you just completed that misson (Im mainly referring to stuff that has a midnight effect, thus you may have just spent all your turns in a round just to get rid of it)\n\nOriginal game is great.\n\nThis game is just something that will ♥♥♥♥ you off until you finally give up.","August 23, 2015","false","19.9"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","0"

I love the board game to death, and this makes a wonderful attempt at provoking the same atmosphere.  The problem with this game is the RNG factor.  The way you play the game is by selecting an adventure, conjuring a set of "glyphs" and then matching the glyphs to the ones required by the adventure.  If you do not have the proper glyph(s) to complete the adventure, you may reconjure your glyph set.  However, when you reconjure a glyph set, the number of glyphs in the set reduces by one.  If you cannot match all the adventure glyphs before you run out, the adventure is failed and your investigator suffers the consequences.\n\nI cannot stress enough how much RNG is in this game.  While each character has their own unique abilities, many of them simply cause more RNG.  (One allows a "clue" which usually allows one complete reroll at no number penalty to instead be two rerolls at no number penalty.)  Some, however, allow you to change one particular glyph type to another particular glyph type once per day.  However, if you do not need the second glyph type, the power doesn't help.  It is incredibly frustrating to need one particular glyph, use all your clues rerolling, reconjure until you have no glyphs left, and never get that particular glyph.  For instance, this happened to me against a particular adventure four times in a row.  I have never been so frustrated.\n\nAnother RNG problem comes in the form of certain adventure effects.  Some adventures have effects on the overall game if left unchecked (a great idea).  One such effect is that if the adventure is left until midnight, it has a detrimental effect (again, great idea).  The problem with this is two-fold.  The day is divided into four parts and your adventurers each play during a particular part.  This means that if a midnight-proccing adventure spawns in the last quadrant, your last investigator MUST attempt that adventure if you wish to avoid the adverse effect.  The other problem is that midnight-proccing adventures can spawn anytime another adventure is completed.  This means that if your fourth quadrant investigator completes an adventure and the next adventure that spawns is a midnight-proccing one, the time will change to midnight and the effect will proc with no way of stopping it.\n\nMy recommendations for this game:\n- No game is without redemption.  This game is SO close to being a highly recommended game, but it falls short in that the tactics are rather shallow and a lot of the game is based solely on luck.  I would recommend changing the style of the game into more of a card game.  This would mean that your glyphs were essentially things you could play against the adventure rather than having to match the symbols.  This would also open up more interesting investigator powers.\n- If two investigators are working together on an adventure, allow the second adventurer to be more than a sherpa.  Let them use their powers or items or something.\n- I like that certain adventures have effects on the game as a whole, but the ones that cause midnight effects should not be allowed to spawn just before it turns to midnight, meaning that there is no way for the player to avoid the effect.\n\nIn conclusion:  While I can't recommend this game, I love the people who made it.  It's a great attempt and with a bit of tweaking this could become a fantastic game.  I want to see more from these developers because they show serious potential.","November 29, 2013","false","5.9"," 25 of 50 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","25","50","0","6"

This is a very challenging single player experience with that Arkham horror feel.\nIt’s niche, so this game may not appeal to all gamers. But if you like Arkham Horror, this game will be a great time waster for you.\nIt contains a lot of the content from Arkham Horror, including familiar investigators, monsters and Entities. The dice mechanics is more interesting, as you need to weigh your chances of getting the desired results.\nGet used to cursing yourself for not seeing the obvious at times, wishing for an undo button. And expect to go through a number of games to understand the way you can save dice results.\nYig will be an obtainable victory, however any other Entity you face will be an extreme challenge. The difference is more like Yig = Hard... (skip extremely difficult, or almost impossible or just impossible) Other Entity’s = Extremely Impossible\nAt least, that is what it feels like.\nYou will need to build an understanding of your investigators individual special abilities and use them to help you save the world.

It is a puzzle game with lot of random stuff happening, random monsters and random events popping up on the map. Elder signs shares some similarity with simple dice game, since conquering a event, beating a monster relays solely on getting the right roll. The twist comes from your character abilities or assets you acquire, and how the ancient one you are battling affects the gameplay.\n\nTo hard?Before writing this review I saw a lot of negative comments saying this game is to hard. I would like to answer to that, of course this game is difficult, all games rooted in Cthulhu mythos are supposed to be hard since the inevitable doom is part of the lore. In that sense this games sticks to all Cthulu board games tradition just like other titles: Arkham Horror, Eldrich Horror & Masion of Madness (although I don't know it these were made into PC games as well).\n\nYou can win :) Winning is all about choosing the right investigators for the challenge, using wisley resources you acquire, and paying attention to what events arise. Most of all you should not give up when something goes wrong, be flexible and adjust your startegy.\n\nNo for everyoneI`ve played this alot on my mobile and occasionally I play it on my PC. This is not a game for everyone, because most of the gamers are not used to loosing, and in case of Elder Sings loosing a battle agains ancient one is a part of the game and part of the fun of enjoying Cthulthu mythos. I advise this game to all casual players, Cthulhu fans, and everyone who likes a game that posed some challenge.","December 13, 2015","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You lose one dice per reroll and can save one die. If you don't get it you lose a hitpoint (mental or physical).\nThats it.\n\nIt's really boring and super-random since you have only a minor influence on your rolls and (in the example above) if you don't get the four number ones again and again you just lose at some point and thats really frustrating.\nAnd since you have to do this high-number-of-one-die-required adventures pretty often and get penalties if you don't solve them the odds are stacked against the player in a big way.\nYou might say thats part of the cthulhu mythos but here you just lose by failing "adventures" with mathematical small percent chances and thats not fun.

Luck is all you need, because no matter what you do, the only thing that affect your so call "adventure" are nothing but blind luck that allow you to shack up the right combination of Glyphs to match the requirement to clear a "Tiny Picture of Something Related to CoC"... and that is all the Adventure you ever going to get in this game at all!\n\nAnd how to lose the game? You are RIGHT! You lose the game by simply being NOT LUCKY ENOUGH!! You run out of chance and can't shack up the right combination of Glyphs? TOO BAD! The Old One +1 and you lose SP for that... not because some dark horror lurking in the shadow, but just because you forgot to bring your lucky dice!\n\nSo in this great game, all you need to do to serve Cthu-Boss on a plate is simple, just show him your lucky dice and he will ROLL OVER AND DIE!! YAY! That is GREAT!! We no longer need to go through dark woods or horror tunnel, we no longer need to search haunted house and deathly crypt, no knowledge needed, no weapon needed, you don't even need to bring your cat to try to scare off those fish-head, you just need PALE LUCK!\n\nIf you are a COC fan, or who had read H.P.Lovecraft's book... STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!! This is for kids under 3!!\n\n\n\nOkie... I have to point out... The music and art style of this game is still fairly nice tho... But sadly...","November 28, 2013","false","2.7"," 19 of 69 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","19","69","0","0"

However, since it's based on a dices and cards game, the rules might seem a little bit abstract to anyone new to the game.  For example, a gun doesn't do a set amount of damage, its a consumable item that will instead allow the player to get a yellow glyph, which is an additional dice that will give a result in a form such as a peril, lore or investigation icon, and these are used to solve given tasks, so there is no real feeling of battling monsters, as they do not have health points.  It's a really nice buy for anyone looking for a lovecraftian experience, as it is of course the main inspiration for the theme of this game.  Great atmosphere, nice images.","August 21, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The presentation is top-notch, and the atmosphere is great. It only took me one playthrough to fully understand the game.

However, it does include many of the fun things from the board games. I have not played the dice game this is based off of, but the other games by this maker in the Lovecraft mythos are my bread and butter. This is much easier and quite enjoyable.\n\nThe game is set up to be hard. And for games that include mostly luck, hard means frustrating odds. You'll need just one card to be right but after 5 rolls and over 20 tries, nothing. It's frustrating. But it's also rewarding when you win. I don't think the scoring is all that great but winning at all is a thing to treasure.\n\nGameplay is between an hour and 3, depending on how long it takes to think up strategies or guess where you'll be most successful. It's a decent time. Not too long, and you can always speed it up.\n\nA few problems. The transitions between players is annoying. It closes and opens a wall sort of thing every turn. It bothers me a bit. As another reviewer said, you can't sacrifice yourself. You'll complete a task and incur the penalty (which can happen for winning) and get killed. But the task gets uncompleted! I think sacrificing yourself should be included in the game. Especially with the nature of the environment being so dire.\n\nOverall a basic and good game. I do recommend, but it's too expensive. It should be $10 or below.","July 16, 2014","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mgsh/recommended/257670/","mgsh","Blau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mgsh/","200 products in account","In short, this is the digitalized version of the tabletop game of the same name. It's a campaign-based RPG, where you have to battle the Ancient Gods of the Lovecraft books whilst you complete tasks and adventures via the use of glyphs (these practically dice with the symbols used in the game). Accordingly, I would mainly recommend it to:\n- Fans of the mentioned books and literature\n- People who have played the tabletop game or similar titles (Eg. Arkham Horror)\n\nPros:\n- It's very atmospheric, the storytelling is spot-on with a few cinematics\n- The game-design and imagery are also well-made, probably simply taken from the original tabletop, so you can't go wrong there.\n- The game runs perfectly, I haven't had any technical issues after about 13 hours of playtime\n\nCons:\n- The game's strategy comprises of the generation of glyph results and how you use them, as well as your invetory items and the abilities of your investigators. The glyphs - as I mentioned - refer to dice with the game's symbols, meaning that in this instance - compared to the original tabletop - the game throws the dice instead of you, practically. This can give the sensation to the player from time to time that it's screwing with you intentionally (as in: "It's cheating!!!!"). Eg. I have rolled a very bad result on my first roll, I want to re-roll all my glyphs only to see exactly the same terrible results afterwards.\n- As others have mentioned before and based on my experience as well, this game can be hard and challenging, a LOT of times. In my opinion, we may categorize it as one those that's not for everyone.\n- And, as others have been aching for it, but never got it, this game hasn't been discounted on sale since it's been released on steam, unfortunately. It would have been nice, but no dice.\n\nI have no regrets though for buying it at full price. It has fulfilled my expectations. I consider it a solid game and will surely play it for several hours more. The Ancient Ones must not return! :)","June 21, 2015","true","25.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lovecraft.  In the game you have to seal away an ancient one before it rises and destroys the world.  how do you do that? Well...by rolling dice...yup.\n\nMost fo the Campains take place in the Arkham Museum.  A number of random adventures are "drawn" and you pick an investigator to takle them by rolling dice and trying to get specific combinations of symbols.  You have items to give you things like more dice or rerolls to help you get the roll you need but the game mostly boils down to pure luck.  Fortuantly the game is well presented and it doesn't take long to play so it makes for a light time waster despite the dark theme.\n\nThe look and feel of the Arkham universe is well represented with lots of the art taken straight from the board game and given a nice touch up. music and sound effects are creepy and what little animation and voice acting is well done.\n\nThere are even some extra hard Campains that have several phases and despite being bull ♥♥♥♥ hard are a nice additon.\n\nmy only gripe is that in the original game if you couldn't stop the ancient one from rising then you have a last ditch chance to beat them in a boss fight.  In this version if the ancient one ever awkens you just auto lose. kinda a disapointment.

So far, i lost 20 games and only won 2 games.","November 1, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So if board games aren't your thing, then this game isn't for you.  It's fully based on the Lovecraft mythos, so the whole game has that creepy feel, which I do like.  It's replayable to the max, considering in my 2 hours of play time, I've never had quite the same game twice.  Gameplay, well, think Cthulhu Yahtzee.  That pretty much sums up the game.  Oh, and did I mention that in those two hours, I have not won one game....ON EASY? Problem with that is that this game is addictive as hell.  It has that "one more quick game" thing going for it.","September 17, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Pretending to be a decetive/archoligist and try breaking the clues and elimating monster that try end the world. I like when they finally got the steam trading cards out for this... but Im hoping for achivenments as well. When I played this game... last two monsters are..ughhh annoying and i really want to kill them.(lol) It is really fun...gotta figure out the stratgic and try collecting elder signs before the monster awake up and ending the world.","February 26","true","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am a huge Lovecraft and Cthulhu mythos fan, so I am a somewhat disappointed because it fails to instill complete unrelenting terror in me while I am playing. The soundtrack is very lacking - this is the main tool they could have used to really haunt us (with a small budget, that is). I am also a big fan of the Call of Cthulhu boardgame by Fantasy Flight, which this little game is based on, but it barely scratches the surface compared to the depth the boardgame offers. They could have done so much more. One idea could have been to add a multiplayer (with a lobby) and a text chat, that would have really added a lot. Playing together is one of the biggest pluses of the game as not very many games that allow that. Maybe in the next game? Oh well, one can dream...\n\nAbout the gameplay, it is quite heavily luck based (pray to Cthulhu to get them lore glyphs! - yeah right...) and that's how it should be in my opinion. You just make the best of the situations that you can (more like, choose the encounters that will least likely end in complete and utter failure, heh!)\n\nAll in all, I still recommend this game if you want a game to play on a dark night (you can put on a proper lovecraftian soundtrack on YT and shiver).","February 6","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only wish that the first four scenarios had been as unique as the later three; as it is, with some minor differences, the first four scenarios are rather alike: the same intro, same ending, same location - the only difference lies in which advantages, disadvantages and monsters you'll face in them. Had this been the case, I'd feel a little more inclined to recommend the game for the price of 15 euro that it's being sold for. As it is... Perhaps better to wait until there's a steam discount for it. It's also a minor disappointment that there's no multiplayer for it. Also, while I'm no big fan of archivements, I feel that they could at least have added one for each of the ancients... Recommended first and foremostly to fans of the cthulhu mythos and fans of the Arkham Horror series of games (and as a footnote, I hope those board games - Arkham Horror, Eldritch Horror and Mansions of Madness will someday be made into games like this as well), but I encourage others to give it a chance as well!","February 7","true","127.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
