The plot is the same as its always been, but with a twist. Dr. Robotnik, the evil antagonist of most every Sonic game has now teamed up with Metal Sonic! The dude with 90s attitude isn't alone though, he now has Tails to go with him. With Tails, come new mechanics, such as jumping into the air, and calling Tails to lift Sonic like a helicopter. If you're on the ground and use the tag button, it summons Tails to combine the two for a super fast attack. If you need to use the helicopter ability, the game will have a little billboard to tell you. This game feels more a kin to the Game Boy Advance games than the original Genesis games which the first episode clearly drew inspiration from.\n\nIn Episode 2, you have four zones with three acts each followed by a boss fight as a fourth act. Not just that, but later into the four hour game, you unlock a playable Metal Sonic with four zones and one act each. These zones use assets from the first episode. So in all, there are 16+ levels for you to master. These levels feel a lot longer than the first episode and the Genesis games as a whole. Some levels feel like six minute marathons with no end in sight.\n\nThe levels are big and offer many paths to the exit. You'll have to avoid an array of enemies, spikes, and even death traps. You'll collect rings everywhere and these rings aren't just because dullards love shinny things, but as long as Sonic has at least one ring, he can take another hit. Even if you have 100 rings and get hit, only 30 will spray out of Sonic. When you get hit with no rings, it means death for the fuzzy blue guy. There are plenty of check points in each level if you die. A game over simply means that you'll need to start the level again. If you collect 100 rings in a level, you get an extra life. If you have 50+ rings at the end of the level, a giant ring will appear that will take you to a special bonus stage.\n\nThese bonus stages are updated versions of the old Sonic 2 bonus stages. You'll follow Sonic running down a 3D half pipe. You can boost and jump. There are a few check points that need X amount of rings to get past. So as Sonic, you'll solemn down the tube moving left and right, collecting rings and dodging obstacles that will lose you rings. At the end you'll find a chaos emerald.... that somehow isn't green. Whatever. Collect all seven to unlock a yellow Super Sonic.\n\nNew to the Sonic 4 series is local co-op and even online co-op, but since the game came out in 2011, good luck trying to find a partner. There are online leader boards for time attacks. It adds to the replayability I guess, but more than that, the game has a red star ring on each level to collect. These rings are either tough to find or tough to get. Its an extra challenge for veterans.Sonic and Metal Sonic play the same. Left and right to move, with a single button to jump. Hold down to duck and hit the jump button to start a spin dash to get momentum to go up slopes. You still need to charge it which takes time. That's why the airborne dart attack is not only a much better way to gain speed instantly, but you can also lock in on targets accurately hit them no matter what the angle. Episode 2 didn't make as much use of the homing attack as the first episode, but it does make travel easier, darting for an enemy or a springboard. The only difference between Metal Sonic and the ordinary version is lack of an ally. No helicoptering around or bowling through enemies.\n\nCalling Tails just feels slow. Tails automatically zips right back to Sonic wherever he is, unless he just died, but it just halts the game to wait. The Sky Fortress kicks off with an airplane mission that has Sonic atop Tail's plane that gives you full control to move the plane left, right, up and down. Complete with Sonic able to jump and attack. Under normal circumstances, I'd think it diversifies gameplay having a plane dodge enemies and twirl through barricades to destroy them. This felt like a slow auto scrolling level (act). There was still a part where the 2D platforming returned, but then it was just back to being on top of a plane. It felt dull, slow and boring. Then having to fight the boss on the plane was unfun.\n\nThe real snag that I have for this game is how long and dull the boss battles are. They take traditional, classic boss battles and completely twist them around into mega bosses. See I like the twists and fighting giant bosses, I just don't like how tedious every boss was. Having to damage each boss for three minutes before the final phase of the boss fight left me clueless and dead ate up most of my 4 hours in the game. These 3 minutes on each attempt felt like 10 and I was never in any real danger. It wasn't a challenge surviving the 3 minutes, it was just a delay for the real challenge. At least the game takes full advantage of having Metal Sonic as an enemy. You get three boss fights against him.\n\nThe game has other down sides too, like a timed race against sand flooding an area. Sonic needs to go up, breaking through barriers, then down. This would separate the casual players from the hardcore. It ate up two dozen lives and was quite the difficulty spike. Then on the final two levels, when Sonic went down hill or uphill, the entire screen would shift so Sonic wasn't running downhill, he was on a horizontal plane. It was disorienting, and might cause someone motion sickness.\n\nWater areas feel better in this game than they have in the past. Sonic jumps higher and Tails can carry him, so you have more maneuverability. Under water still slows down Sonic and he can't swim. If you're underwater too long, Sonic will need to get oxygen from big air bubbles that drift their way up.\nThe soundtrack feels Genesis in a good way. Percussion and synth horns. Its all upbeat happy game music. The graphics are bright and vibrant. There is a good color pallet here. A dusty yellow castle with an aquatic greenish blue moat. A winter wonderland theme park, lit up for a holiday with blue ice water. A metallic sandy red oil rig in a yellow desert. A yellow sky fortress with fans to propel Sonic into the air. Dr. Robotnik's gray and purple metal lair. As each zone progressed, the acts would change their color pallets so you'll see day turn to dusk. It all adds to making each of the three acts feel different. Having Metal Sonic's 4 different zones with 1 act each adds a lot of diversity, even if 3 acts each would have been nicer.\n\nEven with all the bad, its still a good game. Better than most other 2D platforms out there for $15. I enjoyed the first episode better, but it felt like they took the gameplay a step in the right direction. If its on sale, take a risk.","January 11, 2015","true","4.3"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","42","48","3","2"

This easily could've been the next main series Sonic game as Episode 2 looks WAY different than Episode 1. But was it for the best? Yes. The engine has been updated for full 3D graphics like in Sonic Generations and the physics have been fixed, which was a major problem in Episode 1. Another problem in Episode 1 was unoriginality, which Episode 2 changes around (apart from Not Wing Fortress Zone). The bosses are now not complete jokes but I found the Eggman bosses annoying and enduring complete with a 17 second loop boss theme. I have much more enjoyment with the Metal Sonic fight in White Park before Sky Fortress ruined his reputation. The music is still Mega Drive samples but I found more catchy tunes in this game than Episode 1. Also, this game has Tails who follows Sonic like in Sonic 2 and you can perform tag actions with him, like flying, swimming underwater and 69. So is this an improvement over Episode 1? In my opinion, yes. Still not worthy of the name Sonic 4 but it's a decent improvement. 8/10","December 8, 2013","true","9.1"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","32","35","5","1"

And it works well. It's not like the Sonic 2 co-op, where Tails will just get left behind. You just have to tap a button to reunite Tails and Sonic. The online seems to be sturdy. I had a little bit of lag during the final Acts, but it never became unplayable. But don't expect to just find some rando online, because I don't think many people even REALIZE the online co-op exists. It's not even listed on the steam features blurb. Plus it's a million times better than Episode 1. Skip right to episode 2. And don't believe the people who say this game is "the worst Sonic game ever." It's FUN. And the music and level design are both on-point. The homing mechanism is a little bit broken, though. And there are several frustrating moments towards the end. But it's not a bad game, dammit. It's probably not worth a full $15, though. Or maybe it is, if you can find someone to play with.","July 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

The only 2 things I don't are the game has to show a pop-up everytime you complete a zone and that it's not long enough. The sonic and tails roll ability is unrealistic and makes the game too easy in my opinion, even though it's a cool idea, I just think it needs to be implemented in a different way like in an item box. All in all it has beautiful graphics, physics, and boss fights. The reason I think it has good physics is because it doesn't seem too fast or too slow in my opinion.","November 30, 2015","true","0.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","0"

When you do the spinny thing with tails it looks like they're doing a 69 which is pretty funny. Makes you realize that Sonic is a homosexual because he hates Amy and love Tails.\n\nThe platforming itself was quite lackluster. Most of the levels were just so easy it was rather boring. I really hate the handholding where the game tells you where every bottomless pit is and when you need to use tag team abilities. Can't I die once and intuitively know I need to use the ability next time? The music is also mediocre until it becomes grating because it's so repetitive.\n\nI have little to no reason to replay levels as there's a save system.

It's a tired retread that doesn't come close to any of the Genesis games. There are positive qualities: The storyline is non-existent, a Hedgehog isn't revived by a kiss, the music is bland but okay, and um...yeah that's about it. More than anything else, I appreciate Sonic 4 simply because it makes the previous games look so much better by comparison.\n\nOnce again, the first major failing of Episode 2 is the level-design. Everything feels cramped. It's a combination of the camera being zoomed-in too much, a lack of anything note-worthy nearby, and a general absence of "flow". All of the stages have this boxy feel to them. It's like they were slapped together by some sort of map-maker and the results are really unnatural. Good levels are supposed to be sketched out before-hand, like a storyboard. It allows for the designer to develop a specific theme. In this game, it's more along the lines of: we'll have some jumps, then a ramp, and here's a loop, oh and another loop sounds good, then we'll follow up with some rings, and then... The levels are stretched out enough to fill some allotted amount of time (2-4 minutes), and that's it.\n\nEvery zone in the 2D Sonic games has a different tile-set. Imagine if for Sonic 1, every zone looked like Green Hill. Spring Yard would look like Green Hill. Labyrinth? Green Hill. Starlight? Take a wild guess. Even though every zone looked like one another, they would still be very different, because they have concepts and themes unique to each of them. Every zone in Sonic 4 Ep. 2 is visually distinct, and yet they all feel so similar to each other it doesn't matter. There is the standard array of springs, ramps, traps, and enemy robots. Nothing really changes beyond "Hey you gotta go fast here".\n\nWhen Episode 2 tries new ideas, the results are middling at best. Tails is along for this trek, and the BFFs can perform team-up actions. At practically any moment you can get an assist from Tails to reach higher areas, create a super rolling attack, or swim. The system is implemented awkwardly, as most of the flying sections are forced. Also, due to the poor level-design, it never feels like you've discovered a shortcut or a secret when flying around. This I attribute to the claustrophobic aspects of the level-design. Since you can never see too far in front of you, nothing looks out of reach. Part of the appeal of finding secrets like 1ups and red rings is that you can see them, but you have to consider how they can be collected. In this game, if there's something you can't get to, it's probably because you took a different route. I guess this is to encourage replay value, but it's at the cost of exploration, which isn't a good trade-off.\n\nAnother issue with Tails and - by extension the level-design - is the mechanics. When flying, you have to be careful when approaching cliffs from below. If you press against the wall, what will happen is that Tails will step onto the cliff, and Sonic will fall to his death. This doesn't crop up very often, except for the sections where you're forced to rely on Tails to fly. As with Sonic 4 Ep. 1, the hardest part of any act is towards the end. To put it another way, these parts are the only time where death is a real possibility. They can involve a lot of traps, stupid pet tricks, or other gimmicks. The unbalanced difficulty makes the rest of the act feel like padding. Sonic The Hedgehog games tend to be easy, but there is still some sort of balance, with the later zones being more challenging than the early zones. With this game, all of the difficulty is in these end-of-act sections.\n\nThe boss-fights are garbage. Metal Sonic makes his less-than-triumphant return for this adventure. I've always liked its design, and the Sonic CD "boss-fight" was really cool. In this game, he's ran into the ground. Every other boss-fight involves a duel with Metal Sonic, and the encounters all have this samey design to them. You're constantly running, trying to get a hit on the hedgebot, but an invisible force pushes you backwards while he performs various attacks. You'll fight Robotnik (or was it Eggman?) a few times as well. These fights just run way too long. Some of them start with an interesting look or a cool visual, but then they drag on and on for several minutes. I especially dislike the third boss. It's far too easy, but then in order to get the last hit, you have to awkwardly lure him to the right spot, just to land a super rolling attack.\n\nAs a "bonus", if you own both this game and Episode 1, you get to play a shortened version of Episode 1 starring Metal Sonic. Apparently it takes place shortly after Sonic CD, but I don't care about that. It adds an unnecessary convoluted twist to a storyline that didn't need it. All that really needs to be said is that Robotnik is back, and so is Metal Sonic. It's a freaking robot! Eggman probably just rebuilt the son of a ♥♥♥♥♥, or made a new one. Your best bet is ignoring Sonic Team's attempt at tricking unsuspecting gamers into playing through Episode 1 again. Yes it's a shorter and re-arranged version of the game, but the level-design is still absolutely wretched.\n\nJon Rooke, the European Marketing Director at SEGA, recently had this to say: “Sega has publicly apologised to the fans as the quality of console games in the Sonic franchise hasn’t been acceptable over recent years. It’s been tough translating that iconic side scrolling 2D experience from the 90s into 3D but Sonic is still huge for us so the new games will be more inspired by how it played in its heyday." It's a nice gesture. However, I can't shake the feeling that we'll end up with Sonic 5. I'm certain that it'll star Knuckles, every zone will be a half-hearted throwback to Sonic 3, and it's going to be a thoroughly miserable experience.","October 27, 2015","false","3.5"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","29","52","5","0"

Surprisingly though, I ended up having quite a bit of fun with the sequel. The physics engine is upgraded considerably and, while still not perfect, now feels much closer to the Genesis-era games. The hideous cel-shaded character design from the first episode was also ditched in favor of a cleaner look. Level design and boss battles are also improved from Episode I. The newly-introduced "Tag Actions" feel fresh and make for some nice platforming sequences as well. On the downside, the soundtrack is hit-or-miss (mostly miss) and a little more zone variety would've been nice.\n\nWhile still not on the level of the the 2D Sonic games from the Genesis days, Sonic 4 Episode II manages to hold its own and provide an enjoyable experience that retains that classic Sonic feel while tossing in a few fresh twists here and there. Worth playing if you're a fan of the series.","July 5, 2013","true","3.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I played it for half an hour and thought it wasn't worth playing through, played it again from beginning to end and hated it, and then played it through again and honestly thought it was on par with the Genesis games.\n\nIn comparison to Episode 1 it's definitely better. The physics are improved and the graphics no longer look like New Super Mario Bros. but worse. A lot of people complained that classic Sonic was absent from the first game, and took it way overboard, but I kinda do agree that modern looks really unnatural here. Thankfully there's a mod for that anyway if it bothers you that much.\n\nThe game controls a lot better than Ep1 and it's at least satisfying in this game, but still not quite as solid as in the classic games or even Generations. Sonic feels like he lacks weight on the ground and momentum building isn't quite right, sometimes requiring homing attack spamming just to reach your max speed on the ground.\n\nThe level themes are all blatantly reused concepts with the exception of White Park which while I can compare it to some levels it doesn't outright copy anything. I hate the fact that a game selling itself as Sonic 4 is almost nothing but recycled levels and enemies, but the levels themselves have so many new concepts that it's still pretty fresh as a whole, and the likenesses of Episode 2's levels to classic levels isn't as offensive as in Ep1... with the exception of Sky Fortress which is nearly identical.\n\nThe game's visuals are absolutely gorgeous. I'd say Sonic 4 Ep2 is the most scenic game in the series. It's incredibly polished visually. I can't say the same about the soundtrack, though. While I initially really hated it, I realized on subsequent playthroughs with Super Sonic available I never used him for just one reason; I didn't want to stop the level music. While I do actually really love the compositions themselves, the instrumentation is horrid. They clearly went for a Genesis style tinny-ness to the synths but it just sounds awful on some tracks, specifically Sky Fortress Act II and the Death Egg's theme, two songs which I would actually really like if they used better synths.\n\nOh yeah it's also really short. This game has five zones in total and 25 levels in all if you count the boss levels and special stages. I think with a casual runthrough of both this and Sonic 2, Sonic 2 would still be longer, but I consider Sonic 2 to be fairly short for a Sonic game I dunno. Completing the game without all of the Chaos Emeralds yields a message to go collect them, but there's really no reason to, because it does nothing to the ending. Little Planet is still stuck inside the Death Egg while Sonic and Tails feel good about themselves in their escape pods. This could be thought of as a lead-in to Episode 3, but as of now Sega has no plans for one. One of the developers has said that they might make one if Ep2 sold well. Did it? I dunno but I certainly don't want the Sonic 4 series to end like this.\n\nThe game was actually short enough that I turned to achievement hunting to elongate it. Which was odd as this was after I'd already had my fill of this game and dismissed it as another bad Sonic entry. I actually WANTED to come back to collect achievements and actually found a lot of fun with the game, both in gathering the achievements and just playing the game itself. However I will say that the achievements are absolutely pointless. Certain gameplay elements like the Red Rings and presence and abundance of rings before boss encounters were clearly just implemented for the game's achievements on release, but getting said achievements has no bearing on the actual game whatsoever. Collecting all the Red Rings or getting the last hit on every boss as Super Sonic, none of this affects the game at all. It doesn't even have a list of the achievements in game so really it's questionable why they're even there other than to make this short game slightly longer.\n\nAll in all though I did find a lot of fun with this. The game's length as well as reused settings are the biggest problems, but they're pretty well made up for with a beautiful presentation, pretty enjoyable music and most of all a lot of good level gimmicks and physical designs. Is it as good as the classics? Eh, probably not, if only because it's not completely orginal, but I had just about as much fun with it anyway.","August 9, 2014","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

He whizzes around in a blur. Faster than a speeding bullet. The thrill! The exhilaration!\n\nThose wonderful feelings that come to mind whenever I think of Sonic and his buddies. When thinking of a character like Sonic, it's hard to separate nostalgia from true feelings. Hopefully I'll be able to do that!\n\nSonic 4: E2 is a fun platformer. Colourful landscapes, and cute enemies create a vibrant atmosphere. The graphics are acceptable for a 2D game in this generation. The game struggles to run on low end machines, even those that pass the system requirements. The game just isn't playable with system lag, or low FPS.\n\nThe gameplay is okay, but I do have a few issues. To me Sonic was a different kind of platformer. It was all about whizzing through the levels as fast as possible. I got great joy from timing my jumps just right, getting enough coins for the special levels and bouncing off the enemies on the way. Unfortunately S4E2 doesn't feel right. Sonic at full speed feels sluggish, and that's a word you never want associated with our heroic hedgehog. I never felt out of control, Sonic never flew off the screen. Some people might call that a good thing, but I think a fair few fans would agree with my perspective.\n\nI was able to play some levels co-op. The levels are the same, one player controls Sonic, the other Tails. The problem with co-op is as soon as one character gets a little bit away from the other, the player behind has to use the catch up button. This just made the game feel like a chaotic mess. However, this chaotic mess was extremely fun. It enabled some awesome near-death escapes.\n\nThe game is trying hard to be like the 2D Sonic games of old. It introduces some new abilities, like forming a super-ball of death with Tails (which is the best way to go through 80% of levels), or dashing through the air by double jumping. Ultimately this is where it fails. It's an okay platformer, and it has a pricepoint that reflects the length of the game but it doesn't stand up to classic Sonic games.\n\nWhilst the game does not stand up against previous Sonic games, it is quite a fun platformer. The levels are a nice length and fun to run through once. There isn't much replayability there though.\n\nBottom Line: Fun co-op game. A little lacklustre when compared to classic Sonic.","January 2, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even the final boss is a rehash from sonic 2. In 4.2, the levels & boss fights are all unique, new, creative, challenging but not ridiculously stupid hard. It even has 2 new movies with Tails that are required through out the game. The only thing is, the special stages in 4.1 were unique and the special stages in 4.2 are rehashes from sonic 2. I enjoyed 4.2 more than 4.1, it also has coop which is a little bit fun but not quite perfected.\n\nS4.2 is about a 8/10, worth under $5 if you like the sonics.

I gotta say,the music is kinda catchy and the levels are pretty neat. Compared to Episode 1,this game looks more better. I played the first act of this game and didn't play it afterwards because I was trying to get more things in SA2 (PC). After my best friend came over,though,we started the game,and I noticed the level I beat wasn't completed,but that didn't stop us. We played for a long while! Probably from 11:00 to 2:00 AM. We stopped at the first act for Sky Fortress because we were screwing up at the tornado spinning parts and the small Sonic part. The next day,we beat it. We both really enjoyed it.\n\nPros:\n-Better graphics than Episode 1.\n-Short game,but still full of action.\n-The Death Egg is back again,but better!\n-The fact that Co-op exist.\n-Tails is more useful in this game than in Sonic 2 (1992.)\n-The combo attacks are like good items,but you can use them endlessly.\n-Buying this with Episode 1 gives you Episode Metal.\n-Improvement of the special stages. It's not great,though.\n-And much more!\n\nCons:\n-Not being able to use Super Sonic in a combo attack. (It might hurt Tails. so,I dunno about this con)\n-Death Egg has only 2 stages,which is kinda sad since the other ones have 4.\n-Tails flys less with Sonic than he did in Sonic 2.\n-In Sky Fortress,if you go behind the screen,you die,which doesn't make sense. (a few games have this to.)\n-Last Con: The fact that you just get an achievement for doing a few tough things isn't kinda rewarding. It would be better if you had Small Badges somewhere.\n\nOverall,this game is pretty fun and I would recommend this to anyone that's a fan of Sonic,but I still don't get why it gets so much hate! It's not really bad at all!\n\nFinal Results:\nRate: 9.2/10\nWould want a third installment.","April 26","true","72.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I can recommend it to sonic fans but that's as far as it goes. The difficulty spike is rather high. This game is too short for a sonic game though. Even the shortest classic sonic game has more stages than this one. Pick it up during a sale, don't pay full price. The extra Metal Sonic episodes are basically playing the stages from Sonic 4 Episode 1 in reverse. It's much easier than Episode 2 stages but they're rather unfufilling in general.\n\nI love Tails but his role is minimal in this game other than using him for tag-team actions such as flying, or rolling into a super spinball.","July 14, 2013","true","9.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brokenbutterfly/recommended/203650/","brokenbutterfly","The Kitsune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brokenbutterfly/","181 products in account","Like all games, StH4 has its problems, but I don't think that ruins it for the game. While it's very true that you're going to have far easier a time with a controller than a keyboard/mouse, overall, the game is very well put together. Piece by piece, here's what I think.\n\nThe music, like for all Sonic games, is very well done and feels very fitting. Every single stage sounds appropriate, from White Park Zone sounding very much like a snowy wonderland to Oil Desert Zone sounding like an intimidating desert factory. The music itself is composed fantastically, with nothing in it that would grate on the ears, and even the new power-up music doesn't sound too bad.\n\nThe controls and physics take some getting used to, especially if you haven't played a game with Sonic's acceleration need; thankfully, it's been improved somewhat from Episode 1, making it less bothersome. They can also be frustrating at times, but once you get over the slight learning curve, it never feels rage-inducing or overly frustrating. Annoying at times, yes, but at least here, it won't ever feel like the game is actively hating you and all you stand for. Sky Fortress' changed controls can take a bit to adapt to, especially if you're playing co-op, but other than that, failures mostly feel like skill or mistakes rather than bad controls.\n\nThe Zone desgins are wonderful as well. Each Zone gives a feel of some of the older games' Zones, but at the same time, they also have unique little twists or tricks that makes them feel like their own unique places as well. From White Park's snowy theme park feeling to Oil Desert's very industrialized setting, even if there aren't as many of them as in other games, they leave a mark.\n\nThe game is, despite some claims, not that much shorter than the other four games it emulates (Sonic 1, 2, 3, S&K). While there are only 4 normal Zones, every Zone has 3 Acts, plus a stand-alone "act" that's the boss of that Zone (not counting the final Zone). As an added bonus, you can replay any Special Zone you've beaten for fun, or to practice for harder ones.\n\nSpeaking of the Special Zone, the special stages from Sonic 2 make a return! And to add to the fun of the "friendly competition" of the ring gathering, the animation played when going between checkpoints is actually different depending on which character has the most rings. The stages, as usual, can be easy or hard depending on how good you are at picking up rings while dodging, but they definitely have the same feel as the old-school ones.\n\nThe co-op for the game can be either a blessing or a curse, depending on if you have someone to play with or not. The game feels very much like it was built specifically FOR two players to work together on it, which means if you do have two people, you can do a lot you wouldn't get to do or pull off some neat tricks. At the same time, if you're playing alone, it can sometimes be a little frustrating or difficult precisely because of the build intending two people.\n\nAll in all, it's definitely not a perfect game by any means... but it's a game that those who enjoy that style of gameplay should, in my opinion, pick up if they can, regardless of whether they're a Sonic fan or not. Those who are fans of the old-style Sonic, however, will definitely find even more enjoyment in it with all the throwbacks. However, I would DEFINITELY reccomend a controller if at all possible.\n\nSEGA managed to make something that felt both old-school and unique with Sonic 4 Episode 2... and how many games can claim that?","March 9, 2014","true","11.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The first boss fight is where it starts to go south and it keeps going south from there.\n\nGraphics do their job well enough, music is awful and the sound quality is abysmal, I could pull out my Genesis and plug Sonic 1 in and get better quality sound. Reminds me of music in a mobile game.\n\nThe gameplay starts well then goes off a cliff, horrible boss fight mechanics where half the time the boss decides when they are foreground and when they are background because, hey why not right? (Not in the classic cinematic way, just in the middle of the fight in the same place they are sometimes foreground) The stages get progressively worse to the point the only reason I finished the game is that I like Sonic the Hedgehog and the game is remarkably short.\n\nUtilization of tails is also incredibly clunky and poor. I would try the local co-op but I don't want to inflict this game upon anyone else. Stay away, buy Sonic Generations if you want a decent Sonic game. If you have Generations, still stay away, this game just shows how far the series has fallen and it is no wonder Episode III was cancelled.\n\nSuch a disappointment","February 12","false","4.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Sonic 4 Episode 2 is yet another dissapointing release in the never ending Dark Ages of Sonic, which is an on-going line of bad Sonic games starting from 2006, and this one has joined the bandwagon.\n\nInstead of being based off Sonic 1, this one is based off Sonic 2 and rightly so, only because it has Tails in it.\n\nThe gameplay is not too shabby and it is actually better than the first one, but it still has some kinks. The physics are still kind of bad but not as bad as Episode 1. There's also no copying of any of the previous zones from old Sonic games, but some zones are similar to other zones seen in the Sonic series, but I can't really list them all.\n\nThe story is really hard to notice due to all of the characters refusing to talk during the entire game, in all seriousness a storyline isn't really here in this game.\n\nThis game relies way too heavily on the special Sonic + Tails moves, most of the game requires you to use those moves. Like in Oil Desert Zone act 2 or 3, the end of the act requires you to use the flying-Tails-carrying-Sonic thing for the rest of the act, and I've died a few times in that part.\n\nThe Co-op mode is ok, and suprisingly it is accurate to Sonic 2's co-op mode: You both have to stay on the same gosh darn screen.\n\nIt's still not a worthy sequel to the Sega Genesis Sonic we all know and love, but it is slightly better than episode 1. This game is really only for bored gamers waiting for something interesting to happen and for crazy Sonic fans who collect every Sonic game known in exsistance both good and bad.\n\n4.7/10\n\nBut hey, at least it's better than Sonic Unleashed!\n\nBefore I go, there is one more problem with game. If you get all of the Chaos Emeralds and beat the game, you don't get some cool "true ending" cutscene, or even a picture of Super Sonic, dissapointing I know.","June 22, 2015","false","17.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The difficulty is uneven, the boss fights are some of the most tedious in the Sonic franchise, and the music is repetitive to the point of being annoying. Co-op is the coolest part, but it doesn't save the game from being aggressively mediocre at best.\n\nLevel design lacks the clear purposeful simplicity of old Sonic games. It plays well enough, I suppose, but lacks the imaginative spark of creativity the series was once known for, instead coming off as hackneyed "What if we took one old level and mashed it up with this other one?" Originality is not this game's strongest suit.\n\nDifficulty is extremely unbalanced. You can breeze through most of the game on autopilot, but every now and then you'll hit a speed bump that will have you stuck for a frustratingly long amount of time. It makes the game feel uneven and sloppy.\n\nMost of those speed bumps will probably be the game's boss encounters, which feature excessive, flashy animation sequences that will keep you waiting. Every time you fight one of the game's bosses, you'll have to sit through a cutscene that shows them "getting ready" to fight. Some of these cutscenes can last a full minute, and you have to re-watch them every time you die. Death comes often in these boss fights, which can last upwards of five minutes (a really long time for a boss!) and offer no checkpoints. Dying on the last hit only to have to sit through a minute-long cutscene for the third time is the pits.\n\nEven music, typically a high point for most Sonic games (even the really bad ones!) falls extremely flat. It's generic retro video game music, but does not evoke the old Sonic games in the slightest. It's too tinny, too repetitive, too annoying. Oil Desert Act 2 in particular will grate on your nerves, with a meowing synth instrument that doesn't sound like anything on earth. Classic Sonic games were trying to evoke real instruments on limited hardware, but this just sounds like hissing, scratchy square wave nonsense. Chiptunes for the sake of having chiptunes.\n\nIf there was one part of this game that felt genuinely inspired, it would be the game's two-player online co-op mode. This ends up being a legitimate improvement over co-op modes in past Sonic games, given each player gets their own separate view instead of having to share the screen. The game's flying stage, similar to Sonic 2's Sky Chase Zone, ends up being particularly harrowing in this mode. Here, Player 2 flies the plane, and is burdened with the task of getting Player 1 in to position -- a truly cooperative experience.\n\nThe game is almost worth it for the co-op alone. Almost... but not quite.","September 6, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The price is way too high, so just get the Hits collection to pick them up so you have something else to play when you're really, REALLY bored.\n\nIn good conscience, I can't recommend either Sonic 4 episodes - am I the only one that can notice how SLOW these games are? Is it just me? The trailers looked like the games moved much faster, but then when I play them, much, much slower. It used to be that you could finish a level in about 1-2 minutes or so, it feels as if they artificially slowed down the game so that you'll take longer to complete it and they can say it's longer. If I'm wrong, I'd be happy to be corrected. As a long time Sega fan bordering on "fanboy" status (but not quite as manic and irritating) I have to wonder what Sonic Team was thinking.\n\nThe Good Points: I think the graphics are gorgeous. New high-stylized Sonic does look a little odd in a 2-D platformer, but the levels look nice and the artwork is on point. The combine gimmicks are fun to an extent which makes for some cute "aw" moments. In other words, the game is great to look at. It doesn't lose points there. As has been said many times before I got anywhere near it, the physics are VERY improved over the first Sonic 4 game. Boss battles are cool looking and great.\n\nThe Bad Points: Gimmicks are gimmicks are gimmicks, they DO get tired after a little while. This isn't my biggest gripe with the game, however, which is that the game just feels way slower than any previous Sonic title. If they slowed this down in an attempt to get new people interested in the games, they alienated their original fanbase that enjoyed the games for their fast-paced fluidness. These games aren't fluid, they're clunky and slow. Improved physics over the first installment or not, they're simply too slow-paced to get a good rhythm and pace going throughout the games. The music is really, really bad. Mute the music and put on some of your own tunes, just don't play anything too fast because the game's pacing is a mix between the average tempos of Pink Floyd and Enya. How are you gonna slow down Sonic? Some parts will make you feel like you're playing the 2012 version of Atari 2600 E.T.\n\nOn one final note, I have to say that someone at Sega REALLY likes sparkles. They will absolutely put a sparkle type effect on anything they can just to use that one sound effect that they made a few years ago over, and over, and over, and over again. There's nothing entirely wrong with this sound effect, it just gets kind of boring after awhile.\n\nDecent effort, but I don't feel this does anything to improve the controversial and arguable standards of the franchise considering the previous installments (and I DO think that Sonic Generations was a lot of fun and is a lot more fun than these, because they didn't slow Sonic down.)\n\n5/10 - Sonic disaster, not sonic speed and playability. Again, it's not all bad, get it in the Hits collection, but don't spend the money on the game by itself.","April 11, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

Well, congratulations Sonic 4, you've landed in that small list of games I just straight up hate.\n\nThe parts that broke me?  Lots of them, but most specifically the Oil world part 2: the  Oil world has a mechanci where you run across sinking sand and have to jump in order to not sink into it and die, right?  Fine, that's fair.  At a certain point in the stage I was then forced to run along this sand, but in a low corridor where while on top of the sand Sonic's head would be touching the roof of the corridor.  This immediately slowed my progress to a grinding halt.  It gets better, though, because as you get further down the corridor, the roof is raised BUT Spikes are placed at the bottom of the roof!  The spike tips reach exactly where the ceiling of the corridor was before, so if you jump too high you just die.  This isn't ok but I could have at least gotten through the area if it wasn't very, very long or if there had been any rings whatsoever in it, but no, I got hit once, all of my rings disappeared in the sand, and then I had to go through the rest of this insanely long corridor without any protection.  ♥♥♥♥ that.\n\nThe boss of the Winter world -- really cool looking level by the way -- was also full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Alright, cool, I'm racing Metal Sonic and I have to catch up with him and hit him, awesome!  This is awesome!  Wait, two minutes into the fight -- seemed like a long time for a sonic game -- he just hits the platform that I'm running on, breaking it.  I immediately ran into the hole and fell to my death, restarting the fight.  Alright, whatever, that was really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because I didn't have the time to react, and it's dumb that I have to restart the boss fight but at least I know that's coming now and it won't happen again.  Oh wait no, he just does that attack so fast and it's right on top of where you're running that you're just ♥♥♥♥ed if you don't anticipate it.\n\nElsewhere in poor design land is anything to do with Tails.  Alright, so you occassionally have to press a button to join up with Tails for a special ability.  Cool.  Except for, you know, these abilities being so limited in utility that the only times you use them are when the game halts your progress unless you use the abilities.  Of course, you use them so infrequently that if you hit these parts, you won't know what to do, so the game has to put up a sign telling you which ability you need to use to progress.  Hey game, if you think I can't figure something out because I'm not using it frequently enough then I'm pretty sure you designed these abilities poorly.\n\nTl;dr: there are some cool parts to the game but they usually get ♥♥♥♥ed up with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design, horrible enemy placement and just straight up terrible choices.\n\nNo, ♥♥♥♥ this game.

It feels like the game is playing itself for you, there is almost no jumping, or platforming, only running forward, and then we have this super overpowered ''specialattack'' that makes the game even more ''only going forward''. The spindash is almost useless, i guess they replaced the spindash with the ''specialattack''. This game also has some really unfair deaths, and the boss battles are just superlame.  But you get to play as Metal Sonic, that's cool right? No, because you'll get crushed by a trap that is almost impossible to evade, and that's when i quitted this game.\n\n\nBut on the bright side, the graphics and soundtracks are amazing, they could really have made a great game with those things.'\n\n4/10","January 3, 2014","false","5.8"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

The story is that Little Planet from Sonic CD has returned and with it, the return of Eggman's greatest creation: Metal Sonic. It's up to you as the dynamic gaming duo of Sonic and Tails to stop him. The graphics look amazing as it's a full on 3D graphics engine played from a 2D perspective (Also known as 2.5D) and the music and sound design is simply amazing in it's Sega Genesis limitations. The gameplay is the same old Sonic the Hedgehog 2D high speed platforming, but this game introduces 3 new abilities for Tails: The fligh, the swim, and the rolling combo, all activated by pushing the action button at the right time. The levels are designed well and the bosses are pretty fun to fight. The weak points is that it's still a short game with 4 zones (3 acts each) and the final zone with one boss for each zone.

Little Planet from Sonic CD makes a return. Dr. Eggman who was secretly planning a bigger plot from Episode 1 has events set out for Episode 2 - plans he had since Episode 1. As Dr. Eggman heads out to carry out his plans he discovers that Little Planet is coming near their world and decides to reawaken Metal Sonic who was left after his defeat from Sonic CD (which more than confirms that Sonic CD takes place Sonic 3). After being revived Metal Sonic decided to explore through the old stages of Episode 1 to obtain a sacred power that he had sensed. After obtaining the power he has more than become capable of matching with Sonic in terms of Power. After encountering Dr. Eggman along with the reawakened Metal Sonic, Sonic has decided to recruit back his buddy Tails to help him defeat the duo.\n\n• Characters: 9/10\no Tails and Metal Sonic makes a return after being absent from Episode 1 - Sonic and Dr. Eggman make a return as well. New enemies have been added to the mix along with some remakes of the first enemies from the first few games as well.\n\n• GamePlay: 10/10\no Episode 2 continues off the gameplay scheme as Episode 1 but includes a few new nice additions thanks to the inclusion of Tails. Sonic and Tails can do team moves which can range from flying with Tails and rolling into obstacles. Players who have a original file from Episode 1 can also unlock Episode Metal which is a expansion of Episode 1 but you play as Metal Sonic in the game who plays more like Episode 1's sonic without the help of a secondary combo skills (via Tails). Zones and acts return like the other Sonic games, check point posts allow you to come back at that point rather than starting all over again, and now Red Star Rings have been added which is equivalent to a Koopa/Dinosaur coin from Super Mario World. All of the power ups from the first game also make a return.\n\n• Graphics: 10/10\no Just like in Episode 1, Episode 2's visual design is amazingly well done with all the lighting, shading and texture detailing. Episode 2 uses the same engine as Episode 1.\n\n• Sound: 10/10\no Episode 2 uses the same sound effects in quality and bitrate as the first sonic game. A lot more of the old sound effects have returned thanks to the inclusion of tails and new sound effects relating to Metal Sonic have been added as well.\n\n• Music: 9/10\no Episode 2 uses similar if not the same tracks as the first game but also includes several new tracks related to the new stages. You also have several remixes of older games such as the racing level from Sonic CD against Metal Sonic.\n\n• Length: 6/10\no Episode 2 is a bit longer than Episode 1 however it is as short in terms of completion. Excluding Episode Metal, the game should take you about 3-4 hours to complete. There are about 5 zones with 2-3 acts each. If you include Episode Metal you get 4 additional levels (no bosses or additional acts).\n\n• Replay Value: 8/10\no The amount of stages and the inclusion of special stages have added more to the replay value along with the fact that you can now play multiplayer with a friend and do some of the newly added challenges that related to the racing/time of the levels (which did not exist in the first game).\n\n• Player Value: 10/10\no Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 2 is a great improvement of the first game with adding a bit more to the storyline and action in the game. A far more variety as well has been added to the overall design along with the fact that there is a nice addition of two returning characters with one character being a focus with a remake of the first episode's levels in its core storyline. The new Team combo system adds a bit more to the overall gameplay that you never experienced in a Sonic game and thanks to the visual design and the ear relaxing music this game is a instant buy for any Platformer and Sonic lover. The game also adds a bit more challenges and replay options that were missing from the first game.","December 30, 2013","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Literally, Sonic can now roll down hills. Momentum has been mostly fixed, as well as a lot of the physics, which I know a lot of people would probably complain at me if I didn't state that. It's not a perfect simulation of the old physics, but it works.\nThe music is still trying to emulate the older games, but this time it sounds less like a trip to a wood chipper. The Stardust Speedway remix was a nice touch, too.\nThe main gripe I have with this is that whenever lag occurs, the game overcompensates for it and actually /speeds up/ when there's lag.

However there were some drawbacks as well.  The new game engine they used is better than the one in the first episode.  However, in my opinion the level design is not as good as Episode I.  Fortunately the boss battles are more fresh and different compared to the previous installment.  The Episode Metal that is unlocked if you have downloaded both Episodes I & II is mediorce at best.  It just reuses 4 levels from Episode I except you play as Metal Sonic.\n\nAs with Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode I, I feel this game is about the same quality as that one, which is good.  However, I feel Sega could have polished up these episodes a bit more before release.  I still believe Sega was trying to rake-in as much money as possible by releasing Sonic the Hedgehog 4 into two games.  It worked well for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles with the lock-on ability, but they didn't attempt to do anything close to that with Sonic the Hedgehog 4.\n\nGood game, but too short.

Furthermore, someone had the good idea to clearly label all bottomless pit segments. Artistically, Episode 2 does less refurbishing of old concepts than Episode 1. The special stages, which are a slight extension of the Sonic 2 special stages, are significantly less challenging than episode 1 special stages.\n\nI can name two faults that stuck out to me - one in level design, the other in boss design. One of the snow zone acts ends in a tails swimming test that, if failed, kills you by trapping you underwater until you drown. While in principle this isn't much different than a bottomless pit segment, it feels worse to have to wait for that timer. The sand zone boss has a clunky ending. Both minor faults.\n\nSonic 4 is a good Sonic game.","November 28, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Quite a better game than Episode 1. The physics have been tweaked and really do make the game feel much more Genesis like. Tails is also a great addition, he has his own flight capabilities, so it's like you're playing two characters in one! Sonic's normal homing attack, spindash, and jumping abilities with Tails' abilities of flight! The levels are also brand new and look absolutely gorgeous. Full 3-D rendered levels in this game trample over the artstytle of Episode 1, which was cardboard cut out levels with 3-D models. Also, Metal Sonic is back, and it's a great thing too, he makes for some awesome boss fights and adds a really neat story ark while working with Dr. Eggman/Robotnik. So, in short, much better than Ep. 1.\nI'll give it an 8.5/10, Much better physics, Tails, new levels, and Metal Sonic really help this game alot. But, I do see a couple ideas that were used a while back and Sky Fortress zone is just Wing Fortress zone with, yet again, a new coat of paint.","July 16, 2014","true","20.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Little Planet from Sonic CD makes a return. Dr. Eggman who was secretly planning a bigger plot from Episode 1 has events set out for Episode 2 - plans he had since Episode 1. As Dr. Eggman heads out to carry out his plans he discovers that Little Planet is coming near their world and decides to reawaken Metal Sonic who was left after his defeat from Sonic CD (which more than confirms that Sonic CD takes place Sonic 3). After being revived Metal Sonic decided to explore through the old stages of Episode 1 to obtain a sacred power that he had sensed. After obtaining the power he has more than become capable of matching with Sonic in terms of Power. After encountering Dr. Eggman along with the reawakened Metal Sonic, Sonic has decided to recruit back his buddy Tails to help him defeat the duo.\n\n• Characters: 9/10\no Tails and Metal Sonic makes a return after being absent from Episode 1 - Sonic and Dr. Eggman make a return as well. New enemies have been added to the mix along with some remakes of the first enemies from the first few games as well.\n\n• GamePlay: 10/10\no Episode 2 continues off the gameplay scheme as Episode 1 but includes a few new nice additions thanks to the inclusion of Tails. Sonic and Tails can do team moves which can range from flying with Tails and rolling into obstacles. Players who have a original file from Episode 1 can also unlock Episode Metal which is a expansion of Episode 1 but you play as Metal Sonic in the game who plays more like Episode 1's sonic without the help of a secondary combo skills (via Tails). Zones and acts return like the other Sonic games, check point posts allow you to come back at that point rather than starting all over again, and now Red Star Rings have been added which is equivalent to a Koopa/Dinosaur coin from Super Mario World. All of the power ups from the first game also make a return.\n\n• Graphics: 10/10\no Just like in Episode 1, Episode 2's visual design is amazingly well done with all the lighting, shading and texture detailing. Episode 2 uses the same engine as Episode 1.\n\n• Sound: 10/10\no Episode 2 uses the same sound effects in quality and bitrate as the first sonic game. A lot more of the old sound effects have returned thanks to the inclusion of tails and new sound effects relating to Metal Sonic have been added as well.\n\n• Music: 9/10\no Episode 2 uses similar if not the same tracks as the first game but also includes several new tracks related to the new stages. You also have several remixes of older games such as the racing level from Sonic CD against Metal Sonic.\n\n• Length: 6/10\no Episode 2 is a bit longer than Episode 1 however it is as short in terms of completion. Excluding Episode Metal, the game should take you about 3-4 hours to complete. There are about 5 zones with 2-3 acts each. If you include Episode Metal you get 4 additional levels (no bosses or additional acts).\n\n• Replay Value: 8/10\no The amount of stages and the inclusion of special stages have added more to the replay value along with the fact that you can now play multiplayer with a friend and do some of the newly added challenges that related to the racing/time of the levels (which did not exist in the first game).\n\n• Player Value: 10/10\no Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 2 is a great improvement of the first game with adding a bit more to the storyline and action in the game. A far more variety as well has been added to the overall design along with the fact that there is a nice addition of two returning characters with one character being a focus with a remake of the first episode's levels in its core storyline. The new Team combo system adds a bit more to the overall gameplay that you never experienced in a Sonic game and thanks to the visual design and the ear relaxing music this game is a instant buy for any Platformer and Sonic lover. The game also adds a bit more challenges and replay options that were missing from the first game.","December 30, 2013","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a perfect simulation of the old physics, but it works.\nThe music is still trying to emulate the older games, but this time it sounds less like a trip to a wood chipper. The Stardust Speedway remix was a nice touch, too.\nThe main gripe I have with this is that whenever lag occurs, the game overcompensates for it and actually /speeds up/ when there's lag.

The graphics and animations (especially on Sonic) no longer look like something on an iPhone, well implemented co-op both online and off, memorable stages/enemies and the special stages are no longer stressful flash games. Now comparing to the original Sonic 2 this game wins again largely because Tails is no longer painful to play as player 2 because the camera follows both players as well as he take damage, unlike Sonic he doesn't have the homing attack so he isn't just a straight upgrade this time round.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/203650/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","This game is a bit of a mixed bag.  Sega fixed the problems from episode 1 with the way Sonic moves and tried some new ideas, but a number of them failed miserably.\n\nThe good things first:  The graphics are definitely improved and they got rid of the ugly fake 16 bit look from Sonic.  Sonic moves better and doesn't feel so sluggish.  Sega tried a lot of new ideas and came up with some pretty unique levels which are a pretty nice change from previous games.\n\nNow the bad:  A lot of that new unique stuff is terrible, flow breaking, and annoying.  Some new enemies seem to be designed to always hit you if you're going fast like Sonic should.  Some parts of the new level designs are rather annoying, especially the way they ham-fisted the Tails combo abilities in.  In order to reach the fast path in a lot of levels you seem to be required to use Tails' flying ability to reach places you can't even see.  There's also a combo rolling attack which is required to break down some barriers.  The game prompts you every time you're required to use them to continue in the level, and they mainly serve as an annoyance.  And the other problem with the levels...they actually added a scrolling level in the game.  That's right, in a game where the whole point is to be as fast as possible, they added a slow scroller (and Sonic becomes extremely sluggish on this level as well).\n\nNow the biggest problem with the game: the bosses.  Without exception, the bosses are all extremely annoying and tedious fights.  Bosses are a lot more complicated than previous games, take many more hits to kill, and of course require Tails combo abilities at certain not-so-obvious spots.  They also tend to have very long start and transition sequences that you have to wait through every time if you fail.  One of the bosses even uses the scrolling level set up to make it as annoying as humanly possible to fight him.\n\nI got to the final boss, and fighting him is so annoying that I can't even be bothered to finish the game.  Do yourself a favor and just get Episode 1 and Generations.  This one isn't worth it.","December 8, 2012","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Quite a better game than Episode 1. The physics have been tweaked and really do make the game feel much more Genesis like. Tails is also a great addition, he has his own flight capabilities, so it's like you're playing two characters in one! Sonic's normal homing attack, spindash, and jumping abilities with Tails' abilities of flight! The levels are also brand new and look absolutely gorgeous. Full 3-D rendered levels in this game trample over the artstytle of Episode 1, which was cardboard cut out levels with 3-D models. Also, Metal Sonic is back, and it's a great thing too, he makes for some awesome boss fights and adds a really neat story ark while working with Dr. Eggman/Robotnik. So, in short, much better than Ep. 1.\nI'll give it an 8.5/10, Much better physics, Tails, new levels, and Metal Sonic really help this game alot.

First it should be said the both parts of Sonic 4, Episode 1 (4.1) and Episode 2 (4.2) seem to have an identity crisis. They are officially sequels but in reality they are something of an updated remake, 4.1 and 4.2 borrow and reference Sonic 1, 2, 3&K and CD heavily; 4.1s bosses are all remakes of the originals, a fault 4.2 even references with the first boss originally appearing to mimic the Aquatic Ruins’ Boss before transforming into something new. However even it borrows the later levels and boss fights. The level design 4.2 is also much better than 4.1’s. As 4.2 has original zones; Sylvanian Castle, Winter Park Zone and the Oil Desert (whose features resemble 3&K’s Sandopolis much more than Sonic 2’s Oil Ocean which it would appear to be a copy of at first glance). After this 4.2 does fall into copying the final zone which is just an amalgamation of Wing Fortress, Sky Chase and the Flying Battery zones, taking features from each but making them worse (in the Sky Chase knock off for example Tail’s Plane can disappear leaving the player plummeting to earth).\n\nThere are problems with both games; they both insist on the use of Sonic’s homing attack to access ledges which I find it unnecessary for a side-scroller. Again Physics does not seem to apply in Sonic the Hedgehog’s universe, he can walk up walls when travelling at fairly low speeds (although not as badly as he could in 06), while the homing attack creates momentum from nothing.\n\nEven the traditional saving grace of the Sonic game, the soundtrack, is poor which is disappointing. In addition, the game also has a very short life span, 4.1 failed to keep me attached for more than 5 hours, and while 4.2 actually saw me to completion, it only has at most 5-12 hours of gameplay depending on how quickly you can master it and I doubt either has much in the way of replay value unlike the games they are based upon.\n\nThis said however, for once Sonic actually controls well (which he never does in 3D Games). 4.2 itself still contains a number of very good features. The inclusion of team mechanics was a great idea as it makes Tails a valued partner to Sonic, his abilities have made him an essential part as he can get Sonic through traps and defeat opponents. 4.2 also did well with the special stages, which like 4.1s are copies of the original games (this time the tunnel runs of Sonic 2,) unlike 4.1 however, 4.2 improves the originals. Tails is no longer a dead weight, he doesn't drop rings when hit and a new power up (a chaotix ring type feature) can give new interesting challenges, it is just a pity they weren’t used more often.\n\nTherefore although neither are great like the games they were trying to emulate, they are ok and I generally do not see why they have been so badly received as they’re worthy successors to the original Sonic. 4.1 may be distinctly average but 4.2 is a big improvement upon it. The current price tags are not value for money but if you pick them up in the Steam sale (as I did) 4.2 is certainly worth a fiver. 4.1 should only be purchased if you want the bonus Metal Sonic Mode which works when you own both parts.\nSonic 4 Episode 1 4/10\nSonic 4 Episode 2 7/10\n","December 31, 2014","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one presents original stages and the movement feels better (not perfect, though).  The cooperative moves with Tails are kind of neat although they are a little overused (for one thing you can only really get going super-fast if you go the ball-rolling move).

Half way into the level the sonic player must do this short but very unfair platforming section which really trolls first time players or the casual players which isn't a good thing. my friends keep on dying on this section as sonic and when i tried to do that part for them online they fail even more in the tails piloting sections.","January 29","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So SEGA a year and half later came out with Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode 2. Or in other words the LAST episode in the sonic 4 saga.\n\nWell storywize. Sonic meets up with Tails and he says that little planet from Sonic CD would be making its annual return. But Sonic scences that Eggman is once again up to no good and they hop in the tornado and go see the commotion. Well Little Planet this time decided to be a) much larger and b) appear in space this time. Suddenly they run into Metal Sonic. Why is he here? Its explained later. After taking down Eggmans flying ship he reveals that he used little planet as the bases for his new base the Death Egg MK.2. After taking down Metal Sonic and destroying the heart Sonic and Tails barely escape the death egg and..... thats it. What the ♥♥♥♥ was that? The death egg remains intact, little planet is still trapped inside and we still dont know how metal sonic got there? What kind of ♥♥♥♥ id That?\n\nOkay gameplay. So Sonic now has Tails follow him around the stages and by pressing the X button they can do a co-op move that depends were you activate it in the air or underwater Tails carrys sonic to safety and on the ground they charge up a super spin dash and obliterate enemies. I tgink this is a pretty cool idea. But you can decide which character is the lead. You always play as Sonic, not my idea why cant I play as tails? Sonic can still do all the things he can do in Ep.1 but the physics have been improved tremondously over ep.1 and rolling is now a good use in means of gaining speed as well. we even get some creative uses of the homing attack instead of just enemie chains (which there is also much less of them as well). There are still a fair amout of speed boosters but definitely less than ep.1. The stages themself are much more orifional that ep.1 so we Have Slyvania Castle Zone, White Park Zone, NOT-Oil Ocean Zone (Oil Desert Zone) and NOT-Wing Fortress Zone (Sky Fortrress Zone). Like ep.1 while some level themes may be reused the level design is differnt. The level design definitely feels less barren that ep.1, still a bit rough around the edges but nothing ill lose sleep over. Well what about those special stages? Well like ep.1 if you collect 50 rings and jump into the ring at the end you'll be transported to the special stage. The special stages are similer to the sonic 2, Sonic Pocket adveture, Sonic Ruch and Sonic Colours DS as you run along a halfpipe and collect a certen amout of rings. Get enought you get a chaos emerald and you can play as super sonic in regular stages withc is always nice. In terms of bosses well this is the games weakness... when your not fighting eggman your fighting metal sonic. Eggmans bosses, while origonal, are bad. They overstay their welcome by about 3 minuits and the looping 6 times per minuite music doesnt help. The metal sonic fight are thankfully much better, expecialy the white park boss I always get a kik out of that. as I said before all the bosses in this game are origonal apart from the 4th and final encounter with metal sonic being a remake of the race from Sonic CD. The finlal boss is at best ok, but I just wish there was more to it.\n\nIn terms of looks, this game excells. While i dont mind how ep.1 looks, but this is soo much better and the result is one fantastic looking game. Music is better than ep.1, but some of the tracks can still be repetetive as hell and some just sound bad like oil deserts act 2 and act 3 music. The game, belive it or not, also has local and online multiplayer were ojne of you controls sonic and the other Tails. I havent triend it myself coz no one plays this game much anymore but if playing this game with a friend or online appears to you then by all means do so. There are also red rings to collect in the stages but iunless your an achevement lover then don't bother as you don't need to collect then to prroceed and they dont unlock anything extra. The ♥♥♥♥?\n\nAlso if you have both Ep. 1 and Ep.2 on the some system you get a special 'lock on' extra in the form of Episode Metal. You play as Metal sonic (he controls exactly the same btw) through 4 of the stages from ep.1 and it explains how metal sonic returned from Sonic CD. Its nothing special at all and it should only take you about 15 minuits to finish. So basicly Eggman by the power of pointing powers up Metal Sonic and by being rebuilt in Mad Gear and absorbing some purple void in lost labyrinth zone hes fully restores and he flies off and meets Sonic and Tails in white park. Huzzar???\n\nWell Sonic 4: Episode 2 in my opinion is a much better game when conpaired to Episode 1. Better graphics, better physicls, cirtenly better level design and overall is a much more enjoyable experience. At £9.99 i do think that is asking maybe a bit much for this game and I do wish the bosses were better and their be less springs and speed boosters but if you want a light hearted sonic game then go for it.\n\nSCORE: 7/10\nPROS:\nExcellect Graphics\nMostly Good Music\nMore Original Level Themes and Designs\nCONS:\nSome Bland Levels\nBad Boss Fights\nLacking Replay Value\n\nReviewed: FEB 2016","February 19","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game makes a lot of improvements. The music is still great, the physics and mechanics have been tweaked to be much better, and with Tails in tow, you have a lot of options to get through each stage. The stages are fun, the bosses are great, especially the fights with Metal Sonic, and overall it's a great 2D Sonic game. It's still a little more like Sonic Rush than the Genesis games, but it's a little more in the middle of the two. The big problem I have is the Special Stages. I've beaten them all, and while Super Sonic leads to major catharsis factor, the stages are the most frustrating part of the game. They start off fine, like Sonic 2's stages with proper control, but you will need a guide and a lot of patience for the later ones. Here's a tip: if you approach the goal and don't have enough rings, pause before you step over the goal, and hit restart to try the stage again as much as you want. I'll give this one a 9.0 out of 10. One of the better Sonic games.","September 11, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/203650/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Sonic The Hedgehog 4 - Episode 2 is the second episode of Sonic 4 project, which is 2D Platformer with multiplayer, came out in 2012, two years after the first one. It ended up being the last episode in the project, with no news on Episode 3 ever since. Outside of "it's pretty much cancelled". No big differences between mobile and other versions this time around.\nOwners of Episode 1 on Steam will also get Episode Metal bonus.\n\nNo complaints on technical side this time around, it supports all the needed resolutions.\n\nBeing an episode, you may think it's very short. Well, it's decend old platformer lenght. You are given 4 zones with 3 acts each, plus boss act. Add to that final level and special stages. Each act is adds long enough overall for it to be considered to be about as long as, say, Sonic 1. So don't knock this title off for being "not full game".\n\nThis time around Sonic doesn't travel by himself. The ever cute Tails the fox joins him and becomes part of the team. And he isn't just wasting space either, as the game introduces ability to call Tails to help you. He can lift you up in air, let you travel underwater or you can do a combined spin-dash. Said spin-dash breaks through special walls, destroyes everything and simply goes really fast. Yes, I said a cliche thing. You can't turn around in this mode and it will stop by itself after colliding with a wall three times. In all honesty, I don't like this move. It either will be abusive, making some sections go too easy, or will give you cheap deaths of falling into pits you couldn't possibly see before too late. Try not too use it too much.\n\nOh, and takling of pits. Game for once actually puts signs over bottomless pits, so you know if it will kill you or just a way to lower path. The fact that you can call Tails to save you by lifting into air with push of a single button helps you to get out of this sticky situation where you are already falling into one. Quite clever thing, if you ask me.\n\nNow, it's not the first time you have Tails as sidekick. When he was first introduced in Sonic 2, he was giving game much of good. Second player could exploit that Tails always respawns to make bosses too easy, while AI would ruin special stages for you. He would later learn to fly in Sonic 3, also being able to lift Sonic along, but you had to grab Second Player's controller to do that and thus was only used to find rare bonuses. Sonic 2 bad sides of Tails were still there.\nThen in Sonic Advance 3, with it's sidekick system, you could take Tails along with you and could easily use his ability as single-player to help you. But because you could take any different sidekick with very different abilities, game was still using them for optional things, like finding bonus items or just helping usual process.\n\nIn Sonic 4 Episode 2 though he is always your sidekick. Thus the game actively uses it and even throws challenges that requrie Tails help. For example, at the end of one of the acts in the Oil Desert you have to use Tails to hover slowly, while avoiding enemies and being pushed around by wind. By the way, flight isn't timed, instead you can "lift yourself up sllightly" only limited times.\nYou can't abuse Tails for bosses either, as when it comes to multiplayer, from what I know, the lives are limited for Tails. Or maybe they are shared.\nIn all honesty, I didn't try multiplayer out. But I think it should be real nice. Sonic can call Tails to his location, so Tails player will not feel left out that camera only follows Sonic. And yes, it has all the needed options and system to play over Internet. Maybe even too much, it's just 2-player coop of short platform game after all.\nI didn't find anybody active online there. So you should just use it to play with friend, not going to find strangers. Then again, playing with friend is the way it should be done anyway.\n\nGame also fixes some of the main complaints and just improves. Levels still have pacing, platforming and few paths. Actually, each level has one red ring hidden in it that you can collect. In other Sonic games it usually unlocks something. Here it doesn't do anything aside from giving achievement and just being something to explore levels for. They say that it had some use for upcoming Episode 3, but as it's not being developed, well, yea. Each act also tries to get something unique going for it, but there is still ntohing like darkness and carts.\nPhysics are good. They are still not on par with older Genesis titles, so it's not a game about rolling down the slopes. But they about as good as other modern 2D Sonic games, so there should be no complaints. Still got platforming going for it after all.\n\nAnd I also should mention that this time around game doesn't feel like it tries to restrict itself. It finally feels like continuation to classic trilogy. Perhaps this one should have been the real Episode One, really. Bosses are epic, Metal Sonic makes awesome return too. This game actually does the best justice to this villian. Final boss is huge, unique and isn't easy-easy. You will even get to take down flying fortress again. And yes, there is stage where you fly on top of Tornado plane and it's more complicated than original in Sonic 2. Other zones are also unique and don't feel as much of deja vu like in Episode 1.\nShame though that some boss acts are too generous with throwing rings at you non-stop. Ah well, at least battles themselves felt enjoyable.\n\nGraphics are great. It's all modern 3D now, using polygons for backgroudn details as well, not using that simplistic shading effect of Episode 1 either. While not requiring much of computer, it strikes some beautiful sceneries.\nSame can be said of music. In Episode 1 it felt like bad experiement at some times. In Episode Two majority of it is great. It seemed to find it's own identify and provides some unique feel that you will not find in original trilogy, providing tensity too. Oil Desert Act 2 comes to mind, which has a bit of that old-school lo-fi feel, while also giving you a feeling of being in hot oily desert. Burning. Normal boss music is still too repetitive.\n\nYou can still collect 7 emeralds in special stages, which are similiar to Special Stages in Sonic 2, where you run through a tube and collect rings. No twists this time, just additional small features. That, and it's still better than Sonic 2 ones because you can actually see things before they hit you. Some of them are hard, so you will either learn to abuse "retry" button in menu or will have to do it in multiplayer.\n\nEpisode Metal allows you to go through the Episode 1 levels as Metal Sonic. No sidekick. Metal even has same shading to him there as characters in the first Episode. You will just go through one act of each of the four zones. And layout of that act is changed heavily. Could say that it's unique ones. But using elements from what you already seen before. At least they aren't too easy.\n\nSo, Sonic 4 Episode 2 is a pretty good platformer and 2D Sonic game. Better than Episode 1 for sure and actually feels more like proper Sonic 4. You should have fun with it. The only shame is that ending may feel cliffhangery for some.","June 13, 2015","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The physics seem to have been fixed a bit, but it's still bad. I am honestly confused as to how Sonic Generations( which was a good game ) came before this, and yet they missed the mark so much. Simpily standing on a ramped surface, and pressing down, should cause you to roll, slowly, but you should move, and yet to stand perfectly still. The spin dash is almost useless, you neve get anywhere near high enough speeds to acomplish anything. Most vertical walls just need a light walk to traverse.\n\nBetter than Episode 1, still bad.\n\nI just hope they can make a proper Sonic game before we lose the franchise for good :(","June 14, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The physics, while definitely improved from Episode I, still need more work. Furthermore, getting the Chaos Emeralds was a pain due to the fact that Sonic can't move left and right as fast as he needs to, so you may end up missing a few rings, or crashing into a hazard.\n\nI got this game free from that Sonic Generations bundle thing. If you REALLY want this game, just go buy that bundle thingy (if it's still available).\n\nBottom line, Sonic 4 Episode II is somewhat lower-average, and I wouldn't really recommend it.

So SEGA a year and half later came out with Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode 2. Or in other words the LAST episode in the sonic 4 saga.\n\nWell storywize. Sonic meets up with Tails and he says that little planet from Sonic CD would be making its annual return. But Sonic scences that Eggman is once again up to no good and they hop in the tornado and go see the commotion. Well Little Planet this time decided to be a) much larger and b) appear in space this time. Suddenly they run into Metal Sonic. Why is he here? Its explained later. After taking down Eggmans flying ship he reveals that he used little planet as the bases for his new base the Death Egg MK.2. After taking down Metal Sonic and destroying the heart Sonic and Tails barely escape the death egg and..... thats it. What the ♥♥♥♥ was that? The death egg remains intact, little planet is still trapped inside and we still dont know how metal sonic got there? What kind of ♥♥♥♥ id That?\n\nOkay gameplay. So Sonic now has Tails follow him around the stages and by pressing the X button they can do a co-op move that depends were you activate it in the air or underwater Tails carrys sonic to safety and on the ground they charge up a super spin dash and obliterate enemies. I tgink this is a pretty cool idea. But you can decide which character is the lead. You always play as Sonic, not my idea why cant I play as tails? Sonic can still do all the things he can do in Ep.1 but the physics have been improved tremondously over ep.1 and rolling is now a good use in means of gaining speed as well. we even get some creative uses of the homing attack instead of just enemie chains (which there is also much less of them as well). There are still a fair amout of speed boosters but definitely less than ep.1. The stages themself are much more orifional that ep.1 so we Have Slyvania Castle Zone, White Park Zone, NOT-Oil Ocean Zone (Oil Desert Zone) and NOT-Wing Fortress Zone (Sky Fortrress Zone). Like ep.1 while some level themes may be reused the level design is differnt. The level design definitely feels less barren that ep.1, still a bit rough around the edges but nothing ill lose sleep over. Well what about those special stages? Well like ep.1 if you collect 50 rings and jump into the ring at the end you'll be transported to the special stage. The special stages are similer to the sonic 2, Sonic Pocket adveture, Sonic Ruch and Sonic Colours DS as you run along a halfpipe and collect a certen amout of rings. Get enought you get a chaos emerald and you can play as super sonic in regular stages withc is always nice. In terms of bosses well this is the games weakness... when your not fighting eggman your fighting metal sonic. Eggmans bosses, while origonal, are bad. They overstay their welcome by about 3 minuits and the looping 6 times per minuite music doesnt help. The metal sonic fight are thankfully much better, expecialy the white park boss I always get a kik out of that. as I said before all the bosses in this game are origonal apart from the 4th and final encounter with metal sonic being a remake of the race from Sonic CD. The finlal boss is at best ok, but I just wish there was more to it.\n\nIn terms of looks, this game excells. While i dont mind how ep.1 looks, but this is soo much better and the result is one fantastic looking game. Music is better than ep.1, but some of the tracks can still be repetetive as hell and some just sound bad like oil deserts act 2 and act 3 music. The game, belive it or not, also has local and online multiplayer were ojne of you controls sonic and the other Tails. I havent triend it myself coz no one plays this game much anymore but if playing this game with a friend or online appears to you then by all means do so. There are also red rings to collect in the stages but iunless your an achevement lover then don't bother as you don't need to collect then to prroceed and they dont unlock anything extra. The ♥♥♥♥?\n\nAlso if you have both Ep. 1 and Ep.2 on the some system you get a special 'lock on' extra in the form of Episode Metal. You play as Metal sonic (he controls exactly the same btw) through 4 of the stages from ep.1 and it explains how metal sonic returned from Sonic CD. Its nothing special at all and it should only take you about 15 minuits to finish. So basicly Eggman by the power of pointing powers up Metal Sonic and by being rebuilt in Mad Gear and absorbing some purple void in lost labyrinth zone hes fully restores and he flies off and meets Sonic and Tails in white park. Huzzar???\n\nWell Sonic 4: Episode 2 in my opinion is a much better game when conpaired to Episode 1. Better graphics, better physicls, cirtenly better level design and overall is a much more enjoyable experience. At £9.99 i do think that is asking maybe a bit much for this game and I do wish the bosses were better and their be less springs and speed boosters but if you want a light hearted sonic game then go for it.\n\nSCORE: 7/10\nPROS:\nExcellect Graphics\nMostly Good Music\nMore Original Level Themes and Designs\nCONS:\nSome Bland Levels\nBad Boss Fights\nLacking Replay Value\n\nReviewed: FEB 2016","February 19","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For now, I've only played a little bit and I'll be talking about it's PC compatibility.\nWhen I first played Sonic the Hedgehog Episode I on my laptop, nothing would work. No matter what software I downloaded, no matter how many times I verified the game cache, no matter how many times I updated Windows, and even after the multiple times uninstalled and reinstalled the game, it would not work. After two weeks of sadness and hatred towards Sega, I uninstalled and reinstalled the game one more time and it finally worked for no reason known to me. Because of this struggle, I was very skeptical of Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode II's PC compatibility. But I was far from disapointed.\nWhen the game is first setup, it automatically looks for what required software such as DirectX you do and do not have on your computer, and immediately installs what you do not have. This potentially saved me weeks of stress and pain over the game not working if I were to not already have everythin necessary.  It has a pretty low default resolution for the game (300 x 200), and I was afraid that the graphics would either be ugly or the game would run slow. Fortunately, even at high resolution (1208 x 1024), it ran at a smooth 60 fps and this time the graphics looked like Sega actually tried this time. Instead of trying to have the graphics of Sonic the Hedgehog 1 in HD, this game instead had apporximately the graphics of Sonic Generations, only zoomed out. It wasn't like I have an impressive intel core i7 processor of 4.7 GHz, either. My processor is a intel core i3 of 2.1 GHz and it ran this game fine. So if you're afraid of this game because the last one didn't work or hard ugly graphics, don't be. So far this seems like a true Sega game.

I wasn't too great. I liked it, but I could only recommend it to someone who's been a Sonic fan for a while during a sale, and even then I'd have my doubts of whether it was a good idea to recommend it or not. While I wouldn't say this game justifies a 15 dollar price tag, it's definitely worth a peek if you catch it on sale.\n\nThe use of Tails as a mandatory character is one that is met with a lot of controversy but I found it to do more harm than good - *especially* during some of the boss fights. There was one level in Oil Desert Zone where you had to fly a long distance using him and it sucked so bad that I felt it worth noting specifically in this review, but fortunately that's the only time during a normal level I found myself wanting to toss my mouse across the room due to the stupidity of it - special stages are a different story, however, but I'll delve into that later. All in all, though, he did create a few problems when he was mandatory but I ultimately found he did more good than harm.\n\nThe stages are generally very well done, barring a couple of exceptions, and while some of the bosses can have patterns that are a bit too vague I found them to be acceptable for the most part, yet none of them were too memorable barring Sky Fortress Zone's boss and the final boss.\n\nI'd put this game higher than Sonic 1 and S4 Ep. I, but it's definitely weaker than S3&K, SCD, and S2. It's got a lot of good moments, however, and I can definitely recommend picking it up while it's on sale.","August 21, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They force team mechanics onto you, and limit your options. Throughout the entire game, they expect you to use team powers (use Tails to fly, or use Tails for a super spin dash) to get through certain sections. Using these abilities takes you out of Super Sonic, and it just hinders the flow overall.\n\nBoss fights weren't fun for me. Certain boss fights are designed around the team mechanics as well. They split the boss bights into their own separate stages. You can't rack up rings to completely destroy the bosses, and instead... they only give you ~50 rings to fight them. I didn't kill any boss with the 50 rings they gave, and had to finish the fight as normal sonic. My favourite aspect of the classic titles was to destroy the game as super/hyper sonic, despite the little challenge that posed. It was a power fantasy, and this game has virtually none of that.\n\nI'd suggest just getting Sonic 3 & Knuckles. It has more content than this one (Knuckles, Hyper Sonic, Checkpoint mini-games, Electric shields, Fire shields), the levels are designed to allow for more experimentation, and the bosses generally allow for more approaches.","January 16","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can feel the difference with a lighter Sonic and feels a bit more fluid than in previous 2D games. So for long time Sonic fans you may still be thrown off by the unfaithful physics that don't reflect the old-school days of 2D Sonic, but they are a step up from what Episode I had to offer because of some added tweaks to the game engine and, and some subtle changes to Sonic in this game too, such as how he no longer uncurls out of a Spin when jumping of a slope.\nSo the game handles quite well in my opinion, despite not really playing like the Genesis/Mega-Drive days.\nTails controls well too, and the implementation of team based gameplay is executed well too, so I have no real issues there.\n\nNow content is important, as Sonic 3 & Knuckles was a big game(s), and Sonic 4 Episode II on its own isn't veyr massive, and the locations of zones like in Episode I are virtually all tributes to zones from the Genesis days, but there's much more to do in Sonic 3. And since Episode II is a seperate game that you have to pay for individually (and with Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles it's easy to buy the two games together) Sonic 4 Episode II doesn't offer too much a sequel since it doesn't really expand but rather just pay a homage to Classic Sonic, so if you we're hoping to see more than what Sonic 3 & Knuckles offered, then even with both episodes combined, you won't really get that here.\n\nHowever it's still a fun game that any fan of Sonic should give a go, and can even appeal to people who aren't necessarily fans of Sonic. It's not amazing, but a good game nontheless.","July 5, 2015","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Half way into the level the sonic player must do this short but very unfair platforming section which really trolls first time players or the casual players which isn't a good thing. my friends keep on dying on this section as sonic and when i tried to do that part for them online they fail even more in the tails piloting sections.","January 29","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This episode is clearly harder than Episode 1... sometimes way too hard like the last boss of the game.\n\nBoss fights thankfully are not a reboot of any boss from early games so there's a bit of originality and creativity here but fighting them can actually become tedious of how long it takes to beat them.\n\nLength of the game it's too short, yeah I know it's just 1 of 2 episodes, but that strategy was just to cash in on the same game twice.\n\nOverall, this game wasn't clearly designed by the original team behind the previous games (I should appreciate more info about this).\n\nIn resume:\n\nPROS:\n* Well...
