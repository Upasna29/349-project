"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manbehindthewires/recommended/319280/","manbehindthewires","ManBehindTheWires","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manbehindthewires/","136 products in account","So, total disclosure - I've been working on this review since launch because it's quite a tough game to rate. In short, it's the weirdest blend of incomplete yet perfect that you can imagine. The fighting is razor sharp and, for a 24/7 fighter fan, that's all that matters.\n\nA lot of gamers and reviewers are making the obvious comparisons between 98/2002 Kof and Street Fighter III: Third Strike, but I feel it's more like a combination between KoF's unspoken cousin, Garou:MotW and an early Samurai Shodown title. There is a lean towards big juggles and weapon-enhanced pokes that I haven't felt in a long time and the polar differences between L and H normals and specials means that the art of constructing a decent combo will literally keep you up at night.\nThe character selection is sparse, but mechanically the range features something for everyone, even mix-charge fans like myself. Furthermore, despite the complaints I've seen online, my cheap, fake, Chinese fightpad hooked up automatically, as did my notoriously PC-unfriendly RAP VX-SA fightstick - something that some fancier PC fighters have struggled with.\n\nThe hitboxes are tight and tidy, which again separates it from its KoF siblings, and it means that you'll often find yourself trading and, as a result, relearning trade-tactics, even at a low level. Other nice features include KD recovery and the much desired KoF hop options. There's 2 buttons dedicated to the game's Third Strike inspired parry system, which I feel would have been more valuable as a direct rip-off - utilizing the forward & aggressive crouch positions like its origin. As buttons, it just feels a little detached, but it's still an appreciated feature that forces you to bet on your reads.\n\nInfact, with the ranged pokes, the parries and the KD recoveries, its fair to say that they've really captured that old-school "reads" mentality. Every throw, every hop, every meaty is a solid statement that you know the fight better than your opponent - something that's missing or diluted in modern fighters.\n\nNext up, the online is pretty slick. Despite lacking its previously promised GGPO inclusion, I've been getting some pretty great, seamless fights in, with only the occasional "underwater" match occuring. Furthermore, you can view pings, adjust frame delays and mess around with a bunch of other stuff to customize your online experience for the better.\n\nAnother good sign of a thoughtful online mode is the ability to dip into practice mode without leaving a lobby, so you can work on those special cancels between bouts.\n\nSo, as an exercise in making a perfect fighting game, there you have it - Yatagarasu  AoC is about as good as it gets. It takes inspiration from the greats, melds them together and comes out with something that's nostalgic yet new, punishing yet rewarding.\n\nHowever, that's coming from the perspective of somebody who cut their adult fighting teeth on the alpha series and Third Strike and, as others have mentioned, this game is a bit of a love letter for fighter fans of that era.\n\nMechanically, it's all there, and that's all that matters to me, but if you put it up against almost any other fighter, the presentation of the entire thing is pretty jarring. From the minute you hit play it feels like you're in some kind of debug mode on an arcade cabinet, with a range of options and essentially dipswitch functions being the first thing you come into contact with.\n\nThe menus and in-game navigation is also pretty funky and learning your way around training mode options and the two different, but never explained, arcade modes may leave the casual fighter fans and the capital G gamers yearning for a more polished experience.\n\nPersonally, I like it and see it as another shoutout to the kind of player that knows the smell of burning silicone on a CPSII board, but it's not something for everyone.\n\nLikewise, the characters are almost at a Mortal Kombat level of pallete swappy (and a little goofy), but their styles are unique, they match up nicely with their movements and the hitboxes and hurtboxes are all in the right places, so the game exercises as a great fighter, regardless of how creative the character design is.\n\nThere are some nice, thoughtful design features in amongst the rough bits like the assist commentary and the Samurai Shodown style hype-factory of an announcer, that will keep putting a smile on your face throughout with their comedy one liners and old school Akihabaran hatred towards throw tactics.\n\nJumping straight into this game, guns blazing, it took no time at all to find a few links and combos with some bite, with the standard KoF build of jump in heavy, crouchy-standy mix-up into a special/overhead. Specials can often beautifully cancel into other specials, but there's no meterburn or drive cancel cost to do it, which will undoubtedly lead to some awesome acrobatics when Yatagarasu picks up competitively.\n\nMy verdict here, despite its presentation, is that Yatagarasu is a top tier fighter. If you're begging for a new era of Third Strike and the like, this could be it. It keeps that old techy stuff alive, it's a future classic, it's both beauty and the beast. Just make sure to look for the diamond beyond all that mud.","July 11, 2015","true","13.6"," 52 of 57 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","52","57","0","6"

But once you read into the game's history and the direction it is going for its a great nod to the classic fighting games on yesteryear. YTG is a great and simple fighting game but always fun. Matches are at a good pace and combos are a lot easier to pull off than your SF4 FADC tight links etc. Sure the game has tight links in places but they are not really required. Netcode is amazing with the ability to adjust the input delay at the character select screen with O and P. O = decrease delay (best at lower pings), P = increase delay (smoother gameplay at higher pings).

The ui is clunky, audio mixing is broken, online play at the moment requires port forwarding, and lobbies require a lot of micromanagement. That being said, the game itself plays smoothly and feels like a fusion between Third Strike and King of Fighters--the latter isn't surprising since it was created by three former SnK developers. It's a 4 button fighter with a parry system--red parries included--guard crush, and the hop attack that third strike uses. Combos are generally designed around being fun to execute as well (I'm looking at you, Hina.) Beyond just combos the neutral game can feel really rewarding also. Good reads lead to real soviet damage while poor usage of super jumps and parries lead to counter hit states meaning momentum can swing pretty quickly.\n\nAesthetically, Yatagarasu borrows a lot from the era of vintage sprites and the creators do a very good job of bringing that style into a more modern setting. Unfortunately, the resolution is locked at 640 x 480 so it can, understandably, be hard to appreciate.\n\nCutting this short, Yatagarasu plays well but has some very clunky problems in the way it presents itself and if you hated Third Strike you're going to hate this game.\n\n(Netcode is good by the way and it'll have ggpo soon so that'll be great.)\n\nP.S. always do what your sister tells you.\n\nP.P.S.

Anyone who was a fan of Street Fighter Alpha/3rd Strike will feel right at home with Yatagarasu. But the solid local gameplay doesnt make up for the shotty online. Terrible menus and a few bugs here and there.\n\nAs of right now its nearly impossible to connect to anyone without having to portfoward, which shoudnt be the case. Its 2015 things such as port forwarding should be a non issue but it is. Yes it will be fixed soon hopefully with the implementation of GGPO but for now ill stick to a no.\n\nOntop of that it has some of the worst menus I have seen in a game. Navigating through them is a nightmare and youll need to pray you dont screw something up.\n\nAspect ratios are also a pain. There as of right now is no 16:9 aspect ratio so anyone using a monitor that wasnt made in the early 2000's will be unhappy. It typically runs at 640x480.\n\nIf youre able to play locally with some friends go right ahead.","July 7, 2015","false","3.2"," 48 of 76 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","48","76","4","3"

The game's presentation is horrible. The aesthetics of all the menus in the game really detract from the game and makes it look very incomplete. Also, having to set up matches online is a chore compared to how other fighting games handle this these days. It feels like this still needed a few more months of polish to have things ironed out and it feels like they really rushed this out of the door due to lack of funding or something.\n\nNow the good news is that the gameplay is there. The fight mechanics feel great, controls are tight, and character designs look good even though you can tell that they took some short cuts here and there with how they designed the character. Sound and hit effects feel good as well, which to me is an important aspect of a fighting game. Also, once you're able to get online and play you have smooth matches to look forward to. At first I thought it was horrible, but the game gives you an option at the character select menu before a match to adjust to the latency of you opponent. It works ridiculously well.\n\nWith all this said, the game would have been amazing if they'd had been able to get everything in working order. I do recommend this game to hardcore fighting game fans, but casuals may find the menus system and online implementation off putting and frustrating.","September 26, 2015","true","7.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

So, I ended up trying to jump or counter with the same move and spamming it. But overtime, I started to see the diversity of the characters and their attacks.\n\nFortunately, of the 11 fighters featured in the game, there are characters with good variety of enjoyable fight moves and special attacks.\n\nI enjoy the humor of utilizing I think are developers (or their friends) to assist you (which they really don't do that well) and them making useful, humorous or snide comments while you are playing.\nI see potential in the game but with a low budget, they do all they can to make the game work.\n\nThere are some issues that I experienced from the opening movie before going to the main menu. Using a PS4 controller for the PC, often would hit a button that would take me to a menu to leave the game, so you have to be careful not to accidentally hit the left trigger.\n\nAlso, it's best as a single player at this time. Not sure if the developers are planning to enhance the game in the next update, as what we see constantly with the latest "Street Fighter" or "BlazBlue" games.\n\nThe game has 11 playable characters but one thing I wish was that the game was cheaper. Voice packs are $29.99, various versions of the game (version 1.0-version 4.3 released at Comiket) go for $19.99, soundtrack for $10 and art pack for $3.\n\nBut overall, if you enjoy SNK or Capcom fighting games of old "Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm" is worth getting, especially when it goes on sale on STEAM. But if you are looking for a polished fighting game, you may be disappointed with "Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm".\nI personally enjoyed it!","February 16","true","10.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaborger/recommended/319280/","zaborger","zaborger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaborger/","140 products in account","A love letter to old school fighting game fans\nDeveloped by a small, but passionate team, Yatagarasu brings some of the best elements from the 90's classic arcade titles and offers fast, solid gameplay with strong emphasis on fundamentals and accessible, easy to understand mechanics. No air-dashes, triple jumps or several gauges to manage. Elements like parries (called button locks) and juggles, often associated with advanced techniques, feel natural and not as intimidating here, for parries, the game even provides visual cues so players can understand the timing properly.\nThe character roster is fairly small, but there's some variety between styles - even considering the palette/headswap entries. From the fairly standard, beginner-friendly ones like Kou and Crow, to more unique ones like Hanzo, as many reviewers have said, veterans of Capcom and especially SNK fighters will feel right at home, being able to quickly adapt to the pace and familiar controls. At the same time, the no-nonsense approach can give newcomers an easier time to truly experiment with different playstyles. Execution is crucial, but reading your opponent is absolutely essential -- matches can be brutal and end quickly with good counters.\n\nYatagarasu is definitely a great game at its core. For the fighting game players, the gameplay is really what matters. It does try some little unusual ideas, like the commentary system, which is another nod to the fighting game community and those legendary Japanese tournaments from the early 2000s, and the Twitter integration for a more organized online play. But the overall presentation and additional content will give it a hard time to attract fans of flashier, more polished titles. The game doesn't hide its humble origins as a doujin game, and while Attack on Cataclysm is Yatagarasu in its the most complete version, it still feels quite lacking at some aspects. The character animation and sprites are incredible - if you like old school pixel art, Styleos/Kotani's work alone is enough reason to get this game, but the low resolution and static backgrounds may be major issues for some people. The soundtrack is good, there are no character specific themes, but the tracks really work with the game. There's some inconsistency in audio quality but the voice acting is very good.\nUI isn't as consistent as it could be, and although the netcode works fairly well (there's promise of GGPO integration), the online environment is a little rough, not as user-friendly as most titles, requiring manual port-forwarding to work properly.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the inconsistent presentation, Yatagarasu delivers when it matters most. If you look past these issues, you'll find a solid title. It may not be for everyone, but it's the kind of game that makes you remember why fighting games still have many devoted fans even nowadays.","January 6","true","26.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Yatagarasu has great netcode. Yatagarasu is beginner friendly. Yatagarasu is very fast, but Yatagarasu is not an anime fighter. Yatagarasu, quite frankly, looks like garbage.\n\nThis is a game in which individual player skill, quick wits, and experience will win out over meticulously practiced combos.\n\nThoughts:\nYatagarasu is the first fighting game I've seen released since the launch of Street Fighter 4 that presents the player with an experience which boils down the SF-influenced 2D Fighting genre to its core. It apes Third Strike pretty hard, but it's much easier to pick up.\n\nAt the end of the day, 99% of 2D fighters are just Street Fighter 2 with a gimmick. Yatagarasu has no gimmick. Parrying, to me, feels like the most natural extension of what could possibly done with the genre without changing the fundamental gameplay that Street Fighter 2 layed out. Parrying quickens the pace of the game without simply upping the speed. Guard breaks also keep players on their toes, expanding upon the typical guard, grab, 'n chip damage solution to turtling.\n\nIn essence, while this is a more offensive game than SF2/4, your options for defense have been expanded considerably, creating a beautiful balance which keeps both players on their toes. Mounting an offensive takes much more than a block strong riddled with high/low mixups and the like.\n\nPlease, play this game. It honestly looks really bad, it's obviously still in development (menus are very poor, stage icons use in-progress art), and personally, I think the the character designs are really boring. That said, the mechanics of this game are top notch. If you like fighting games, if you want to get good at fighting games, this is the game to play.\n","July 21, 2015","true","4.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

It's stuck at some god awful resolution, so when anything on steam pops up it covers a 5th of the screen. No way to change it in the launcher options or ingame. Playing it on a pad or stick feels bad, and the game doesn't recognize RT and LT. I'm used to playing Third Strike but, all the moves do A LOT of damage. Like one heavy hurricane kick will do like a 5th of your life bar. The game has 11 characters but a bunch of them are just clone characters. With very little(if any at all) variation. So it makes the cast feel way smaller than it is.\n\nThe only pros are that the online is good and the art is cool. And you can have Max be a commentator and that's pretty funny. Other than that you'd be better off just buying Skull Girls, Third Strike or MvC2. If I hadn't bought this from the Humble Store I'd refund it, it's that bad.","July 8, 2015","false","0.4"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","24","40","0","0"

Sad to see this coming from some former King of Fighters developers, who probably shouldn't have gone indie - someone should tell them that SNKP is hiring for devs to work on KOF XIV right now. Note that I played the original doujin release of this for a good while before trying the Steam version, hoping that things would be improved after the Indiegogo campaign finished up.\n\nThe HUD elements besides the life and super meters, and the menus are bar none the most poorly designed and confusing I have ever seen in a commercially sold game. Right when you start up the game, you'll notice that Arcade Mode is listed TWICE...how the hell did this pass basic playtesting? There is no Steam integration whatsoever, and the online settings probably require some sort of computer science/engineering degree to use - a bit much to ask of fighting game freaks.\n\nThe graphics are okay, but uneven. Characters are generally well drawn and animated, but players who have more than a passing familiarity with Capcom and SNK fighters will notice some shameless sprite edits, especially with Jet inheriting several moves from SF's Dudley and KOF's Ralf Jones. The newer stages range from average to good-looking, but the ones made earlier in development all look like lazily photoshopped wallpapers, or even unfinished. The soundtrack varies from not terrible, to completely awful as in the vocal screamo song. There isn't a single song I'd remember or would listen to outside the game. There's no 16:9 support, but I wouldn't have used a stretch option with invisible walls (like in MvC2 on 360/PS3) anyway.\n\nThe characters and mechanics are rather unremarkable and derivative. Most of them are lazy clones of famous Street Fighters, and four of them are just palette swapped clones of each other. Yatagarasu makes no bones about its heavy Third Strike influences, with its selectable supers and parries, but completely lacks the finesse, production values and charm of that game. There's two parry buttons instead of needing to input a timed directional, which doesn't really work too well. There's a story mode (listed as a second arcade mode), but it's boring and bare-bones as crap, the translation is kinda off, and it fails at giving us any more of a reason to care about the doofus wannabes that make up the roster. Admittedly, the four characters added as a result of the Indiegogo funding are somewhat more original and well designed, though Hanzo's moveset is a complete mess.\n\nThe people promoting this made a big deal about the commentator feature, where canned clips of several well-known FGC personalities (or at least I think they're well known, I didn't recognize a single one) will play during the match in response to what's going on. I found this to be nothing but inane, annoying and immersion-destroying, especially with the real-life photographs popping out all the time. We don't need stream monster crap escaping Twitch and venturing into the world of the game itself. At least you can turn these off, but I don't think you can disable commentators used by online opponents.\n\nI applied for a refund and probably won't be revisiting the game unless it gets hugely overhauled. Why would you ever want to settle for a vastly inferior clone of Third Strike? If you want an under-the-radar 2D fighter that's actually really cool, original and memorable, check out Chaos Code on PS3 (a Steam release has been hinted at).","July 7, 2015","false","0.4"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","28","49","0","0"

Best thing about this game is the balance and risk reward system. Every charcter is scary and really strong once they get momentum and their mixup game going.\n\nYou take more damage for getting hit in the air during a super jump and if you miss your parry timing or do the wrong parry (parry counter). In addition if you get parry countered in the air you go into a juggle state so the opponent can dish out some serious hurt. So if you go ham and super jump like crazy to get in or mash parries you will get HURT! LOVE IT!\n\nOnce this game gets GGPO netcode it will be even better. Right now the online is very solid and I regularly play with NA players with little lag if they are around 100ping.\n\nIf you like oldschool 2D fighter or are a fan of SF3: 3rd strike you will most likely love this game.

They’re both systems of worth within Yatagarasu's old-school aesthetics, leaning away from the encyclopaedic move lists of Marvel or Guilty Gear and expecting you to instead exist within violent bursts of sudden damage, little bubbles of aggression you either fall foul of or successfully defend against.

However, if you can look past that there is a great fighting game here with very mechanical movesets and battleing.\n\nAs with most fighting games I would recommend it more for multiplayer than the singleplayer aspects, as while the premise of 1920s ninjas is pretty cool, the storyline isn't particually interesting. You could have a lot of fun with netplay vsing other players. The game also has a very in depth training mode that, although a bit unintuitive, can aid a player to prepare against almost any incoming attack.\n\nThe main draw of this game is the parry system from 3rd Strike. While in 3rd Strike you had to press forward as the hit connects, in Yatagarasu there are dedicated buttons for high and low parrys. This means I would say this would fit right at home with people who want to try learning a similar system to 3S and want something new with the parry system.\n\nThere isn't a large variety of characters and they are quite limited and reuse sprites, for example, I'm pretty sure Jet and Jyuzumaru's pants are exactly the same and there are a few characters who are basically the same character with slightly different moves and a different haircut. Several of the characters are near rip offs of 3rd Strike characters like Jet is very similar to Dudley and Hanzo is very similar to Chun Li etc. That said there a variety of combos attack methods to perform with each character, the characters do perform differently.\n\nThe pixel art is great for the characters, they are very nicely animated and look interesting, however the backgrounds are quite poor and don't mix with the character art at all, they look like they are on different planes of reality. Only the street background looked like it had any effort put into it, some literally look terrible and I cannot tell what they are supposed to be or look like.\n\nMusic ranges from mediocre to really good like the opening which is great. The voice acting is good and so is the sound effects, they sound very authetic.\n\nOverall, its a good fighter that needs a bit of polish around the rough edges but is definitely worth checking out and isn't too expensive at $15 at time of writing this review.","August 24, 2015","true","5.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The devs are working to put GGPO into the game, but as of right now, you are forced to open your ports in your router manually to assure you can play online. This is just unacceptable and should not be the responsibility of the player to do. The interface in this game is VERY poorly put together and that is due to its indie nature. The interface i can excuse, the online component in todays day and age, i cannot.\n\nWith that out of the way, I love this game! This is one of the most solid and rewarding fighters to be released in quite a bit. All the standard fighting game archetypes are represented well. The more unique fighters are rewarding to play and very fun! While the shoto type characters can feel very brain-dead and a bit auto-pilot, there is plenty of variety in the albeit small roster. Your favorite type of character will be here.\n\nYatagarasu's take on the parry system is fantastic in my opinion. It walks the line of making your parry more and less risky. When you mistime, or improperly read your opponent with a parry, you will suffer a BL Counter and take more damage. Holding a direction when inputting parry will give you more or less of a parry window depending, and i think it is handled very well.\n\nLike any fighter, there is a bit of a learning curve. However, any fighting game vet or player vaguely familiar with 2d fighting game inputs or fundamentals should be able to have a blast with friends or rivals. The training mode offers challenges (trial modes) to help with learning combos or general move application.\n\nThis is a game that i really enjoy but again, have a hard time recommending in its current state. I REALLY hope GGPO will come sooner rather than later. I can wait, but it seems a large portion of the FGC and community at large cannot. fighting game fan? I'd say grab it.

The game definitely has a reasonable cast of characters that feels appropriate for the genre and fight a bit differently without being overly different in their usage, and the paired down move list gives a more simple yet satisfying experience for the fighting game enthusiast. The game probably shouldn't have come out of early access in my opinion, as the polish around the edges especially with UI and in game inconsistency in elements is apparent after playing for a period of time, but that doesn't overlook the good solid fighting base here. It's no Skullgirls, but if you're looking for competitive fighting at a low cost, this may be up your alley.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video First Impressions: http://youtu.be/i7HAEz5pHz8\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nSolid Simplified Fighting Mechanics that aren't overly complicated, and focus on simple strikes and combos while not being overly reliant on combo strings.\nGood Character variation that doesn't hit too much of a range of different methods/strategies, but does just enough. Characters may have specific focuses like Grappler or Zoner, but the base gameplay is accessible to most people in the end.\nCharacters designs are simple but they work. Good color schemes for most characters and they don't detract from battle.\nI like the idea of commentators and choosing them, and while it may get old after a long period of time, did appreciate their inclusion, as it helped to add to the spectacle of battle.\nLike the simplification of the low/high system and eliminating the medium.\nFeel like the game plays better for players who want to be more aggressive, which has been different then a lot of games for fighting (Ultra SF4 being a prime example)\n-:\nStory mode is weak,  like most fighting games, and especially with a new franchise it's hard to follow along with what's going on.\nMissing polish. Things like the Story mode reading Arcade, and simple ideas like a dizzy symbol over the head is missing to add to the game's overall presentation.\nTrigger buttons are not able to be bound on Controller.\nUI elements at time can be ugly, and feel like they were thrown together at the last minute, especially in story mode/arcade mode.","July 7, 2015","true","3.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Unfortunately, you won't be finding any originality here, all of the moveset came from somewhere else like KOF and Street Fighter. It has some defensive move, some offensive move. Parrying is the selling point.

You must port forward your router, but then again, not all of the router will allow you to do it fully, so in worst case scenario you will be stuck playing on random match only.\n\nThe menu UI is not very good. Online is difficult to see, confusing, it's not polished at all. Seeing "2 arcade modes" doesn't make any sense. There are some options in training mode, but hard to navigate.\nUnlike many other fighting on steam, this game has very small support for controllers. Keybinding is pain in a butt, you have to go through your system file and open document in notepad, reading them in JAPANESE.\n\nIf you still need explanation for not recommending this game, just think for a moment- you have 2 options, between Yatagarasu and Street Fighter. Both have similar style, but Street Fighter have far more characters, more online players, and most importantly, more single player options. Even with its double price, the Street Fighter is what I would get, in fact, what I SHOULD have gotten. It really doesn't matter if it's doujin or big company game, there should be no excuse for poor quality- you are the one who's paying for it.\n\nIf you bought majority of fighting games on Steam, then I guess this is your limited choice left. If you just started to look for fighting games, I don't recommend this game. If you are limited to your budget, go get Skullgirls. While Skullgirls are harsh on online, it is much more completed game than this.","July 15, 2015","false","14.7"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

But tha also means you'll have to defend against people coming in at you, and you have multiple tools to do this. You have your standard anti-air attacks and blocks, but you also have a parry, something 3rd Strike players are very familiar with. But beware, if you miss this parry, you can eat a lot of damage from an incoming combo.\nThe netcode, while a bit scary at first, is very good, with adjustable inputs to to minimize lag and work with whatever ping you have. (I have heard a rumor, however, that it will eventually be getting GGPO, which will be prettier and easier to use, but comes with all the problems GGPO entails, i.e. frame skipping rather than lag).\nWith a cast of 11 characters that all play differently, there is variety in the cast.\nThere are also "commentators" in the match, these range from the in game characters to actual commentators in the FGC from both Japan and America, such as Tokido, James Chen, Ultra David, and Maximillian. This is a nice novelty, but eventually they all run out of quips to throw out, and get's old after a while.\nOne thing this game has the people may see as a problem is an intentionally low resolution, so it could better emulate the feel of the fighting games from the era it draws so much influence from, but the people who place a high importance on this should be warned.\nThe only real negative this game has is the unpolished UI, such as 2 different modes both being named "Arcade", text overlapping in the lobby select screen and while doing the challenges in training mode, but im sure this will be touched up in future patches, and is a negligble complaint as is.\n\nTL;DR - Amazing fighting game, total throwback gameplay and visually, great netcode - if a bit intimidating, subpar UI, 8.5/10","July 9, 2015","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A combination of 3rd Strike and KoF, this game is really well presented in terms of mechanics. Only reason why I can recommend this to people who plays fighting games regularly, but not to those who aren't familiar with the genre\n\nSound: Great soundtrack. However, most of the time, the songs are not very well looped. A minor inconvenience, but not unbearable. The japanese voice acting seems on point, and the and I love the effort that the developers put in for the community, adding the voices of people who are popular in the fighting game community, such as Maxilimilian Dood, James Chen, etc. and included the voices of each playable character.\n\nArtwork / Graphics: I'm not sure what to say about the graphics in game, since this is developed by a small group of people. I'm sure that they were going for a more, classic feel like 3rd Strike and older KoF games, but needless to say, I'm a little dissapointed by how the characters look in game, especially since it's 2015. Character artwork is great, but minimal, one per each character. Also panties and ♥♥♥♥ for the fan base.\n\nPort: The port of this game is a HUGE mess. The horrendous and lazy looking UI will make you think this game was developed by someone who just got out of college. Get used to seeing a lot of text over a bland square of white because that's exactly what the pause menus look like. There are translation errors everywhere. From cutscenes to the option menus, no one can escape the engrish. The controls can get messed up, going by the bugs forums. Keyboard, controller, and sticks doesn't work sometimes, and there have been problems with the game inputting down for no reason. Several bugs. Only one resolution size, so steam overlay looks messed up. That is, if one can open up the steam overlay. I personally can't open it up, but there might be people that can. Developers definately needs to fix this up if they want a running community.\n\nTL:DR good game that received a bad port. I look forward to the oncoming patches, and hope they clean up the mess they've made. I understand that this will take some time, as this is a community funded indie game. I only recommend if you're a veteren of the fighting game genre.\n\n7/10, not enough fan service","July 7, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Holy cow!\nPlays similar to oldschool fighting games, and can be pretty easy to pick up, but seems hard to master\nCharacter variety in playstyles\nNice animations, even with the pixel design choices\nFunny FGC related commentators\nMusic is pretty good\nOnline is functional and a lot better than a certain NRS game out there\nGood fighting game for its price\n\nCons-\nAnime style can be a bit offputting if you're not a fan\n2 of the characters are legit clones outside of one being a charge character, and the other using fireball motions\nUI looks awful and can definitely use some dumbing down\nRelatively small cast, though this is hardly a con in my book\nArcade mode story is fairly mediocre, as expected from an indie fighting game\n\nThe game is to its core, OLD SCHOOL. Don't try to find some 50 hit 80 percent combos here, because they'll all be 5-7 and do tons of damage. The gameplay reminds me a lot of games like King of Fighters and Street fighter 3 Third strike, where the movement feels very similar to KOF, and the mechanics and fighting itself feels very 3s. The animations for the game are great, despite being pixelated. Some may be a bit offput by the design choice, with its pixely anime style, but overall I thought it was fine. The cast is also very diverse in play style. You have your charge characters, shotos, rekka characters, and grappler. The only complain in the cast I have is the two female young ladies who both have the same stance and animations, but one happens to be a charge character and the other happens to be a quartercircle character. Really wish there was more originality there, but overall, I'm not mad at that decision.\nOutside of the gameplay, we have a decent training mode, relatively barebones story, online features that play pretty well so far, and a Ui that has to be the worst UI I've seen for a fighting game on steam so far. It's pretty ugly and way too big. Hopefully a patch or something can make this both look and feel way more user friendly. Controller support is all there. My Madcatz Fightstick pro was plugged in and worked no problem. You can assign your buttons pretty easily, and you should be fine. Layout for the game is fairly simple too.\nIf you're apart of the FGC, you'll be happy to know this does offer some pretty unique humor in highlighting some known FGC players, commentators, and content creators as chooseable commentators for your match. I tend to always pick Maximillian, usually always saying cornball but inspiring lines, or one of the japanese players, like Tokido.\n\nOverall, I'm enjoying Yatagarasu so far. It's a game i'll stick with for some time. I definitely recommend it if you like oldschool fighting games, especially games like SF3 third strike. You'll fit right at home with it.","July 7, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have quite a bit of experience in fighter playing competition for over 15 years and in arcades since I could reach the stick. The game feels solid and has nice mechanics. This combines the kof type 4 button style with Third strike (3S) parries for 4 buttons.\n\nParrying in this game now has big consequences compared to 3S and are done with one of two buttone (high or low). On the ground if hit you take more damage and more hitstun, in the air a failed parry allows you to be juggled 5 more times for huge damage. Universal overhead give combos when hit on crouching opponent and mostly neutral on block. There are some commmand normals, such as the grappler must hit df+hk to sweep.\n\nThe animation has a 3S style and the game feels nice and responsive. You get to pick your super like 3S as well. This very much feels like its own game. The cast does have some influences from 3S and "clones" play nothing like each other.\n\nI'll update this the more I play, but this is definitely solid so far.

It’s slightly surprising then that Yatagarasu feels far more Street Fighter, and with the inclusion of a parry system, it’s easy to see the inspiration.\n\nStraight off the bat let me say that Yatagarasu is fast. It’s more restrained than a VS game, but so much snappier than a traditional SNK game, with moves just rolling in to each other. It feels great, really on point, and ultra responsive. That said it may be a little too responsive, while it’s nice that specials and combos are easy to pull off, it’s also a little too easy to accidentally throw out your super to end a combo.\n\nThe character roster isn’t huge. Granted there’s the argument that fighting games wrongly take the ‘more is more’ approach to their line-ups, but Yatagarasu feels like it doesn’t quite cater for everyone. That said there’s a decent mix, if you like your Ryu’s and Ken’s then there’s a couple of characters there for you, there’s a boxer, a wrestler, even a charge character. As a fan of Garou and King of Fighters, I’d have liked to have seen the ex-SNK devs throw in a few more SNK inspired characters, but perhaps those movesets wouldn’t work at this pace, perhaps they just wanted to get away from that. Either way, there’s no point complaining about what the game isn’t, especially when what it is plays so well.\n\nThat said, as a package it doesn’t really deliver on the promise of the core game. A game made by a small team is always going to feel a little rough, but at the time of release (and I held back the review to play some games on release day), the online isn’t where it should be. There’s supposed to be fixes coming, but I’ve struggled to get in non-ranked lobbies. To play online I’ve stuck to ranked matches, which hasn’t exactly done wonders for my ego, but even when I’ve managed to get a game it’s been heavy with lag. It’s hard to know how much of that is because I’m playing against people on the other side of the world, but still, it needs improving. It’s also the reason I can’t really comment on how balanced the roster is, certainly there’s characters I prefer, and characters I’m awful with, but without lots of varied match ups, played at a decent lick, it’s hard to really see their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe story mode is an odd one. There’s 2 arcade modes, one with more story than the other. The various stories aren’t particularly great if I’m honest, and the presentation of them is the definition of bare bones. The cpu will give you a bit of a match on the normal difficulty, it’s not impossible to beat, and it will leave itself wide open, but it will also parry you and counter. It’s a shame there isn’t a bit more meat there to make up for the currently stuttering online mode, but it’s better than the bare minimum. Offline though you do at least get to see what the game is capable of,perhaps playing online against a not too distant friend will work well enough, but if you can get someone in the same room then all the better.\n\nThe training mode is a mix of far more options than you’ll ever really need, and far too little information to make the most of it. It’s not noob-friendly, certainly not if you want more than to just jump in and unleash on something that won’t fight back. You can command the AI to perform certain moves, so it’s not a bad way to practice your parrying, and you can set challenges, but the language used means you need to experiment to see what exactly is being asked of you. Which is indicative of the training mode really. There’s nothing in the game to tell you there’s parrying, or how to do it (it’s a high/low button selection rather than directional like Street Fighter 3), nor about the guard crush, etc. It’s a game that could have done with an instruction book.\n\nThis is all starting to sound a little negative, so let’s finish on a positive. While the graphics options are limited to ‘Do you want full screen or not?’, understandable due to the 2D nature of the game, but still a shame that the default resolution isn’t higher, the actual art is great. The characters are animated well, flowing nicely with a chunky 2D look. The backgrounds steal the show though, some are almost abstract watercolours, almost all of them would make fantastic wallpapers if they were a higher resolution. The music is great too, cheesey but great.\n\nIt’s a shame then that Yatagarasu’s package isn’t better. Ignoring the clunky arcade mode, there’s also the online settings being outside the game, with no real instructions on how best to set it all up. If you can get it working though, or can play against a friend, Yatagarasu is a great old-school beat-em up, fast paced and fun.","July 8, 2015","true","6.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Woohoo!\n\nOkay, it's not quite perfect. It's clear that the developers put most of their effort into the gameplay itself, which boasts a really fun combat engine which falls somewhere between KoF 98 and Third Strike as far as combos, parrying and general movement go.\n\nThis is awesome, but then there's things like the overly convoluted, borderline ugly UI, slightly odd translation or expecting players to delve into their port settings to get it running correctly online. PC literate players will be fine, but more casual players may take a while to sort it all out. Oh, and there's a notable lack of configurable keybinding options and no resolution settings. Low res or no res, amigos.\n\nThat aside, it's pretty rad. I find the combat way more interesting than many of its contemporaries, given that so many fighters these days are sequels playing it safe, and despite living in the UK I've had some smooth matches so far - and that should improve once the GGPO update materializes.\n\nOh, and Aja's totally sweet. Glad she won the crowdfunding poll.\n\nTL;DR - It's a genuinely great fighter so far lumbered with some awkward UI trappings.","July 7, 2015","true","12.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Its U.I and technical issues present a glaring issue though. I tried playing it with a 360 pad and all the buttons worked, but the thumbstick didnt get picked up. It has no aspect ratio options. It has a lot of unexplained mechanics, which after most of the fighters that have come out recently having huge portions of single player taken up by tutorials, is off putting. This would be fine in any other type of game, but there is a reason other fighters do that. While i recommend it as a fighter, im waiting for a few technical fixes until I pick it up proper.","July 11, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A lot of bad marks with online in general; netcode is bad; matchmaking system is bad; lobbies can ocasionally cause the game to freeze. The menus are also pretty bad, but that's not really important. Would be nice if the client was also more stable, as I often have problems if running it full screen, especially trying to tab out which usually leads in one of two results; not allowing me to tab out; crashing the game. Hopefully they do implement the GGPO, because beneath all these negative aspects involving online mainly lies a great game. The gameplay is really solid, and has a lot of elements making it a really good fighter. Even now, you can still get a couple good online matches here and there, it just takes longer than it should.

We're talking you'll get slowmo underwater simulator experiences with 120~ ping, all your ports forwarded, the netcode updated to maximum flux, deflector shields set to full, after you checked your TCP/IP protocol, turned off youtube, and handed your opponent your IP address, and set input delay to 5 at the start, carefully manipulating it in game with O and P.\n\nThese are some of the hoops you must make to play this game, and it's just not worth it. A fighting game without functional online is useless to me, you, and everybody else. Some people report that online experience is satisfactory, but until this is the norm, well...\n\nThis is a bit of a shame, as it's a beautiful, down to earth, minimalistic street fighter 3 spiritual successor. While the characters initially come off as bland (hey, you guys, I'm gonna play Kakashi from Naruto! Huh huh huh!), they'll eventually grow on you quite a bit.\n\nI feel the best way to describe this game is as a reverse skullgirls. A fat combo in Yata is 4 hits and a super finish, performed after a sneaky surprise backdash and trailing your EX hadoken. A fat combo in skullgirls is 80 hits and two super finishes, alongside an assist off Fortune's head to trigger the Mike Z patented SOVIET DAMAGE module, and the opponent will likely put his controller down and tab out to read ♥♥♥♥♥ as you do a totally standard, totally meaningless reset into your buzzword buzzword buzzword long combo hype, with character designs that appeal to you don't even want to know, shockfull of dated late 2000s memes.\n\nSomewhere down the line, something was lost, but the timeless elegance and form of fighting games is recaptured here.\n\nIt is my HOPE  that they fix this game, and keep adding to it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningWildVidya/recommended/319280/","RunningWildVidya","RUNNING ★ WILD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RunningWildVidya/","153 products in account","This game really wants to be Street Fighter 3 Third Strike, a game I think is vastly overrated. Yatagarasu uses 4 attack buttons (2 punches, 2 kicks, like in KOF), and... 2 buttons to Parry, high and low, which in my opinion, is really terrible and an annoying feature. I'm not particuarly a fan of parry mechanics in 2D fighters to begin with, especially when it involves a dedicated parry button, but Yatagarasu has to take it a step further by having 2 dedicated parry buttons, on top of being able to tap forward to parry like in Street Fighter 3 as well. Games like The Last Blade, which had a single dedicated button for the job, also had a whiff animation, that Yatagarasu lacks, which I think is major problem for a game with a parry button. There is an indicator below the lifebar to show when a parry is attempted, but I think it's a poorly thought out system.\n\nThe game uses your typical Street Fighter style commands, It's very easy to get into and start doing stuff. The damage output is extremely high in this game, but it gets even more extreme when counter hits are involved, especially if you try to super jump in on your opponent or you somehow fail a parry attempt, you take much more damage. Two good solid hits can easily wipe out 40-50% of your lifebar. This is very much an old school style fighting game where a single hit can determine the outcome of a match easily.\n\nThe characters in this game are all pretty boring and bland. You got two shoto clones, two katana wielding school girls, Dudley wannabe, Zangief wannabe, rekka character, etc. None of the characters in this game are very interesting, exciting or original, they play exactly like you'd expect them to with one glance at their moves. Most of the characters look like they don't even belong in the same game together for some reason. Only Hanzo really stands out, and that's because she's total fanservice, but then you just realize in terms of aesthistics, she's Angel from KOF designed to be a "ninja". Her crouch stance is terrible, I dunno what the designers of this game were thinking giving her that. For her standing stance her chest inflates and deflates, it just looks really silly.\n\nGraphically, the game can't even compare to cream of the crop 90's arcade fighting games. There's not a whole lot of detail on character sprites, alot of them look very flat and the animation on them is pretty average, but worse off is the background art. Most stages look like they are just a single flat image, with little to no scrolling or animations going on, not even spectators (There's spectators in 1 stage, and they are pretty awful looking, some even displaced/overlapping).\n\nFar as audio goes, most of the music in the game is pretty forgettable, not a single good theme in the game. Majority of character voices are whatever, they don't have much personality. Sound effects, again nothing special, average fighting game fare. Don't even get me started on the commentators. They are totally obnoxious and one of the worst things about this game, almost as bad as the Navigators from Persona 4 Arena. Thankfully you can turn them off, for the most part. I dunno, sometimes they would pop back up even though I toggled an option to disable them. I don't get it. Although I did laugh at UltraDavid's "Is there trip guard anti-air in this game?".\n\nSo yeah, Yatagarasu... It's just really dull, boring and lazy game design. It does nothing new or original. How did it take them so many years to get this game out? I mean there are a ton of other fighting games out there that do what Yatagarasu does, but way better. The main issue I have with the game is that even though it's supposed to be finished, it still feels very incomplete and like an Alpha. It completely lacks polish, it's a mess, characters in this game feel extremely shallow and limited. I really can't justify spending $15 on this game. You would be better off spending that money on something like The King Of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match Final Edition or 2002 Unlimited Match. Those games are way better designed, with much better gameplay mechanics than you'll find in Yatagarasu. This game's been in development limbo for years, and frankly, it was not worth the wait.","July 10, 2015","false","14.1"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","0"

I can do specials, but something about the double-quarter-circle motion for supers fails me. This is a TERRIBLE fighting game for the executionally challenged, and the presence of a few annoying characters seemly beloved by the community (ie, they get used alot online) means I personally cannot get any fun out of this game. If I could get a Steam refund I would, but I was so sure I'd like the game somehow that I went over the limit of gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tabriel/recommended/319280/","Tabriel","Tabriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tabriel/","971 products in account","I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but after waiting for this game for so long now... after playing it I am a little disappointed. When I say "No" to recommending the game, that's unfortunate because I really wanted to recommend it for my love of fighting games, but just not how it is now as it doesn't stand up to current-gen titles. I'll give my 2c on the pros and cons as I see them.\n\nI don't mean any insult by having the cons list larger than the pros, and the development team should be praised for bringing out a fighting game with their own IP; this is just an opinion.\n\nPros:\n- Love Letter to the old-school fighters. Basic combat that is relatively easy to learn, even more so if you come from a fighting-game background.\n- Good Musical Arrangement. Techno-Japanese? I'm down for that! I could watch the intro over and over.\n- Fantastic Manga/Anime artwork. The intro is pretty cool, and the character art on the selection screens and in the story mode is well-done and finely detailed.\n\n---\n\nCons:\n- Too much of a Love Letter to the old-school fighters. Too basic in it's combat, and while I put that as a Pro it is also a Con. Too often do I find myself wanting to do air-dashes, air-recoveries, counters and all the more new-age utensils the modern fighters provide.\n- Reso-what-now? No resolution options... AT ALL. When you start the game an external-launcher will let you select windowed or full screen, but not at what resolution. Then in-game in the options menu there's no option for it either. When played in Windowed Mode it is a startling 640x480! So don't play it in fullscreen, especially if you have a widescreen monitor as it looks really rough.\n- Sprite Detail. Hand-in-hand with the low-res nature, the sprites don't hold their own when scrutinized closely, especially in full widescreen mode.\n- Character Cast. Only 11 characters. Not too much of a big deal.\n- Character List. You can't press down. Only left and right, which alternates you up and down through the characters on both rows. Why is this necessary?\n- Announcers. They put some form of "announcer" system in the game where you can choose an announcer (who I assume are pro-fighter players) to say random things like "Stuffed!" during the matches and pop their very rough-pixelated faces onto the screen. Too much of a disconnect during rounds.\n- Text. The in-game text for things on the main menu, continue screen, etc, look like they were just run through photoshop and had some basic outer-glow filters slapped on them. Minor, but seems very quick and dirty.\n- Menu Screen Confusion. Two arcade modes? 1st one is Arcade and the 2nd one is Story. There's no help-dialogue when you mouse-over them to let you know, so that could be changed to ease confusion.\n\nThere we have it, that's currently what I think of the game. So sadly, it's a No from me. A good effort, but just not enough in my eyes. I'll play some more, maybe get some more perspective, but that was just my early impressions.","July 15, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has very solid controls combined with fun gameplay and cool combos making it a must have. The game combines mechanics from SF3TS(Parries, Universal Overheads, Selectable Supers, Target Combos) and older KoF(The Four Button Style, The Juggling) games creating a very dynamic game. The music is rather hit or miss, being a mixture of synth and guitars. For example, Crow's theme is amazing, while Kou's can be forgettable. The layout/UI/HUD of the game looks like it came straight out of MUGEN, though. Like OMG it's that bad. But the sprites look amazing and so does the artwork. The only bad thing that I can really say about the game is that when you download it everything is fine until you enter a fighting mode, in which you'll be stuck holding down-right, as opposed to being in a neutral position. This can be solved by going into the Steam App folder for the game and opening the file Gl.LST in notepad or something and go down do where is says [KEYBOARDCONFIG0] and replacing all of the * with unmapped keys. Took me a half hour to get that solution though. Either way, I give this game an 8/10.","November 3, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, the good:\n\n1. Plays well. You feel in control of your character at all times.\n2. Deep, complex mechanics.\n3. Most of the spritework is pretty great.\n4. Inspired by Street Fighter III: Third Strike, my favorite fighting game of all time.\n\nThe nitpicks:\n1. Older versions of the character art were actually cleaner and nicer looking.\n2. Multiple character clones.\n3. The story is... well... just pretend it isn't there.\n4. The stage art clashes with the character art pretty badly at times.\n\nThe bad:\n1. Online play is confusing as hell. Port forwarding and technical setup aside, when you join a lobby, you have no control over the cursor unless you are host. Lack of any chat feature means you are basically waiting for the host to decide who gets to fight who and set the match up.\n2. GGPO is supposedly coming in a future update. The game needs it now. The slowdown and online wierdness is pretty bad as it currently is. Being able to set the frame delay before the fight is great, but doesn't solve the problem.\n3. The mechanics are deep to the point of craziness. You will need to look up guides online to figure out how this is played.\n\nThe game is pretty good, once GGPO finally comes along (the dev team is staying tight-lipped as to when this will happen) I can see myself playing this for a long time. Right now, though, I play a bit of arcade and training mode and have fun.
