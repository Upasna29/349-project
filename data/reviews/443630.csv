"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/443630/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nChicku's influences are clear: Flappy Birds, Angry Birds, Super Meat Boy... even the film Chicken Run. The result is a simple, amusing game that's charming enough to keep you playing for a good session or two.\n\nThe selling point of the game is the simple but annoying control system, based on rotating your chicken around 360 degrees, and tapping a button to flap in that direction. There's also a button that freezes you for a second, then fires you in the chosen direction, taking you safety past obstacles such as blowy pipes.\n\nThese controls result in genuinely funny (and gory) moments of chaos, and while you do get better with practice, the fact your chicken is so prone to gravity means you're never far from death.\n\nGameplay highlights video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J16IWK3Z9w\n\nChicku's campaign mode consists of LOADS of short, spiky levels. Almost too many - the game spreads itself quite thin and you might be waiting quite a while before something genuinely new turns up. But the levels are so short (some can be completed in a couple of seconds) that it's got a great sense of pace, urging you onwards.\n\nMost levels are just "get to the end", but occasionally you'll need to collect stuff over the course of as many lives as you need. For completists, each level has a one, two or three coin award depending on your best speed. The coins can currently be spent on randomly allocated hats.\n\nThere are more unlockables (that seem to come after a certain number of levels or coins, I wasn't entirely sure) that can be used to modify the game with crazy disco balls and the like.\n\nThe multiplayer versus mode, which I haven't tried yet, puts you in a choice of arenas of similar size to the campaign levels. A variety of weapons and tools spawn for you to collect and use to kill the other player. Time limits can be changed, silly modifiers (once unlocked) can mix things up.\n\nSo it's one of those games you jump in, get confused by for a few minutes, get into the spirit of it and blitz through half of it very quickly. Beyond that, it'll be worth a few more goes, plus waiting to see what is added over the course of early access. If you can sort out local multiplayer, the battle mode does look fun, although these days it's up against a LOT of arena games that offer more complexity.\n\n* Version reviewed: 1.01 (Early Access)\n* More indie gaming videos by Randomise User","April 7","true","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Gameplay is silly and challenging to appeal to both hardcore platformer fans and those just looking for a laugh.\nEntire game is 4-player local co-op compatible, making it an outstanding party game. Anyone can instantly drop in and out of the game without interrupting gameplay.\n240 levels is plenty of content to keep you satisfied.\nCONS:Some levels have a bit too much randomness thrown in, resulting in scenarios where you need to get lucky to win.\nChicken controls are a bit tough to get used to.\nPretty much required to have a controller to play the game as the precision of movement necessary to beat some of the harder levels is nearly impossible on keyboard.\nSUMMARY:Chicku is the love child between Super Meat Boy and Flappybird creating a game that is a well-designed and unique take on the platforming genre. Your goal is to fly your chicken through the maze avoiding grinders, grills, and other obstacles dangerous to chickens. There are 120 unique levels in the game and an additional 120 nightmare levels. The nightmare levels are the same layout as the original levels but with a TON more obstacles and traps. Best of all you can play the entire game with your friends, as every level in the game can be played local co-op. While the game can be frustrating at times overall it’s a silly, rewarding experience that has more than enough content to be worth the $13 price tag.\n","April 7","true","13.7"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

Very goofy, playfu and gruesome theme that works very well\n- the gameplay is most of the times very fun.(depending on what level you are on). like mentioned earlier its probably inspired by SMB and Flappy Bird and it has taken the most appealing parts of thoose two games and merged them well.\n- Motivates the player to replay levels to get coins and unlock hats \^O^/\n- a lot of varied levels to play\n- no bugs encountered! gratz!\n- fun but slightly too chaotic multiplayer mode.\n\nBAD\n-I only have one negative thing about the game to say but its a biggie for me. some of the levels are very unfair and not fun at all especially lvl 45... which is a fun idea but a horrible experience to actualy play. All the hardest levels are sadly at the moment the least satisfying. because they require precision to complete and the game lacks that in some of the controls, which leads to just replaying the levels untill you happens to slip through by chance (atleast for me) the charge move which should be used for precision sometimes put you in an unexpected direction after being used which contribute to this problem.\n\nI still think it is worth playing in its current state. the price is very fair for the content. These "unfair" levels are not that many and the only totaly horrible level ive played so far is lvl 45.\n\nThe game as it is right now (early acess) is very entertaining but with some updates has potential to be amazing!","April 22","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I tried it with a keyboard, and it was much much  harder. Still very doable of course, but without a controller you are going to have a lot more frustration, and a lot higher bloodpressure after a fer hours.\n\nOverall I would have to give this game an 8.5/10 . It really delivers in every way you would expect it to. It's difficult, it's funny, and its frekin addorable how they blow up into a cluster of blood, feathers and chicken wings.

But I warn you now.. it's isn't easy!\n\nPrepare to die, and to die often!  Prepare to watch your poor chicken carved into chicken nuggets in all sorts of bloody, gory ways!  ..And that's a big part of the lure to this game!\n\nWhile you can use a keyboard and mouse, a controller is definitely recommended.  You have a total of 3 maps, each with 40 levels, so 120 total levels in all to try and get your chicken to break open a crates with little trapped chicks inside.  Flying past all the spikes, spinning saw blades, and many other hazards is where the challenge comes from, each level progressively getting harder and harder.\n\nThere is also a local multiplayer mode where up to 4 local players can all duke it out for the claim to the most brutal chicken ever!\n\nThe ability to play each of the 120 levels and earn coins to equip your chicken hero with "cool cosmetic gear" adds to the addiction of this game and it really is a game that is a ton of fun to play!\n\n\nHeres my scores for this game based on my own unique scoring system:\n\nValue:  33 out of 40.\nFun:     28 out of 30.\nControls & Bugs:  20 out of 20\nGraphics & Sound: 8 out of 10\n-----------------------------------\nMY TOTAL SCORE:  89%\n\nThe price of this game is the biggest reason this game didn't score higher.  Even though there is a ton of levels and replayability, I just feel that if this game were priced a little lower, it would be much more appealing, so if you can catch this game at 50% off or better from it's $12.99 asking price, then my score for this game rises into the mid 90's!

This platformer is Super Meat Boy slid his double quarter pounder into Flappy Birds and gave it his secret sauce. That is Chicku. BTW, do yourself a favor and play this game with a controller.\nWARNING: The game is graphic in that is has copious amounts of cartoon blood. If you are with PETA, move along, this is not the game you were looking for.\n\nON TO THE REVIEW!\nSound: 7/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nReplayability: 7/10\n\nThis platformer does have integrated multiplayer. Co-Op and Deathmatch. Nothing like playing a suicide bomber chicken to take out your friends.\n\nSOUND:\nBasic sounds and music that doesn't annoy you after 4 straight hours of gameplay.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nCute cartoon mayhem within this slaughterhouse of horrors. Every death allows for another layer of blood to wash over the background with each subsequent death (as long as you remain on that level obviously).\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nI feel this game is well worth the $10 it is going for, for its coming out of Early Access sale price. Even for the regular price of $12.99, I would still pay that much for this game. (***Note, publisher provided a game key for review purposes, but in no way has influenced my personal or professional feelings on this game***). If you mess up slightly and barely nick a hazard, it is not always game over! (YAY!) That is because it is possible to loose your wings, legs, and even head, and still be able to complete the level. I really really enjoyed this little perk of game play, so you can literally run around in game as a chicken with it's head cut off.\nAll in all, there are 3.5 world types with over 120 levels to beat. After certain levels, you get to unlock perks to add to your multiplayer death match, like Zero Gravity. The levels occasionally will have multiple paths to take to beat them, depending upon your play style.\nCo-Op consists of local players dropping into game by pressing 'A' on their controller and helping you to clear the level.\n\nREPLAY:\nThis game has decent replay as you go back through and attempt to beat your previous level clear times. There are a total of 3 coins per level to be obtained, which can then be used to purchase custom hats and headgear for your chicken. There is nothing like running around blowing friends up while your chicken wears a bloody Jason Hockey Mask!\n\nOverall score: 8/10\nNow go cause some mayhem!","May 5","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In truth the developers  in my own opinion were ‘lazy’ granted I understand the vision at first was for a single player then adding in split screen co-op made sense HOWEVER  in this day and age and especially uploading to  steam  the developing team should have considered working in a online multiplayer.  If they were to INCLUDE it (see fourms for dev’s mention of possibly adding as dlc or standalone)  I see this game staying under the radar of popularity with low sales.   Word of advice to the developers, if you wish your game to sale PLEASE include a multiplayer and I GUARANTEE  sales will rocket  especially when youtube celebs begin playing it.      Though time will tell this game is fun and quite entertaining  (for a short time)  but without a co-op/versus  (lan/internet) this game will fall in the to  junk pile.    Till some sensible multiplayer is implemented  I cannot suggest this game to anyone.","May 9","false","0.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Its  solid with no big problems except frustrating the ♥♥♥♥ outta you when it gets hard. haha.  Apart from the i really like the Right trigger mechanic (using controler) that makes u stop yourself when used. it adds so much skill to this game on how you can move around.","April 14","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
