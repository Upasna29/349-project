After 16 years, it still stands in a league of its own. Simple to use, this software is utilized by the likes of Fortune 500 companies and top tier business schools for training and retaining skills. Furthermore, it doubles as an entertaining and interactive platform for learning about the Middle Ages.\n\nHRM Simulator 99’ takes place in a historical period running from the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the dawn of the Colonial Age. You will be placed in the role of a medieval leader seeking to build your kingdom and defeat your opponents. In order to win, however, you will need to micromanage your human resources with the utmost efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nCentral to your efforts is the villager. Villagers are the ideal worker. They can work for indefinite periods of time while earning nothing and aptly work several different jobs throughout your kingdom. They can handle everything from construction to fishing to sapping enemy buildings. Your villagers are also loyal to you beyond question; they will even gather berries while wolves are mauling them to death.\n\nOnce you have established a perfectly efficient economy using the principles of operations management, you will have to shift your attention to raising an army and defeating your enemies. As a human resources manager at Proctor & Gamble put it, “HRM Simulator 99’s army management is good preparation for some of the most daunting tasks that a new manager may face in the real world”. While managing your army in battle, you will also still need to pay attention to your economy, keeping your villagers on task and away from becoming useless, idle drones.\n\nCampaigns (Spoilers?):\nPlay as Mel Gibson and beat up the army of a dude named Edward Longshanks who, despite his last name, cannot shank anything for long.\nPlay as a teenage chick, summon Shelby Cobras for horny Frenchmen so that they can shoot up snotty Britons.\nPlay as a legendary ISIS commander and defeat NATO forces in Israel.\nPlay as Genghis Khan, travel the world and break down the Great Wall of China with an extraordinarily fast & furious monkey.\nPlay as der Fuhrer, subdue domestic opposition, invade Poland and convince Italy to side with you. Then drown in a river and get buried in a pickle barrel.\nPlay as Attila the Hun, beat up everyone and steal their everything.\nPlay as Good Guy Greg, save your king’s life even after he screws you over and imprisons your family.\nPlay as Cuauhtémoc, repulse the Spanish invasion of Tenochtitlan with the help of God-given Hun Tarkans and Korean Turtle Ships. Witness the evolution of Cuauhtémoc from a loyal, concerned jaguar warrior into a tenacious resistance leader and then finally into the last Emperor of the Aztecs. Then play Age of Empires III and see him finally become a psychotic blood fetishist fighting wars in oddball locales all across Asia and the Americas.\nIf you successfully complete these campaigns with flying colors and prevail over your colleagues in online skirmishes, you will be ripe to become the CEO of one of the largest corporations in the world!\n\n500/500 Preferred by all large-cap corporations listed on the S&P 500. In other words, buy this game if you want to invest in the American economy!","June 17, 2015","true","93.3"," 1,064 of 1,167 people (91%) found this review helpful 1,315 people found this review funny","91","064","1","315","20"

I managed to go outside and make some friends. I even got a girlfriend and a job. Life was good until a colleguage told me to check out the black friday steam sale.  I noticed AOE HD listed with 70% off and immediately started having flash backs of the game from back in 2000.\n\nI have to say the game hasn't changed from what I remember and once I got the hang of the keys I was playing like a pro again.  In the first few months there were crashing issues in the lobbies but these have been fixed recently. I now love playing it just as much as I used to and spend most nights in deathmatch games.\n\nThe population limit increase it the only feature i've noticed to really improves the game from the original...apart from that its the same, so probably overpriced for a 15 year old game. Reasonable if you pick it up in a steam sale.\n\nUnfortunately my girlfriend got sick of the sound of camels moaning while she tries to watch towie so our relationship took a bad turn...my boss has also noticed my work productivity has decreased because I spend too much time sitting in deathmatch lobbies when i'm supposed to be working...he said if things don't improve I will be fired.\n\nI think I could enjoy this game more if I was single and unemployed but at the moment it's causing too many problems :(\n\n","December 27, 2014","true","012.1"," 395 of 417 people (95%) found this review helpful 452 people found this review funny","95","395","417","452","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrypticAesthetics/recommended/221380/","CrypticAesthetics","A D I D A S","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrypticAesthetics/","91 products in account","Oh boy, where do I begin? I've been playing this game since it was released as a demo for maximum pc back in 1998. My father showed me it at a computer store that he used to work at in the small community that we used to live in. I was only 4 years old at that time, and I remember the only civilizations you could be were the Brits and Celts. I first laid eyes on the scout calvary, would ignore the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything else, because he looked cool in my eyes at 4 years of age. Since then, Ive been playing this game on and off, I'm 21 now, and I still find myself latched on to it. I now have a daughter of my own, although she won't know what it was like to see the game evolve over the course of 16 years, she will still know how it came to be, assuming she would even find it as cool as I have growing up. I think for me at least it was the growing anticipation of seeing something new with every civ, while still keeping the basics of the game simple and the same in it's own ways. I used to play this during lunch break in middle school from 2006-2009 with all of my friends, for the most part, I came out on top, even had our own little community of players, formed our own club, and we made a board game out of it. It was pretty cool that not all of us were premature nerds that played this, at least half of our little community were jocks that just loved it as much as we did, and there was no discrimination involved in any of it.  We amassed to a total of 20 or more people in this community, and for a small amount of us, our community is still strong with new members and old. This game is called Age of Empires II, and it will stand the test of time for the ages. I'm happy and delighted that people are still playing this game 16 years later, and we're still finding newcomers for this game at as faster rate than before. I've come to realize that just since early 2014 I have ended up spending hundreds of hours playing this game, teaching people both young and old what to do in this game. I'm so thrilled to see that this game is coming out with new expansions still to this day, even after 16 years. I think that if I were to find the gold edition realeased back in 2004 without the package being opened or torn, I would keep it as a collector's item, this game has so much potential and I'm happy to see that it's not being thrown away in to the trash. I honestly believe that when I die of old age, assuming that I don't die any other way, I will more than likely have a copy in my coffin for when my body gets discovered generations later, people will know what kind of influence this game had on my life as much as anyone else's life. I honestly didn't even play the Conqueror's expansion pack until 2007, even though I knew about it unpon release date, my mother refused me video games, so I never got to play it on time like most of my friends did, but I knew that I would at some point in time. Due to my parents seperation back in 2001 shortly after my mother's mother died, I ended up living with my mother, as she got the majority of custody except on holidays when I would be with my father. Whenever I was with him, he would let me play games, even though it was against my mother's wishes. I really loved playing as the Celts, Britons, Franks, Goths, and Vikings, at the time, they were my favorite. Now and again however, you will find me riding along Genghis Khan's horde as the Mongols, however, you can also find me still enjoying the company of the Goths and Britions. I love all of the civilizations very much, I know that they all have their strengths and weaknesses, some are greater than others. My best advice to you is to rush your enemies into the dirt while still keeping up with your economy via micro manage. I would rate this game a solid 10/10 and would also highly recommend it to anyone who still finds the old RTS game to be complexed and fun. I can't wait for the new expansion to come out November 5th 2015 African Kingdoms will have without a doubt in my mind as many new features as it pre successors. I hope you all have a try at this game, it's for sure my favorite game of all time.","October 8, 2015","true","778.8"," 419 of 451 people (93%) found this review helpful 55 people found this review funny","93","419","451","55","19"

It was the first game I ever bought and owned for the PC. I played a lot of this game, mainly singleplayer back in 2006, but scratched the CD a couple years later. When I found it had been remastered on Steam I was quick to purchase myself a copy and have been playing both singleplayer and multiplayer since. For those of you who used to own a copy like myself, I highly advise purchasing this digital edition, as it offers both the same nostalgic gameplay and a great strategic outlet. The Forgotten DLC also gives you more to explore and adds even greater variety to an already extensive game. I highly recommend this title, as it has quickly (re)become a personal favorite.\nFor those of you who haven't played Age of Empires before, it was one of the older RTS games dating back to the late 90s / early 21st century. I'm surprised more people don't play it. You are given a wide selection of civilizations with specific perks each, and try to race each other towards an objective, be it a Wonder Race, Deathmatch, or King of the Hill. All of which are great fun! What really stands out with this game is that there are hundreds, if not thousands of ways to win. Granted, the mechanics may seem simple and outdated, but when trying to runn an entire empire with 200+ units against up to seven other players, every click counts as you try to out-maneuver, out-think, and out-micro your opponent. The graphics may take a while to get used to, but what you really should look forward to enjoying is the satisfaction of wrecking the strong defenses of an enemy with allies or alone, and conquering lands one by one. A great title, I also highly advise purchasing this for the newer community.","February 13, 2015","true","144.1"," 169 of 175 people (97%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","97","169","175","12","0"

Lets find it out!Hint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR section.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●\nOctober 1999; one of the most durable games all the time was born made from the hand of Ensemble Studios; its name: Age of Empires II. Even Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun, which turned up at the same time, wasn't in a position neither to beat down the rapidly growing fanbase nor to outclass Age of Empires II itself.\n\nYet so many years later no games from this genre was able to reach the quality of Age of Empires II and we all ask ourselfs; is there something which can make such an old game better and give it modern conveniences to the newer operating systems? I'll give you the answer; a second coat. HD and the option to play with higher screenresolution.\nWith this Age of Empires II: Age of Kings looks better as never before, however the gameplay and everything else you may know from the old version has remained. Sadly this includes also unaltered animations from the unites, which causes the feeling that the whole game seems to be a bit laggy, especially when you have a lot of unites on the field.\n\nDon't stop to read now! This and the price (18,99EUR/$ 19.99) could may be a reason to close this window within the second you saw the last sentence, but don't you dare! It's worth the time.\n\nRemember when there was a population limit of 200? Microsoft had the wonderful idea to increase it and allow us to create not less than 500 unites. A real ease for most of the gamers, even if there was a mod which did the same to the old one.\nApropos ease: The multiplayer from the old version is yet after this many years still active but a pain in the neck to get it work properly, if I may say so. To avoid this, you are now able to play through the steam p2p multiplayer which microsoft implemented. As if this wasn't enough they also added a ranking system which permit you to duel yourself with other gamers and be the best!\n\nAlso steam called a workshop for this game into existence, so feel free to scroll through all the fanmade maps, graphics and so on!\n\nIncidentally this version contains the add-on "The Conquerors" and if you still want more you also be cordially invited to buy "The Forgotten" Once a fanmade product, now remastered and available at the same menu from AOE II after purchase.\n\nAs to the rest you can expect playfully exactly what it was back then: Almost a perfect real time strategy game.\n\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nNot every remake is good enough to fit into the quality of these old games... but in my opinion microsoft studios made nearly everything perfect. Till now I have no regrets about the purchase of this game plus its DLCs and I guess it will still mesmerize me when I am old and bony and begin to fall apart!\n\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ UPDATES]▬▬▬▬●\nUnbelievable but true: Microsoft Studios decided to give this gem a new addon. Age Of Empires The African Kingdoms will add a few more civilizations and new maps to the game! Go check it out in the store!\n\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔]  Updated graphics\n[✔]  Running Multiplayer incl. ranking system, no third party programs needed\n[✔]  Workshop Support\n[✔]  New updates and content\n\n[✖] Unaltered animations, which don't feel smooth with a lot of unites on the map\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up! I also appreciate every feedback!\n\nTo keep updated about my reviews, feel free to visit Morbs' Review Base and follow the curator page to never miss an review from me!\n\nCheck also  CompleteTheBacklog out!\n- ℳorbus","November 26, 2013","true","177.9"," 491 of 604 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","491","604","0","22"

Best part was they released an expansion after more than a decade because this game has such a cult following.\n\nThe game has you gather resources, build structures, amass units and go trapsing over maps of all kinds. These range from tiny islands to pretty decent sized representations of European climates that have you seek out and destroy your enemies or win by several other not-so-total conquest game types. The new expansion allows those maps to be massive and adds even more civilizations to play with, making the total 23. These civilizations span from all corners of Europe, Asia and the Middle East. All units have voice clips in their native languages to help with the feel of every faction being truly different in addition to visually unique buildings and units depending on the cultural locale of your civilization.\n\nWith its migration to Steam AoE now has great multiplayer support, achievements, and Steam Workshop capabilities that will allow the sharing of user-created content to be spread much easier than having to download things like scenario  maps from a third-party webpage over dial-up as I did back in the day.\n\nIf you played this game in the past, it is well worth picking up again if nothing more than for nostalgia goggle syndrome because you know just how fun this was. If you somehow missed the boat in the past and are a fan of games like this there is literally no reason you should not own this game. It has been improved and will more than likely be considered one of the fine wines of gaming; Better with age and enjoyed even more with friends.","November 10, 2014","true","32.4"," 118 of 128 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","118","128","3","0"

Although, the original game was realised in 1999 it managed to stand the test of time due to its unique art style.\n\nThe gameplay is simple to learn but hard to master. As you begin in the Dark Ages and try to advance your civilisation to the Imperial Age. A good building order is important for maintaining an optimal economy to support your war machine. It does not feature unique abilities that units can utilise and therefore it does not require the extensive micro-management as seen in games such as Starcraft II and Warcraft III. Actually, the introduction movie of the game says it all as two kings play a game of chess, the pieces representing units in the game. This is how Age of Empires feels, a real time chess game where every move matters and momentum is key.\n\nAs an added bonus the soundtrack of the game is amazing, although I do miss the original menu music. However, thanks to the support of the Steam Workshop, there is a mod to fix that (and many other things). Overall, the HD version is what it says: an update of the already impeccable original game with better textures and HD resolution support.","November 25, 2013","true","44.0"," 210 of 255 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","210","255","0","0"

It is a perfected version of Age of Empire II: The Age of King and Age of Empire II: The Conquerors expansion pack reimagined in HD and now entirely as one single game. Everybody know what Age of Empire is unless you're really new to PC gaming, the game is a legend, was the best classic real-time strategy of that time.\n\nAll gameplay and features in this game is left untouched and are very exactly the same as the old Age of Empire II except for the new 500 population limit for skirmish play, let's you train even more units and having a larger battles and larger tactics than before.\n\nThe graphics has been improved slightly where you can see the new water and fire textures and effects are better than before. The new widescreen support for the game are also included. The rest still retain the same graphics as before.\n\nWell, the exact same gameplay and features could be the good or bad thing, because most people don't like buying things similar with what they already have, own or taste, but if you're looking for the old Age of Empires II in a new and better way then it is for you. All the story campaign, civilization is all there and the new Steam workshop integration is the best thing so you now can download many user created content ranging from maps, scenarios, AI scripts and many more to customize your game or create your own stuff and share it with everyone in the Steam community.

It's a timeless classic that is still just as enjoyable today as the day it came out. In my opinion it is the best RTS game of all time and for that to still be true 10 years later, it is certianly worth full price.\n\nHowever, this is the HD version so it is slightly different. Graphics are practically the same - which is ok for such a timeless game. However it doesn't quite live up to it's HD title. However, I came back for the game - not for anything new.\n\nThis HD version HDifys the gameplay rather than the graphics. It adds a new map size and increases the highest pop cap to 500 - allowing for much better games if your PC can handle it. The new map size hurts the PC more than the pop cap though and I've played 500 pop games on a laptop on the old standard map size. I don't recommend doing that with more than one player though. Nonetheless, huge armies are very fun to play with and add that little thing that we probably would've modded in. However - if this is what sold you then make sure you have a decent PC for it because it gets unbearably laggy on certian systems.\n\nAnother update is the new AI which they patched in at some point. As a man who prefers to do single player, this new AI added a proper challenge to the old game when I played all the time during my childhood. I used to be able to take on  6 other AIs on the hardest difficulty all on the same team. Now I struggle against them on equal footing. However, you do have the option of playing against the original AI if you want. Even a mix if you really want. The only problem I've found with it is that it will focus on water whenever there's a significant amount of water on the map. This can be good at times but when they attempt a galley rush on highland and you walk right around them it's limitations can be quite apparent.\n\nOne big flaw is it's multiplayer. They've removed the LAN function for some reason. Despite this I still play this at LAN parties but we play through the online mode. A little bit annoying. Another thing is the lag. There's a noticable lag between when you click somthing and when it notices. This did cause problems but they are working on patching these problems out. The lag still exists but I'm no longer having the problem of me putting many houses in a line and it registering the house I accidently placed rather than the ones I wanted. However, I have played an entire game which was full of unbearable lag. However, it has multiplayer (the original's doesn't work anymore) and it actually lets you try the new civillisations from the expansion packs in it.\n\nOverall, this is still the Age of Empires 2 that I loved all my life. It didn't need updating but they gave it a go and basically refreshed the experience a bit by letting me play on larger maps and with larger populations. Still the same game and therefor worth full price in my opinion. I'd personally say that the fact that the game is still being updated and you've got expansion packs if you want more, it's somthing you should get. Even if you've never played it you should try this game as it is the best game of all time in my opinion.","November 4, 2015","true","347.3"," 76 of 80 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","76","80","3","0"

After 13 years it can still be purchased (along with its expansion, The Conquerors) at Wal-Mart and Office Depot. This "new" title is an attempt at sprucing up one of the most beloved games of the franchise. It is amazingly rare to see an old property being brought back to life and updated, especially by a parent company that is only looking forward to the next big buck, and are willing to drop any title not making 500% profit (AOE Online was scrapped after a year in the wild, and much needed updates to many games still hang in limbo at EA). Only the bigwigs know what made them bring this one back, but we are glad to see some dust wiped off of our past every once in a while. Developer "Hidden Path" was contracted to shine up the series fav and bring it into the new age of gaming, they fixed important things and they didn't fiddle around where it wasn't needed, but they missed a couple of points that would have made it into a new age RTS diamond.\n\nFirst of all, I must thank hidden path for finally raising the unit cap, but why only 500? While it is a good 2.5x higher than before, our machines are 250x more powerful than the Pentium II 200mhz it was originally designed for. I can only guess that much of the core engine remains as it was, and 500 was the highest they could go without breaking it. Even though the cap has been raised, you can still only select 20 units at a time. Was it something that was overlooked? not likely. Here is another notch in the theory of a stretched engine. They just couldn't do more without overhauling the back end.\n\nWhile we are on the graphics, The reason it has HD in the title is the ability to hit 1920x1080, (and beyond for multi monitor rigs) whereas the original topped out at 1024x768. I agree with the general consensus in that the overhauled building and unit models are amazing, but once again the elderly engine comes through showing us no shadows, no zoom, and no visual effect updates. These are an almost standard feature of today's even bargain bin games that they missed completely. Does it detract from gameplay? Not really. Could they have spent a little more time bringing the graphics engine into this decade without effecting gameplay? yes.\n\nThe multiplayer. What can I say here? Game Zone worked (kinda) back in the day, but thankfully we have learned from those early days and have integrated the game wholly into Steam's online network with only a few launch bugs and some early lag issues (to be continued). What this means is a front row ticket to a beautifully seamless multiplayer before-game matching experience, but completely removes the LAN option that, like me, so many young geeks had permanently set up in their basements just for this. Inclusion with the Workshop will make mod and map finding a breeze, and I believe the good outweighs the bad here, but somehow there is still a bad taste somewhere in my mind from losing our offline multiplayer. (single play is still allowed offline).\n\nThe music score has been redone, but I can still pound the number keys for WOLOLOOO and "I Need Wood". No complaints there.\n\nAll-in-all it was well worth the money, and it is the authentic Age Of Kings/Conquerors experience, but the lack of improvements to the gameplay, and the surface improvement to the graphics makes this game feel more like a decent mod than a blockbuster.\n\n(For further fiddling- the mod "Forgotten Empires" does everything this HD remake does, plus adds hours of single player campaigns, and a good dozen fixes)","October 14, 2014","true","14.4"," 71 of 84 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","71","84","0","0"

Steam wasn't popular so this is what I would play.\n\nThe original game used to run on some low resolution, and was so obvious. The age of the title had something to do with it ;)\n\nBut as it was, it didn't really matter to me. I would love being able to sit down and do what I wanted to do. I didn't have to kill everyone off, I could get the "artifacts" or build a wonder to win. Even the Regiside (kill the enemy king(s)) gamemode is a good gamemode.\n\nMultiplayer isn't as good but it's nice to be able to play with friends again. With all RTS titles, it's whoever can rush the enemy the fastest. That's what bugs me about the multiplayer. If you can get over that, there's no major outstanding issues. ELO ranking has been added, but don't base your skill off of it.\n\nEven though it may look like it supports old machines, there was a requirement for some new shader/texture thanks to the water. Not sure if it really is the water, but you need a dedicated card of some sort. Old Intel GMA graphics don't support it. So any reasonable card such as a GT 8600 or GT 9800 would make a great choice here.\n\n7/10","November 27, 2013","true","44.3"," 82 of 101 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","82","101","0","1"

Everyone was either a Turk or Byzantine, but we did have one Korean and a Teuton. The Korean died quickly.\nWe laughed because one of the Byzantines was named Heinrich Himmler, the advisor for Hitler during WW2. My friend in the game was acting a lot like Hitler, killing every Turk, so you can imagine having Hitler's advisor was funny. I was one of the Turks, but my friend did not kill me.\nSoon my empire grew and I started to kill off a Teuton who refused to give in to my demands. He was very weak and fled. I found him hiding in Heinrich's huge city, and it had turned out Heinrich agreed to protect him. Heinrich went to go eat and I decided I'll drop by and...hah...see how the Teuton was doing.\nI bring 40 Heavy Camels, 50 Jannisaries, and 15 Petards. The 15 petards were used to blow up (as I screamed in chat "ALLAH HU ACKBAR!") the little defense the Teuton had, effectively letting in my troops. The Teuton panicked and, again, tried to run away. I killed 23 of his villagers, but two got away. They got on a transport I presume, because next thing I knew, they were on a different land mass. I had trouble finding him, but eventually I did and got over there with 20 Cannon Galleons.\nBy now, Heinrich had come back and noticed I was trying to kill the Teuton. He laughed but didn't choose a side.\nMeanwhile, I began to build a wonder, which for a Turk like me is a Mosque. I said "LET ISLAM REIGN!" as I finished the Mosque and put 15 Jannisaries on guard. My friend laughed before saying "I hope you realize...I kill Muslims like you."\nI laughed as well, thinking he was joking.\nI got some pizza and decided to go eat some. I come back about 7 minutes later, being destroyed by my friend and his ally. Now it was my turn to panic.\n"WHAT ARE YOU DOING *insert my friend's name here*?!"\n"I'm stopping the spread of Islam! Succumb to Christianity!"\n"OKAY OKAY I SURRENDER, CONSIDER ME CHRISTIAN!"\n"You are no Christian until you tear your Mosque down!"\n"But I...ugh, okay."\nI selected the Mosque and clicked DELETE. It fell to rubble.\n"Happy?"\n"Yes."\nNow we go back to the Teuton. He was hiding up north before, but in the short 7 minutes I was gone, he went back to Hein's city and Hein had built a wall around his town center. He called it the "Teutonic Concentration Camp". It was pretty funny. After a while we got bored and were going to select "Allied Victory". I still had a bone to pick with the Teuton, so I sent the remainder of my men after his camp, having to enemy Hein on the way there.\nFOR WHATEVER REASON, THEY KNEW I WOULD DO THIS. SERIOUSLY.\nEVERYONE IN THE GAME ENEMIED ME AND FOUGHT ME TO THE DEATH. THE TEUTON ACTUALLY WON WITH 1 TOWN CENTER, A VILLAGER, AND A FARM.\n\nIn the end I whispered to myself "This must be how Israel feels".\n10/10 would be a failure of an Islamic empire again","April 25, 2015","true","362.8"," 56 of 62 people (90%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","90","56","62","63","0"

I recently had an online 3v3 match where I had to fight the Japanese, British, and the Spanish. Early on, my friend got attacked by the Spanish which left his empire severely crippled. He sent some villagers to settle next to my empire so we could attack together. Around the beginning of the second hour, we kept getting attacked by the Japanese, so we assembled large armies to push through. Soon enough, my navy and our armies destroyed the Japanese. We both settled in the area because the Japanese left a lot of resources around. Resources were scarce around midgame, so we set up small strike forces to chip away at the British empire. Soon enough, we lead an ambush on the British, attacking their buildings and razing their farmlands. We killed their army and destroyed their most important buildings, eventually causing them to surrender. Our last enemy were the Spanish. Led by Queen Isabella, she had armies of monks and conquistadors. We kept getting our asses destroyed by her forces, almost leading us to surrender. She had controlled most of the land, which would prove to be a challenge to us. It took us about 2 hours to destroy her navy and kill her conquistadors and monks. Soon enough, she surrendered, as we just toppled the largest empire on the continent and brought it to its knees. We won the match when the clock struck 5 hours.\nGod I love this game.","January 1","true","61.7"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","91","53","58","12","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/221380/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Age of Empires II: Age of Kings was originally released in 1999, and it is one of the most influential titles in one of real-time strategy’s most celebrated franchises. It holds a special place within gaming history as a solid, meat-and-potatoes RTS generously drizzled with rich historical gravy.\n\nAge of Empires II: HD’s main changes are updates to the graphics engine, allowing the game to be compatible with modern machines. The game has been overhauled to allow players to take advantage of HD displays and multiple monitors. But one of the strongest elements of the re-release is the score, which has been lovingly remixed. The music now evokes a more sophisticated mood than it did previously, and it’s something that adds greatly to the feel of the game.\n\nThis edition of Age of Empires II includes The Conquerors expansion, so fans wanting to replay the campaigns will find hours of familiar scenarios. These haven’t aged particularly well; the scripting system compares poorly with other titles, particularly Blizzard’s Warcraft III and StarCraft II. There are many instances of breaking the fourth wall, where victory and activation conditions are very obviously scripted rather than fitting seamlessly into gameplay.\n\nThe new textures added to water, fire, and earth add a nice new look to the terrain. It’s subtle, but the overall impression is refined and almost painterly. The terrain itself has been one of the biggest changes, with a mesh system now used to give a more even natural landscape. Also gone are the 256 colour UI elements, and the icons have been updated to a more rustic feel to go with the softer 32-bit colour scheme.\n\nThe only significant change made at all to gameplay is the raising of the maximum population cap to 500. This is a lost opportunity to fix the kinds of problems that even diehard fans consider simple annoyances. The ability to select more than 20 units would have been a worthy addition, and is simply a control flaw rather than a balance or creative issue. Running at 1920x1080 allows for a huge number of units on one screen, which still need to be divided into small divisions to command in battle.\n\nThe most positive change – and one that will justify the price tag for most players – is multiplayer. Although alternative matchmaking services have done much to keep interest in the online game alive over the years since the demise of Microsoft’s clunky Gaming Zone, Steam integration puts players back onto a universal ladder system. The platform’s social features and existing framework also mean players can come to the game with their own networks firmly in place.\n\nSo for better or worse, Steam has come along and is now selling a game it’s quite possible many gamers already own in some form or other. The changes are subtle, but well-intentioned and admirably executed. Multiplayer is excellent. Those who loved Age of Empires II should happily indulge in some nostalgia with this HD facelift. Anyone new to the game will be frustrated by the lack of modern control systems and responsive hot keys.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 2, 2015","true","27.7"," 69 of 84 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","69","84","4","0"

Now age of empires is not a bad game but it is deffiently not for everyone. Now lets dive into this review here.\n\nSingle player campaign\n\nSay you dont have internet or maybe you just dont want to play online well there is a variety of levels in the single player campaign for you to enjoy from the french all the way to the aztecs the campaign is packed with hours of fun filled levels each having there own story its also a good place to start if you are new to the game its slow paced and gives you a taste of what the game is like and how it will handle\n\nartificial intelligence\n\nalthough they did update this to make it feel more like your verusing an online player it ovbiously still lacks what online players have wich is diffrent strategys and diffrent skill levels the AI in this game isnt the best and is flawed but i guess you have to make do with what you have. atleast i can say its better practice then the old AI that wouldint even get the last blacksmith upgrades in the imperial age making them a joke and very easyy to deal with. so i say if your going to do any sort of deathmatch or random map or scenario for the matter you should stick to playing with real people.\n\nScenario Editor\n\nThis is my personal favorite of the game are you tired of online dont feel like playing aginst the crappy AI then why not make your own adventure or your own story in the scenario editor. i have had hours of countless fun making simple levels that i enjoy by myself to complex levels that are still in development this is deffiently one of the best features on Age Of Empires 2 just buying the game for this is worth it very user friendly, easy to usr and organized. the triggers take some practice to get use to but you will soon learn fast. the best part is that you can share your levels with the public and many other players can play them.\n\nmultiplayer\n\nThis is where the main core of the problem is for the game multiplayer is very unstable very laggy and the community isnt to nice but its not the worst you still will find alot of decent player but ocassionaly run into the ones that always try to out do everyone or put other down. if you have much patience then you may be able to handle the lag but some game lag can just be unbarable. Dont even get me started on the dysync if there on accedent or on purpose they really know how to ♥♥♥♥ you off, The worst type is the player that does it intentionally because he or she is a sore loser or doesint want to lose ELO(the points that show your ranking in the game.\n\nCivalizations\n\nThe game age of empires has a vast amount of civilizations to chose from in the game this maxumizes gameplay allowing you to tamper and play around with diffrent strategys for diffrent empires. maybe you like the ranged gunpowder of the turks or the close quarters combat of the aztecs. or maybe you like to ride the fearsome paladins of the franks into battle who knows there are many diffrent strats and builds you can try.\n\nAge Of Empires 2 Overall\n\nAge of empires is a very fun game if you can get past the  bad multiplayer lag although occasionally you come across some good lobbies that wont lag near as bad. even without multiplayer or if your preffer to play offline this game offers so much content that it takes a very long time to get bored if you chose to spend your money on the game even with its flawess i would say you would be makking a wise choice for 20 dollars i dont think you can go wrong.\n\n\n\n","September 8, 2015","true","570.7"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","46","50","6","1"

That doesn't change the fact that it's still a pretty good stragety game.\nI personally love the unique units you can train in castles, for instance when you play as the Spanish you can train a unit called the Conquistador in your castle, a unit wich only you (while playing as Spain) can create.\nThe maps are quite big, so enough space for large battlefields.\nWhile the naval battles aren't bad either, I personally love the land battles between two different infantry units.\nThe original 18 civilizations are still in the game, but a DLC has been added: The Forgotten (empires)\nThis DLC ads 5 new civilizations, including the Italians and the Inca's.\nAll civilizations have got their very own unique unit, and building style.\nAn awesome new campaign has been added aswell. Here are a few short descriptions about the different campaign scenario's:\n\n1. Alaric I:\n\nThe trauma of the Hun invasion in the 4th century has shaped Alaric, the fearsome warrior king of the Goths. But can the beloved king secure a new homeland for his people in the territory of the collapsing Roman Empire?\n\n2. Sforza:\n\nAlways hungry for glory and wealth, Sforza wanders around 15th century Italy, offering his services to the highest bidder. Will he pick the right battles or make the wrong enemy? Take the fate of the young mercenary captain in your hands.\n\n3. Bari:\n\n400 years after the collapse of the Roman Empire, Italy is still up for grabs. Relive the tale of the port city Bari from the point of view of a Byzantine family, rising from the common soldiery to the nobility. Beware, for not only Bari is at stake, but also control of Southern Italy.\n\n4. Dracula:\n\nHistory forged an incredible legend around the man who ruled Wallachia in the mid-15th century. Holding his ground against the vast armies of the expanding Ottoman Empire, his cruel tactics made him the most feared man in all of Eastern Europe. Will his thirst for blood and the loyalty of his soldiers hold the Turks back for good?\n\nSounds good doesn't it? Well it is.\n\nThe €18,99 you pay for a game wich should be HD but the only thing HD in the game is the water, might be a bit much. But it's defenitly worth it.","February 20, 2014","true","432.2"," 89 of 123 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","89","123","0","9"

I almost feel like this is because of people attacking anything negative despite reviews showing objective problems. Most of the reviews on the front page of steam that are marked "helpful" are hardly "helpful" to people who played the original given the actual problems that haven't been listed and are completely useless to people who never played the game. When you have people who will attack anything negative someone says (I have yet to see a good argument against me saying this game isn't worth 20 dollars) then crap like this (AoE:WD) happens. MS now thinks that we are blind, thrashing, monsters that will buy anything with the Age logo on it who will blot out anyone who goes against it with just flaming (not constructive critcism, flaming). Now you may be the biggest age fanboy ever and you may try AoE:WD but you probably won't put money into it. Microsoft is clearly making (what looks like) a clash of clans ripoff to milk fans that will fail (at least in milking fans) and end up being a big waste of time to any fan of age of empires 2. I am not saying that "fanboys did this" I am just not rulling out the possibility.\n\nUpdate 2: Over a year, multiplayer is dead. Fanboys too busy humping this game to care. I can't believe some of the idoitic responses I have gotten from this. If you like and bought the game, why are you arguing with me? Why do you care? This game has flaws that make some aspects of the game OBJECTIVELY WORSE than the original. IE no lan, framerate issues, etc. I have reported on these flaws yet I am bashed for it. I have played hundreds of hours combined and yet you guys think you are at a better position to judge me when you can't even admit the objective faults of this game. MS now knows that they can charge whatever they want for each "HD" edition they release and at whatever state they put it in and they know people will eat it up. Even if it's broken, the criticism will be drowned out by fanboys "downvoting" (which is not how the system works, it goes by if the review was helpful, morons) every critical piece that comes out. You can still get the single player game with the mod for 10 dollars off amazon, with lan and fewer bugs. That is still a better value then what is here.\n\n\nUPDATE: IT HAS ALMOST BEEN A FULL YEAR AND THERE ARE STILL D-SYNC ISSUES AND NO SERVERS (so people are still DCing and it's still laggy as ♥♥♥♥) FIX YOUR DAMN 20 DOLLAR PIECE OF GARBAGE.\n\n-Actual Review\n\nI'm sorry, what is with all these reviews with their positive ratings? You guys are okay with paying 20USD for a widescreen edition and paid dlc for a game that is more than a decade old AND that has had numerious bugs even 7 months later still have not been fixed? Like the online lag is still awful. "But it's better than it was on launch" yes but it's still awful and at this rate I would advise just finding a copy of the original game and playing it with mods (like the Forgotten Empires, more on that soon) that run it on a modern system for the single player.\n\nAs for the DLC, I have not played it, but I have heard how it had lots of bug on launch and the patch to add it in fudged up the base game as well. Buyer beware the campaign doesn't even have voice acting although on their livestream they said they [maybe?] will look for voluneteers. It's nice that they are getting paid for it but instead of releasing it for 10 (which is really unreasonable might I add) why not make it free and give some of the money you (MS) made - from the upsurdly priced 20USD - and give it to the devs of forgotten empires.\n\nAlso, there are no benefits that come from the FE update, therefore, IF YOU BUY THE GAME BUT DON'T BUY FE, YOU NEED TO PLAY WITH OTHERS WHO DON'T HAVE FE OR WHO CHOSE TO NOT USE FE. THIS MEANS THAT THE COMMUNITY IS SPLIT UP EVEN MORE, GREAT, THAT MEANS ONLINE IS EVEN MORE BUTCHERED.\n\n\n\nGraphics and Performance\nit's not an HD edition, it's a widescreen edition with 2 graphics options (which weren't even on launch btw) as well as no screen resolution. "But it's an old game, why do you need graphics options?" well that's because the game can run like crap online or offline on certain lower end machines. I run a gigabyte 7950 GPU with an intel 3770k I7 3.5 processor and the game runs like crap online, I HAVE PLAYED WITH 8 PEOPLE AND I GOT AN AVERAGE OF 15-25 FPS, THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT CAN RUN CRYSIS 3 AT ALMOST MAX AT 1080P 60FPS, THERE IS NO EXCUSE TO CHARGE ME 20 FOR A GAME THAT RUNS WORSE THAN A TRIPLE A GAME. Side note, when do you think people are gonna start saying "But can it run AoE II HD online?\n\nThe poor optimization is shockingly bad but the game is basically unchanged. Remember those graphs you would look at after a game ended that would show certain stats? Yeah those are unchanged, they look really bad now as they haven't been updated with cleaner text or anything. I would have accepted that in early 2000s, not 2013 on an "HD" edition.\n\n\n\nGameplay\nYeah it's good. It's age of empires 2 what do you expect and from what I can tell, that's all people seem to care about and i'm assuming that is the only reason people are giving this game good reviews.\n\nBut guys, THIS IS NOT WORTH 20USD AND TO BE MARKETED AT AN HD EDITION WITH THIS CRAPPY PERFORMANCE AND BAD ONLINE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. IT HAS BEEN 7 MONTHS AND THERE ARE STILL MANY BUGS AND ONLINE IS STILL BROKEN.\n\nI will be fair right now with the gameplay, the campaigns take time to beat and they are challenging. The gameplay had a satisfacation in the way it was made that - to me, for the longest time - beat other games, units wouldn't get stuck from time to time via collision on an object when you moved them, (Star Wars: Empire at War) units move when you tell them to without fail (company of heoes one had moments where they would just sit there) and they would respond quickly (age of empires 3, although many units behaved like that, many would move slow as balls). The core gameplay is enjoyable at least to a fan of the original but there are many outdated mechanics that I really don't have the time to go into, just think of starcraft 1 to starcraft 2 MECHANICALLY Ie unit binding, macros, replay systems, all that and how much of a leap back it feels going from starcraft 2 back to 1 after awhile of playing 2. The difference is very noticable.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nOn sale at like 5 bucks, if you don't want to bother digging up the original game and putting mods (which isn't very difficult) than yeah, maybe buy it. But at 20 USD with an expansion at 10 more? No, just no. For that price you can get Starcraft 2 for a few bucks more on Amazon. Age of Empires 2 was my favorite RTS of all time until I played Starcraft 2 (warcraft 3/frozone throne came in third) but now after playing Age 2 again, I like warcraft 3/FT better. WHICH YOU CAN BUY COMPLETE FOR 20 DOLLARS, IT IS A MUCH BETTER VALUE THAN THIS RIGHT NOW AND THE MULTIPLAYER (although it has its problems after recent patches) DOESN'T HAVE LAG ON EVERY GAME YOU TRY TO PLAY.\n\nYes, Age of Empires 2 is a good game but the HD edition is a disgrace. Don't praise this game just because it plays like the original. Don't charge 20USD for a re-release with bugs. Fix your game and make it look better and then I will reccommend it for almost anyone but at this point ONLY BUY IF IT'S ON SALE FOR 5USD OR LESS AND YOU ARE A FAN. Newcomers will get almost no value out of this instead of getting the original with mods.\n\nIf this was just an intended re-release for 5 bucks or 10 with workshop and multiplayer I would be singing a different tune.","December 5, 2013","false","55.5"," 429 of 698 people (61%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","61","429","698","13","42"

None of this is the case for Aoe 2 HD, It has numberous compability issues with all systems, months after re-release, the preformance is actually down a bit, there is virtually no new stuff, mechanisms are still from the ninetees, Pathfinding is aswell and the increaced unit cap(not that great btw) only makes it worse, because "retro is cool" they didn't even change the unitselection limit! now how ... not smart is that? 2,5 the unit limit but don't increace the number of selectable units?\nWhile there are fairly many events, the support mainly boils down to "have you tried turning it off and on again".\n\nConsidering the Mo... Expansion, There are many great new aspects. But it's pretty obvious it's only a glorified mod. the comparison with AoC hurts it quite a bit. Not because of the civs or units but because of the Campaigns. The beautifully mapped and scripted maps but because of the shallow (and lacking)storytelling and the agitatingly narrow passageways through whom you have to maneuver 100 troops of different types combined with multi stage missions that are easily goofed. These missions are not particulary difficult, they are just annoying. I love lush and passable forests that don't just consist of blocks of trees and paths in between, but with this pathfinding and full armies it's just a pain in the ♥♥♥ to micro or getting your army through in the first place :/ . the lack of voiceovers is totally understandable for a mod but it's another hint that MS is minimizing it's work here and not really ok for an expansion, same goes for sketchy scribbleings on parchment before each mission. The great thing about the AoE2 campaigns was not the missions themselves, but the stroytelling. You sitting in the tavern with Henry the lion talking about Barbarossa, a Frankish PoW in Saladins Camp, badgering El cids Widdow on the streets, Cautemocs chronicles, Father armand and his Goth-Skull, those were FANTASTIC! - All this is lacking in "the forgotten".\n\nJust take your old CD, install the mod (for free) and deactivate the explorer, and you have a game that is much stabler and cost you "nothing" - this version only has one asset: Steam, yes steam is the asset here, that shows how low microsoft has sunken. With Steam you can easily get mods and maps, install it on machines without an optical drive and ... well you get acchievements, if you're into that stuff. I just got it because I'm currently working with just a small laptop(no optical drive). I still think that 25 liters of cheap beer would have been preferable.","December 3, 2013","false","178.3"," 177 of 282 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","177","282","0","7"

Well, that has changed since the release of the latest African Kingdoms expansion on November 5th, 2015 - since then multiplayer has been rendered unplayable. What is worse, the SkyBox Labs/Forgotten Empires crew ceased any communication regarding the problem shortly after. As early reviewer, I was assured by Cysion (Belgian member of a dev team) that repairing the broken multiplayer is high on to do list back on November 13, 2015, but nothing has happened since, except for the release of half-baked & buggy expansion for Age of Mythology with the subtitle "Tale of the Dragon" back in January 2016.\n\nOn reload, game does not seem to remember players/AI oponents involved, which can be clearly seen in the lobby, after reload, you cannot play a multiplayer game for more than a few secs before it just desynches. African Kingdoms was my very first and for sure the last preorder on Steam, sure, multiplayer-destroying update came to all AoE II owners, including those who did not bought the expansion, but this expansion symbolizes the beginning of the problem and the lack of commitment from the developers towards their own project which stands on multiplayer. They do not deserve any finnancial support unless they fix their mess.

That is due to the recent expansion and patch update, but trust me, people. Don't give up on it. It is a 16 year old game that has been given new life, and a breath of fresh air due to the committed Forgotten Empires crew. My husband and I, as well as a group of friends, have had very many hours of fun on this game, and the hours on my account will continue to grow. I haven't gotten tired of this game, and it is the only game that I've ever played so many hours on in such a short time without losing interest.\n\nThe laughs, the tears, the anger, the happiness.... It's all worth it. You have 27 civilizations to choose from, and you can win in so many different ways, with strategies that aren't formed to a small "box" like other games. There's really no right or wrong way to play, and that's what I love about it. Growing your village into an empire from your starting town center, few villagers, and a scout, only to lose it all in battle..... Such a grim ending, but it never ever gets tiring.\n\n--\n\nFor those who think it is buggy and laggy, yes, it is, after the patch,  but they are working nonstop to fix it, and I assure you it was NOT that way before.\n\nDon't give up, it is worth it!","November 7, 2015","true","267.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

To make matters worse, the latest DLC broke the game even more just in time for the developer to seemingly abandon the game in an absolutely devastating state.\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT IS COMPLETELY BROKEN. If you want to enjoy Age of Empires II get the original game and use a free service like Voobly to play multiplayer.\n\nOriginal review:\nMaybe the best RTS game of all time with the "HD" version adding support for widescreen and a few other minor features. The singleplayer campaigns are perfectly playable and just as fun as they were 14 years ago. Steam Workshop makes installing mods very easy.\n\nHOWEVER, the multiplayer has since release been absolutely riddled with bugs and glitches. FPS lag even on high end PCs, far more lag than the original version, many connectivity bugs and lobby glitches, sometimes forcing a lobby to be recreated several times before it actually works\n.\nIt is not completely unplayable but the multiplayer experience will get very frustrating very quickly.\nFor now I cannot recommend buying this game, if you already have the original version, stick with it, if not, wait until the bugs get fixed or just get the original.\n\nedit: removed the out of sync part, as this has apparently been fixed in the latest update, all other bugs/annoyances are still in though.","January 11, 2014","false","499.5"," 52 of 88 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","52","88","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ny-chan/recommended/221380/","ny-chan","Nyara♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ny-chan/","11 products in account","Review Aimed to New Players: Yes, it is an old game. Yes, even with the HD enchance the graphics aren't that great. Does it plays as it looks? Nope. While it is indeed an old game, AoEII was known for being so modern in its mechanics that it revolutionized the whole RTS scene to the point that newer games tried to be like AoEII and not the inverse. Considering this, you can see features such like pathfinding, balanced civilizations, mass stack of units, group controls, up to date hotkeys and a myriad of other things common in the RTS of our days. So yes, it is an old game, but it does not play like an old game.\n\nWhat makes AoEII so good compared to RTS of its time or present time?\n\n- The game is forgiving in small errors because confrontations are focused in tactical endurance and slow advance rather a clash of sweeping offensives. This is one of the few games where when you can truly say "I may have lost this battle, but not the war!". So things are more aimed toward who makes more errors (and the importance of those errors) rather about who makes the first error and dies. This add a lot of depth, playability and strategy to the game, both for newbies and veterans.\n\n- You have a myriad of civilizations who specialize in different things and each one posses an unique unit (or some, two). Yet, the bonuses and differences between civilizations aren't sharp, so aside a few particular cases you won't find yourself in the situtation that a civ. pick (or random) can determine the whole match or even influence too badly on it. The civilizations are properly balanced, so you can pick favorite ones and be sure you will rock on it as long you use their advantages wisely (and patches their weaknesses).\n\n- The game is extremely friendly to new people since it includes one of the most memorable tutorial campaigns (featuring William Wallace!) ever made, making sure in a fun and quick way that players can manage the game. While it can take a time to learn about all the units and specific details, since the game only possess four ages and the units upgrades are straightforward, a player can plan an (effective) tactic without much knowledge. The matches can be played on Slow Mode so the reaction and reflect factors of the RTS doesn't hit them hard. There are maps like Black Forest that are easy to wall, thus winning you time to compensate differences in skill levels.\n\n- The Single-Player posses a heck a lot of content with a myriad of different campaigns and random maps. The campaigns (excepts those from the expansion The Forgotten) features an amazing voice acting that will enchance your experience greatly. Wanna learn about medieval history (specially for school/college LOL)? This game and its campaigns will teach you and motivate you like nothing else you can find in your way!\n\nWith that said, the game possess a flaw for new players in multiplayer and it is the resource gathering. Actually your capacity to quickly collect resources possess a snowball effect that can put you ahead several minutes (even half an hour!) of your opponent in development, giving an easy win to those who can make a lot of resources in the Early and Middle game. This is easy to improve with some practice, tips or tutorials, and resource gathering is actual fun here with the ever useful villagers (that also rocks as offensive and defensive machines since they can repair key units and position holding building during battle, just like making new main bases or frontline bases to battle). Yet, this can be frustrasting at first when someone wins you only because they handle the resource gathering better.\n\nNonetheless, this game rulz and I totally recommend it, not only for old and veteran fans, but for new people as well!","December 24, 2015","true","242.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/221380/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","What is it?A fully rounded real-time strategy game that's simple to grasp with full, playable tutorial mission to get you started (as William Wallace of Scotland) and really hit that magic formula where town-growing and tactical defense are equally enjoyable.  Age Of Empires II: Age Of Kings (its full title) is set in mediaeval times covering a time period of some 1000 years and is a mixture of resource gathering, town building, research and development of technologies and Wonders, and stategic defence and town attack with multitudous unit types from knights to elephants!  There is a full story-rich campaign where you will play as various legendary leaders from the Middle Ages around the world such as Saladin and Joan Of Arc (with unique units to each character).  The campaign is immensely enjoyable and surprisingly informative, where you re-enact famous battles or battle through foreign towns (plundering them and making them your own) without being able to change the course of history.\n\nThere is also the option to play a sandbox game where you can choose to play one of several nations (again with unique units to each) and this never seems to get old.  Start with a new and small town with very basic resources, and try to build it to a much larger town and conquer other NPC towns on the map before they conquer you!  The game also offers full multiplayer support.\n\n\n\nHow much has changed?Age Of Empires II HD is still the same game it always was.  The single biggest changes are the much-improved resolution over the (now very old) original and full compatibility with today's Windows versions (no more needing to kill explorer.exe to play)!  The HD version also allows the player to carry more units than the original.  Finally, the equally excellent expansion The Conquerers is included at no extra charge.  The game doesn't look pixely or low-resolution, and it's held up surprisingly well for a game first released in 1999.  The HD remake ensures the game looks as good now (on high resolution wide-screen monitors) as it did back in the days of low res 4:3 monitors.  What the HD version is NOT is a complete remake, but a remake was never needed; the changes just restore the game back to its former glory.\n\n\nI own the original - is it worth upgrading?Absolutely.  This title is often on sale so you don't have to pay full price if you're patient.  It's a delight not to need discs any longer, and to be able to run the game without killing explorer.exe processes in order to play.  It's also nice to have full wide-screen support and those all-important extra units.\n\nIt won't feel like a different game (it isn't), but it's been lovingly restored to the game it always was - for today's PCs.\n\nIn summary...An excellent and very addictive game from the age of traditional strategy that will sink many hours of your time without the steep learning curve often associated with today's strategy titles.  If you like games where you can build a town, defend it and conquer other towns, then this game is perfect.","January 2, 2015","true","5.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

This game was pure joy every click I made, every command I did, every task I assigned and every Teutonic Knight I slayed (♥♥♥♥ those ♥♥♥♥♥es).\n\nA masterpiece of game development. An example of how to design maps, how to create a community that lasts forever. Until the day I die, this game will stand, that ♥♥♥♥ is beyond hard. What Ensemble made is beyond genius. A showcase and a pedestal in the kingdom of variety, challenge and replayability.\n\nPROS\n+ Dozens of civilizations to play as. Each with unique units, their own research trees and their own language when clicking units. This is an obscene amount of detail beyond anything any other franchise conceived. Not Command and Conquer, not XCOM, not Warhammer, nothing!\n\nThis contributes to the massive variety and replayability the game possesses.\n\n+  Well-aged retro graphics that don't instantly turn you off. While many classics like Wolfesntein 3D and such died from bad aging, AoE2 still stands imo as the best RTS ever made. Even the graphics have a great charm to them, perfect simplicity and adequate accuracy to it's historical roots.\n\n+ Great Editing Mode. You can literally create thousands of maps avaliable for online play. I spent so much time making maps when I was younger O.o\n\n+ Mod Support. Now on Steam Workshop and as if the player base is huge... mod support now even increases the support on this game.\n\n+ Support. After over 15 years, AoE 2 got 2 new DLC expansions. 15 YEARS!\n\nCall of Dut... what?\n+ Lots and lots of campaigns to complete. All vastly different from eachother, giving the game massive playtime for a completionist.\n\n+ Greatly improved Online support.\n\n+ Very good and non-obtuse UI, unlike C&C and many other RTS' that try to do too much and fail hard UI wise, making everything feel cluttered and drab.\n\n+ Phenomenal tutorial, an example to any game of any genre how to incorporate story and gameplay in a tutorial that explain pretty much everything about the game without throwing everything at you at once, like 80% of video games...\n\n+  There is dialogue in the campaigns, it's not modernized nor was it replaced. Still sounds as nostalgic and good as it was. Not cheesy or immersion breaking :)\n\nCONS\n- Improvements needed from the original are lacking, like when picking an army: if it's too big, you can't pick them all at once. This ♥♥♥♥ should've been fixed years ago ^^"\n\n- Occasional and annoying bugs and optimization issues. I ran multiplayer games @ 30 FPS sometimes, others were massively laggy and on the Ludicrous map size, there seems to be a general issue that renders the game slow (my game froze/played at 1 FPS, I ♥♥♥♥ you not. Haven't touched it ever since).\n\n- Some Achievements are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's just... busy work. I mean... 1000 wins with each civilization? REALLY?! What the hell? Yes, the game's addicting, time consuming, and requires massive dedication to remotely learn it's mechanics decently well, but 1000 wins? What the ♥♥♥♥ were they thinking?!\n\n- Compared to some more modern RTS, AoE2 is too zoomed in  on the action imo, at first after many years of a break (until the HD remake came out), it just felt weird and a zoom out option would be GREATLY appreciated.\n\n-  Where's Age of Empires 1 HD Remake?! I want that ♥♥♥♥! NOW!\n\nAlright, this was a smaller review overall, but it just had to be made eventually. I was supposed to since... Summer of 2015 but was too lazy to do it. This game was, is and will be always a masterpiece that heats the blood that flows through my heart valves. it bring numerous child memories of playing with friends and even my mom. It's a masterpiece of strategy design, planning, agility and critical thinking that many "Biggest Unit-Spammer Wins" RTS these days sorely lack!\n\nDespite all the flaws, I just can't bring myself to not giving this game a perfect score.\n\nNo game is perfect. Everyone knows it. But there is this perfect nomenclature that translates into something you keep going back to year after year, day after day, night after night. You have fun all those times. You lose some and win some, but you leave with a grin on your face. Because you are happy, you had fun. You love the game and the game loves you. A flow of synergy between the controls, UI and your brain that made you blow up that castle and gate, bash in with your cavalry and slit that king's throat into a pool of gushing blood!\n\nConotative over denotative. Perfection in life is something that never dies within you, as a kid, a masturbation-addicted teenager, a studying and/or working adult or a caring father. A movie that you talk about year after year with your friends. A game like this. A book you never shut the ♥♥♥♥ up about. People that never leave you. Nothing breaks that bond.\n\nIs this getting boring and hard to turn you on into buying this game? Sorry... so is your mom ;)\n\nMaybe it's getting too long? So is my d1ck :)\n\nAnyway, -> 10/10\nThis game is perfect.\n\nAnd so is my girlfriend, Breaking Bad, The Last Lecture, biscuit cake, sex and so much more life's worth living for.","March 22","true","177.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","11","13","3","4"

In my opinion, it remains the best at what it does.\n\nThere are many civilizations to choose from, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, but all incredibly balanced. The gameplay is very simple and allows for a variety of approaches. There are also many modes for multiplayer and the maps are generated randomly, resulting in unparalleled replay value.\n\nThe single-player campaigns are well designed and challenging. Plus, you can learn some History by completing them – I know I did.\n\nThe scenario editor is a fantastic tool. It has pretty much kept Age of Empires II alive for all these years, thanks to its brilliant and passionate community.\n\nThere are some issues, of course. For example, the A.I. leaves a little to be desired and unit pathfinding is not so great, which is made worse by occasional framerate drops during multiplayer matches.\n\nStill, none of these issues are enough to keep you from fully enjoying the game. You can't call yourself a true PC gamer without giving Age of Empires II a try.\n\nEven though it's been over a decade since its original release, it feels like the game hasn't aged a day.

This is perhaps one of the most immersive strategy games I've ever played. Overall, I can't find much to fault in it. Everything seems to still be in its respective place.\nAge of Empires II is an amazing strategy game, retelling hisoric events, such as memorable battles, the rise of multiple leaders and civilizations (through campaign mode, which is also highly recommended for those of you who like to play alone), and events in history that just captured peoples attention. I think they should institute this at schools for history class instead. It's very accurate to the events/battles/timelines that it covers.\nIf campaigning just isn't your cup of tea, fear not! There are multiple online servers hosting games almost all the time! You can also play your own private games with friends, in standard games, if PVP isn't really something you want to do, or are extremely good at (like me. I'd probably get destroyed in PVP XD). Lots of civilizations to choose to play as in these modes, so finding the one that suits your playstyle doesn't take long at all.\nFeeling creative? Make your own maps and scenarios, with scenario editor! Pick and choose features to add to your maps, and have a blast creating your own battles and maps to play!\nI don't generally play strategy games (it's on my to-do list), but I have played this one extensively.

The game is slow and very repetitive - in the economic matter of speaking : collecting food, wood, gold, recruit repeat - but it does its job, entertains you for hours. As the most potential feature I consider multiplayer, playing with real life opponents makes everything more interesting and harder than with AI.\n\n7/10","September 22, 2015","true","103.6"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","0"

I remember that i used to watch my uncle play this at the office when there weren't any clients around and ask myself why he found this game so amusing. At that time i was playing a demo version of "Lego Racers" when cereal boxes used to give you CD-ROMs. I asked him to get me the full version of that game, at that time and i couldn't understand what a "download" was, he simply was that computer wizard who could get me anything i wanted. There wasn't "unlimited internet" at that time, we used to turn off the phone when we wanted to get online so i never got the chance of playing "Lego Racers" and i got a zip file with "Age of Empires II" instead.\n\nFor many months i watched that folder on my computer and then i decided to play it. I remember playing with "El Cid", i didn't understood English at that time so i never got the first level completed. I tried to run from "King Alonso" and i never understood why i couldn't complete my mission. Years have passed, i played single player games with bots and learned the basic mechanics of the game. I've got "Age of Empires III" and my uncle was still playing "Age of Empires II" and i couldn't understand why once more. Why should he prefer it when there was a game wich was "the next" and with so better graphics?\n\nI am 22 years old now, i learned a little of English and i have my internet access to do whatever i want. "Lego Racers" used to be my favourite and i never played it anymore, i played lots of "Age of Empires III" and got the collection on Steam to remember me what great games are. On "Age of Empires II", i went back to the "El Cid" campaign, fled from "King Alonso", got some villagers, built my empire and tried to destroy him without the game asking me to. I have failed miserably but this time i did just because i wanted.\n\n"Age of Empires II" is a really well made game, i am not experienced in the "HD version" but i found many bugs that should be corrected. I am currently playing the game hoping that i could beat every campaign but sometimes it's just impossible.\nBesides that, i don't know why i can play this game for 6 hours straight, i can't understand why this game is better than "Age of Empires III" but in all of this years i can tell you this: my uncle was right all the time for playing it and if you are reading this you are making the right choice.\n\nNote: I am trying to help others and get help by making a steam guide so feel free to check it out.","January 28","true","68.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","8","9","4","0"

If you are interested in RTS and Medieval themed games, I would highly recommend that you purchase this game now. The in game art style may be outdated, but the gameplay will never die or grow old. AoE: II has a wide variety of civilizations and historical campaigns to choose from. The maps you play in MP or with bots can be premade or randomly generated, creating infinite possibilites for gameplay. Even better, the game comes with a scenario creator that has hundreds of options letting you create the battlefield you want.\n\nSadly, the remastered version uses the same MP from the retail copy I have from 2001; therefore, you will often have laggy matches or disconnect. However, you can play with bots offline alone. You can also play against bots on lan or internet with friends if you wish. Luckily, the remastered version makes up for it's lack of MP by having Steam workshop and modding support, which allows for endless content that's free.\n\nIn conclusion, after many years of playing this great RTS title (I have many more hours on the disc version), I would say that it's a must have if you like classic Medieval themed RTS games. If you aren't convinced yet, you should know I have 5 copies of this game. (Original discs and others are for friends on different steam accounts.) Yes, it was worth every penny.\n\nOverall, 10/10 would wolololo again.","July 24, 2015","true","595.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","8","9","5","2"

What's even worse is why it had to be this game that they had to screw up..\n\nFrom the very beginning, it started to smell of poor management. Milking the system having no clue what to do, working for Microsoft...\n\nThis game was released in 1999 originally, lets remember that. Now it's released 2013 April and already introduced new bugs. Fair enough, s*** happens and we just have to wait for a fix, but nope, that doesn't come to months later, even when it's game breaking like an "Out of Sync" error in pretty much 1 in 2 games and sometimes constantly in a row.\n\nThere was no beta testing, no alpha, not even a sale, the price was £20.00 for a game that was released and rereleased with no care at all on how much people actually take this game seriously and how much people focused on the little things.\n\nEven now, they release patches that breaks the game, which could have been easily noticed if they had a proper beta testing method. The forums is no help to the community other than random crap you would expect from a game expected to be FINISHED.\n\nIt can't get any worse, we assume, but that I can't confirm, as I thought that last year.. Slowly things are being resolved as time goes by, but no credits are warrented in my opinion, given anybody can do anything in 100 years.\n\nI recommend this game, because it's my favourite game of all time, but under control of crappy people.

Many people recommended this game and when I saw it on sale I gave it a shot.\n\nBasically, this game is like European Wars : Cossacks. Old style RTS.\n\nThe only downside to this Age of Empires 3 versus the second is the way you can choose formations in the second. It felt overall the second had more to control whereas the third sort of simplified things and tried to make the game easier and smoother. AoE 2 is your typical RPG, offering peasants (or settlers), militias, markets, church's, walls and gates to protect your city. I really can't see all the hype about this game to be truthful as everyone says. Yes the campaign stories are good, but I find that this game doesn't really set itself apart from other RTS's.\n\nIf I had a choice between playing European Wars : Cossacks or this - I would most likely choose EW : Cossacks. Not to say that this game is bad, but the options that are given in EW far outweigh those of AoE for me.\n\nI would give it an 8 if it had something to differentiate itself from other RTS of it's class, but\n\n7.7/10.","August 14, 2014","true","0.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Filling the gap that AoE Online failed to in my heart, Age of Empires II HD recaptured the Age of Empires experience that I've enjoyed better than most, if not all gaming experiences on this planet.\n\nThe community is great, as I have yet to see the classic multiplayer rager who caps locks and types vulgarities into the chat, and most everyone says "gg" after a match, making Age of Empires II HD one of the most docile and least annoying multiplayer communities I've seen on Steam!\n\nWith The Forgotten Expansion, the single player AND multiplayer experience is, in my opinion, doubled in fun. With scores of new and unseen units in the scenario editor, brand new civillizations, and some of the most interesting random maps I've seen, this expansion is well worth the money.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Age of Empires II HD to veterans of the game, as it will be an amazing and unforgettable nostalgia trip. If you've never played Age of Empires before, it's never too late to start! Also, this game is a great alternative solution to the problems that the CD-ROM of The Conquerors has on modern computers.\n\n","May 18, 2014","true","597.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It may seem a bit basic - train a load of soldiers and build a load of siege engines in order to systematically remove every other player from the map - but the complexity comes from adapting to various different styles of map, as well as learning how each different civilisation works. For example, the Britons have some of the best archery units in the game, but their mounted units are lacking in response. On the other hand, the Teutons have a unique unit that can take a lot of hits but is extremely slow, so they essentially need ranged escorts. And then there's dealing with being krushed (a.k.a. rushed with knights) and being able to reach the Castle Age in under 20 minutes. Oh, and don't even get me started on the absolutely wonderful soundtrack - something that I didn't hear until I got this version, no thanks to having to use a No-CD patch.\n\nHowever, while this is an incredible game, I feel like Microsoft haven't done enough to call this a true HD edition. Yes, technically it is in HD and this improves the game significantly, but otherwise it has little in the way of improvements, and it's therefore quite expensive for what it is. If you're never going to play multiplayer then try to find it cheaper on Amazon or something, and download the Forgotten Empires mod separately. Otherwise, get it when it's on sale, because fifteen quid is rather a lot of money to be spending on a game that's over 15 years old.\n\nIn conclusion, absolutely get this game (when it's cheap) because it is one of the greatest strategy games ever created, alongside Civilization IV and Command & Conquer: Red Alert. And to those idiot critics who say the game doesn't play very well, you deserve several slaps.","October 19, 2014","true","130.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

With widescreen support, updated graphics and interfaces, multiplayer and workshop support, this classic game that I binge-played as a kid just got even better. I've deposited countless hours into this game growing up and played local-multiplayer with my sister every day. In later years we used GameRanger to play multiplayer verses other players, even though it wasn't super ideal.\n\nIn my opinion, Age Of Empires is one of the greatest RTS games to date... even though I play very few RTS games, the ones I have played pale in comparison. AOE II has a deep upgrading and leveling system per game and a very large varity of tribes to choose from, each offering their own special units. You can play on a variety of maps and gamemodes, including ones you can create in the map editor. This is where the Steam workship really comes into play, easily being able to download custom maps in minutes.\n\nThe map editor itself is something I could talk about for a long time because it is so advanced. I'll keep it short though and say that under it's surface are the options to create detailed and custom campaign scenarios or maps with custom triggers and plenty of props. If you have the time to invest into the map editor, there are no limites to what you can create.\n\nAge Of Empires II holds up really well for being 15 years old, and if you love any kind of RTS game, Age Of Empires II HD without a doubt should be in your collection. The new expansion packs they added is also a must have, adding new features, maps, and units while keeping it true to the origonal game.","November 12, 2014","true","30.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The original game remains intact and is still alot of fun to play; However, with this new HD Edition, you can also play with user-generated content through the Steam workshop and on Steam servers. The HD Edition of AoE2 also comes with, The Conquerors expansion, and features multiplayer the same as the original version.\n\nOverall, I think they did a pretty good job of resurrecting a classic. I have fond memories of playing AoE2 for hours both through the varying single player modes as well as through multiplayer. It is nice to polished up a little and making the rounds for newer gamers who didn't have the pleasure of playing the original.","December 11, 2015","true","0.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The recent updates/bug fixes had the unintended consequence of creating more bugs. The game is now practically unplayable, as if it were possible to make the multiplayer even worse ! 90% of the games you play will lag terribly, and someone will drop out within the first five minutes, to your dismay it will usually be someone on your team, rendering the match distressingly unfair.\n\nThe community consists of rank obsessed, loyal, die hard fans that have no regard whatsoever when it comes to fair play and have accepted this ♥♥♥♥ and awful broken multiplayer. You can still find unranked, arena type games, such as castle blood, where the objective is to out kill your opponent which levels up your never ending spawn of troops, but these are frustrating due to multiplayer issues.\n\nThe biggest trouble is multiplayer, it is totally broken. Some players are courteous enough to rush their enemy when an opponents team mate drops, to end the suffering as quickly as possible, occasionally someone will drop out to even teams, but most laughably carry on as though it's still fair game, despite being 4v3, or 4v2, or worse. You might be lucky and have two lag outs, one on each team making it a fair 3v3 or 2v2. You will roll the dice every time you play, in the worst possible way. I don't blame people for being unsportsman like, it's so hard to actually get a game going, getting through the loading screen, by the end you're just desperate to play something, anything at all, even if you have no chance of winning, or equally, the opposing team has no chance of winning because lag claimed a victim on their side, it's frustating, as the game will almost NEVER play out as intended from the start, you just want that sense of blood and carnage, it's so difficult to reach that point due to the bugs.\n\nPeople rarely leave out of courtesy to even the teams once a player has dropped or lagged out so the game is instantly over in some cases. If lag claims a victim on the opposing side expect a desperate rush from your opponent in order to rebalance the game, or expect a team mate of yours to capitalise on your opponents misfortune by moving in on the dead players position and building in close proximity to gold, iron etc, often cutting off the trade links for market carts, meaning the opposing team has no chance at all of making a comeback. If the dice roll in your favour,  you may as well go afk, have a shower or make yourself some food instead, that's if you don't lag out yourself, because the game will not be challenging at all, you've basically won, it's 4v3, or 4v2, you are sitting pretty, why not send your villagers to attack the enemy base? May as well try and amuse yourself somehow because it's otherwise no fun at all. This buggy and broken multiplayer has lead to some interesting developments in gaming strategy/style. Some players have adapted to predicted lagouts, by rushing and trying to eliminate a player at the very start, thereby increasing their odds of winning. How sad and pathetic that a game's multiplayer in 2015 is so broken players have to include alternative strategies to accomodate the event within their scope of play. AoE2 was always plagued by terrible multiplayer.\n\nThere are so few games in the multiplayer lobby, even at peak times, the chance of you finding one in close proximity is remote which is important because any games you play worldwide will increase the probability of lag and almost certain drop outs. Any communication 'lag' issues with other players is delighfully displayed on the game screen at the start. You will be dissapointed when you join a lobby only to find you lag with another player, the traffic light system green, meaning slim chance of lagg/drop out (but by no means guaranteed), yellow, meaning odds of lag/drop out is over 50%, red meaning don't even bother, it's unlikely you'll get through the loading screen. I mean really these are windows 95/98 issues that never got resolved, it's an absolute disgrace. You will spend more time in loading screens/lobbies trying to play than actually playing.\n\n\nHaving said all that, if you don't mind being unable to play multiplayer, the single player has a lot to offer. Sadly even those that love RTS will, I doubt, wish to spend hours on their own doing the single player campaign or death matches against AI  in this era of gaming. Multiplayer is the only real thing this ancient game has going for it, and that is totally ♥♥♥♥ed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, trust me on this, save yourself the frustration, because it never gets any better.","November 29, 2015","false","123.4"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","17","29","0","0"

Alternatives to this exist as freeware in the form of ports such as Voobly.\nNo Manual way of changing resolution\nSteam overlay often bugs during the stats screen and after a game in the main menu.\n\n\nDespite all of this, it is still the Aoe we all know and love, with some modern conveniences. So, yes I would definatly recommend this game to anyone remotely intrested in true RTS gaming, in a world were old school RTS games are ridicilously difficult to find.\n\nRATING: 68/100 (Good)\nMost of that mark is because it is AOE2 with multiplayer that actually works. However the lazy nature of this 'HD Remake' must be taken into consideration to anyone wishing to purchase it. Value for money is not very high, at 27 euro one can purchase other Remakes such as RIse of the triad or Serious sam HD, but at the same time Aoe2 fans like myself are not likely to turn down this offer.\n","January 19, 2014","true","272.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Though I first played this game when I was 12 yrs old i.e some 4-5 years back(not a long time). Though I don't have many play hours on my steam account but I can say with a 100% guarantee that I've played this game for more than 500+ hours with the old disc version.\n\nSecondly, as the title says "Age of Empires II:The HD Edition", I will only say that its no worth buying if you're buying it for some improved graphics as it has only some minor(0.01%) graphics change(or say texture change) only on reflections of water and the colour of cliffs. Other than that its just the old AOE2.\nBut the good thing is that it has multiplayer which is no dead and you can easily find a decent amount of people playing online.\n\nIn short here are the pros & cons of this version of game-\n\nPROS-\n1.Multiplayer reborned\n2.Buy this if want to remember some good old memories of this game(having it on steam)\n3.For new players I would say you should try playing this best classic RTS game if you want to.\n4.Some minor changes like-\n-Select more than 40 units in a row(not sure how much, maybe 50 or 60)\n-Supports a maximum of 500 population limit in standard game mode.\n\nCONS-\n1.Don't buy if you're concerned only with the HD graphics.\n2.Its no remastered edition, its just an old AOE2 with steam workshop and steam trading cards available. But yes it has multiplayer to play.\n\nI really don't mind its graphics as I am fine with its old retro style graphics. But they should have improved its graphics as it says "HD Edition" which it is not :C\n\nFinally, I'm happy that it is on steam, and also the developers are releasing new contents for this game.","February 4, 2015","true","85.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tomboeg/recommended/221380/","Tomboeg","Tomboeg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tomboeg/","380 products in account","I made a Video & Text review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtLu3XNKHNk\nBoth are the same. Text below.\n\nWhat is age of empires?\nAge of empires is a classic real time stragery game. In Age of empires you are the wel.. hmm\ni think you are the king of a little kingdom. You always start of with three or four villagers and one scout\nYour main goal is to defeat the enemy king which also has a village somewhere out there on the map\nYou'll need to issue orders to your villagers and get them to work, villagers gather resources\nsuch as stone, wood, gold and food\nYou don't need to literally feed your people, but if you wish to recruit more villagers you will need to\nspend a one time payment to start the creation of a villager which will then be recruited.\nAs you gather supplies you will become able to build various buildings such as the barracks, archery range\nand stable. All the buildings require a certain amount of supplies in order for you to build them\nfor your kingdom.\nwhich are all used to recruit a certain type of unit. The blacksmith is in turn used to upgrade\nvarious aspects of your units such as armor, line of sight and firing range.\n\nAs you play you develop your own village or perhaps should i say kingdom. You will become powerful and\neventually lose or win the game by defeating the enemy king or getting defeated by the enemy king.\n\nOnce you have acquired a good base of supplies you may head over to your town center and advance to the next age.\nOnce you advanced to the next age, new buildings will be unlocked.\n\nIt might seem easy but it definitely is not. The ai is what i call the typical AI. The first moment it stands idly by,\nwhile it attacks with everything and everyone a moment later. Even though the AOE II HD development team\nworked on the AI i still find the AI rather vanilla with it's behaviour not greatly enhanced.\nI did notice that the AI actually sends siege weapons in and archers for targets that infantry can't reach\nbut the AI has a habit of sending it's unit's one by one to their death.\n\nYou can age-up a couple of times. You start at the foot age and then age up to the feadul age.\nAfter the feudal age comes the castle age and the last age would be the imperial age.\nEverytime you wish to age-up you will need to possess a certain amount of goods\nto pay your age-up with. Once you reach the castle age you will unlock siege weapons which could\nbe essential for taking\ndown castle's and other fortified buildings.\n\nand we've got a perfect example right here right now. As you can see the AI has various units just standing\nthere doing nothing.\nThey are literally waiting to get attacked or for an enemy to get close enough to them.\nIt usually takes a while for the AI to actually start attacking you, but when it does it does attack you good.\nAs you could have guessed, i do am playing on the easyest difficulty right now.\n\ncivilizations and upgrades\n\nAs you play you unlock new upgrades everytime your civilization advanced age.\nOnce you build the proper building, let's say a library.. many new upgrades will be unlocked and made available for research\nYou could for example then research stronger armor, sharper arrow, longer range, faster units andnew attach methods etc.\n\nAt the end of the game you will still be able to view the good old timeline. Showing the stats of all players who participated\nin the game. You can view military stats, economy stats, technology stats the society stats and of course the general timeline.\n\n\nThere are various civilizations a player can pick to play as.\nEach civilization got it's own bonus. Be it cheaper units, faster unit recruitment, unique buildings and so on..\n\nwhat is new?\nThe game has been released again under the name of age of empires 2 HD.\nHowever, there hasn't honestly been anything new despite the steam workshop and the steam multiplayer function.\nThe textures do look indeed much sharper than they used to do.\nBut then again they still exist out of visible pixels.\n\nThe expansion pack they brought really didn't bring much to the game and is to be more of a mod.\nLuckily there are active members in the steam community wish dedicate their time working on mods and new content.\n\nThere do is some new fancy music which i actually liked instantly. It literally settles the mood properly and brought me back\ninto the good old age of empires II atmosphere.\nThere also are a couple of achievement a player could earn for defeating players and acquiring certain achievement.\nBut other than that? No, there isn't much new.\n\nSteam workshop integration\nOne of the amazing things the developers added is the steam workshop integration.\nThis allows steam users to access new content such as textures but also new or additional units!\nAnd if you are creative, you may contribute to the community yourself.\nI find this a very good new addition myself, this way the AOE developers no longer need to release new content for the game.\nNow, the community could do it for them!\n\nmultiplayer\n\nit is amazing that you can now play age of empires ii online and on steam without having to port forward your router.\nBut it still got it's flaws. Even though you're using a network and are no longer using\ntelephone line to play multiplayer the game still suffers from constant performance drops\nand internet delays which only occur at multiplayer games.\n\nFinal verdict\n\nThe game is good, it is still good. It's lovely how the online option and steam workshop was added. That surely brings the\ngame back to life.\nHowever, the game itself hasn't changed. So if you're planning to purchase the game again for the single-player whilst having\nit on an old disk somewhere\nthen do not purchase it, the game is the same. It's the online and workshop you should purchase the game for.","January 25","true","22.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/221380/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Those of you that haven’t played AoE II in a while will probably have some pretty fond memories of the aging strategy title. You’ll likely think of it as one of the greats; spectacularly innovative, well-balanced and displaying a level of detail that would make Renaissance painters blush. Then … you’ll start the game.\n\nAs great as it might be, the number of changes that have been made here are the absolute bare minimum. There are no HD textures, all of the original sound effects and voice clips have been kept, and none of the mechanics have changed. Everything is exactly as we all left it -- for better or worse.\n\nLittle in AoE II has aged as well as one might hope. Those used to more sophisticated strategy games might find this golden oldie a bit frustrating. There’s no auto-explore, no unit command queues, no building queues, selecting a group of units will often select stray workers, control groups are pretty limited both in terms of number of units you can select and number of control groups allowed, and worker AI leaves quite a bit to be desired.\n\nEven so, there’s a kind of purity to the whole thing. Micromanagement and care are a lot more important than they have been in years and the lack of affordances and hand-holding gives a rougher but sometimes more precise experience. I found myself setting rally points much more effectively, and I would often dedicate five of my control groups to villagers or workers specifically to help cycle through economic management. For example, in my main lumber-gathering camps, I’d keep one worker in a control group so I could easily reposition the camp, and jump to that group of workers for quick action.\n\nAdditionally, I became much more careful with base construction patterns and the arrangement of my buildings and supply lines. Keeping everything organized with so little help from the computer is hard enough, and I figured working around my own foolish base design would make the whole thing intolerable.\n\nThis bare-bones approach encourages a much more aggressive, and obsessive style of play. There’s no room for complacency; you can't afford to stop moving or quit paying attention. Quite unlike StarCraft, which is often the same for the first three minutes or so of every match -- build worker after worker, secure more food, then crank out some military. At the very least, AoE will have you manually scouting and switching between various starting food sources while also securing housing, wood supplies, and getting everything set-up for the tech advancement. It’s different enough each time that it’s never the same game twice.\n\nEach of the civilizations is also fairly balanced with a few small exceptions here and there. Generally speaking though, the game is a very appropriate gauge of an enormous number of tactical as well as bigger-strategy skills. The game moves fast enough with other competent players that you’ll need to be pretty aggressive to keep up, without being so inaccessible that newer or less well-practiced players will be doomed before they ever start.\n\nSimilarly, the campaign will take you through some of the more interesting, albeit distressing, moments in the middle ages. It’s all more or less historically accurate, though handled with a fair amount of tact, such that it never veers into unnecessarily offensive territory. If you can teach your children how to play effectively, it’s honestly not a bad tool to teach them a few things about major historical conflicts. I remember learning about the Aztecs and the city of Tenochtitlan from this thing. Enough that I can still spell that city-name properly with one try. Whoever said games weren’t effective teachers?\n\nIn all seriousness though, this game is fantastically well-made, even if it a little rough around the edges. Some of the bigger issues with trying to run the thing on modern computers (such as the color bug, and the mouse scroll bug) have been fixed. Plus AoE II now supports a huge range of monitor resolutions, which is nice, even if we’re still stuck with these old textures, but there is Steam Workshop support so things could change down the line by fans.\n\nAll told, while a little frustrating if you’re not into tons of micro-management, Age of Empires II HD with the Workshop and updated multiplayer features is an excellent title. The brilliance of the game’s design is still there, you just might need to look past its age to see it.","March 12, 2014","true","198.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

In one way this is great because it stays true to the original game for nostalgic value and so professional/competitive players won't shun the game for being "casualized" or ruined for minor changes. On the other hand this is a huge amount of lost potential. To be perfectly honest, Age of Empires II was a very flawed title - I mean don't get me wrong, I love the game and it was amazing when it first came out... but it hasn't aged as well as it could have. No pun intended.\n\nI still think the game is incredible and well worth the purchase, but I would have liked to see them do more than just port the game over. A more advanced map editor, better mod support, more interface options, more potential. All things that don't really affect the 'competitive' scene but give the rest of the audience (probably 99%+ of players) something to play around with.\n\nThe original AoE 2 gets my full 10 out of 10 score, but this 'HD' version is just a sloppy port.\n$20 is a little steep to re-purchase a game that came out in '99, but hey, if you love the series then I guess it's worth it.\nOriginal Game: A+, timeless classic\nHD Remake: C-, could have been better","March 29, 2014","true","232.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

No game can every come close to the replayability of this game. With the release on steam we get to see an all time favorite get new development and features. Two official expansions have been added since AoC was released in the year 2000.\n\nA notable feature that the HD edition brings is an integrated lobby system. Users with any combination of the standard HD edition or expansions/DLC can play with each other and see each others lobbies. As a former player of Age of Empires 3 I hated seeing the community spit up into vanilla, The War Chiefs, and the Asian Dynasties.\n\nI've put 1000 hours into the game so far and still enjoy it. The multiplayer experience is the heart of the replayability. You will experience more lag than older versions of the game due to the visual engine being updated with directx 9.0c. It was originally made with version 5 & 6. The minus is the peer to peer connections vs a client server model. The plus is there is no cost to maintain it and you'll see more dollars free for development rather than paying for servers. I've found that playing with players from a region close to you makes for a pretty nice running match.\n\nPlayers from Europe with good connections+good PC's can also be played with a tolerable amount of delay. Cross continent play with poor connections or older PC's makes the game hard to play. Find games with 200 or less ping and you'll be sweet!\n\nSingle player runs very good with unlocked FPS and is very responsive. It makes campaigns very enjoyable, especially when you start with limited armies and need to spend more time microing your units. The classic age of kings and conquers campaigns are always great, forgotten empires campaigns lack a little bit of the classic feel. They don't' have voice acting and play very modular like. The feel is you are playing a well crafted scenario vs a retail campaign. The newest expansion African Kingdoms brings back some of the old magic with voice acting and fluid campaigns. I highly recommend it. I have completed all the campaigns so that's my experience with them.\n\n\nI give the game overall 8/10 with 10/10 a possibility. It would need to make better gains in multiplayer to earn that perfect rating. If you consider $/hour played, this game is the best value you can find even at full price.","June 12, 2015","true","371.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Then, after hours and hours of slogging through games maybe you'll take on a super hard AI, maybe. As well as that you can enjoy one of this game's million campaigns, because doing three of four wasn't enough. But then again, doesn't everyone want to play as Vlad the Impaler and fight Romanian Tribesmen.\n\nBut, it is the multiplayer that really kicks the ♥♥♥♥ bucket. If perhaps you're just looking for a nice, easy game full of teamwork and such then you'll be horribly disappointed. Watch as your Levy Pikemen are utterly slaughtered by hoards of Paladins, scream in terror as your walls are torn down by Vikings, or just scream with a hint of insanity as your men are turned against by men in dresses with sticks.\n\nIf you happen to be the guy with the Paladins, the Vikings or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Priests, well done!","July 14, 2014","true","125.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The "HD edition" is exaggerated and might be misleading. It runs on a higher resolution, the water is a bit nicer, the cliff texture is different, but overall it's not that much of a difference. The menu was very dissapointing imo as it looked very low resolution and blurry. I even thought that my resolution was set wrong! I don't think it's worth the prize they are asking for it, I mean come on an old updated game for 18,99 or 27,99 (+DLC) is way too much. If you still have the original game then don't bother buying this unless the steam online play attracts you that much. I didn't have the game anymore and it was on -75% off so that's the reason I bought it. I don't really know if I would recommend it yes or no as I'm more in the middle.

Incredibly well made, engaging and educational! And now it got a much needed HD update. Indeed, an update worthy of the game itself. The title screen had an almost hypnotic nostalgia effect on me; I just sat there for a minute or two listening to the music and admiring the details that have aged so well. The seamless transition to HD quality was without a doubt perfectly executed. The game hasn't lost any of its original charm and after a few moments it feels right at home. What's more, I particularly enjoyed the new music that seemed to fit in so well with the gameplay, adding this much needed dramatic effect. Although I played only the first mission of Barbarossa, I found it immensely entertaining. The amount of user-generated content for this game is bewildering, in a good way. Hundreds of achievements, Steam powered lobbies and future official content to come, what more could one ask for? I couldn't think of any game more worthy of such revivification.","December 4, 2013","true","24.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mendozacheers/recommended/221380/","mendozacheers","Mendozacheers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mendozacheers/","4519 products in account","A HD revival of the classic Real-Time Strategy game Age of Empires II: Age of Kings and it's expansion The Conquerors. Originally released 14 years ago during the golden age of Microsoft Game Studios with classics such as Halo, Rise of Nations, Dungeon Siege, Fable etc. Age of Empires II might be the most acclaimed RTS game of all time, with exceptions of maybe Starcraft and Warcraft due to the importance they had in the competetive scene compared to Age of Empires. Age of Empires never were a real successful tournament title but there has always been small communities surviving throughout the years.\n\nThe original game is still available in some Retail stores as "classic" branded title, often as a third-party release. I bought a DVD copy a few years ago just for the sake of nostalgia, it featured both the 1997 original Age of Empires and the sequel for 9,99€. Yet I instant-purchased AOE2HD when it arrived on Steam. I would've bought it even if it costed me 29,99€ for the sake of getting it on Steam with workshop support, achievements and higher resolutions.\n\nThe HD version does not include Any high-definition textures or effects, as one might expect. The game is rather a High resolution edition, supporting up to multi-monitor resolutions, not that it's recommended on a Strategy game, but still neat. Some people argue that the price is too high and the title is false marketing since the game does not feature any HD changes to the textures. Combine that with the amount of issues some people had upon relaese - and you get quite a few disappointed customers.\n\nThis game introduced me to Video Games, Age of Empires (1997) was the first game I ever played, at least that's what I remember. The sequel did play an even bigger role throughout my childhood and even up to this date. A supreme LAN title to play with your friends or on your High-schools computer's. No doubt this is the game I have played the most ever. Which does say quite a lot, I regularly return to play some Single or Multiplayer.\n\nAge of Empires II HD recently recieved it's first expansion - The Forgotten. Which adds 5 new Civilizations, 4 new campaigns, a bunch of more units and upgrades, new custom maps and settings. This is probably what fans wanted with the original HD release, since the expansion costs 9,99€ alone. I am still extremely excited for new official content after such a long time!\n\nIf you do not have a personal connection to this game then I suggest checking out some videos and maybe look out for a sale. If I were to install the game from my DVD and gotten the fan created high-res support as well as server hosting service (Voobly, GameRanger), then if I would've tried to play online - I would have gotten my ♥♥♥ kicked. This revival resulted in a lot of beginners started playing this game again, which is a very good thing. I get to kick some ♥♥♥ without being a total "AOE2 Master". We've seen a lot of classics being revived lately, and I hope publishers and devlopers realise what kind of money a person is ready to spend just to feel like a kid again.\n\nLike Real Time Strategy and don't mind a few dated looks? This game suits you like a glove. Maybe you just want it for the nostalgia?","April 27, 2013","true","256.5"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","4"

For a 2000 game. I'll let that sink in.\n\nThe pathfinding appears to be more or just as broken as the originial title. The game is highly unstable.\n\nThe new effects they added are badly tacked on and look worse than what they replace. The cliffs look out of place, the flammes look like a slow detached blingee gif added on top the building, the farms and ressource icons look like crap.\n\nDo not buy the expansions as they are not expansions, they are MODS. MODS that you PAY for. They were made by young high school/college modders (this is no joke) and scream amateurish for every content introduced. The material stands out from the original assets like a stain on a white napkin. The slav building set has a lower resolution than the rest of the game, looks unfinished and the colors are way off the game's general scheme. Most of the new units added were ripped from old mods or AoE2's original beta units.\nThe forgotten campaigns are a succession of very narrow corridors (A nightmare with the armies you control), on immense maps clogged with buildings and decorations. The modder who made them seems to be suffering from the same affliction as George Lucas which prevents the both of them from realizing when overdesigning is ''too much''. There is no voice acting obviously, thank god for that considering the walls of texts thrown at our faces were apparently written by someone struggling with the English language (of course they're also amateurish and cheesy beyond the simple vocabulary and spelling mistakes). The triggers can be downright tedious, like having to click back and forth between two characters just to trigger each lines of a pointlessly long dialogue, and are apparently so elobaborate they can cease working altogether.\n\nEven small details like the new pictures for the civilizations in the history section, or especially the unit voices, stand out for their low quality. You are left to wonder if the material used for most of these voice recordings amounted to more than an in built laptop mic and the work outsourced to a random Peruvian, Hungarian, Russian, and Italian fan respectively. Considering this 'expansion' was made by amateurs in the first place, would that be surprising? (Read on how they were produced in the original 1999 game, it's amasing that they went their way to hire Mongolian throat singers for the Huns/Mongols voices).\n\nThe new expansion, AFRICAN KINGDOMS, suffers the same, just to a lesser extent. The content still stands out for its low quality. The new building set for Africans looks a bit better than the slav one, and they had the sense to give the Italian building set to the Portugese. The campaigns are still inferior to the original ones but not as bad as the Forgotten. Not as over designed, they have some very bad voice acting but at least there's less lines to read from (you can spot mic distortions which obviously indicate some sort of cheap USB mic in someone's bedroom was used, again). You often walk accross gigantic maps, tediously eliminating one small group of enemy after another. Age of Empires 2 is not Warcraft and was never meant to play like an adventure tactical game, especially not on amateurish maps.\n\nAnd this is about all you can say about the HD edition. There is virtually no other content to review. On the plus side the new civilizations are somewhat balanced and play alright in multiplayer, some balance changes were introduced and are welcome for the competitive scene. Except there's virtually no HD competitive scene to speak of and the multiplayer is mostly dead.\nIf you like Age of Empires 2 I recommend you acquire the old versions and go play on Gameranger or Voobly who have a thriving multiplayer scene.\n\nPS : If you're wondering about the Italian building set, they ripped it off from a very old mod, Rome at War. I don't even know if the original creators are aware that they are making a profit on their backs.","November 8, 2015","false","19.9"," 43 of 80 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","43","80","3","3"

Luckly you don't really have this problem with AoE II HD (it happens with other very good games just like Warcraft III or Empire Earth). I would say the HD graphic it's kind of "retro-oldish"  but also "newish" at the same time: a perfect compromise.\nIt's a shame they didn't add some new features, but even lacking new relevant updates this game is still amazing and can definitely compete with more recent titles.\n\nIf you're wondering "is it really worth it to spend 20dollars for such an old game?" my answer is: you'd better wait for sales in order to get it for about 5 dollars, but man... the game is worth all the 20 damn bucks.","July 8, 2014","true","64.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/recommended/221380/","xpliciit","Xpliciit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xpliciit/","178 products in account","Introduction\n\nFirst of all i just want to say that i played this game way back in the day when it was released and i loved it so much. Back then you had no way of tracking how much time you played but il bet anybody i played over 1000 hours eaaaaasy! Then when the expansion disc came out i just had to have it omg i was so addicted back then.\n\nSo now that im 25 years old and probably hadn't touched this game for over 10 years, i see that this game is on Steam and for Nostalgia reasons i decide what the hell i loved it back then i can love it again on Steam!\n\nReview\n\nSince this game has been released on Steam the developers have included the Conquerors expansion disk (DLC) with the original game and also included Workshop support. It was due to this Workshop support that the modding community for this game created such a vast epic amount of content that the Developers had decided to even release further DLC to this game that i believe was created by the community. However since i bought the game on Steam after this point for me it has always had all the DLC included.\n\nSo playing this game again for the first time in probably over 10 years brings back so many memories and im soon remembering how i used to build my bases and quickly picking up the hotkey buildings. With this i jump straight into a couple of Deathmatches and Random matches against the NEW Computer AI which is considerably harder than the disk versions Conquerors AI. I get killed off pretty early and quite easily but im not phased at all because the memories playing this game are flooding back to me and im absoloutly loving playing this game once again.\n\nUnlike the PS2 version this is Steam and therefore it also now has achievements of which there are around 300 i believe, so if you are wanting those then there will be no using cheatcodes like back in the day when you were a little low on a resource :P\n\nAlso one thing i will add since having bought this game it has very regularly been Updated with many Stability fixes and Lag fixes. Due to the age that this game is now considering it was first released in '99 the support from the Devs is just fantastic especially when they could just ignore this game and focus on their much newer games. Speaking of which i also have AoE 3 but haven't played it on Steam yet, it doesn't seem to have Achievements or Workshop content like this game does for some reason so maybe that doesn't get the same support this game does i don't know.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nSo this game since being released on Steam has Multiplayer - Something which i at least never had on my PS2 version although we never had an Ethernet cable to connect to it back then so maybe there was Multiplayer back then too. I personally have not yet even managed to touch on the Multiplayer side of things since im progressivly working my way through completing all the Campaigns in the entire game and its DLC. Multiplayer i can only imagine would even more so greatly increase the overall number of hours played in this game, especially when you look at playing through some of the Workshop Scenarios together too.\n\nWorkshop\n\nSo this game has Workshop content, what does that mean? It means that the Developers have given the AoE community the power to create thier own graphical texture improvements and share their scenarios that they have created for this game with everyone else that owns the game.\n\nFor me so far i have grabbed a couple of graphics improvements that give the water textures a more colourful, realistic feel and new cliff and grass textures. This gives the game a whole fresh, modern HD feel to the game which still has or at least looks like it has the original graphics from 1999. That is what im assuming from still having not played the disc version that i still have with the PS2 :P\n\nThere are like i said before many hundreds of Custom Scenarios all created by the Community Workshop that i haven't even touched on myself yet that could add upto hundreds of hours of extra gameplay. I have seen scenario remakes of Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones to challenging scenarios and some other very creative scenarios!\n\nThere are graphical mods that allow you to completely change the entire feel of the game so you can have Crystal Trees and huge Veins of Gold and Stone Mines with a Space like terrain if you wanted. This is the kind of things you can experience on a game this old that breathes new life into it and could easily see you play over 10,000 hours in this game.\n\nOverall\n\nIf you played this game back in the day and loved it - BUY IT NOW! You will not regret buying this game, i only have a meagre 200 hours so far in this version, i expect to be easily dropping 1000 hours in eventually. That is ontop of what i could only guess would be at least 1000 hours on the PS2 version back in the day :P","August 14, 2015","true","206.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

See Skyrim for Sandbox RPGs, Mario Bros 3 for platformers, etc. I won't go into detail explaining the gameplay, but with 20+ civilizations to play with and against, you will never run out of combinations.\n\nGRAPHICS/MUSIC\n\nThe music is catchy and will get stuck in your head quickly. Graphically, it's not necessarily "HD". Just looks sharper and more refined thatn the base game. Overall, pretty good, and you can easily tell what things are, make distinctions between teams, and identify PRECIOUS STONE HOLY CRAP WHY IS THERE NO STONE WHEN I NEED IT\n\nSTORY\n\nThe story mode is played out in single-player "scenarios" that document real events in world history. It's a very cool concept, but isn't as great as the multiplayer.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\n\nThis is where the game truly shines. Nothing beats getting a few buds together and playing Last Man Standing for ages.\nHonestly, it can't be put into words, you have to experience it for yourself.\n\nOVERALL\n\nGRAPHICS/MUSIC: 8\n\nSTORY: 8\n\nMULTIPLYER: 10\n\nIn conclusion, it's easily the best RTS I've ever played.

I can remember me and oon played Age of Empires when we were about 8 years old. I like everything about this game excpept the muitplayer save issue. Me and Bollekukk tried making a multiplayer save and when our internet connection went off we were not able to load the map again... We even saved it several times. I read on the internet that several people have the same problem, but I think they should fix this issue by now. The game has been out for so long that it should be done years ago.. Still is lots of fun to play single player.

See Skyrim for Sandbox RPGs, Mario Bros 3 for platformers, etc. I won't go into detail explaining the gameplay, but with 20+ civilizations to play with and against, you will never run out of combinations.\n\nGRAPHICS/MUSIC\n\nThe music is catchy and will get stuck in your head quickly. Graphically, it's not necessarily "HD". Just looks sharper and more refined thatn the base game. Overall, pretty good, and you can easily tell what things are, make distinctions between teams, and identify PRECIOUS STONE HOLY CRAP WHY IS THERE NO STONE WHEN I NEED IT\n\nSTORY\n\nThe story mode is played out in single-player "scenarios" that document real events in world history. It's a very cool concept, but isn't as great as the multiplayer.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\n\nThis is where the game truly shines. Nothing beats getting a few buds together and playing Last Man Standing for ages.\nHonestly, it can't be put into words, you have to experience it for yourself.\n\nOVERALL\n\nGRAPHICS/MUSIC: 8\n\nSTORY: 8\n\nMULTIPLYER: 10\n\nIn conclusion, it's easily the best RTS I've ever played.

Every unit's pathfinding is great, and they will oftentimes have a single unit or small group of units go a completely seperate and longer route, ending in their deaths. Every military unit also defaults to "aggressive" stance, which means if they see a unit, even a single unit, like a scout run through, they will chase them until you tell them not to. So if you don't change them off of that and a scout runs by without you noticing, all your units will chase it, probably to their deaths. If there's a gate and you try to send units through a lot of the time they walk up to your gate, change their mind, try going through the wall instead for a bit, then go back through the gate, far behind anyone else. They might even pretend the gate exists making you have to manually move them through it very slowly. These are just a few of the many, many examples of the horrible ai and pathfinding.\n\nThe enemy AI for singleplayer isn't any better, either.

If you try to select and move these units along with others who spawned near them and just didn't move for some reason they go to where you want them to temporarily, then go backwards and start spazzing out.\n\nAll the DLC is mods made by college students, sometimes with assets used from other mods maybe without permission. The expansions also all look really low res and don't fit the colour scheme, looking absolutely horrible.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, they hide the bug fixes in the DLC, so without them you're left with Teutonic monks without more healing range among many other things.\n\nThere are numerous other problems with the game I don't feel are important enough to list here, such as  certain things being hard to click, and buildings being unable to be rotated, making you have to first build walls and waste those resources before placing down a gate, even if the gate alone can close the gap.\n\nI could go on well above the 8,000 character limit about the flaws of this game.","December 25, 2015","false","88.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

My list of critical bugs:\n\n* If a farm is "targeted" by an enemy it cannot be worked, no matter if it is actually attacked or not.  This can be exploited as a denial of service type attack.\n\n* Gates don't actually stop any units, even enemies.  Any unit can walk straight through a locked and closed gate, into your base.  Trade carts end up on the outside of a wall, and the enemy army end up inside.  Highly irritating.\n\n* Multiplayer saves cannot be restored.  I understand they are aware of this, it wouldn't be such a problem if the game didn't crash in the middle of a match so easily (for no reason).\n\n* The map generation scripts for several maps are still "missing" so only a small set of scenarios are actually playable.\n\n* AI units just stand in front of walls and do nothing while they are slaughtered.  While amusing, this does take the fight out of the game somewhat.\n\n* Pathfinding in general is horrendous.  Any group of units larger than 10, especially slow moving units for some reason always take the longest possible path and then get nearly to the goal and turn round and go back again.  I don't know if there is some sort of timeout and slow units hit this and they are forced to "recalculate" their path, but its very annoying.\n\nApparently the developers are "aware" of most of these issues, howver because they are hell-bent on releasing oodles of DLC these have been forgotten for months with no indication at all of when they will be addressed.  I would't mind if there was any signs of life from the developers themselves.\n\nSuggestions for the developers:\n\n* Unpin the countless "patch threads" in the forum that are several years old and completely irrelevant.  Keep the most recent patch thread in place so people can easily find it.  Pin a thread which indicates which bugs you are aware of and some indication of priority or timeline.  I'm sure (or I hope) you have an internal bug tracker, it wouldn't be too much to ask that we can get some indication of whether these issues are being fixed at all.\n\nI really want this to be a positive review, but until these blatant issues are fixed I couldn't possibly recommend this game.","January 23","false","306.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I remember how thrilled I was fighting the Britons side by side with William Wallace; I have played this campaign again and again. How many times did I destroy that castle in The Battle of Falkirk? I couldn't tell. And I didn't even try the full version yet. It's not a surprise my parents later gave it to me for my birthday! I finished every campaign multiple times, fought against my friends or side by side with them. Even when I spend months, even some years, without playing it, the music comes back to me once in a while. I was in love with that game.\n\nIt is saddening how the new development team made me hate it.\n\nThis HD version is like raisin cookies you mistook for chocolate ones. And I will tell you right away why it is so dream shattering: lag. Huge ugly lag which tears all the fun from this game.\n\nI have a decent computer which runs many other games with high graphics. But this game lags when there are more than a few hundred units on the map. Sometimes it even freezes for a whole second, it's not just low fps. I believe it's more than a graphic issue, there is a memory leak somewhere and nobody from the community found a way to fix it. It is a known issue, search "AoE lag" and you will find dozens of bug reports, but the development team doesn't seem to care; it has been a long time according to what I read and they prefer to release DLCs than to address a monstrous bug in the core of this game.\n\nDo not buy it; go back to the original version.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laktar/recommended/221380/","Laktar","[Twat] Kane 'The Mole King'","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laktar/","335 products in account","This game was one of my childhood favourites, and inspired my interest in history, especially history surrounding the nomadic empires of Atilla and Genghis. The gameplay is fairly standard when it comes to RTS gameplay, you start with your Town Hall and a few workers and micromanage said workers untill you've got a town large enough to build a sufficient army to take on your foes.\n\nPersonally I never got very invested in the multiplayer, which is why I'm glad to say the singleplayer is very extensive with campaigns surrounding certain wars that were fought in times long past, for instance the rise of the mongol empire, and the events that unfolded when spaniards first set foot on aztec lands. I wouldn't say the game is 100% historically accurate, but the campaigns are definitely based around real events.\n\nBeyond that, all and all I think it's a fun game, the HD edition doesn't add to much beyond making everything look a bit smaller, but nothing too upsetting, atleast it lets me play Age of Empires 2 again, a game I'd gladly pay for to relive.\n\nWord of warning though, I have come across a lot of issues with the expansion "The Forgotten", and as it was based around a mod for the original game, a lot of the AI feels clunkier. (The AI will spawn tons of units in their fortress and the campaigns can feel more like a grind than usual), and the pathing is sometimes difficult to manage. There's also the issue of invisible walls in favour of pacing, which all comes down to your personal preference.\n\nAll in all I love the original game, and due to that I can bare The Forgotten's campaigns, but if you're trying this for the first time I'd recommend starting off with the game without the dlc.","February 19, 2014","true","206.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you enjoy RTS games even a little, you want this game.  If you haven't already played this game, you should play this game.

It is extremely balanced after years of playing it and refining it.  The HD version enhances the game by offering wide screen options, newer hardware/OS support, steam integration, and new age balance changes.  Age of Empires II HD has received nothing but betterment on top of its amazing predecessor, the classic many grew up with and even more played.\n\n\nAge of Empires II HD and the new expansion, 14 years after the release of the game, are both must haves for any gaming collection.  10/10.","December 23, 2013","true","44.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

AoE2 HD Edition is great for people who never played the original release and want something that will work on modern systems without any problems. It's also great for people like me who absolutely loved AoE2 to begin with and was hoping for the ability to play it on modern operating systems without running into graphics or sound glitches or having to go through the workarounds for multiplayer after the MSN Gaming Zone was shut down.\n\nThat said, for an HD Edition, there's decidedly little that's actually "HD" about it apart from being able to run in modern resolutions (just bear in mind that fullscreen runs at your desktop's resolution and there's no way to change the resolution ingame). I feel like this is mitigated by the fact that it's still a compilation of Age of Empires 2 + The Conquerors expansion, with their gameplay pretty much unaltered from the original releases and patches apart from integrating Steam achievements and using Steam for the multiplayer setup. AoE2 wouldn't really benefit all that much from significant visual upgrades anyway. After all... it's the fantastic gameplay that's kept people like me playing it pretty regularly for going on 15 years. And that's precisely what you get with this package.","February 3, 2014","true","63.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

This was fine 10 years ago when screen sizes were pretty similar but it just doesn't work well with bigger monitors.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 2\nAge of Empires II HD\nPurchase Date: 6/13/2015\n\nUnlike most of my Steam games that I haven't played, this one I just picked up in the most recent summer sale.  I played the original Age of Empires II way back in the day, but I didn't remember a lot of specifics.  Generally I am not a fan of real time strategy games, but I remembered actually liking this one, so I decided to pick up this new version on sale.\n\nAn hour doesn't get you very far in an RTS game.   You can have multiplayer matches go longer than that.  But I spent my hour going through the tutorial, which does a good job getting you up to speed on things.  If you've played an RTS game before, then the concepts introduced in the tutorial will be very familar.    It's all about harvesting resources to enable you to build buildings which let you train different units so you can attack and defend.\n\nBecause this is an older game (albeit an updated version of one), it's missing a few things that you'd expect from more modern games.  For one, you can't change the resolution of the game.  You can run full screen or windowed mode.   You also can't zoom in or out of your map.  I kept wanting to use my mousewheel to scroll, but this game predated the use of scrollwheels in games.\n\nThe one thing that really stuck out as annoying was the placement of the icons at the top of the screen, which are for various menu options.  The problem is the icons are rather small, and also when you move your mouse to the top of the screen, it will scroll the map up.  It' nearly impossible to click a menu option without also making the map scroll.\n\nThe tutorial was pretty fun, and does a good job of easing you into the game without overwhelming you at first.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the HD version of this game actually changes very little.  The graphics and textures look the same.  I think this was more about making the game playable on newer machines with widescreen resolutions.  Also it adds Steam Workshop support which is a nice bonus (although my one hour in the game didn't include anything to do with the workshop).\n\nI can see where some might be turned off by the lack of updates here.  But I would argue there is something to be said for keeping the game as it is, warts and all.   This isn't intended to be Age Of Empires IV, so I don't think it should be judged as such.\n\n\nOverall Recommendation: Keep\n","June 14, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeetMaster/recommended/221380/","NeetMaster","Volly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeetMaster/","135 products in account","Welcome everyone, back to Age of Empires II.\nThat one game from everyone's childhood that is the cause of mass nostalgia is now on steam and HD.\nOriginal Release Date: September 30, 1999\nSteam Release Date: April 9, 2013\n\nAs nearly everyone else in the reviews, I also played this in my childhood. This was probably my second or third game (after AOE I of course) and I can easily recall wololo'ing enemies to my command, only using the cavalry because they looked neato and stupidly raiding enemy AI prematurely without much of a chance. Age of Empires was a brilliant part of my gaming childhood and might just be what pushed my 5-6 year old self to continue to do what I love up to today, gaming.\nAge of Empires II is a RTS (Real-Time Strategy). The focus of the game is to gather resources such as wood, food, gold and stone to create your most ideal kingdom that fits whatever scenario you are in/come across. You use your loyal villagers to create buildings based around certain ages you can evolve through. These ages consist of the Dark Age, Feudal Age, Castle Age and Imperial Age. As you move forward throught the ages, you advance in technology and become able to construct better buildings and units all with the intention of surpassing your opponent in economy and militia.\n\nThe game offers an easy and understandable tutorial to people who are new to the scene of RTS games while still maintaining a learning curve of difficulty perfect for more advanced players.\nLower difficulties aren't simply a walk in the park where the AI immediately gives up. It still provides a challenge suitable for the newer people to the game.\n\nThe Yays!\nMore people are playing multiplayer. Since the HD version, many players use multiplayer now so it is very easy to find a game suitable to your level of playing. I'd reccommend tweaking the settings beforehand to suit your wants.\nSay 'Goodbye' to countless hours of your time. Age of Empires is a very addictive game and you will definately find yourself late for dinner, meetings, anything that'll happen in 2-3 hours time.\nFlexible Scenarios. Find yourself lost in many fun and random scenarios ranging from handicaps to bountiful resources and more!\nInteresting Campaign. Play single-player games featuring famous people in history such as Joan of Arc, Ghengis Khan and Attila the Hun.\nMod/Workshop Support. This is really interesting to see because now players can add custom maps, soundpacks, texturepacks and scenarios to workshop.\nThe sounds and music are a great listen. It feels good to win a game and depressing to lose one (not just because you're bad :P). The music and sounds are a great addition to the atmosphere of the game.\nThe Nays...\nUpdated Graphics...? The difference between the HD version and older version isn't too far apart. They both look quite similar and have only minor changes. Although much higher resolution is supported than the old one.\nNo LAN Games. It seems that the LAN feature for multiplay has been removed, would've been nicer and more playable if they kept it.\nConnection Issues. Desync and mass lag occurs quite often and is very game-breaking, even when you are close to people you're trying to play with.Seeing this game on steam after those years made a feeling of nothing other than pure nostalgia wash over me and absolutely compel me to buy it.\n\nWould I reccommend this to anyone?Without a doubt, yes. Whether you are an older returning player to the series or would just like to try a new game, Age of Empires II is definately a good game in my books.\n\nRating: 10/10\nReccommended Price: $5-10","December 22, 2015","true","127.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is the best joke on AoC ever!\n\nEdit: I am aware the problem was fixed long ago. But the main problem of this game is having lots of issues like that and developers don't take them serious in long term.\n\n#It doesn't run on some old PCs which can run old version of the game#\nI like this game very much and have always been a supporter of Cysion about this project. But I also have to admit that had lots of problems when trying to play instead of old AoEII. I insisted a friend to buy this game on Steam when it was just released. But the game didn't work on his PC. I know, this happens very rare but it didn't run on a computer which can run old version very well. So, you can't play this game with an old graphich card.\n\n#FPS#\nFPS is lower than expected. I expected to play this game with Intel integrated graphics, but it's not fluent on high resolutions. Also, scroll system doesn't feel smooth like the old version, especially if FPS stays below 60s.\n\n#Game balance#\nAdding new civilizations and units very good improvement, but as long as they don't break the game balance. But I think nobody doesn't play The Forgotten seriously or (some of them) still not aware of it. It is really impossible to stand Italians with a cavalry civilization (like Persians). Or Incas' unique unit is really worthless. When these changes considered seriously you can see the unbalanced points easily.\n\n#Campaign videos (Narrated Stories)#\nI had really enjoyed while playing Age of Kings and Conquerors campaigns, expected same quality from Forgotten. Actually, scenerio designs very good, but why there is no narrated stories with a medieval soundtrack? This could be really done easily because texts are already implemented in the game. It seems they realised this lack and added to African Kingdoms, but I think Forgotten Empires also deserved that. To be honest, I was expecting that for a long time and it seems no chance for AoFE no longer.\n\nConlusion: I like this time and still supporting the project and spending money for it. But I also have to admit that when I compare the changes and lacks of it, the lacks seem more than improvements.","November 7, 2015","false","94.5"," 31 of 58 people (53%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","53","31","58","6","4"

The game lobby is laggy, games take minutes to start, if they do start at all.

They can let people post in that thread and seemingly do nothing to address it.\n\n\nI am all for expansions and new content, but not if the base game is not fixed.   I do realize many people are having no issues, but there seems to be a high number of people who are.\n\nIf you only plan on playing this single player then I can recommend it.   If you plan on playing multiplayer I cannot receommend it since there is a strong possibility it will not work for you and you won't be able to get any assistance or commitment from the developers to fix it.","November 7, 2015","false","3.9"," 33 of 62 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","33","62","0","5"

I've been trying for several minutes now to come up with something brief that would summarize why this game is the best, but I find that I am unable to. There's just too much. If I were to list all of the things that I like about this game, I would basically be making a list of everything there is in the entire game, because I quite literally like EVERYTHING about this game. The map types, the game modes, the civilizations, the buildings, the units, the technologies, the unique features of each civ, the artwork (256 colors have never been used so well) and of course, the scenario editor. The quality of the mod tools is fantastic, and if you browse online, you can find thousands of great multiplayer maps, full campaigns, and even heavily triggered scenarios that play out like RPG's or adventure games. This game does not support the higher resolutions that you're probably accustomed to, but it is still a great-looking game and of course the gameplay is still as great as it ever was. Highly recommended.","May 5, 2014","true","31.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

One of my most favorite games of all time. Unlike the majority of the reviews, Im gonna hit the highlights throughout the game, and not focus on "crashing multi player" like everyone seems to have issue with.\n\nOk, the best deal on Steam is the Age of Empires 2 HD with the DLC The Forgotten included. Ive played THOUSANDS of hours on an old disc, and have completed the majority of the original campaigns. Finally, I didn't play it much. It was just old and had lost some of that exciting thrill. But once I bought AoE2 HD with the Forgotten DLC, the game feels completely new again, as the new civilizations bring all new units, building style, campaigns, and that thrill of a new game.  Even with the original civilizations, and campaigns. This truely brings a real medieval town building experience, and it is quite easy to see people settling down somewhere, starting a town, and calling it Hungary...truely an experience to see what a medieval king had to go through.\n\nHere are the highlights I saw:\n\nPopulation limit increased to 500 to better build armies and navies.\n\nThe new civilizations make the game feel like its an all-new game, not a updated version of an old game\n\nThe campaigns have a more in-depth story to them in the game and in the story\n\nClicking on the characters to make them speak and sometimes have conversations in-game is a nice idea!\n\nCampaigns are SUPER challenging on standard difficulty(the easiest difficulty to choose from)\n\nIt also discourage's the use of cheat codes as NO Steam achievements are gained if ONE code is used.\n\nBeing able to play online WITHOUT cheat codes for proper strategy.\n\nMusic is awesomely epic!!!!!!!\n\nThings that could be good or bad, depending on your view:\nNo voice-over during the story reading before and after campaign levels, though if you had to pause during that, it saves the story till your not busy.\n\nThe multi player finding system. You just select the settings you want, it search's and you gotta hope it finds a game. If not, tough luck.\n\nDown part of the game:\n\nGame is LAGGY during multi player games cause my computer wasn't "connected" to my friends device and would cause lag. Felt a bit ripped off there.\n\nLag seems to be most when population limit is 500.\n\nA dirty word in-game. Its always been so clean and family-friendly(excluding Attila the Hun campaign and now the Dracula campaign) but I never did complete the Aztec campaigns either.\n\nThe price. It is ridiculous. I got it on sale during the Mid week Madness sale. But it needs to be lowered some. But you do get excellent game quality.\n\nOverall, excellent game, the battles are well balanced, unless of course you have 100 troops against 30. The 30 wont kill any of your troops, most likely. The civilizations are also well balanced, so all are strong as the other. Its up to you to maximize there power over the other and ultimately, the winner will be the best general/king/emperor ;) I'd suggest keeping multi player local until you have the grasp of the game or the lag disappears. For old, veterans, this is a whole new ballgame. For new players, buckle up for a wild ride through history!","August 4, 2014","true","306.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a remake of Age of Empire II: The Age of King and Age of Empire II: The Conquerors expansion pack reimagined in HD and now entirely as one single game. Everybody know what Age of Empire is unless you're really new to PC gaming, the game is a legend, was the best classic real-time strategy of that time.\n\nAll gameplay and features in this game is left untouched and are very exactly the same as the old Age of Empire II except for the new 500 population limit for skirmish play, let's you train even more units and having a larger battles and larger tactics than before.\n\nThe graphics has been improved slightly where you can see the new water and fire textures and effects are better than before. The new widescreen support for the game are also included. The rest still retain the same graphics as before.\n\nWell, the exact same gameplay and features could be the good or bad thing, because most people don't like buying things similar with what they already have, own or taste, but if you're looking for the old Age of Empires II in a new and better way then it is for you. All the story campaign, civilization is all there and the new Steam workshop integration is the best thing so you now can download many user created content ranging from maps, scenarios, AI scripts and many more to customize your game or create your own stuff and share it with everyone in the Steam community. I say this is a good remake, I recommend this. And by the way, I've been playing this game for over 6 years :)\n\nRating 10/10","July 9, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I wish I had Steam when I was younger because the amount of hours I spent on this game when it was released was unreal. I religiously played this game. It's also so awesome with some of the crazy ♥♥♥ cheats like "how do you turn this on" gives you a Shelby Cobra car that fires cannon balls like a machine gun. Nothing scares your opponents like 4 wheels of gunpowder madness. Cheats aside, this game is a fantastic city building RTS with an amazing tech tree and unique units to each of the different civilizations. For me it's always the Britons being an English lad of course. Nothing beats an army of 50 elite longbowmen with heated shot (fire arrows) upgrade. Also the fun part about playing a skirmish against computer opponent is the fact that they always seem to launch premature strikes on your base as like a 'provocative strategic manoeuvre', when really all they end up doing is getting completely mauled by the little army of archers/foot soldiers that you have been obtaining (alternatively they can keep sending ungodly amount of troops somehow 5 minutes into gameplay when you're just building your 3rd house and got about 3 farms up and running, and then slaughtering and griefing your tiny little village). Regardless of that nonsense, when you've fortified your city with walls and built 7 billion castles around the edges with a couple of watch towers dotted in between, you can safely start to build your mahoosive army which you then take on one massive campaign and dominate the AIs. Alternatively, if you're a sh-i-te commander then you'll have to end up going out with an army and getting them all slaughtered and then having to spend out resources and building another one. On the bright side there are achievements on Steam for getting your own units killed (such an incentive I know!). There are awesome formation settings and attack stances that separate you (an organised battle tactician) from the computer AI (naked blue body painted savages that throw all of their units and resources away).\n\nIt's always so awesome looking at the end of scenario report and seeing your stats sky rocket above the rest of the players.\nAs for online, I've never played online so find that out for yourself.\n\nBuy this game immediately because of reasons and because of a unit called a Petard (I know right) that you train in a castle and it's basically a medieval suicide bomber.\n\n20/10 - love this game","February 20, 2014","true","39.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It is a remake of Age of Empire II: The Age of King and Age of Empire II: The Conquerors expansion pack reimagined in HD and now entirely as one single game. Everybody know what Age of Empire is unless you're really new to PC gaming, the game is a legend, was the best classic real-time strategy of that time.\n\nAll gameplay and features in this game is left untouched and are very exactly the same as the old Age of Empire II except for the new 500 population limit for skirmish play, let's you train even more units and having a larger battles and larger tactics than before.\n\nThe graphics has been improved slightly where you can see the new water and fire textures and effects are better than before. The new widescreen support for the game are also included. The rest still retain the same graphics as before.\n\nWell, the exact same gameplay and features could be the good or bad thing, because most people don't like buying things similar with what they already have, own or taste, but if you're looking for the old Age of Empires II in a new and better way then it is for you. All the story campaign, civilization is all there and the new Steam workshop integration is the best thing so you now can download many user created content ranging from maps, scenarios, AI scripts and many more to customize your game or create your own stuff and share it with everyone in the Steam community. I say this is a good remake, I recommend this. And by the way, I've been playing this game for over 6 years :)\n\nRating 10/10","July 9, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've played it ever since it INITIALY came out in 1999. So bear that is mind.\n\nLets start up by comparing it to the original AoEII.\n\nThe base texture quality (Terrain, grass, snow, etc..) have not improved much. It still remain the same, but it still looks good if you ask me. There is no zoom option anyway so you can't study it real good anyway ;)\nBut the water texture have been updates, infact it's been upgraded compleatly. In the original game, the water was just like the ground, plain and flat. But here it's 3D (At least it's animated). It make the water more "Alive".\nThe Cliffs have also been updated from a brown desert like texture to a more gray stone color. Making it more neutral towards all types of maps (Desert, Grassland, Snow, etc...).\n\nOther thinks that the HD verion have is a more or less inproved options menu and not to mention Widescreen support.\nEveryone who played the original AoEII knows it only supported letterbox (4:3). Now it support all screen resolutions and aspects, big + from me.\n\nThe addition of Steam Workshop, Steam Play (And Achivements) are a big big BIG welcome to all of us.\n\nI have yet to toy around in the new Senario creator (If new at all). So no oppinion there.\n\nI like that they raised the max selected unit from 40 to 50 and allowed more than 200 units pr player.\n\nThe fact that they added the Forgotten Empires mod in as a DLC was cool as well. 5 more civilisations, 4 new Campaigns , new map size, new Techs, Capture the Relic, Twitch streaming support and a propper spectator mode. Not to mention treaties, which in my oppinion will help new players agains't better players while they climb the ranks and earn there stripes.\nOnly bad thing is that there is no voice acting in the new Campaigns, but that fine.\n\nNow, there are some issue i still have with the game itself. The pathing is still kindof broken. If you click on a pre-explored part of the map, the units will walk the correct way instantly instead of doing it on the fly as they explore more of the fog of war.\n\n\nNow, before you other veterans go buy this game. Remember that the system requirements have gone up quite a lot compared to the original. The graphical and memory requirements have gone up quite a lot (1 GB ram and 2 GB HDD). So be noted about that (Because I do get frame drops from time to time).","December 28, 2013","true","105.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Water and cliff graphics have been cleaned up a bit and updated but the look largely remains the same. The difference is that this game will upscale properly to a widescreen format.\n\nAt the time of writing, the current early access version has several glitches that actually cause framerate lag even in single player, but they're currently being worked out. Aside from this, the game is exactly how you'd expect it to be.\n\nLong story short, it's just the old king of RTS brought back with support for modern day matchmaking and display systems with no real gameplay changes.\n\nIf you played this game before and didn't like it, this updated version won't change your mind. If you did, then just pick this up and enjoy it with your friends just like back in the day without the fuss of setting up Hamachi or a reliable direct IP connection as you would for the original game.\n\nOn the negatives, matchmaking through LAN has been stripped out of the game despite this game having to be one of the biggest staples of LAN parties everywhere.

When your game crashes, you don't lose any ranking at all.\n\nThat being said though, this beautiful, well-crafted game only needs to maximize multiplayer security and robustness to fully ensure that every single minute you spend in multiplayer is just as good as playing the game yourself in singleplayer.\n\nThe new multiplayer system in servers have changed. Now there's two types of AoE II games that can be played; Original Game (Age of Kings + The Conquerors) and the Expansions (Original Game + The Forgotten + The African Kingdoms.)\nServers can now choose to either host these two AoE II games. HOWEVER, if you join an Expansions server, you are stuck to a LIMITED pool of civilizations to choose from, unless you own the Forgotten, or the African Kingdoms. I highly recommend that you buy this game in addition with at least one expansion pack in order to prevent restricted options in multiplayer; the selection pool EVEN limits Age of Kings and Age of Conquerors civs.\n\nOverall, it's a great RTS that shows historical values of the civilizations you play, providing the same, satisfying gameplay experience. However, it suffers from crashing in multiplayer games, and the fact that there's a limited pool of civilizations to choose from for people who join Expansions game servers, yet don't own any of the two expansions, hinders multiplayer experience for people who've already bought the original.\n\nMy favorite number is 30lololololol.","November 21, 2015","true","66.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The original game was so good, I don't even remember when I first started playing it from a DVD. I must have spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours since my first ever AoE II game. I still have my old DVD with the game.\n\nSo why do you need the HD Edition? I've tried and the original still works fine on my 1080p screen, so what's the point of buying a game if you already have it? If we don't count the much better graphics, the answer is the content. With the HD edition from Steam, it adds so much more interesting possibilities.\n\nFirst is the Steam Workshop. You can now download for free hundreds of maps, enhanced graphics or elements or even new troops and buildings.\n\nSecond, the DLCs. You can't add "The African Kingdoms" and "The Forgotten" DLCs to the original game without tinkering with the game. I prefer to pay a few dollars/euros to get it from here than trying to find it on some sketchy Reddit post.\n\nAnd last, but not least, the multiplayer games. Whenever I tried to go in a multiplayer server on the DVD game, I was directed to a Microsoft website that told me that they stopped supporting multiplayer battles. it is essential to try multiplayer and learn from some veterans, who know all the best tactics and some might even try to help you learn to play better.\n\nAs a conclusion, this is probably one of my most favorite games and I think that you would like it as much as me.","November 14, 2015","true","35.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've been trying for several minutes now to come up with something brief that would summarize why this game is the best, but I find that I am unable to. There's just too much. If I were to list all of the things that I like about this game, I would basically be making a list of everything there is in the entire game, because I quite literally like EVERYTHING about this game. The map types, the game modes, the civilizations, the buildings, the units, the technologies, the unique features of each civ, the artwork (256 colors have never been used so well) and of course, the scenario editor. The quality of the mod tools is fantastic, and if you browse online, you can find thousands of great multiplayer maps, full campaigns, and even heavily triggered scenarios that play out like RPG's or adventure games. This game does not support the higher resolutions that you're probably accustomed to, but it is still a great-looking game and of course the gameplay is still as great as it ever was.

It is a remake of Age of Empire II: The Age of King and Age of Empire II: The Conquerors expansion pack reimagined in HD and now entirely as one single game. Everybody know what Age of Empire is unless you're really new to PC gaming, the game is a legend, was the best classic real-time strategy of that time.\n\nAll gameplay and features in this game is left untouched and are very exactly the same as the old Age of Empire II except for the new 500 population limit for skirmish play, let's you train even more units and having a larger battles and larger tactics than before.\n\nThe graphics has been improved slightly where you can see the new water and fire textures and effects are better than before. The new widescreen support for the game are also included. The rest still retain the same graphics as before.\n\nWell, the exact same gameplay and features could be the good or bad thing, because most people don't like buying things similar with what they already have, own or taste, but if you're looking for the old Age of Empires II in a new and better way then it is for you. All the story campaign, civilization is all there and the new Steam workshop integration is the best thing so you now can download many user created content ranging from maps, scenarios, AI scripts and many more to customize your game or create your own stuff and share it with everyone in the Steam community. I say this is a good remake, I recommend this.

I used to play it all the time before the disc broke when I was younger, and my recent return to its beauty is a warm welcome. The HD graphics "update" doesn't really stand out to me, as it looks nearly the exact same. However, the exact same is good enough for me. The music fits the game like a hand in a glove, and if you're one who cares as much as I do about in-game soundtracks, this is THE most memorable music I have ever heard while playing a game. It stands out with its really unique approach to the how a game should sound, and listening to the entire 30 minute long epic (and that's only the base game soundtrack) while outmaneuvering enemy players is a dream come true.\n\nThe game itself still holds up extremely well in terms of variability even to this day. Its many different civilizations all offer something slightly different, both in terms of playing style and building style. The expansions for the game add on an almost ungodly amount of additional civilizations, which only furthers its flexibility. The game modes are relatively straightforward, and all very fun in their own way. My all-time favorite will forever be conquest, in which you must conquer all enemy players completely and decisively in order to win. The resource system in the game is perfectly executed, in my opinion. I believe it found just the perfect balance between simplicity and depth, as it is very simple to learn, but very difficult to master, hence the appeal from a shallow learning curve. The different branches of research are much more difficult to master, as they are plentiful and all useful in certain situations. You need to decide what is most vital at the moment, and work towards it (ex. advancing villager resource gathering speed or troop strength) while also juggling however many other tasks you can in order to keep a fluid overall movement and pace as the game progresses.\n\nThe workshop implementation for this game is simply a joy to browse through, as this game was just begging for it from the start. The map creator tool in game makes it possible for custom maps to be posted and downloaded by anyone, and the more open-ended game files allow for easier modding. Right now whenever i play the game, I am treated to the game of thrones soundtrack at the title screen as a result of a simple download from the workshop. Various available texture packs caringly created by the workshop members are really nice to try out, as they can add entirely different feels to the game as you play it. Beyond this, I can't think of much more to add about it, other than the fact that it greatly furthers this game's life expectancy in my games library.\n\nOverall, I can tell you that this game, no, this MASTERPIECE, is well worth the buy, and the constant discounts it offers should only entice you further to snatch this baby up.\n\nNeed I even add it? - 10/10","June 25, 2014","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When your game crashes, you don't lose any ranking at all.\n\nThat being said though, this beautiful, well-crafted game only needs to maximize multiplayer security and robustness to fully ensure that every single minute you spend in multiplayer is just as good as playing the game yourself in singleplayer.\n\nThe new multiplayer system in servers have changed. Now there's two types of AoE II games that can be played; Original Game (Age of Kings + The Conquerors) and the Expansions (Original Game + The Forgotten + The African Kingdoms.)\nServers can now choose to either host these two AoE II games. HOWEVER, if you join an Expansions server, you are stuck to a LIMITED pool of civilizations to choose from, unless you own the Forgotten, or the African Kingdoms. I highly recommend that you buy this game in addition with at least one expansion pack in order to prevent restricted options in multiplayer; the selection pool EVEN limits Age of Kings and Age of Conquerors civs.\n\nOverall, it's a great RTS that shows historical values of the civilizations you play, providing the same, satisfying gameplay experience. However, it suffers from crashing in multiplayer games, and the fact that there's a limited pool of civilizations to choose from for people who join Expansions game servers, yet don't own any of the two expansions, hinders multiplayer experience for people who've already bought the original.\n\nMy favorite number is 30lololololol.","November 21, 2015","true","66.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have played this game now for over ten years. My first encounter with AOE was in 2005, when I just started on school. They had the game installed on the school PCs, and it was the original age of empires.\n\nTen years later I discover Age of Empires HD Edition and are totally hooked. The game is MASSIVE. Although the game itself isn't so large, it can be played in hundreds of ways.\n\nYou can play with your friends, other people in the world, or with yourself and " the computer". When I get tired of my friends, I try against some unknown around the world. And when multiplayer is boring I start with singleplayer. So when even singleplayer gets boring, I start with multiplayer again, so there is a "vicious circle": P\n\nSo it does not look like I've played so many hours, but the hours I've played it on steam, is only a fraction. I played the original like crazy, but I will say that the HD version of the play is even better. They've added a little more and otherwise freshened up the game a lot and made it possible to play multiplayer over the Internet. And i know that the HD edition didn't improve so much, but I think it's great!\n\nLike i like to say: This game came first out in 1999, and have through, soon 2 decades been played.

The option to select real world maps is fun, and it runs smooth with very few bugs or glitches. The graphics improvement is mostly the water and fire, and not much else so don't expect a completely different looking game, but the graphics was probably the smallest improvement in this amazing remake. If you have not played age of empires I recommend you start with this one, by far the pinnacle of the series. There are also tonnes of campaigns, and if you finish them there is the new "forgotten DLC." So don't worry about running out of content in this virtually never-ending game there are also tonnes of civilizations to play as and dozens of play styles.\n\nIf you haven't got it I definitely recommend this remake of one of the greatest games of all time.","September 15, 2015","true","51.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The guy had lost so he just spammed that option, which opens a window that everybody has to respond to in the game before the game can progress.\n\nMost people playing it are fun-loving and just nostalgic like me though!  If you loved Aoe2 you'll have a good time in AoE2HD.","June 24, 2014","true","306.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

AOE2 captures your attention with its easy to use unit creation and the ability to create an empire that will ♥♥♥♥ your opponents ♥♥♥♥ up. or if your like me, lose everything and ♥♥♥♥ someone off by using one unit to rebuild it all and ram them from the back! get it, have fun with friends as you all join a multiplayer gangbang and may the best man get his ♥♥♥♥ kicked in first.","June 29, 2015","true","144.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

They've added new civilizations which is also a welcome move.\n\nThe new campaigns though lack the voice acting that made the original conquerors and age of kings feel more real.\n\nThe developers have removed local lobby which is a HUGE drawback of this game. You always end up playing online with someone with a moderate to poor ping. The number of players that are on multiplayer is dwindling quickly down to a trickle as of Sept 2014. Given this, the lack of local multiplayer is a major drawback I hope the developers will consider re-adding into the game.\n\nI am recommending this game purely because of the potential that it has and the hope that the developers are encouraged to continue development to improve the game, build a community of followers around it. This game has future potential and is a fun game to play offline.","September 4, 2014","true","539.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Excellent game, excellent update.\n\nAge of Empires is like what would happen if you made Civilization into an RTS.  You choose a civilization, then build and explore in typical RTS fashion.  As you construct buildings and units, you can advance into technological eras, which give you more things to build and research.  You can also contruct markets to trade with other cultures.\n\nThat about explains the concept of the game right there, it's a well-made RTS with a heavy Civilization influence.\n\nThis release, AoE2HD is interesting because this game was released and finished well over a decade ago, a sequel and spinoff were made, and it should have gone the way of most superceded games.  Instead, it was revisited and remade, designed to work on modern computers and look good on today's HD monitors, with the expansion and additional content merged with the game, similar to Paradox's release of Majesty Gold HD.  Unlike Majesty Gold HD, however, the update for AoE2 didn't stop at patching the game, development continues with a new expansion pack and active support.\n\nBasically this is a case of a developer bringing a game back from the dead successfully, because of the devotion of the fans, and it is a rewarding and refreshing thing to see.","August 29, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With the ability to have up to 500 men at one time you can build massive armies, with nearly no limit, and the new and improved Ai is great and unpredictable. The option to select real world maps is fun, and it runs smooth with very few bugs or glitches. The graphics improvement is mostly the water and fire, and not much else so don't expect a completely different looking game, but the graphics was probably the smallest improvement in this amazing remake. If you have not played age of empires I recommend you start with this one, by far the pinnacle of the series. There are also tonnes of campaigns, and if you finish them there is the new "forgotten DLC." So don't worry about running out of content in this virtually never-ending game there are also tonnes of civilizations to play as and dozens of play styles.\n\nIf you haven't got it I definitely recommend this remake of one of the greatest games of all time.","September 15, 2015","true","51.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is just as it was: excellent, seemingly balanced, and entertaining.\n\nThere's a "Save and Exit" spam trick to slow down the game's progress by about 20x that I was the victim of once.

I have played this game now for over ten years. My first encounter with AOE was in 2005, when I just started on school. They had the game installed on the school PCs, and it was the original age of empires.\n\nTen years later I discover Age of Empires HD Edition and are totally hooked. The game is MASSIVE. Although the game itself isn't so large, it can be played in hundreds of ways.\n\nYou can play with your friends, other people in the world, or with yourself and " the computer". When I get tired of my friends, I try against some unknown around the world. And when multiplayer is boring I start with singleplayer. So when even singleplayer gets boring, I start with multiplayer again, so there is a "vicious circle": P\n\nSo it does not look like I've played so many hours, but the hours I've played it on steam, is only a fraction. I played the original like crazy, but I will say that the HD version of the play is even better. They've added a little more and otherwise freshened up the game a lot and made it possible to play multiplayer over the Internet. And i know that the HD edition didn't improve so much, but I think it's great!\n\nLike i like to say: This game came first out in 1999, and have through, soon 2 decades been played. And when a game is still popular when it's 15-20 years old... AOE have to be a "good" game!\n\nAbsolutely 10/10 :)","December 26, 2015","true","105.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

Champions and ballista's.\nso i sent a lot of Paladins (full tech tree option) to counter his Champions and to quickly eliminate the ballista's. And he sends Halberdiers!\nI loved this constant thinking of what to counter but your enemy always being one step ahead of you!\n\nthen i made my own map!\nI loved making fortress maps for me to defend againts the AI in AOE 2. but the strategy that the enemy uses is really hard to comprehend in this kind of situation.\nI always turn off the Trebuchets because I flipping hate those things. and then the enemy comes to the gate of my grand city! with siege rams, lots and lots of siege rams. so i send my Kamayuks outside to deal with them. and you'll probably guess what was in the rams.... Arbalests and Champions... he countered my Kamayuks just because I went scouting with one earlyer in the match.\n\nThis game has it all. HD graphics, great campaign, great AI, lots of options and a sense of nostalgia..\nthank you Microsoft Studios (and all the other companies that I don't see just because I want to skip the video's in the begin and play my game)\nyou made one of my favorite games come to life again.\n11/10 it's awesome!","August 30, 2014","true","119.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A few more units, and civilizations. Steam just needs to drop the price. The HD graphics aren’t worth 20 dollars. But other than that.

This is the best Age of Empires game ever.\nBUT. There is a problem with this HD re-release - the base game runs better.\n\nThis is utter ♥♥♥♥ compared to the base game, and if this was not the best strategy game ever, I would not recommend it to you.\n\nIn an offline match (random map, campaign, etc.) there is a great deal of lag - so much, that you'd think you were playing with people living under the earth. Units glitch around. The frame-rate hovers at about 30 FPS and when you've got on-screen battles that involve MORE than 20 units, the frame-rate stutters below 20.\n\nPathfinding is broken and if you've got 3 villagers collecting from the same gold quarry, when they go to unload their collected resources, they will get stuck on each other until you manually control them. Units will attempt to take the shortest route to where you send them and they almost always get stuck trying to go a patch of trees, through a wall (even though there is an opening a few squares away), and military units will get stuck on enemy units, just sitting there - while getting attacked.\n\nAlso, hotkeys are recognized FASTER than the ORIGINAL 1999 GAME. You to press H (town center hotkey), shift+the hotkey to train a villager (so you train 5), and you get no villagers. You just get to the town center. This problem wasn't in the original game. When you use hotkeys to make villagers build things, (i.e. press B then whatever key to build whatever building), you get stuck on the build menu.\n\nAchievements are completely broken. You can only get them in a multiplayer game. But when you do somehow get achievements, you get an MVP award and a "razed 50 enemy buildings" award when you are ♥♥♥-rushed by the Huns and this activity causes players to go out of sync and you get bumped out of the game..... yeah.\n\nAnd this brings me onto the subject of multiplayer. The lag is terrible. Players go out of sync so many times, units sit around for about TEN SECONDS when you give them a command, and even if you're the host, you get horrendous lag - EVEN WHEN YOU START A MATCH WITH A 75 UNIT POP LIMIT AGAINST ONLY 1 OTHER OPPONENT.\n\nThese problems were never existent in the 1999 game, and this version feels like an unstable mod that I programmed..... with my ♥♥♥.\n\nWith all that said - I would not at all recommend you buy it. In a couple weeks, this all could change - those Microsoft ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s could get off their big, fat, greasy asses and address these problems, but we all know Microsoft - and their attitude towards fixing things, PC games, and Steam.\n\nLivid, is an understatement. I am utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that THEY SOMEHOW MANAGED TO F*** UP A RECIPE FOR UNTOLD RICHES. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO SCREW UP AN HD-RE-RELEASE. ALL THEY WERE GOING TO DO WAS UPSCALE THE RESOLUTION TO 1080p AND ADD MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT...\n\n10/10 for the original game\n1/10 for the re-release\n\n**Update as of 11/25/13**\nI haven't touched it in a long time but it's fairly playable now. Multiplayer netcode has improved, but then again i've mostly been playing with people who live near me or in the same house, so I can't say much about regional or global quality. Hotkey response has been messed with as well, which was a big issue because RTS games are mostly about the speed and proficiency at which you perform. Now I recommend it. Also there is the new Forgotten expansion which looks fantastic. Don't have it yet but definitely plan on buying it.","April 13, 2013","true","267.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goenni/recommended/221380/","goenni","♥go!tenni♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goenni/","503 products in account","In the year 2002, my cousin introduced me to Age of Empires II, a week after he let me play my first game, he handed it over to me and i played nonstop as a child. It's taken me a year to properly get aclimated with the HD Edition. So here's my thoughts.\n\nAge of Empires II is to least to say, not out-dated. The gameplay and mechanics are just as fresh as they were when the game first came out. It has a huge online following that keeps it updated with new maps and mods to play,  The online aspect has been smoothed out to make it easier with the inclusing of a matchmaking service, something that previously was messy due to a lack of offical online support after MSN Game Zone closed down. Hidden Path did a wonderful job here of taking such a old game and bringing it into the new generation.\n\nBut this isnt a game for everyone. You wont expect everyone to pick this up and enjoy it. Most games last over 30 minutes, some going into the 2 hour range. Devoting time to learning every civilization is key to knowing how to win every game you play. There is a single player that acts as sort of a tutorial that helps you get better over time. It's the same learning curve as in the past, outside of A.I games, there is no difficulty setting. Sometimes the A.I will dance around you, while sometimes 5 minutes into a match they will be at your gate with battering rams. It's a mixed bag, the bots could use a lot more work to make them act more human instead of rushing bases.\n\n\nPros\nThe ease of steam for multiplayer games, the matchmaking is spot on and can throw you into games without having to set up anything\nSteam Workshop intergration of maps, mods is excelent.\nWidescreen Support, High Resolution Support\n\nCons\nFramerate is extremely iffy to this day, at launch it was an unplayable mess, but now its at a stable rate.\nOutside of the population increase, no new additions to the game (minus The Forgotten, the 5 new campaigns are a welcome sight)\nThe Higher resolutions can create some issues with reading some of the text on screen, makes units also seem small compared to the world.\n\nPick this game up. You wont regret it or get bored with it. Play though the single player, play random map games, play online, get friends together and get a game going on a friday night","April 14, 2014","true","14.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

It was the first game I ever bought and owned for the PC.  I played a lot of this game, mainly singleplayer back in 2006, but scratched the CD a couple years later.  When I found it had been remastered on Steam I was quick to purchase myself a copy and have been playing both singleplayer and multiplayer since.  For those of you who used to own a copy like myself, I highly advise purchasing this digital edition, as it offers both the same nostalgic gameplay and a great strategic outlet.  The Forgotten DLC also gives you more to explore and adds even greater variety to an already extensive game.  I highly recommend this title, as it has quickly (re)become a personal favorite.\nFor those of you who haven't played Age of Empires before, it was one of the older RTS games dating back to the late 90s / early 21st century.  I'm surprised more people don't play it.  You are given a wide selection of civilizations with specific perks each, and try to race each other towards an objective, be it a Wonder Race, Deathmatch, or King of the Hill.  All of which are great fun!  What really stands out with this game is that there are hundreds, if not thousands of ways to win.  Granted, the mechanics may seem simple and outdated, but when trying to runn an entire empire with 200+ units against up to seven other players, every click counts as you try to out-maneuver, out-think, and out-micro your opponent.  The graphics may take a while to get used to, but what you really should look forward to enjoying is the satisfaction of wrecking the strong defenses of an enemy with allies or alone, and conquering lands one by one.  A great title, I also highly advise purchasing this for the newer community.","January 12, 2015","true","59.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/recommended/221380/","ajpos","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/","483 products in account","Age of Empires II is disputably the greatest RTS game ever made. The sheer variety of maps, units, technologies, and playable civilizations make it a force of its own, but the game attains premier status with its incredible map/scenario making tool, a killer campaign, well-balanced gameplay, and generous catering to multiple play-styles. Age of Empires II: HD Edition is not a remake, but merely a rerelease with a few changes, including widescreen support. Neverthless, the release was long overdue, and it is the one of the games I am most happy to have in my Steam collection. Disclaimer: this review is also for "The Forgotten" expansion pack.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Incredibly huge game with near-perfect gameplay and virtually timeless game mechanics. Many features of newer games are a tad hard to replicate, such as auto-explore,(hold shift to create waypoints then click on your map all over), but the game othwerise stands up to the test of time quite well.\n\n* Units, when grouped together, create tactical formations to your specifications. AOE2 was the first game to do this, and no game has yet done it so well as AOE2.\n\n* Greatly expanded and updated multiplayer options, including the treaty mode which gives a huge advantage for "turtle" players, a population limit of up to 500, and automatic ELO online rankings.\n\n* Steam Workshop support with active modding community, including HD texture packs.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Online multiplayer has noticeable but acceptable lag.\n\n* The achievements are WALLS of text that do not fit into Steam's mouse-over UI when checking on achievement progress. Here is an example of one of the longer achievements: "Over one hundred of your units were lost in this battle - even with such great losses, if they were well used against the enemy you did the right thing. Get used to studying the battle stats after each match with an opponent - did you have the right complementary mix of units? Did you make your enemy pay for every one of your losses? Every unit sacrificed is an opportunity to learn about your opponent."\n\n* I encountered a potentially serious bug where everyone's name switched to "[unknown]" and we all had to navigate by player-color. Chatting was very difficult.\n\n* The game is not FULLY steam compatible. The F12 key, which should take screenshots for Steam, loads the "save game" menu. This makes taking in-game screen-shots an annoyance.\n\n* No "military drag" feature, which allows you to select a group of units EXCEPT for villagers. This was first introduced in AOE3.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n* The game had a horribly messy launch which gave many people a bad first impression. Most bugs and glitches have since been fixed.\n\nThe verdict:\n\n* This is a must-buy for anyone who enjoyed the game when it was still in its hey-day. If you have not played it before, you may consider waiting until it is on sale (it is on sale for the worthy price of $14.99 at the time of this writing).","December 26, 2013","true","23.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Yup. How to learn about William Wallace? Look, here's something! Well, they're not entirely wrong. It does tell you about civilisations and some of the heroes associated with those cultures, and the single player campaigns somewhat emulate historical events in the game setting.\n\nReally though, you end up learning that Britons happen to have insane range so you can derpaherp build loads of archers, or the mayans have funny monks wearing skirts and feather caps that can convert an entire army, and that easiest and standard ai is easy, but moderate is actually pretty hard. And if you hate building houses, then why not be the huns? Also build lots of castles. You can never go wrong with castles.\n\nHonestly, this game can provide so much entertainment. As a strategy, you start with a town centre, and your aim is to advance as fast as possible.  You collect four different resources in order to do so: Food, Wood, Gold, Stone. You can choose different paths in order to win, and each game can be around two hours or less. Longer if you're going for a passive victory or want to build an absolutely huge army, or have a big world map.\n\nYou can win by killing everyone around you  in the end game with your amazing killing machines and units, killing them early game before they are able to advance far enough, collecting all the relics scattered around the world map and putting them into your monestary, or being the first civilisation to build a wonder, which costs a lot of resources. You also have other conditions for victory, such as regicide. Better protect your king!\n\nSometimes the logic in the game can be a bit off, such as the fact you use houses to increase your population limit, but you can't actually put people in houses to hide. Other than that it's an addictive game. There's something very satisfying building up your nation, successfully defending against others and reaching the end game where all the action really starts to happen. I know I've spent hours trying out all the different nations when I was younger, and playing with or against friends.\nA few issues I have with the game is that you can't select all your units if you have a very big army. Say you have fifty archers, you'll have to select three groups to move rather than the whole lot. Mix this with other types of units, and you find it's quite hard to direct everything when it comes to an attack. So lots will just be chilling out instead of doing anything.\n\nLooking for Idle villegers can be annoying, though you do have an idle button which will let you scroll through any of those slackers.\n\nAnd the amount of times I lost my scout because I couldn't spot them on the map after I directed them somewhere. So sad.\n\nI wouldn't mind an auto explore feature with the scouts, since there is sometimes so much to focus on, that you're probably going to end up with him chilling in some forgotten forest somewhere.\n\nPros\n\nAddictive\n\nDoes kind of give you a brief insight into history\n\nArchers are funny\n\nSo are monks (Wololo)\n\nOldie but goldie\n\nSheep and turkeys are the backbone of any nation\n\nCons\n\nKeep losing that stupid scout\n\nHard to control lots of units at once\n\nVisually hard to track things on the map, since you have to either scroll or click on a specific place, no zoom/overview feature. At least one that I'm aware of\n\nAi difficulty jump from standard to moderate seems a bit steep\n\nTL;DR\n\nOverall Verdict\nDefinitely recommend. I'm probably biased because I played this in my childhood. It's my precious. But anyone with a preference for fast paced strategy games, should give this one a look. It's a classic! (Do I even need to mention that?)\n\nIf you'd like to read more reviews from me, follow/join my steamgroup","November 20, 2015","true","26.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

Yup. How to learn about William Wallace? Look, here's something! Well, they're not entirely wrong. It does tell you about civilisations and some of the heroes associated with those cultures, and the single player campaigns somewhat emulate historical events in the game setting.\n\nReally though, you end up learning that Britons happen to have insane range so you can derpaherp build loads of archers, or the mayans have funny monks wearing skirts and feather caps that can convert an entire army, and that easiest and standard ai is easy, but moderate is actually pretty hard. And if you hate building houses, then why not be the huns? Also build lots of castles. You can never go wrong with castles.\n\nHonestly, this game can provide so much entertainment. As a strategy, you start with a town centre, and your aim is to advance as fast as possible.  You collect four different resources in order to do so: Food, Wood, Gold, Stone. You can choose different paths in order to win, and each game can be around two hours or less. Longer if you're going for a passive victory or want to build an absolutely huge army, or have a big world map.\n\nYou can win by killing everyone around you  in the end game with your amazing killing machines and units, killing them early game before they are able to advance far enough, collecting all the relics scattered around the world map and putting them into your monestary, or being the first civilisation to build a wonder, which costs a lot of resources. You also have other conditions for victory, such as regicide. Better protect your king!\n\nSometimes the logic in the game can be a bit off, such as the fact you use houses to increase your population limit, but you can't actually put people in houses to hide. Other than that it's an addictive game. There's something very satisfying building up your nation, successfully defending against others and reaching the end game where all the action really starts to happen.

Mix this with other types of units, and you find it's quite hard to direct everything when it comes to an attack.

And this re-release is no different.\nIt didn't take long, until I was spellbound once again. The gameplay is as intriguing as ever, and the music has aged well and perfectly fits the mood. Even the graphics still look great. The textures might not be as clean and sharp, but it's hard to miss the love and detail, that went into every pixel when played in HD.\n\nAchievements, Leaderboards, Matchmaking and Cloud support are a welcome addition together with the visual upgrade. The game even supports user created content over Steam Workshop.\n\nThe only complaint I have, is the main menu. I personally would have liked to see a bit of an overhaul, but it's nothing serious.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who played the original or any rts lover who has not done so.\nGo, buy now!!!!","December 6, 2013","true","3.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Here definitely lies the strength of the dev team. They insert themselves into the game seamlessly and feel like they were always part of the game. This adds a ton of replayability, because there are a lot of new strategies to explore, both in terms of playing and defeating them.\n\nOne of the main features advertised with the HD Edition was the "new and improved AI". Well... this is definitely not the strength of the dev team, in my opinion. The AI definitely is better than the one from the original game and definitely can be challenging, but it's still lacking in a lot of areas. Basically the biggest "improvement" is that it rushes. Really hard and in big numbers. This makes it really frustrating for beginners to get into the game. But when you can fend of the hordes of enemies and the big first attack, it becomes as easy as usual.\n\nWorth a (negative) mention is the multiplayer. It's unstable as ♥♥♥♥ and it doesn't seem to get better. You get unbearable lag and disconnects and when you think the game is running stable for once, you get an Out of Sync.\nThis, together with the amount of bugs the game has, some of them still from the release years ago, is pretty sad to be honest. I'm sure the dev team is doing their best to fix this... but that's just not enough at this point. I literally never had a multiplayer session without issues with this game.\n\nAll in all, I still recommend this game though.\nIt's still a lot of fun to play and the campaigns are great too. You can still put hundreds of hours into this game without even having to touch multiplayer once and if you don't like the new AI you can still play with the old Conquerors one.\nGet the game when it's on sale though, because paying full price is only worth it when multiplayer finally works better than it does right now.","February 12, 2015","true","576.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","4","6","5","0"

There are still several issues that are slowly, very slowly getting fixed via patches that are considerably spaced out.\n\n\nEdit 5/12/14:\nI've had this game since the day it came out, and in the past year and a month, the developers have made significant improvements to this game. One such being an actual attack move command, and various other things such as bug fixes. They released an expansion to the game, as well as many free campaigns. One of the best things about this game is the Steam Workshop which adds many useful mods or user-made campaigns and scenarios. I would still recommend this game, but I would wait for it to go on sale. There have been many sales in which AoEHD2 is $5, and with the expansion is $7.50 or somewhere around that price. Definitely worth waiting until this Summer for the sales, rather than spending $30-35 dollars in my opinion.","September 20, 2013","true","287.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For the most part, yes. Even the way they died is often accurate. It's mainly reenacting the famous battles during the middle ages, with you acting as the commander. There are some instances that aren't as accurate. The new expansion adds five more nations to the fold, effectively making it so there is twenty-three nations in total. Whereas the best part is that despite having the same generic units, and having only one or two unique units to each and their own.\n\nThe outcome of the battle can truly be decided with what technology and talents each and every civilization holds, and how much you use it to your advantage.. Where each civilization has four or five, maybe even six bonuses, one of those bonuses going to the team it's on, and itself. They have one unique technology exclusive to it's own nation, and one or two unique units depending on the civilization itself. Not only that these special units are powerful in their own field, but they're exclusive to your nation and anyone else being of the same nation. Therefore making it so the only way to get those units when not being of that nation is to convert them.\n\nEach civilization has it's own playstyle, defensive or offensive, no matter what, you need to use those traits to an entire advantage. On top of that, said civilizations have their own technology trees, which has some historical inaccuracy, sadly. Though these trees balance the game a little as well. Though when in control of a civilization, you need to know not only it's strengths, but it's flaws, and how to combat them.\n\n\nThe HD version changes actually, very little of the same, safe for graphics that were revised, the gameplay and controls were not touched one bit, therefore allowing any Age of Empires veteran to join in the fun.\n\n\nThe new expansion is worth it ,by adding more civilizations, technologies, and units to play around with. So with that, this game is good for those who love a historically accurate real-time-strategy type game. Where each and every civilization has those aforementioned strengths and difficulties.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Hit that green button.\n\n","June 21, 2014","true","245.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While I can't particularly get into the dated multiplayer(even though it has a "thriving" community), a good RTS campaign is always a great time filler.\n\nThe original game and expansion need nothing new said about them. They are classics.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some issues with the new Forgotten expansion. More like a set of fan campaigns, they feel decidedly less professional than the original campaigns. No unique voice acting, some strange choices that bring to mind old school questionable attempts at original Starcraft "RPG" maps(clicking on individual units to advance dialogue... really?), and just an overall tediousness to the design of the missions.\n\nAnd as a complete achievement ♥♥♥♥♥(though primarily on console) I would be remiss to not mention this game's ... um, let's say... "daunting"... set of achievements. Thousands of games played, tens of thousands of buildings lost(not destroyed by you, but LOST by you), etc. It's fairly ridiculous to say the least.\n\nIn short, the original game is amazing and worth picking up. The modern additions, not so enticing. Definitely worth playing, but if you have the original retail game sitting around like many people unless you just really feel like getting in some multiplayer on the title, stick with what you got. If you don't have the original or never played it, a definite buy.","August 19, 2014","true","117.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But then he walked me through the process of setting up a city, and it all came together. This was not the first RTS I've ever played, but once I got a hold of it, it was the first I could actually enjoy.\n\nThe game has aged remarkably well, and thanks to the relatively low graphics, it doesn't need a top of the line computer to run well. It does tend to lag during war sometimes, though, due to the amount of soldier AIs being active at once.\n\nIf you're someone who can figure out an RTS like this quickly, or you have a friend like mine to show you the ropes, I highly recommend this game.

There are still several issues that are slowly, very slowly getting fixed via patches that are considerably spaced out.\n\n\nEdit 5/12/14:\nI've had this game since the day it came out, and in the past year and a month, the developers have made significant improvements to this game. One such being an actual attack move command, and various other things such as bug fixes. They released an expansion to the game, as well as many free campaigns. One of the best things about this game is the Steam Workshop which adds many useful mods or user-made campaigns and scenarios. I would still recommend this game, but I would wait for it to go on sale. There have been many sales in which AoEHD2 is $5, and with the expansion is $7.50 or somewhere around that price. Definitely worth waiting until this Summer for the sales, rather than spending $30-35 dollars in my opinion.","September 20, 2013","true","287.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
