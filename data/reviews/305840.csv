While the game is fun as it currently is, it still needs some fleshing out and the inclusion of more content but that of course is to come in future updates.\n\nRight now, the biggest thing the game suffers from is the lack of game content which was not been implemented yet (however, the game still has a rather large amount lot of stuff to do at this point)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome notable things:\n-Excellent ship editor (while you cannot customize aspects of your ship such as the different segments, there will be modular ships that you can customize quite freely in the near future)\n\n-The UI has been changed and enhanced to be more user friendly while retaining all the intuitive and strategic information and elements (With courtesy of the community and their suggestions on how to improve the UI)\n\n-For an indie game with a small budget, the games graphics are top notch. Everything from the backgrounds to the little turrets on the ships have incredible detail and look amazing.\n\n-The game is incredibly well optimized despite being in such an early state. Unless you're running a commodore 64 then you will experience some fps drop, but only in the ship editor since that has some kinks to be worked out.\n\n-Music ain't no Han Zimmer but it's still quite catchy and very atmospheric, it's nice to listen to while you're fighting an enemy.\n\n-And while on the topic of atmosphere, the game's setting (space) has a beautiful amount of detail and the environment feels quite welcoming. Lots of color, very lively. It feels like space proper, but without the blandness that is so commonly seen in many space games today.\n\n-Combat is very fun to work with. The best comparison would probably be a total war in space. That is, you're lugging this big ships at other big ships but there is still quite a bit of strategy when it comes to handling your ships and positioning them.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere's a lot to look forward to but it hasn't quite yet reached it's highest point. Check out the roadmap for an overview of what's to come: http://shallow.space/roadmap/\n\nAlso check out http://shallow.space/the-setting/ for some more little details regarding the game (actually just check out the whole website: http://shallow.space/)\n\nIf you're on the verge of buying this because you believe it will fall prey to the eternal early access plague, then you should probably dispell your fears of that happening. While words from some random player may not be the most convincing, I can still truthfully say that the developer has worked diligently and unceasingly for a two years on his own and it wasn't until about 4 months ago that he finally got a crew to work on this game (and when he did updates came out like crazy). Right now we're getting huge content updates every 2-3 weeks and, unlike most EA developers I've seen, this guy gets updates out quickly and relentlessly. He's pretty passionate about his game and has not even shown any prospects of giving up on the game and letting it die during the two years he's been working with it. Full steam ahead and a lot of enthusiam coming from the guy. Probably the one early access developer you can believe in methinks","October 21, 2015","true","3.7"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","39","45","2","0"

Right now. Video review at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzwwVeWKwNc\n\nTL;DR: Do you like Rome: Total War? Do you like Homeworld? Then you absolutely must buy this game. Are you a fan of RTSs but never played Rome or Homeworld? Give it a try anyway. Are you a CoD or DOTA player who's never touched real time strategy? Buy it for the pretty spaceships and explosions. Basically, buy it.\n\nSo, what is it? In short, it's Rome: Total War in space. Line up armies, face them off against eachother. A campaign mode is coming, but is not here yet. It's so much more, as well; ship and fleet customization give it a whole extra dimension of depth above most RTSs. Nonetheless, it's very intuitive and feels incredibly responsive.\n\nThe good:\nGraphics and UI are beautiful and very well designed\nThe UI, while not typical of RTS games, is impressively intuitive. I went from "how do I move" to feeling like Ender in  about ten minutes, WITHOUT a tutorial. The Tab-key locking and simple move queuing makes complex strategies a joy to plan and execute.\nThe UI again - it's so good, it deserves another entry. With such a complex game to control, and what with not being finished yet, the game could be forgiven for being confusing and hard to learn, but it's not. In addition to what I've mentioned, the game slows when planning moves or when enemies are first detected, giving you the chance to think a little more about strategy - very important for new players.\nThe music. I'm not sure if it's dynamic or not, but it's highly appropriate, highly atmospheric, and greatly enhances the immersion.\nThe fleet maneuver dynamics. Watching an entire flotilla wheel around and steam head first into the enemy, guns blazing, might not be the most astute strategy, but it's certainly impressive. Even just flying a fleet around in space is fun.\nThe bad:\nThe most obvious first: It's not finished. There is no campaign mode and no tutorial. There will be - the buttons for them are there - but they aren't implemented yet. Honestly, I don't think a tutorial is really necessary, but I for one will be happy to see the campaign mode.\nMinor gripes in re: not being finished yet: I'd like to be able to move the camera by clicking on the minimap, and a few other things like that, but really who cares? It's Early Access. They'll fix it.\nA few observations:\nWhen I first started up a skirmish, I didn't realize it was fully 3D. I accidentally held down the left button during a move and saw the prediction line shoot up into the void, and I thought, "I could really get lost out here." That's a great thing, in my book: a space game that really gives a good idea of the vastness of space.\n\nI run Linux - an unsupported version, no less - and the game runs flawlessly. I do appreciate that effort from the devs.\n\nConclusion:\nBuy it. Just buy it. It's only $15, and it's already an incredible game - and it's certainly not going to get worse as Early Access goes on.\n\nEDIT: Yes, I posted this review after playing for about 30 minutes. The game really is that easy to pick up.","April 3","true","4.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

Being able to customize your ships in both appearance and loadouts is a great feature. The visuals are certainly stunning, from the ships to the skybox, there is lots of eye candy outside of just the explosions.\n\nThe drawbacks are that there is not a whole lot to do at the moment, meaning the single-player campaign is not in place, no Multiplayer, and the ship selection is still fairly small. Of course, these things are all planned features, but the level of communication and activity level from the devs shows that they are committed and passionate about finishing the game.","October 21, 2015","true","2.4"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","19","24","2","0"

The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the ships beautiful, and the atmosphere being built around in te Shallow Space universe is totally indepth.\n\nShallow Space, even in its current iteration is gently, but surely scratching that itch, left by Nexus.","December 21, 2015","true","2.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

But, although I am unfamiliar with the genre, I can tell that Shallow Space is aiming to be something unique.  Most importantly, the game is in early access, but the developers are very active on their website and on Steam, and respond to almost every post; whether it be feedback, praise, criticism, or just general questions.\n\nDisclaimer: This part of the review is about the game as of 22, February, 2016, and will likely change with further additions/changes to reflect the current state of the game.\n\nAs for the gameplay, currently it is all about outfitting your ships and building up your fleet to send into battle.  Right now, there are a few Skirmish matches and a simulation mode, which allows you to test out your custom or generated fleets and flotilla configurations against a similar fleet of AI.  You can choose to mirror your exact fleet for the enemy to see how well you perform with certain ships, and possibly see how the AI uses them to better advantage.  There is a lot of depth to how the ships can be set up and positioned, as you have a fully traversable 3d environment.  Plotting the courses for your ships to take is a dream and even at this very basic level of functionality is quite intuitive to use.\n\nThe ship design is gorgeous.  There is a ton of detail in the models, and the visuals for the backdrops are similarly amazing.  You can customize every ship in your fleet with various kinetic and energy based weapons, outfit them with extra generators for more power, deeper scanning radius, and you can issue further commands from Carrier or Capital class vessels, such as deplying smaller Corvettes or issuing focused-fire commands.  Future updates will include resource gathering and station building/management, added depth to ship shields and weapon mechanics, and much more.\n\nThere are some crashes and a few bugs here and there, but for Early Access the optimization is great and it runs really well.  Most negative reviews on Steam are from user-error through interface malfunction or bug related issues, but much of that seems to have been corrected by now.\n\nThe developers have some amazing things planned for this game, and they are very passionate about making it as good as it can possibly be.  A planned feature is to let you take executive control of your ships in battle, and to expand the current skirmish style gameplay into a more open-world one.  If you like space games, and you want to command a massive fleet of warships either to engage in all- out tactical 3D combat, or if you just want to  SEND THEM ALL TO DIE....then this game is definitely one for you.","February 21","true","9.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027897585/recommended/305840/","76561198027897585","Sazuroi","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027897585/","91 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI had decided to back this game before it entered early access, based on the old demo, interaction with the developers, and the idea itself. As a reminder, the game sets out to create something of a hybrid between Nexus: The Jupiter Incident and Homeworld. To achieve this, it builds around "squads" of spaceships commanded by officers that will gain RPG stats and progression later, adding special abilities and deep customization to the mix, and aiming for an expansive, strategy map-driven narrative campaign.\n\nOf course, we aren't there yet. At the currents stage of development, the name of the game is instead bug-hunting in the skirmish mode and customization hangar, which offer somewhat limited functionality, but definitely enough to determine the mechanics and decisions the game will be based around. Reaction of the developers to bugs reported on the forums are prompt, with many bugs fixed in the next update, which come in every week or two, and also add more ships and modules to play with. Currently, the tally stands at 3 hangar-stored shiptypes - light through heavy corvettes - 3 cruisers - also light through heavy, for variety - one battlecruiser with one more to be added in the next update, this class boasting heavier weapons, such as a fast-firing centerline gun on the Pleiade's Homan class, two battleships, light and medium and one carrier.\n\nEach of those ships offers several slots for weapons and equipment, and different strengths and weeknesses, somewhat dependent on the faction that constructed it. The bulk of the current selection is the sleek, elegant designs of the Pleiades Corporation, with the battleships hailing from the Mineral&Fusion Corp and being decidedly blocky, and the third corporate faction, Incorporated (^^) currently in production for their modular designs, with eleven modules for the cruiser-size alone. All this information is also available on the game's blog (http://shallow.space/blog/) and actively discussed in the forums (http://forums.shallow.space/).\n\nWhile the game is addmittedly in its infancy - alpha stage, in fact - it runs smoothly and crashes are typically around transitions, with the most easily triggered ones already fixed and work progressing on the rare others. While the selection of combat scenarios is small and map scripting limited so far, the combat is fun and proceeds apace, even though balancing is only scheduled for when more assets are placed. The railguns really need to be buffed, for example XD (inside joke).\n\nThe developers are also eminently approachable, and while they have a set concept, they are willing to listen to user suggestions and discuss their decisions. Production of ship models and coding are currently progressing side-by-side, and for an independent, largely self-financed project, the speed and even more so the quality achieved is quite respectable - and this is by no means the final graphics, many effects are still simplified, with the goal being the sort of stunning vistas space games are known for.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is understandable that some people may not want to buy the game at this mostly skirmish and ship configuration testing-stage and join the hunt for the remaining bugs, the price is low enough to easily gain entrance now and only play extensively once the beta hits, and the options become more complex and the tactics more varied. The campaign, though, will have to wait until release, to preclude spoilers - but some tidbits of story are on the blog as well.","December 19, 2015","true","9.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Even though the game is only in early access at the moment the devs are frequently updating and adding to the gameplay experience. This will doubltessly be a game for anyone who is looking for a space RTS that has depth and customization.\n\nPros:\n- Devs are very active interacting and taking community feedback - they're also plugging away at this game basically every 2 weeks a big update hits in the Alpha so far\n- Customization of ships is pretty awesome a good number of modules to choose from that can really vary a fleet\n- GRAPHICS!!! I'm not normally a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ but the ships and the enviornements are beautfully rendered. Even little things like shield resisters lighting up when a ship gets hit blow me away especially considering the game is only in Alpha\n- The Devs also have a pretty clear roadmap so you should have a pretty good idea of what the game will include which is nice considering sometimes Early Access games offer a lot of vague promises\n\nCons:\n- Not every system is in the game you might say duh its a EA title, but it does leave for less replayability than the beta or of course the final product will have\n- only 1 of the 8 factions that will be in the game is playable right now\n- Some systems aren't clearly explained as I'd like (tooltips)\n\nOverall it is shaping up to be a great game!

It is amazingly polished to still be in Alpha.  The control scheme may be the best of any full 3D environment space fleet game I've ever played.  This developer clearly knows what he's doing!  Worth buying in its current state.","April 30","true","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I'll advice you not tu buy, but keep a close eye for further updates, or jump in and support what looks like a promising game.\n\nAs allways, I apreciate the GNU/Linux support.","May 25","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not only can you change the color of each ship you enlist in your military force, you can also choose their loadouts in terms of weapons, sensor equipment, shield enhancements as well as energy modules. So you have fun blast away your feeble foes and look good doing it.\n\nUNLEASH THE PINK BATTLESHIPS!!!\n\nSpace combat feels very much like nothing I've seen in a space game. It's a beautiful mesh of homeworld ship scaling and Nexus the jupitur incident's combat manuevers, when the capital ships engage they are constantly flying and zipping around it's target dealing damage while fighters fly around with guns ablazing trying set its enemy ablaze! It's very easy to get lost in the beauty of it all.... until you notice that huge explosion at the corner of you screen was your best battleship.\n\nExploration is an amazing thing to see in a game like this. I thought it was going to just be like a traditional rts but instead, it's going to also have 4x elements to the game! Having a persistant fleet and traveling the stars in search of glory sounds like a joyride in my book.\n\nAs for the cons the most obvious one is that since it's early access you will run into some bugs here and there. Now the one I see a lot are nervous buyers that like what they see but feel a cold shiver go down their neck once they see the tag "Early Access", I too also dread to see that tag as well. Also theres no multiplayer and I'm also not sure if it will be implemented since it's primarily a singleplayer game. so you could either wait for release for the game or hop in ready to help make this game become one of the best space games on the market, your choice.\n\nMe? I'm blowin up space nerds with my pink battleships :)\n\n10/10 would fire all Lazors again","April 10","true","13.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"
