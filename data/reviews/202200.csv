You are leader of a small but prosperous empire, controlling roughly two dozen small star systems.  You and your allies have been at war with the most powerful civilization for years, and you've managed to gain the upper hand.  A long and costly war has cost you several star systems and most of your fleet.  Finally, they agree to peace.  You sign the papers, and begin to focus on internal affairs.\n\nAs you check your intelligence briefings, you notice that another empire has been building up their military.  Significantly.  As it stands, the Yor have four to five times as much firepower as the rest of the nations put together, as well as a much larger population.  They begin to greedily prey upon the weaker nations, demanding tribute or conquering them.\n\nYou halt all social and military production, and begin pouring all of your resources into your R&D projects, developing weapons and shields specialized to counter the growing threat.  One by one, your allied nations fall to swarms of powerful Yor ships.\n\nAfter the research had advanced sufficiently, you empty your coffers and upgrade your small fleet, and purchase some additional cruisers.  You position your fleet on the Terran-Yor border and wait.\n\nIts time.  Your destroyers flash across the border, seeking out the numerically superior Yor fleets and engaging them.  Terran ships begin to explode, but the Yor are technologically inferior, and they explode faster.  War erupts across the galaxy as civilizations pick their sides.  A galactic conflagration begins.\n\nBehind your destroyers, fleets of heavily-escorted troop carriers descend onto Yor worlds, crammed with billions of troops.  Tens, then hundreds, of billions die as your begin to inch your way towards the Yor homeworlds.  Your war machine keeps turning, producing dozens of sophisticated warships.\n\nEventually, Icos itself falls.  You survey your vast empire, won with the blood of countless billions.  Your huge fleet dwarfs all others.  Your allies are afraid of you.  You've positioned fleets on all of your borders, backed up with troop ships.\n\nThen you realize: you've become what you set out to destroy.\n\nThis is Galactic Civilizations.","March 2, 2014","true","155.7"," 688 of 703 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","688","703","0","21"

Memories...\nI sank so, so many hours into this game. I owned it on CD before losing them and having to buy it again on Steam. And then sank in some more hours, for good measure.\n\nSo, what makes this game awesome? It's often compared to Civilization, but in space. Yeah, that sounds about right... but it's not totally true either. See, GalCiv has many things Civilization does not. Unique tech trees for every race: check. Unique gameplay for every race: check. Being able to customize every single ship: check. That's right, no Warrior vs Warrior here. You can build your ships however you like with the ship builder and put whatever weapons, armour, modules and engines you damn well like.\n\nThe political system is also well tought-out and doesn't feel out of place. Want a bigger economic bonus? Go Star Democracy! But what's that? Oh yeah, we're a democracy now, I can't just declare war on a whim... Alright then, let's ask what the parliament thinks. They approve? Oh yeah, let's kick some alien butt, baby! (If your approval is too low, good luck getting your people to follow you into war.

This is about as good as you're going to get when it comes to the 4x genre and is pretty much Civilization 5 in space but better and with its own ship designer. There is an extremely large amount of techs, buildings, weapons and so on so yeah a lot of variety. Even the ship builder is well developed as you can build a ship anyway you like and equip it anyway you like based on the technology you have availible.

It strikes an incredible balance between providing large-scale epicness and surprisingly robust micromanager's playgrounds.\n\n**While micromanager's playgrounds are not uncommon in modern games, it's exceedingly uncommon for a game to include them sporadically enough that they don't become tedious obligations and yet give them enough weight to make them worthwhile and rewarding. You can go an entire game without ever creating your own ship if that's not your cup of tea--but boy is it ever satisfying to wreck other civilizations with ships you designed.**\n\nGCII is such a vast, epic game it'd be a bargain at twice the price. It's got a bit of a learning curve, but dive right in with a custom scenario and learn by doing until you master the incredible depth and number of facets to it--it's way easier than doing the tutorials. Then, like Civ games, sit in stunned silence when you look up and realize that you've been playing for 13 straight hours.

I've enjoyed it a lot, and for some reason a big title or two will come out and I'll eventually forget about galactic civ. for a while, and then eventually  I'll stumble upon it... always surprised by how much I enjoy playing it, time and again.\n\nIt lacks some of the graphical 'bells and whistles' of a Civ-type of turn-based strategy game, but as any player of ck2 knows, what a game lacks in polish can be very much made up for in actual game content and replayability. The depth of galactic civ (and ck2, for that matter) makes civilization look like simplistic child's play (unplayable to me, as a by-product) in comparison.\n\nDistinctive differences/cool elements of the game:\n\n- Skill trees are actually unique to every race.\n- fully customizable ships (designing ships became one of my favorite elements of the game early, to my surprise).\n- plot/narrative elements that differ game-to-game, making it very replayable.\n- Races themselves are fully customizable, adding another layer of replayability and depth to the game's customization.\n\nOn the downside, it has many layers of things to control and 'develop,' so to someone coming to this from civ or simpler games of that nature, galactic civ could be daunting, by all means, even overly so. This is a game for a real turn-based strategy-lover, who wants to have a depth of 'control' that might be beyond the average gamer, whoever or whatever that even means...?\n\nI'd say for a strategy-lover (someone who likes games like ck2, europa universalis, etc.) it's a must have regardless of price (I don't think it's more than $20, this far from publication). If you're a civilization/spore lover and you're worried this might go a little too deep and not have the 'sheen' you look for in a game, wait for it to go on sale, as it does every so often, and get it for $5, and give it a shot; Who knows? The developers clearly labored over it with love, and put in a lot of good work in making a very fine game (as I see it).","April 23, 2014","true","69.4"," 93 of 103 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","93","103","0","10"

You can even create your own Civilization, however the downside is that you have to use template portraits of galactic leaders both big and small.\n\nThe AI is very well done, you can really see the differences between the lowest diffculty setting to the highest. However, the downside is that it will either handicap them or the player. depending upon what setting you want to go with. The combat system is pretty straight forward "The more capable you are, the better results".\n\nAlso this game offers an indirect warning to players "don't expand too early or quickly" sure it will help your civilization get resources and such. But however you have to constantly manage the planets you colonize and later on, as the game progresses it will become incresingly diffcult to do anything.\n\nEvents in the game are usually recycled or "important" events but they either happen once or not at all. The story mode is pretty good for a space game, but by the end of it all, you just want to play the game itself and not any story\n\nLastly, there are no mods for this game, no matter what anyone tells you.\n\nI would recommend this game for players who love civilzation games and love space games","December 10, 2014","true","38.8"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","49","53","2","0"

With these ships they can explore and exploit the universe and it's diverse offerings, colonize new planets, meet opponents and friends, fight pirates and other threats, build starbases, or conquer opponent's planets.

This might be an obvious comparison, but in my mind that is only partially true. The first obvious difference is that in space there are no tactical advantages to be had from terrain. Another huge difference is that in Galciv you can actually design your own units. And the tech tree is much bigger, and also forked. That means that at any time you can choose from many different technologies to research, while in Sid Meier's Civilization your choices are limited.\n\nWhat all that means to me, is that Galciv feels more like a 4X GRAND strategy game. The scope is more epic, you have way more freedom, and games generally take a lot longer. The trick here is to realize that you cannot learn to play this game without reading it's (excellent) manual. There are so many game concepts to wrap your head around, that in your first game you will probably feel like a headless chicken running around. In the second game you will have some understanding of all the concepts, and you'll start to experiment a little, e.g. with ship design and planet specialization. Upping the difficulty is not recommended for your first few playtroughs.\n\nI tried Galciv III for a few hours and I don't see any improvements over this older version. Quite the contrary in fact. I would recommend this version II Ultimate Edition over version III in a heartbeat. This is such a solid, balanced, epic and well thought-out game, that one wonders why they had to make a new one in the first place...","May 2","true","133.8"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Specifically, I love playing 4X games on the largest possible map with the maximum number of opponents and the highest density of resources (in this case planets, stars, asteroids and other celestial bodies). I play 4X games this way so I can shape the game-world to my liking. Unfortunately, that is impossible in this game.\n\nBecause this game was developed as a 32 bit application, its VM maxes out at 2GB. This is a huge problem. After a 100+ turns (sometimes fewer) the game will crash because it runs out of VM. I tried a 4GB patcher on the application with no luck. I did manage to get a game past 500 turns by playing on the very lowest graphics settings but, after a point I still encountered the VM crash.\n\nI suppose my biggest mistake was buying this game on Steam. From what I've read, it appears that using a 4GB patcher will work on the GoG version but, not on the Steam version. If you enjoy playing massive 4X games that last for 100s of hours/turns--don't buy this game unless you are willing to pick it up on GoG and patch it to use 4GB of VM.","May 20","false","370.7"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","9"

Today I decided to finally see if it lived up to the hype.\n\nFirst, I had to create a Stardock account. I didn't have to validate the e-mail address to start playing, so I suppose I could've just entered a fake address. Seems like completely pointless DRM. (I mean, even moreso than usual.)\n\nAfter I finally got to start playing the game, it turned out to basically be a clone of Master of Orion 2. It has a few extra gimmicks (like having to choose the location for each planetary construction), and the interface is much, much worse. I built an asteroid mine, and then tried to select it, but no matter where I clicked it selected the mining ship instead. I had to move the ship to a different asteroid in order to see where the mine was sending supplies.\nSpeaking of moving ships, for whatever reason, instead of ship movement being planned during your turn and happening when you advance time, ship movement happens during your turn as soon as you right-click on a destination. There's no way to undo movement (as far as I know), so if you accidentally right-click, you've wasted a couple turns of movement for your active fleet. Also, there's apparently no way to not have an active fleet.\n\nEventually I wanted to see if there were any keyboard shortcuts I didn't know about. The options don't have a keybinding menu, so I tried to check online. That's when I learned that GalCiv2 breaks the Steam Overlay. The Steam version was released over three years ago, and they still haven't fixed it?\nAfter closing the game so I could open a web browser, I checked to see if there was some way to get the Steam Overlay working. What I found was a thread in the Stardock forums where someone asked how to fix it, and the game's community descended on them like a swarm of piranha. Apparently, like EA and Ubisoft, Stardock has its own Steam knockoff. They also have a rabid fanbase that practically worships the developers. Put those two things together, and you've got a forum full of crazies calling for the developers to sabotage the Steam version to try to drive people to use the local knockoff.\nThat killed off the last bit of interest I had in the game.\n\nMy personal recommendation would be to buy Master of Orion 1+2 from GOG instead. Better games at less than half the price, and no DRM.","July 4, 2015","false","0.8"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","3"

Galactic Civilizations II manages to continue on those footsteps with it's own twist.\n\nI remember playing this one back in the days, a lot. The hours I have on this title here in Steam aren't actually truthful in that regard. However just recently I started playing GalCiv II again, and it still hooks me in like a happy salmon. Even after all these years the graphics are still "ok", as at least I didn't feel distracted by it from the gameplay. And oh boy what gameplay it is.\n\nIt's your basic space empire simulator with managing colonies, building space stations, trading and diplomacy with other empires, building fleets of spaceships and watching them explode in hails of über-deadly weapons fire of the future. There are a lot of little twists around this main concept though. You can design your own ships, not just the loadouts but also their outlook to a surprisingly great detail. The technology tree and decisions you take incorporates some rudimentary ethics, and you can steer your empire towards good, neutrality or evil and receive technological advances accordingly.\n\nThere's a storyline campaign which I haven't managed to ever finish, I guess it's a nice attempt of creating content. However free-for-all type random play is what this game excels in my opinion.\n\nThere have been quite a few mentions of bugs and crashes in the reviews, but I haven't noticed any such behavior except when alt-tabbing to windows from the game.\n\nA minor point is also that you will need to register your game at some Stardock service - give them your email address and game key - to be able to play the game. I know this can upset some potential players, and I agree it's a stupid remant of ages past. However at least for myself the registration process took less than a minute and I've never received a singly spam message from Stardock.\n\nAll in all, well worth it if you're into the 4x genre and can see past the slightly dated graphics and UI.","January 18, 2015","true","23.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Yes, addictive in that terrifying, inescapable, "just-one-more-turn" way. Galactic Civilizations II is what you get if you take Master of Orion II, expand it so that the galaxy, tech tree and ship customisation are roughly a hundred times as huge without ever becoming boring, bump the graphics up to a standard still respectable today for a TBS, give each civilization some serious make-or-break differences (hint: the Drengin and the Yor almost always end up dominating most of the galaxy that ISN'T YOU), and shove it out there to give almost every other space-based TBS a serious poke in the eye.\n\nGalactic Civilizations II, made even better by its two expansions Dark Avatar and Twilight of the Arnor, allows you to build up a massive, sprawling interstellar empire, then throw the universe into chaos by stomping rough-shod all over everybody else's massive, sprawling interstellar empires. Each race has its own personality which helps (or hinders) it in its dealings with its various neighbours. Depending on your chosen path, your ethical choices, your research direction and your custom ship designs, you can choose peaceful, violent, subversive or a combination of methods to conquer a galaxy with a large number of customisation options. Galaxies can range in size from miniature star-cluster sized affairs which can be overrun in the space of an afternoon to immense beasts that will probably take weeks to complete a game on. You can pick and choose who shares these galaxies with you; decide how frequent habitable planets will be; choose the difficulty level and the rate at which technologies are researched, and several other options which make each galaxy a unique one. Stars and habitable planets are all renameable for a truly Make-Your-Own-Galaxy experience.\n\nGalactic Civilizations II is also still receiving updates from its developer Stardock. The most recent of these seems to have fixed the occasional crash-to-desktop errors which previously occurred, although oddly enough the newest NVidia drivers on Windows 10 seem to generate an "out-of-date driver" error on startup. This error however has no effect on the game itself, which still runs flawlessly on my machine.","March 15","true","100.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Getting to grips with the game, and realising that while on the surface it looks simple as you start to look and prod there is much more to the game.\n\nI somehow managed to corner the market on diplomatic translators, which meant no other Civilization could make them - so only I could make and trade them! Nice! Then I discovered the Ship Creator tool in the Shipyard, which allows you to design your own ships. Oh man.\nThe trading and diplomacy looked fairly straight forward, then I was invited to the UP for a Galactic Council vote, which I thought was a nice addition.\n\nI think what gives this game a mark of 'good' for me is that I had played for 2 hours and not realised it. Going in a thought it would be a 'time sink' game, and it is, yet it's fun to play. IF I do manage to 'win' at this game, I'll keep it installed and play it again. I have a feeling there's a decent mod community out there, and can imagine that there are plenty of community designed races and ships to use.\n\nIf you enjoy empire building games, don't mind time sink games, and think you can lead your own alien race to glory... this game is for you.","January 2, 2013","true","14.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

This is definitely not a bad thing and Galactic Civ II expands on the formula in interesting ways. Rather than just unlocking new units, new technologies unlock new ship parts that you can use to design your own ships. Want a slow moving transport with tons of armor? Build it. Want a super fast fighter that can zip across the galaxy and deal out damage but goes down in one hit? Go for it. I really enjoyed this aspect of the game and found that it made combat very rewarding.\n\nAnother great aspect of the game is the fantastic AI. I really got the sense that the AI players actually know how to play the game and aren't successful just due to unfair bonuses, as is sometimes the case in 4X strategy games. This is important because the game completely lacks multiplayer, which is a strange omission, even with the age of this game.\n\nOverall, it's a lot of fun to just start a random map and begin conquering the galaxy. There are lots of different victory conditions and lots of strategies for pursuing them. I won with a mix of military strength and focus on culture to win an influence victory, but was simultaneously pursuing an ascension victory, which requires capturing energy from ascension crystals scattered around the map.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't find the campaign very fun or interesting. All missions seemed to rely on military strategy alone but didn't even start you off with military technology. The result was a slow and clumsy build up to a strategy-less conflict. I spent the majority of my time in the sandbox mode, as I expect is true of most players.\n\nPresentation\nBoth the art and sound in Galactic Civ II is good, but not great. It's all fairly standard sci fi fair and feels pretty derivative and uninspired. These aren't very important aspects to me in a turn-based strategy game, so I was happy to play while listening to my own music. Presentation is definitely a major differentiating factor between this game and the Civilization series.\n\nOne good aspect of the presentation is that the parts you use in building ships actually animate differently, with shields and weapon systems having different effects during battle.\n\nAlso, don't expect much in the way of a riveting story.\n\nOverall\nI really enjoyed my time with Galactic Civilizations II and it really does hit that "one more turn" paradigm. If you are looking for a space-based 4X strategy game, Galactic Civ II will definitely scratch that itch and you can have a lot of fun building up your empire","May 23","true","11.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Plenty of ways to win, you can build alliances with other factions. There are large factions and smaller sub factions.\n\nI will however admit there is definitely a learning curve, and it does't help that there is LOTS of micromanagement required. And when your empire starts expanding, the turns will take longer and longer and longer as you check every ship and planet and ensure that they are doing as needed.

It's not like such strategies even require much finesse; diplomacy will get the job done on any difficulty level, so long as you specialize in it and spend vast amounts of real life time doing it. War isn't that much more interesting than peace, either, due to the lack of tactical combat or sophisticated ship design.\n\nThe ship design system incorporates a lot of meaningless cosmetic elements to try and disguise its fundamental shallowness. Ignore all of the aesthetic stuff and underneath you'll find a very basic system without any art to building a good ship. Just put on the defenses and weapons that counter what your enemy has and that's it. Due to the lack of tactical combat, ships will all fight the same way no matter what kind of weapons they're armed with.\n\nEconomic management is tedious and ultimately irrelevant in face of the fact that, if you're using a peaceful strategy, you can ultimately build whatever you want and then get the AI to pay for it using the diplomacy system.\n\nI'd say skip this one and find yourself a more interesting 4x.","October 29, 2015","false","101.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","1"

However the game lost all appeal once I realized that the tech progress is completely linear. You are presented with a huge tech tree, lots of different buildings and other improvements, but they're all completely boring. It's just like, +1 armor, +2 armor, +3 armor. 1+ economy, +2 economy, and so forth. NO nonlinearities, NO interesting synergies to be seen whatsoever, but these are what makes 4X games complex and interesting! The game mechanics really lack imagination, which is a problem I see with lots of Stardock titles. With Legendary Heroes, the lack of complex R&D mechanics is mitigated by the roleplaying system which manages to keep the game interesting. In Sins of a Solar Empire, the linear mechanics are fine because it's an action- and speed-oriented RTS title. But GalCiv, that's just as dull as it gets.","November 16, 2014","false","12.5"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","21","41","0","2"

In its favor, it takes many of the best aspects of MOO1 and 2 and combines them. There are, however, mulitple things that mar its enjoyment. While the UI has been somewhat improved over the MOOs, Late game can still be a confusing mess, trying to manage various fleets and colonies spread out across the galaxy. The ship movement and combat system is often frustrating, and the ships often look the same on the strategic map. Both MOOs handled this much better. The last mark against it is personality, which feels like it is just a little too subdued compared to the MOOs, which had it in spades. Even with these complaints, it's still a good play for anyone who is a fan of the 4X space genre. Also, it's kind of the only game in town.","December 19, 2012","true","38.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I first bought GalCivs II when it was new and after a bit of a learning curve (Having never played a Turn Based Strategy Game at that time) I figured out just how amazing the game actually was.  The ability to customize your faction in almost every aspect, plus continue to develop it down the path you see fit, provides an excellent replayablity and immersion.  The ship designer even allows you to recreate designs from some of your favorite Sci-Fi tales, or develop your own line to help crush the galaxy.  The ability to watch fleet battles was a huge plus, and the game's soundtrack is exceptionally easy to modify if one wants to mix it up after hours of playing.\n\nOnce I saw a chance to pick up the Ultimate Edition for 75% off, I bought it in a heartbeat and put in another full game or two.  I've had a number of games in the past taking months to complete on the largest map settings, so the increase in maximum size and depth of the factions only made things better.  The option to customize your enemies ships and faction name sets the stage to truly create your own sci-fi epic, for those you find themselves essentially role-playing such immersive games.\n\nIn short, I can't reccomend this game enough, as it is a brilliant buy and at an affordable cost.  Even better, one doesn't necessarily need a high-end computer to run the game, despite its high entertainment value!","January 4, 2014","true","46.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It's certainly not a genius, but if you turn the AI's ability all the way up, it will make deals that don't involve the player quite often and build armies designed to counter whatever they're fighting is using. They also use spies properly and generally play the game.\n\nIt's easy to customize. Got a 256x256 and a 430x280 png of something. Drop it in the right file and attach it to a custom civ. Want to make your custom civ have the same bonus stats as an initial civ or increase everyone's stats, open an XML editor and the notation will practically tell you how. Then there's the ship editor atop that, which is easy to work and works even out to the map. Want to build a giant robot or a mecha space scorpion, you can do it, and watch it advance on enemies.\n\nIt has some of the best macroing of 4x games. You can easily create a few templates, then drop the templates on worlds as you get them, and the game will auto-assign improvements to the tiles that would give them bonuses. Then you can assign ship building and rally points with a few more clicks without ever touching any of your planets. Or you can do it all by hand.","January 17, 2014","true","277.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Let's face it, why does researching "A" mean mastering "B" later is harder?\n\nThat aside, war seems unavoidable.  No matter how much effort I put into culture and trade, someone wants a fight.  You have got to maintain a fleet even when your relations are all friendly.  And when, half way through a war someone else started, another race classed as "close" starts destroying your space stations without even declaring war I got pretty cheesed off.\n\nThere are some aspects of this that are fun, but they do not come close to making up for the stupidity of having your friends gunning you down while you fight someone everyone hates.\n\nKnowing what I do now, I'd give this a miss.

It's another game in the 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) genre but takes place in space. The amount of cuztomization in this game in how you run your empire is at first overwhelming, but its expansive tutorial system can quickly get you on your feet (plus the campaign is good for learning and experimenting as well). The biggest attractor for this game, in my opinion, is the fleets of starships you can construct and customize. After a while, however, I felt that my abilities for customization were pretty underwhelming. I wanted to create mobile starbases as large as the Death Star and starships that would take years to build, half my treasury to finance, and be all but invincible. Yes you can choose how your ship looks and make it massive, but at the end of the day your ship can only be so large. This game is fun, don't get me wrong, but if it's any more than ~$8 I wouldn't really tell you to go for it.","May 17, 2013","true","25.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a 4x galaxy conquest extravaganza. You pick a race, each with their own traits, you can modify traits to your liking, or keep them as they are. Then you set out on your homeworld and slowly expand to other planets. One good yet bad is that the tech tree. It's pretty big and hard to comprehend your first playthrough. Also, researching weapons and ship tech makes it available to you for use, but doesn't necessarily unlock new ships. That means YOU need to go into your ships designs and refit as you see the need. However, ship customization is one of the big pluses for this game. You not only pick what tech to use, you also can design your ship from the hull up. You can make it look however you want. This game is a definate classic. I highly recommend to anyone who likes 4x conquest.","September 17, 2012","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fly around, meet new people, and take their stuff.  There's much more to it than that, though.  The AI is exceptional.  At higher difficulty levels it's smart, adaptive, and even cunning in a way a lot of human players aren't.  It also doesn't discriminate between player and AI since computer players are as likely to screw each other over as they are to go after you.  AI races play to their strengths and try to avoid exposing their weaknesses. - Militaristic races will hit you with powerful ships, economic races bribe others into attacking you, and diplomats form coalitions to take you down.  The game is also very customizable - It comes with its own editing utilities (though you do have to look for them) and designing your own races and ships using the ingame designer is easy but powerful.  My only complaint is that it lacks any real multiplayer capability - If it had that, it would be close to the perfect game.","July 22, 2012","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So it's a turn based strategy game in space.\n\nBut I want to be a bit more specific.\nWhen starting up the game it sort of looks like Civ, but feels a bit empty after just a few turns. It feels as though there isn't as many options as in the Civ games. But after maybe an hour into a game it suddenly changes by having heaps of stuff to do. The techs are interesting and making improvements are quite enjoyable. And you have a ship designer which lets you design a ships looks and functionality, cool stuff.\n\nIt might not be as sophisticated as the Civ games, but if you like the Civ games and are bored with them, then you will enjoy this. I would be as bold as to suggest you'd like them even if you aren't bored with the Civ games.\n","January 11, 2014","true","20.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I knew it was turn based and an older game so I reserved any expectations.\nTurns out it's a really enjoyable and addictive game that runs great on my non-gaming work laptop. Sure there is a fair learning curve and you need to invest some time on YouTube to get your head around the games ebb and flow but there is a lot of depth to the game - the tech tree is enormous.\nIt's not for everyone, you need to be willing to read;  it's turn based, so it's more a thinking game than frentic action; and this means games take a long time (usually over multiple sessions) so it's not for the very time poor.\nStardock have announced Galactic Civilizations III, due for release some time in 2014 so I'm looking forward to checking that out while I play GC2.","October 28, 2013","true","25.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I don't really know where to start, I didn't discover this game until 2014 and it's one of the best I've played in years. Set in the future, you'll take control of the humans, a custom race, or a pre-set Alien race of which there are many to chose from, each with unique tech abilities, characters, ships and appearances.  You'll colonize planets and build your empire, research new technologies, balance your economy, your peoples morale, research and military spending. You'll design ships, fight intergalactic wars, build fleets, explore inhospitable worlds and colonize them with research. There are many ways to win the game, just like in Civilization you can choose to conquer the galaxy, wiping out all competitors, or choose brain power and win a technological victory. This description hardly scratches the surface of how good the game is. It's not perfect, there are times when the game seems rather difficult, bu the customization factor makes it well worth the experience. 9/10.","January 21, 2014","true","75.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However, I was dissapointed with Gal Civ II. My biggest gripe rests with the mildly cumbersome interface and the lack of 'terrain' or other interesting features in the game map. Without these features there are no strategic bottlenecks or natural borders to exploit. Also, in the course of a game of Civilization II, the players will dramatically alter the appearance of the board and thus see the effects of their progressing nation. No such changes are apparent in Gal Civ II and it feels very much like there is no real visible progress to match the hours consumed. As a result I spent many turns staring at the map in boredom.","January 4, 2014","false","18.2"," 16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","16","35","0","0"

I'll say now, that some people may enjoy it, but personally I didn't. It's a time-sink, but not a particularly fun one. I'll begin with the pros.\n\nPros:\nGood tech tree. It's interesting, useful, and well-made. It goes quickly, while still lasting quite a while.\n\nCustomization. You can build ships, create custom races, all of that. I spent most of my time simply re-inacting my books, and seeing how different races of mine would react to those of other universes.\n\nBattle screen. If you have two fleets that are in battle, you get a more detailed video of the battle. Though not particularly useful itself, it is enjoyable to watch.\n\n\nNow, for the cons. These are the reasons why I wouldn't recommend this to most people.\n\nCons:\nSlow start. The beginning feels boring and long-running. Every game begins the same: You have your system, you colonize the one other habitable planet, then you move to the next. And even once you meet another race, you don't have diplomatic incidents to worry about. The worst you could do is sell something important to them by accident. Until you go to war, it's a very tedious and repetetive task.\n\nTactics are useless. Aside from wanting to attack THIS planet instead of THAT one, you don't really need to use tactics. If your ships are strong enough, you just win.\n\nLack of diplomacy. You can't use diplomacy at all. You can pay other races to ally with you, or to declare war on somebody, but that's it.\n\n\nFinally, the game just doesn't fit the role I expected from it. Instead, I got a time sink that I probably won't play for months on end. If you want something that will bring tactics into the game, I'd recommend Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. For those who enjoy a more basic game when it comes to fleet tactics and diplomacy, you may enjoy this. It has it's ups.","October 3, 2014","false","26.1"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","21"

It takes too long to have anything going and everything you do doesnt seem to matter much. Building a factory, researching certain tech first, constructing a trade fleet: any of this activities takes forever to have any effect, so you feel like you are doing nothing all of the time.\nIn Sid Meier Civilization, when you build a certain building you feel your civilization improving, here it doesnt matter much.\n\nPart of that happens because the interface isnt very good, it is hard to know what is going on with your civilization: how may trade routs do I have? What´s the growth rate of my planets?\nAlso, the technologies for going to war are so expensive that you are only going to see war at ending game. Diplomacy doesnt work very well either and you will usually use it only to exchange techs.\n\nThis game is inferior to civlization in every aspect, play Sid Meier Civilization if you want a civ simulation.

I'd give it a 6, maybe 7/10.\n\nI'll be honest, it can be easy to waste away hours in this game, but not because the game is particularly 'exciting', but because ... that's just the time the development / research tech trees.\n\nYou can strategize on what worlds to colonize and how to build them up (although it's pretty shallow), and what types of strengths you want to give your ships once you've researched far enough into the tech tree, but the core element that let me down was where you actually battled another race/ faction.   There's no input from you, as a player, as to how that battle will go.  If your ship is powerful enough, you can send a single ship to take out several, if not dozens of enemy craft.\n\nNo skill, no positioning, no planning of attacks like there might be in ROME or Age of Wonders II.   Heck, I would say that games that are over 10 years old (like RoN or AOE) are better at the battles then this game is.\n\nAlso, let's talk about diplomacy - the game tries, but the races/ characters are pretty one-dimensional.\n\nI might play this game again every now and then, but I'm disappointed.

In fact I have never managed to finish a single long game because of frustration. There is a massive bug that really ruins all fun and frustrates me to no end. For no reason the cursor will start panning towards a random direction, will not stop and there is nothing you can do about it. You are forced to watch helplessly as the game goes to the edge of the map and remains stuck there.\n\nThis bug occurs randomly, sometimes you can play for 10 mins or so without any problems but nowadays it seems to happen every 3 turns or so. I have tried everything to get rid of it with no luck. Sometimes it goes away on its own or after pushing a button or going to a different screen but there is no reliable way to remove the issue. Sometimes nothing will work and you will be forced to quit. Since I started plaything this game again a couple of days ago, I have been forced to shut down the game and restart to make it go away about half a dozen times.\n\nThis problem was there when I first bought the game many years ago but it just seems to have gotten worse. Help from the GalCIv2 official forums seem to mostly point the blame to specific graphic cards but during those years I have switched pcs, gotten laptops or different brands and hardware configurations and still nothing.\n\nOtherwise the game is pretty good with the only missing element being multiplayer but I can't recommend it as long as that game breaking issue exists.

The problem for me is that it doesn't really ease you into anything. I weren't caught by it at all, and was just looking at ship models larger than planets, and a complete mess of things to do. Likely I shouldn't have started with a skirmish and found some form of tutorial, but I've been fine doing that with other 4x's and yea. This just didn't catch me at all.. I'll likely give it another try in the future, and then this will be updated. For now, I can't recommend it, as I didn't personally like it.\n\nHowever keep in mind that if you don't mind an overwhelming complexity from the start, due to the various and varied game play, allowing you a lot of freedom as to what you want to do, then this might just be the game for you.","May 20","false","0.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

This is always relatively boring at first, but goes quickly since there is little to do and you can click through turns quickly.\n\nThe make or break point for this category of game is how tedious it becomes once significant expansion occurs.  Do you have to click on everything in the map to see if anything needs your attention every turn or does the game notify you whenever something important happens?  In this area, the game is mediocre.  There are notifications when significant events happen, but I still feel the need to check up on every planet periodically to know how things are going.\n\nA huge factor for every game's enjoyability is what aspects come into focus.  Every game has good and bad parts.  The question is, do the good parts shine and the bad parts fade into the background or do the bad parts constantly nag you until you can't enjoy the good parts anymore?  Here the game is mediocre to bad.  What you consider good or bad will depend on your gaming preferences and I don't care to take the time to elaborate, but suffice to say I was not impressed with the balance (despite some quite good features).\n\nAnother big factor is the interface which is mediocre to bad depending on your adaptability and preferences.  It is never good when you spend as much time finding and clicking buttons as you do making real game changing decisions.\n\nA significant factor that made me set this game aside was that the explanations of core game concepts was weak.  I read the manual before I played and also went through the tutorials.  Yet, as I played, I didn't really feel like I knew what was going on in many important aspects.  Some people enjoy figuring out the mystery as they go along.  I do for subtle aspects and tricks.  I most certainly don't for the basic core concepts (especially when having taken the time to read the manual...).\n\nThere are also a handful of other minor points against enjoying this game but I won't bother to elaborate since this is already a long enough review.  The important point is that with the huge number of games available for cheap today, this one just isn't worth the (extensive, tedious) time to play.\n\nAs I side note, I do not understand at all the number of positive reviews (almost all of which are little more than "YEAH!! AWESOME!! COOL!!! BEST GAME EVAH!!!!!").  I suppose it takes a certain kind of player to enjoy this title.  Make sure you are one of them before you buy it.","November 11, 2014","false","30.7"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

I love Sid Maier's Civ series, and I've tried a couple of times to get into GalCiv, but it's just too dated, slow, and uninspiring.  This is one of those titles where people who like it, like it a lot, and they'll gush about it and give it positive reviews, while the rest of us just shrug our shoulders, go "meh", and really don't see what the big deal is.\n\nThe graphics are not only dated, but that's to be expected, I can look past that, I mean I still play a lot of older games. But they're just too simplistic as well, even back in the day this would look crappy.  The music and SFX are actually really horrible tho, so bad that it actually stands out lol.\n\nThere's a lot of content to the game, by that I mean in game mechanics, the tutorial is VERY large - maybe too large, but there's ZERO in game help, no tips suggesting what to do next or what steps you need to take to accomplish your mission. So you can waste a lot of time building and researching one strategy only to find out you need to take a completely different path /wasteoftime.\n\nIf you like this game, good for you, but for new players - there's better options out there, this game is just really, really boring.  Pretty bad when even the Civ series seems more exciting than this space aged 4x game.","November 22, 2014","false","5.3"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

As can be expected, some are mean and nasty and others are peaceful.\n\nThe program is so filled with features it's impossible to describe them here.  With only 8 hours into the game at this time I am only beginning to learn.  I have started several different games because I discovered something important that I had missed before.\n\nIt is turned based so your able to get up and get that 2nd cup of coffee or whatever without the game changing on you.\n\nCons:  None that I know of yet although it did crash to desktop once on me.  Saving your game occasionally takes care of that.\n","December 20, 2014","true","233.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you get to the word, you should see "Galacitc Civilization II: Ultimate Edition" in the 'definition' space, because that's exactly what this game is. I have played space games/simulators/strategy since I could touch a keyboard + mouse, and I can safely say that very little in my experience has come close to the stunning gameplay that GCII has to offer. The only other space game(s) that I feel have a chance of competing against this beast are Sins of a Solar Empire (if you prefer real-time and epic space battles) and Endless Space (if you're wanting a simplified version of GC).\n\nThe graphics aren't next-gen due to the age of this sequel; but then again, one doesn't play this game for its graphical quality as GCII will prove to you in the long course/progression of a custom match.\n\nThe economic system is by far the best I've seen in any strategy game I have played (and I play most macro-scale strategy games). You have to carefully learn how to balance the taxation of your population with their overall approval of your empire, as well as how much you spend on the different budget groups (Social, Military, and Research). Sliders and percentages make this easy to understand the moment you open up your Domestic Panel (another great aspect of GCII). Keep in mind however that the more money you might place into a specific sector of your empire will yield different results, which all have their benefits and drawbacks (for example, focusing fiscal policies will return you with superior profit, some average research progression, but little military  unless you're spending your profit on fleets instead of further economic upgrades). Overall, the financial situation presented to the player in GCII is simply stunning in its conception as each choice you make will have an effect on your empire.\n\nThe Research is kind of standard, depending on how many 4X or macro strategy games you've played (various techs lead into specific tech trees, etc). But the gem of the Research aspect is how it differs between each races (which there are many of by the way) and how there are so many options depending on a number of factors (your race tech tree selection, your research spending, etc). Pretty typical of a strategy game, but your decision on even some of the smaller techs still make big differences (think ahead based upon your current empire trajectory and how the galaxy is progressing!).\n\nThe combat is cool at first when you get to see your first ships/fleets in action, but can quickly become tedious and boring (luckily there is a fast forward and end button to wrap up the combat in a timely fashion). It basically plays out like a rock/paper/scissors match based upon your ship configurations (which is reviewed below), your research into armor/sheilds/anti-missile defenses and your weaponry (beam, missile, mass driver). Obviously the superior number in various attacks and defenses compared to your enemies or vice versa will more than likely result in victory or defeat, but other factors are involved (such as hit points and some other minor military research equipment). You do not gain control in the real-time combat, but are able to view it from a multitude of vantage points while the game takes over the battle, which can become pretty epic once the fleet sizes grow to large capital ships. Other than that, nothing to report on combat (obviously planetary invasions are of an equally similar experience with much the same factors involved).\n\nThe customization is the crux of GCII, and it shows to great extent what it is capable of. Customizing the very size and decor of individual ship types can sap hours of your time if you have specific designs in mind. It truly is fun to incorporate custom designs into an automated availability system for your fleets (i.e. based on what you craft for a ship type it will become available after the required research has been met without a lot of questions as to whether you wish to use said ship type in games or not).  Micro-management of planets and planet tiles can become aggravating, only because you'll find that sometimes there just aren't enough tiles or there are too many tiles, and deciding whether to balance or focus on a particular output can cause brain tumors (but then that's the fun, in my opinion, of being the supreme ruler over every little choice in your empire).\n\nThe AI is extraordinarily intelligent, and by far some of the best in my gaming experience. Diplomacy in GCII is of the utmost importance. Creating trade routes, establishing areas of influence (which you'll learn through playing), and attending galactic council meetings/voting sessions can be some of the more exhilarating aspects of the game (United Planets council once voted against me to place an inter-galactic prisoner base on one of my best planets, doubling its production for the duration of the base, but causing a breakout of prisoners who seized ships and formed pirate fleets behind my lines, which I had to divert forces from my main front in order to crush). The muliple random events (which I recommend leaving at a high frequency) makes the game that much more interesting as well. Choices seem easy in the beginning, but later on may force you to think for a few minutes on each one as good and evil start making an appearance (Paragon and Renegade for your Mass Effect players), with each decision having either short term or long term effects (whether they be empire boosts or differences in the way you are viewed by the United Planet's empires/races).\n\nIn the end, Galactic Civilizations II easily obtains a 9/10 on my gaming scoresheet. With tons of replayability and a campaign to create a mood, for any Civ gamers or 4X lovers this is a MUST BUY.","June 9, 2014","true","64.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was impressed at how much customisation there was for choosing your starting 'Civilization'.\nOnce you have decided that, you are thrown in at the deep end. No tutorial, No Advice, No Helpful Hints. Nothing. So be sure to click the Tutorial button down the menu before hitting 'New Game'\nI had missed that button, i found myself truely like Human race would find themselves in deep space surrounded by aliens... Eager to get started, but clueless...\nAfter a few stop and restarts i managed to get my head around this game. At first it doesn't strike you as a very complex game, just a few blobs of colour with lines everywhere, but hidden underneith is incredible complexity and customisation. Although there does appear to be a few very easy routes to victory.\nAfter spending some time on this game i always learn something new that improves my gameplay each time around.\n\nThe Ship Editor is great. The only drawback is that you do have a limit to how powerful you can make a ship design, so unfortunately you can't create a planet destroying moon-sized leviathan and if you get too carried away you'll find you'll never get to actually use the ships you create because you put them behind a massive wall of tech\n\nBreakdown:\nGraphics - 7/10 - Nothing Amazing and the main menu looks a bit dated. But the game works well\nGameplay - 9/10 - Once you have got your head around what you are doing this game becomes a very impressive strategy game\nCustomisation - 10/10 - Make your own race, design your own ships, run your own planets. I'm not sure what more you could want!\nLongevity - 8/10 - You'll spend plenty of time going back and starting again to make sure you get the best head start in the galaxy. If you take off all the special victory conditions you can play the game for an era and expand your influence over the whole galaxy!\nWorth the Money? - Absolutely\n\nOverall - 9/10 - If you like Strategy and Colonization games, you'll love this\n\nTime_For_Tea","March 1, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are fine for a 4x even today and scale well to modern resolutions.\n\nThe gameplay harkens back to a time when the focus of 4x was on immersion and fun rather than a vain chase for mathematical balance.  Different factions have unique flavors that aren't necessarily balanced, but who cares--they're still fun to play.  Regular cutscenes add a sense of immersion.  Military and industrial management is very well done with waypoints, governors, and auto-upgrading that lets you skip a lot of micromanaging.  The tech tree allows for many play styles, as the prerequistes for a tech are only techs of the same sort--it would be possible (though not advisable) to research to the highest level of laser weapons without researching any non-laser tech.  And different factions and alignments have unique techs available only to them.\n\nI hope the upcoming GC3, currently in beta, lives up to the promise of GC2, and they don't make the mistake Civ 5/BE have made of dropping the little things that make 4x games fun and immersive--cutscenes, victory movies, the possibility of discovering unbalanced strategies, faction personality, diplomatic insults, etc.","March 8, 2015","true","69.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That and the excrutiatingly long loading time didn't sit well with me. Now, a couple of years later, I saw the game on sale on Steam and decide to give it another try.

Although the graphics are very dated, this game is one of the few that has a genuinely strong replayability scale for me.  I come back to it every so often, and it re-hooks me into a new game.  Heavy difficulty is actually very hard, contrary to some games I've run into, and its options both during game start and in methods of victory really make this game wildly variable in how it turns out.\n\nAfter getting accustomed to it, you'll find that if you're going to be beaten, 60% of the time that's going to happen in the first 30 or so turns, which makes it a quick game.  Sometimes you'll get beaten later on, which is a satisfying if not happy defeat.  When you win though, you'll be able to see it long before you finish the game - so you'll again have the option of restart or play to the very end.\n\nVery fun stuff, and for the price it's hard to beat.  v3 is coming soon, so it couldn't hurt to bone up on the concepts in v2 now.","May 25, 2014","true","150.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Galactic Civilizations II also features a vastly overhauled and scalable graphics engine that now runs in 3D (yet is still playable on low-end systems.)","March 30, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The shipyard allows you to build and customize your own fleets. Lots of options in the alien race of your choice guarantees you will find one that suits you, and if not, you can always make your own civilization to try conquering the galaxy with. Tech trees are massive and the different ways to win lead to many different paths to victory. My only problem with this game would be the way my computer would slow down drastically late game on the biggest maps, but seems thats been lessened quite a bit. Random events upon forming new colonies can have pretty funny choices in the vein of 'good', 'neutral' or 'evil' fixes to whatever situation comes up. Random anomalies, tech researched notifications and some dialogue from the other alien races made me laugh,too. Campaign was ok. Some missions were much harder than others, but overall mostly just a learning curve to whats being thrown at you, some trial and error, and a buncha good times. I cant stress enough how much fun it is to paint the galaxy whatever color youve chosen as your own, and all the different ways to do it is icing on the cake.

It had been a while since my last attempt. So far, the interface looked confusing, too much stuff going on, can't possibly take it all in. Guess I'll just make my best guess as I go. Well, at least it looks like I'm doing alright. Maybe I'll go for alliance victory, make everyone happy. Hey look, my economy's doing alright. And I can make these cool trade routes and get super rich! Wow, I can get all the techs from everyone else with this money and a few of my own! Hey, those guys built an Inflience starbase next to my planet, that's not cool; guess I'm going to declare war. Funny how these different races have personalities and stuff. Darn Korx always forcing such expensive trades. At least the Drath seem nice. Well now that I've conquered those other guys in the corner, time to take on the big...oh wait, they actually like me...enough even for my last alliance! I win! Wow, that was great! Time to play another game and try for a different victory!\n\nThis is a fantastic game. I didn't like it at first, but recently tried it again and its amazingness sort of snuck up on me. I'd recommend it to any fans of strategy. I especially enjoy how warfare doesn't play the dominant role it normally does in strategy games. Playing the nice-guy trader whom everybody loves is entirely feasible in GalCiv2, but conquering is just as legitimate a strategy. There's plenty of races to try out with their own playstyles, and you can even make your own and pit them against yourself! Maps can be somewhat customized as well, and there is a great editor for making your own starships.

I was impressed at how much customisation there was for choosing your starting 'Civilization'.\nOnce you have decided that, you are thrown in at the deep end. No tutorial, No Advice, No Helpful Hints. Nothing. So be sure to click the Tutorial button down the menu before hitting 'New Game'\nI had missed that button, i found myself truely like Human race would find themselves in deep space surrounded by aliens... Eager to get started, but clueless...\nAfter a few stop and restarts i managed to get my head around this game. At first it doesn't strike you as a very complex game, just a few blobs of colour with lines everywhere, but hidden underneith is incredible complexity and customisation. Although there does appear to be a few very easy routes to victory.\nAfter spending some time on this game i always learn something new that improves my gameplay each time around.\n\nThe Ship Editor is great. The only drawback is that you do have a limit to how powerful you can make a ship design, so unfortunately you can't create a planet destroying moon-sized leviathan and if you get too carried away you'll find you'll never get to actually use the ships you create because you put them behind a massive wall of tech\n\nBreakdown:\nGraphics - 7/10 - Nothing Amazing and the main menu looks a bit dated. But the game works well\nGameplay - 9/10 - Once you have got your head around what you are doing this game becomes a very impressive strategy game\nCustomisation - 10/10 - Make your own race, design your own ships, run your own planets.

It had been a while since my last attempt. So far, the interface looked confusing, too much stuff going on, can't possibly take it all in. Guess I'll just make my best guess as I go. Well, at least it looks like I'm doing alright. Maybe I'll go for alliance victory, make everyone happy. Hey look, my economy's doing alright. And I can make these cool trade routes and get super rich! Wow, I can get all the techs from everyone else with this money and a few of my own! Hey, those guys built an Inflience starbase next to my planet, that's not cool; guess I'm going to declare war. Funny how these different races have personalities and stuff. Darn Korx always forcing such expensive trades. At least the Drath seem nice. Well now that I've conquered those other guys in the corner, time to take on the big...oh wait, they actually like me...enough even for my last alliance! I win! Wow, that was great! Time to play another game and try for a different victory!\n\nThis is a fantastic game. I didn't like it at first, but recently tried it again and its amazingness sort of snuck up on me. I'd recommend it to any fans of strategy. I especially enjoy how warfare doesn't play the dominant role it normally does in strategy games. Playing the nice-guy trader whom everybody loves is entirely feasible in GalCiv2, but conquering is just as legitimate a strategy. There's plenty of races to try out with their own playstyles, and you can even make your own and pit them against yourself! Maps can be somewhat customized as well, and there is a great editor for making your own starships. So far I have no cons to report, but I haven't been playing for too long.","September 6, 2015","true","47.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

GC II feels like playing a board game that has the size of a football pitch. I kind of like its game mechanics and balance. It includes all the elements of a wide-range strategy gameplay but it does it without going too deep into them. During gameplay it means that you don't get drowned into micro management that is not a bad thing.\n\nAges ago there was a game called Imperium Galactica II that bests this one for me, despite the fact that is more than a decade older, because it included direct control over your planetary and space combat where your decisions could win or lose the battles (with immeasurably smaller maps I must add). With good tactics and right choices you could win against much bigger forces. I miss this "outsmarting" option from GC II where you have automated battles where the outcome has already been fixed before the encounter itself.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't make the game any lesser. If you support the idea of LEGOing together your own spaceships and roast the hell out of your opponents with them, it would be hard to find a more capable and fun tool. Damn, you can even build your own death star.","February 5","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Personally I like it.\n- The automatic governors are pretty limited.\n- The AI is extremely hostile; they'll only be your friend if your military is more powerful.\n- The initial rush to colonize planets plays a huge factor because it's not until much later that you have the tech to invade and take over a planet.\n\nOther reviews mention all the great things about GalCiv II so I don't need to go into it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/greeneagle20/recommended/202200/","greeneagle20","GreenEagle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/greeneagle20/","76 products in account","This game has become one of my all time favorites. I was a fan of the strategy genre, but take strategy, customization, some rpg like elements, and you have a great game! Personally people have been complaining about the 3rd-party thing, but personally I haven't had any problems. After I registered, I'm able to play, no problems.\n\nThings that are fantastic-\nThis isn't just a game where you build a civilization to completley wipe out all the others, there are mutliple ways to win, even just being ally with everyone. Wanna be that Civ that kills everyone, you can! Wanna be the nice one that helps and brings everyone together, you can! Wanna be that 'Corruptor' Civ that causes others to fight wars and supplies ships to cause chaos, why not? This game also includes random events which are outstanding. At one point I had a new minor race appear out of nowhere, then I had 1 of every planet from each Civ revolt and created a new faction called the "Jagged Knife". One of my personal favorites is the ability to design my ships to my liking. You have full customization and desgins are saved so if you finished a game, those desgins will appear in your next game as long as you have the right research upgrades that were fitted to your ship. It's truly amazing what can happen sometimes in this game.\n\nThe bad things-\nEvery now and then I noticed the game camera would bug out and move in one direction by itself. I had to fix it by saving, going to the main menu, and reloading that save. It got annoying at alot of times. At certain points of the game, there were these "Galactic Council" meetings. Although the idea was cool, I often see the same choices over and over again and it just isn't as exciting. I also found some of the same random events to appear often aswell, though really awesome ones I've never seen still appear. I personally like to stay out of wars and just supply the factions I like with ships and money, though I have noticed that the AI tend to 'lose' ships. I would send them a ship or 2 even if they aren't in war, and then sometime later they just vanish. Either the AI traded them or destroyed them somehow and it kinda annoys me.\n\nOverall I think this is a great game worth checking out if your fan of strategy games!","October 13, 2015","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

About the most active thing you'll do in this game is looking down your list of planets to see which ones are building spaceships you don't want, or to figure out which ones built spaceships but haven't launched them.\n\nMOO2 kicked this game's ♥♥♥, sorry to say.\n\nNow - it's well made, has an interesting setting and could definitely be a lot of fun IF you're into pure management - I'm not.\n","December 6, 2012","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I probably had 300 hours played before even getting it on Steam. It's the only worthy successor to Master of Orion 2. It's not insanely overcomplicated like MoO3 or dumbed down like Endless Space. A few caveats:\n- The economy/production mechanics are significantly different than other 4x games, it takes some getting used to. Personally I like it.\n- The automatic governors are pretty limited.\n- The AI is extremely hostile; they'll only be your friend if your military is more powerful.\n- The initial rush to colonize planets plays a huge factor because it's not until much later that you have the tech to invade and take over a planet.\n\nOther reviews mention all the great things about GalCiv II so I don't need to go into it. Oh, and there's mods!\n\nNB: I've never had trouble with the DRM. Never even noticed any, actually. Maybe they removed it? YMMV","February 4","true","83.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

GC II feels like playing a board game that has the size of a football pitch. I kind of like its game mechanics and balance. It includes all the elements of a wide-range strategy gameplay but it does it without going too deep into them. During gameplay it means that you don't get drowned into micro management that is not a bad thing.\n\nAges ago there was a game called Imperium Galactica II that bests this one for me, despite the fact that is more than a decade older, because it included direct control over your planetary and space combat where your decisions could win or lose the battles (with immeasurably smaller maps I must add). With good tactics and right choices you could win against much bigger forces. I miss this "outsmarting" option from GC II where you have automated battles where the outcome has already been fixed before the encounter itself.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't make the game any lesser. If you support the idea of LEGOing together your own spaceships and roast the hell out of your opponents with them, it would be hard to find a more capable and fun tool. Damn, you can even build your own death star.","February 5","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It's fun as hell and if you're a major Space and Sci-Fi fan like me you'll love the hell out of it even more. The only thing I had a problem with is the price. It's easily a bit too pricey. It's an old game and still is at 20 dollars like what's with that? If you don't have money to spend then you might wanna wait till a sale but in my personal opinion it was worth the 20 dollars. I'v already put almost 40 hours into it and gonna put a lot more into it. It's one of the best turn based strategy games i'v ever played. You can win many different ways and my personal favorite is conquest. Some people say the game is too slow paced. And it can be if you don't have the right settings on. I can spend hours just on the ship builder alone. Over all if I were to give this game a rating i'd give it an 8 or 9 out of 10 and even with spending almost only 40 hours into the game I still feel like I just started and I wanna play more.","May 18","true","42.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
