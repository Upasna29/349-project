I see where he is.\nwhile I struggle to get drugs, bandages and disinfectant, he discovers the joys of stitching oneself.\n\n- we join and, while he recovers from his wounds, I board the place up and gather all the wood and tools I can.\nwe sleep in the break room. they're 5 feets away, clawing at the boards. they never break in.\n\n- after a few days we start scavenging the suburbs, just what we need, we have projects.\n\n- a few weeks later, we're settled, the crops we planted on the roof after transporting some dirt there is flourishing.\ndays passed by, peacefully. the place is clear and we start to feel in control.\nhe picks up cooking.\n\n- one night, I hear moans and cracks, the building's on fire. whole groups of them came to see it.\nmy friend passed out while cooking and canning food for the winter.\n\n- he almost dies in the fire to save the seeds and tools we couldn't survive without.\n\n- once set up in a smaller building, we heal and consume all our reserves, the meds are gone and the water shuts off.\nwe peek outside.\n\n- the Z's have massed, we can't reclaim enough terrain for a field or rain collectors.\nafter making an inventory of what's left we decide to loot the gun store, one town away.\nwe'll have to get out anyway and at least, if we go there, we could clean our home afterwards.\n\n- the way there is easy, we're well rested, fed and hydrated.\nwe run there, only stopping for the night in a gas station half way\n\n- just before we arrive, we're starving. we ate all our food, drank all our water.... we see a supermarket!\n\n- we drink soda and eat meat for the first time in a month. we're safe in the offices, the stairs are broken.\nwe can rest peacefully and the shop is within a stone throw.\n\n-the next morning we silently climb down the roof with a rope made of bloody clothes.\n\n- the score is easy. I distract them, shooting our few last bullets and run into the woods while he brings down the metal roll-up door of the gunshop as fast as he can with a sledgehammer.\n\n- we've got 'em! we're armed to the teeth and we paint our way out of town red.\n\n- I already aim better by the time we reach the gas station.\nit's a tough fight to reclaim it and I get scrached. a cold gives me fever and I freak out at the idea I might be infected.\nI drink and smoke all night to forget the worries.\n\n- by the morning I'm all better (besides the hangover but who cares, I live!) but my friend is nauseous.\nhe didn't rest and looks sickly. he tells me he thought we were above use-by dates.\nafter surviving what we did. he couldn't just die from bad cabbage... could he?\n\n- a few miles later, he can't run anymore.

Crafting, cooking and farming. Barricade windows and doors, build a safe house and scavenge supplies to stay alive.\n\nUsing the skills to build and cook or fight will allow you to become better at them, so there is some character progression.\n\nAlso let's not forget the awesome music in this game. Highly reccomended!\n\nIf I had to compare it to any games I would say it is like the sims+ Don't starve+ night of the living dead.\nFuture plans are in place to add npc's other than zombies and polish to the engine and graphics.\nIt really is quite addicting and a great early access title to get your hands on. Especially if you liked state of decay and wanted a little more. Also word going around that a story campaign will be put in as well.\n\nWith amazing details like food degradation and injury/ illness/ exposure to cold and heat/ mood debuffs/ weapon durability/ character encumberance/ sound and light attraction of the zombies this game can be a nice challenge on the nice open maps.\nIt isn't an FPS but it plays great and has similar controls to an FPS.\n\nJust remember this is Early Access and there are some bugs and such. As it stands the game is very much in a good playable state and well worth the money.  Hearing about the coming changes to this title, I am even more stoked about this particular purchase.","November 25, 2013","true","42.3"," 912 of 987 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","912","987","0","0"

Braved bitter winters.  Sorted and labeled crates of canned food, wondering how long it would last me.  Tended crops and cursed the misfortune of plant disease.  Fractured my leg and holed up in the corner of some dilapidated warehouse dying of thirst since I lacked the speed to get home safely.  I've lived a thousand lives and felt the touch of death so many times, now I'm only surprised when it doesn't come swiftly.\n\nWhat I've learned is that death isn't failure, no, it's a sweet release.  Make no mistake, I've survived for a long time, built impregnable safehouses with self-sustaining crops, high above where any zombie could reach.  But that is simply a different kind of death, death in the form of boredom, but it is a death all the same.  It makes sense though, doesn't it?  You are the last person on Earth, the world is filled with endless zombies, there is no happy ending to all of this.\n\nBut the point isn't to survive, the point is to create your own tale, make a snapshot of experiences that are memorable.  This game is really just an analogy for life and death, compressed into a few hours at a time, and how you choose to spend your time reflects on your personality.  How will you keep death at bay?  Will you build walls, will you hide, will you run as far away as you can, or will you pick up an axe and try to fight it?  It doesn't matter, death will find you in the end, but it will be a hell of a journey.","December 1, 2015","true","329.7"," 385 of 399 people (96%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","96","385","399","45","10"

It's definitely not Resident Evil. And that is a good thing. Seriously. You even have a demo available. Play it.\n\nWhy is this man, who has only a few hours invested in the game ordering you around? Well...\nEven though my hour count states that i've just bought my game, that is not exactly true. I played this game a lot a while back when it was still on Desura and I think I really can give you guys an objective opinion here.\nThe fact that the game is flawed is true, yet i always thought this is the game that zombie fans deserved. It's not some cheerful "sit with your friends and giggle while blowing zombie heads off" game like Left 4 Dead series were. I mean, i like L4D, but it never got right what i really wanted off an zombie game. It's also not wannabe "scary and atmospheric horror game" like Resident Evil that's in the end just funny, especially with the addition of co-op in RE5 which has broken every last bit of atmosphere that Resident Evil 1 and 2 had. (Seriously if you haven't play the old Resident Evils, they are good)\nThis game can be easily compared to DayZ to some degree, in the aspect that both of them make you feel like a masochist and that both of them consist of learning by trial and error. By fire.\nThe games differ in the fact that DayZ is action filled and most of your playthroughs are ended by an infamous axe-guy that doesn't want to cooperate, and zombies (even with their fixed and upgraded AI's) feel more like an annoyance then a threat, while in Project Zomboid many times i died just because some zombie slowly shambled 30 meters behind me and i forgot to dispatch it before it came to my house. It broke my window and in the middle of the night hell broke loose.\nThis game is a game where every one of your playthroughs will learn you a new thing, where you will evolve from a guy that runs around with a butter knife and tries to kill as much zombies as possible before dying a slow and painful death, to a guy that silently scavenges whole blocks of buildings, and knows how not to take unnecessary risks.\nIf you take into consideration the fact that this game now also HAS MULTIPLAYER. So if you feel like shooting some zombies with your friends, that is just one more reason to try this game out. Also, keep in mind that multiplayer is also in its early stages, but for me it worked like a charm.\n\nThe cons are that the control system is kinda weird to get used to, and that the game doesn't really instruct you that much about all the dangers of the world, and believe me, they are many.\nMany times you will find yourself dying of just one lucky bite or of the cold that you ignored for too long. There are many many little things that make this game a true zombie apocalypse simulator, not just another action game that includes zombies. But, also i have to mention a really friendly and awesome community over at game forums that will answer most of your questions and help you in any way possible.\n\nTL;DR VERSION: The game has a steep learning curve and is really not your "everyday zombie game". If you are, on the other hand, looking for a closest thing to an zombie apocalypse simulator, you have to at least download the demo and try the game. It's a wonderful game with many details that make it really atmospheric and easy to immerse yourself into.\n\n\nEDITED 21.06.2014. - Yay!

Runner? No problem, the game allows you to change almost every aspect of your undead foes.) after which, you must then search for supplies and an adequate safehouse for survival. The game is very hardcore, with permadeath as well as essentially an insta-kill system, if you get attacked by a zombie, you either get bitten or scratched, being scratched has a small chance of you becoming infected, while being bitten is pretty much always going to infect you (95% chance I believe). Infection leads to a slow, unavoidable death.\n\nThe game also has multiplayer, however it lags a good deal for me to the point where it just isn't fun, but I do have extremely poor internet, so it probably will be a lot of fun for those with proper internet.\n\nThe developers are also currently working on an amazing NPC system that could very much rocket this game into one of my favorites of all time, it's supposed to be able to generate events that are similar to situations from the walking dead, but randomly!\n\nOf course... being early access does mean that the game has bugs, it is however fairly stable from what I've played so far. But it does have a fair share of annoying bugs and issues, particularly with the UI.\n\nOverall... I can't recommend this game enough, it's just amazing so far, and they're planning on adding a huge amount of stuff that'll make the game even more worth the purchase! If you like zombie games, and extremely nice and helpful development teams and communites centered around your games, then you should get this game.\n\nI would recommend if you wish to research the game, that you watch recent let's plays, while you can read the wiki, it seems to be outdated in cetain aspects, and probably will remain so until the developers stop updating the game so regularly.\n\nHere's the wiki link: http://pzwiki.net/wiki/Survival_Guide\n\n\nNote: this was the first review I've ever made. I also kind of suck with my paragraphs, so give me a little slack :P\n\nAnother Note: I had a section here where I said what things had been added since I first made this review, but decided to delete it since I wasn't updating the section, and I don't think that would give justice to how much stuff they actually have added into the game since this review was published.","March 17, 2014","true","29.5"," 240 of 263 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","240","263","0","12"

Here's how that went.\n\nWe spend the first 30 minutes figuring out how the controls work. Zombies everywhere in custom difficulty. Brother and I run, girlfriend somehow gets bit. We bunker down overnight and the bite wound kills her. She raises as a zombie and I have to put her down.\n\nWe try a few more custom difficulties until we decide to just go with the first bite. We spawn in a decent house with a white picket fence and a grill in back. Not too many zombies in sight. Until we see the horde down the road. Girlfriend thinks it's like left 4 dead and goes in swinging her bat, gets bitten again. We don't change the bandage out often enough and it kills her. She raises again as a zombie and I have to put her down again.\n\nHer THIRD character gets a small scratch from a zombie. By now, I have it down on how to treat the wound. I fully heal her. Then I notice her status goes to Zombified and I sigh, taking her out back with my spiked baseball bat and await the inevitable. I put her down for the third time.\n\nHer fourth character does better, though now she avoids any zombie. My brother, our scavenger, accidentally jumps from a second story building and fractures his leg. He waddles back to base and my girlfriend treats him, since she's supposed to be the medic while I'm the carpenter. It took an in-game week for his leg to heal enough for him to run with the splint on. It heals while he's out...and he accidentally falls out a second story window, breaking his leg again. I talk him out of drinking bleach while I gather corpses in the middle of the street to burn. I start the campfire and my pants leg catches on fire. I panic, running about and then into a building to grab water to throw on it. I die and my burning pants set the building on fire, making me glad I didn't walk into our base.","October 19, 2015","true","42.2"," 184 of 194 people (95%) found this review helpful 206 people found this review funny","95","184","194","206","0"

Animations are fitting, and satisfying. Though there are still several glitches, I have no doubt they will be worked out and fixed.    Gameplay  8.5  A uniquely fun twist on the giant list of Zombie games, Project Zomboid actually brings back the feeling of surviving the zombie outbreak, not just simply gunning your way through it. Has a classic RPG skill picker, with several crafting elements. Brutally merciless, Zomboid doesn't want you to live to see the next morning. With a unique take on your characters field of view and LoS, Zomboid challenges you to stay alert and aware of everything going on around you. There are still several kinks they need to work out for combat and some actions, and it take a long, long time to level up your skills, but the updates steadily roll in and it gets better with each update!    Story  N/A  Not much of a story currently in the game, though there is one in the works.    Multiplayer  10  An absolute blast with your friends. Gather as many as you want, host your own server (or join an online one) and figure out how to survive together. Or watch as your ragtag group crumbles into some twisted Walking Dead equivalant society. Work together to build a fort and prepare to live as long as you can. Set out on expeditions into town to gather supplies, and watch in horror as your friend is mauled to death, and there's nothing you can do but run.    Replayability  10  You can keep coming back to Zomboid for more and more. Currently the end-game is a bit easy, but they are still pushing out plenty of updates for the game, and are working on making it even more difficult. An absolute blast to play over and over with your friends.    Overall  9/10  The most refreshing take on Zombies you will have yet. So many Zombie games anymore are simply shooters, and the survival element is lost. However, in Zomboid, every movement, and every moment, count. Didn't check that dark corner before you rummaged through the house? That zombie just jumped you and bit you, and now you might turn. Do you tell your group, or press on and hope it blows over? Made the mistake of running to fast? The zombies have heard you, and the horde is coming. It's not a matter of if you'll die, simply a matter of when. How quickly that happens is entirely up to you. A must buy for zombie-survival fanatics.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","October 26, 2014","true","40.1"," 212 of 232 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","212","232","0","2"

In many cases, not scouting out and planning your approach could very easily mean your death. Zombies are a real threat here; the smallest scratch can be fatal.\nDespite the graphics and the camera style (which personally I love), there have been some situations that have had my heart racing and my hair left standing up. The smallest event can have great consequences if incorrectly handled.\n\nDon’t like your slow, one-bite-kill zombies? Customise them the way you like in the sandbox mode! Live in the zombie apocalypse you want, with the world rules you want! Don’t like that the water and electricity shut off after a few weeks? Change it! Don’t like the way the zombie virus is spread? Change it! Maybe you’re a fast runner Left 4 Dead type zombie lover (good luck you crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) or maybe you like the slow but intelligent zombies that open doors and like to watch you sleep… All up to you!\n\nZomboid is the zombie game for the strategic man, the man that thinks before he does and the man that cries himself to sleep at night. If you are any of those things… This game is a thrill to play!\n\nI have yet to try out the multiplayer, but I’m sure it’ll be a blast.\n","May 8, 2014","true","42.8"," 173 of 184 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","173","184","0","3"

We spawned in different locations. I made a safehouse and gathered stuff, while he did the same.\n\nDay 2: Friend died from horde. He made a new character and started over. I barricaded my safehouse and gathered more stuff.\n\nDay 3: We tried finding each other, and through the helpful use of a map, no thanks to the game, we found each other.\n\nDay 4: We explored around the area and looted everything we found.\n\nDay 5: I went to another place, while he tried to find a good 2nd safehouse. Gunshots around him with the horde following, so he retreated back to the safehouse. I looted stuff at the motel.\n\nDay 6: We both went around looking for a good safehouse, and finally found one. After putting sheets on the windows and gathering food and weapons, a chopper passed through.\nIt was the most intense situation I've seen, with more than 15 zombies coming right at us. We fought the horde, and through some exploitation of AI we were able to kill them.\n\nDay 7: Looting around the 2nd safehouse. Unfortunately, I got bitten by a bathroom zombie. I had an injury, wrapped it with Ripped Sheets and took painkillers. A few in-game hours later I started feeling nauseous\n\nDay 8: We were looting around and found another horde of zombies. Killed it and looted some more. After getting back to the 2nd safehouse I started feeling Sick. Looked it up on Zomboid Wiki and we arrived to the conclusion that I'm infected.\n\nNight 8: Me and my friend ran around the safehouse naked. He was trying to kill me because I might turn into a zombie. We both tried hitting each other. Then he had this great idea. "Why don't you try jumping off the windows?"\nI said "Sure, why not." and thought "I'm gonna die anyway."\nSo I jumped out the window. I fell, naked, only with boxers.

Bunch of complex mechanics, fun on both singleplayer and multiplayer. Mondoids(regular Monday reports) keep the community updated about the game's development.

P. Zomboid offers what seems to be the most complete "Zombie Survival" experience (with graphics) there is by providing a huge amount of elements that range from putting yourself together on Day 0 and scavenging for supplies to stabilishing a fortified farm house months later, everything in between included. A sandbox mode allows you to create your own Apocalypse-to-Survive by permitting you to edit the Zombie Lore and behavior along with map conditions.\n\nDespite being far from finished, the game is very much enjoyable in its current state and has a fair amount of big features yet to be impletemented - such as Online Multiplayer, NPC survivors & interactivity along with many more crafting options. Having been in production for years along with getting an engine reboot, the development has been picking up a faster pace in the last few months and doesn't seem to be halting anytime soon; with its ample modding support, Project Zomboid just might end up being the next big thing, one that is definitely worth picking up at its currently discounted dev price ($15). There is also a demo of the current build available which is worth checking out.\n\nspecial thanks to gangan for being such a charitable brassknuckles wielding monk","November 26, 2013","true","39.0"," 258 of 311 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","258","311","0","0"

Absolutely. It's one hell of a fun game that just keeps getting better with each new build. It's not perfect, there are still a few rough edges, but the Devs are busting their butts to get everything working properly. The gameplay is surprisingly addicting, sometimes I look at the clock and wonder where the last 4 hours went, but looking at my fort shows me where they went.\n\nThere are some great elements of the game still being worked on (NPC's, Map Expansion) that will certainly alter the current games play style. No longer will we be "limited" to just raiding Muldraugh, West Point, or the "New(ish)" Mall area/recent expansion......which to be perfectly honest is quite a bit of looting to begin with. It honestly necessitates a new Safehouse/Fortress for each area as carrying all the stuff you find between forts would be kind of pointless...as the current map is that big....(map link) http://pzmap.crash-override.net/ and the planned additions of Louisville, Fort Knox and whatever lies in between them will make this a HUGE map.\n\nMy play style is a little Kamikaze(ish), i love to get a Nailed Baseball Bat or an Axe and take on a horde or two, just swinging away till either the zombies are dead, my weapon breaks, or i have to run and get bandaged up.....maybe have my character drink some bleach if the zombies made me bleed. Consequently, i rarely have a character last much beyond a month in the game. But that's the fun of the game, it lulls you into thinking that you are "Too Good" for the mere zombies to hurt....until they get you surrounded and you remember that you swore to yourself last time, that you would not let that happen again.\n\nBut don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself and see how well you do. Just remember the words on the screen at the beginning of the game "This is how you died"\n\nEDIT on November 30, 2014\n\nAs i write this we have just had a recent hotfix of Build 30, which brought in a Medical Overhaul. I have fallen out of windows and broken feet and legs, requiring me to bandage and splint the injuries then just wait for it to heal. I have cut my hands climbing in thru broken windows, had to get some tweezers and pry out the lodged glass before bandaging, possibly having to stitch the wound. Been scratched and bitten by zombies, requiring me to disinfect, stitch/bandage the wound and hope i did not get infected.\n\nOf course, before i can do any of this, i had to locate the needed medical equipment at various locations on the map. With the new overhaul, it's even possible to bleed out from a bad wound if i cannot locate some band aids, bandages, or even some sheets or clothing to rip up for use as a low grade bandage. One nice thing is the ability to clean a bandage for reuse.\n\nI swear, every new build the Devs come up with just continues to draw you in and add more game immersion, and they have plans to "adjust" the game to make it harder for you to survive a lengthy amount of time.\n\nThe MP has continued to improve, with more and more Game Server companies starting to add PZ to their inventory.  And i just realized i did not mention some of the other new things in the latest Build (30.3) We have more Sandbox options available when starting a new game, including adjusting how often Zombies respawn, whether or not you want random loot respawn and it's frequency.\n\nOH yeah, the incredible Erosion mod has been integrated into the base game which literally is Mother Nature taking over the map...vines growing up buildings, cracks in pavement, trees losing their leaves as fall approaches then regrowing as spring comes, bushes and trees growing in places where we Humans would remove them, SNOW, and so much more that i just cannot think of right now.\n\nOK, I don't want this to be a 10,000 word review so i'll stop here. but as before, if you would like to see some gameplay there are plety of videos on youtube from guys like MatthasGames and Eckyman. Or, check on Twitch or Hitbox and catch a live stream. Either way, I hope you enjoy what you see and you too join the Zomboid community.","September 16, 2014","true","108.7"," 122 of 130 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","122","130","9","13"

I was 'scratched and bleeding' on the foot and I couldn't find, or figure out how to bandage myself. So I died.\n\nFrom a cut on the foot.\n\nSecond character starts to freeze to death within just a couple of minutes of playing, so I get together some materials for a camp fire and make it in the safety of my bathroom. 30 seconds later my character is running around the garden being chased by zombies with his legs on fire, watching his house burn to the ground.\n\nThird character survived for a long time. I found a warehouse and wanted to look for axes or sledgehammers but there were too many zombies around. So I lured them all to follow me, planning to trap them inside a house and then run out the back door. An excellent plan!!\n\nI opened a house door, ran inside and the zombies started pouring in, an excellent plan I thought!! Wait, where's the back ♥♥♥♥ing door???? There is no back door. Cue Laurel and Hardy music as I sprint circles around the living room as more and more pour in the door. By the time I'd remembered that I could climb out of a window it was too late.\n\nMy first multiplayer experience with this was like an episode of The Walking Dead.\n\nI created my character, an illiterate clumsy oaf with incredible strength and tough skin, and then spent the next 6 hours trying to get the server to work. (if you've tried everything but still can't get it to work- on the router settings make sure the device the game is connected with is your IP, not your local machine IP, or your router's IP, but your IP. Not your public IP. Damn it's complicated. For me it starts with 192.... but there are two of those, one with 256 at the end, the other with 140 at the end. The 140 one is the one I connected the game to and then it worked.)\n\nBut nevermind that.\n\nMy character's name is Rick Grimes. I ran out of my door taking a bunch of food with me and sprinted down the main road, leaving a bread crumb trail so I don't get lost. I find a huge warehouse where I scavenged a few planks and hammers, a buttload of nails and duct tape, and also somehow managed to FALL DOWN THE STAIRS, breaking my leg.\n\nI ripped up my vest into sheets and tied a wooden plank to my leg as a makeshift splint. Sorted!\n\nMy friend at this moment managed to log in. We cheer! But then sigh as he has spawned in a house filled with zombies and the doors and windows are barricaded shut. WTF??? He screams. He sends me a voice message telling me he's already getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off with the game and that he's about to log out.\n\nHold on!!! I tell him.... just hold on!!\n\nI go online, load up the map of the area and tell him to take a picture of his house zoomed out. I manage to match up this quirky looking road out front of the house to where it is on the map and..... holy ♥♥♥♥ balls. It's miles away.\n\nNevermind the distance, I thought! I'm going to rescue my friend!! Hang tight, I tell him, I'll be there soon!\n\nAs soon as I start sprinting I realise that a broken leg in this game actually means something.\n\nSo 45 minutes later, I arrive at his house. To my astonishment, he's actually managed to take down the 5 zombies in his house with his bare hands and he's just been waiting there starving to death.\n\nThe feeling of seeing him stood there, through the crack in the barricades on the window, was pretty amazing. My friend called it a Golden Gaming Moment.\n\nI looked through my inventory and ♥♥♥♥ myself. I don't have a hammer... I can't take down the barricades. So I start wailing on them with a golf club. Bonk. Bonk. Bonk. Nothing.... panicking that he's going to have to wait another 20 minutes for me to find a hammer, I remember my schoolbag. I open it and.... ah yeah there's my hammer.\n\nI take the barricades down and I know for a fact if there was a BROHUG emote in the game we would be spamming the hell out of it.\n\nWe survived for a good hour and a half before we started to get cocky trying to take down small hordes of zombies around our safe house. I got scratched and cut on my leg and arm. Bandaged up no problem. But my friend got bitten on his chest and it was deep and needed rebandaging every 2 minutes or so. He was losing health.\n\nInstead of continuing to back away from this horde, we stupidly decided to carry on trying to exterminate it one zombie at a time.\n\nI got scratched on the foot again and decided to just back off and give up, but due to miscommunication, my friend decided to balls out try and kill them all by himself. He got swarmed!! I managed to push them all away and I went rampant as they swarmed him, managing to knock down or kill the last of them.\n\nMy friend's waddling around leaving a trail of blood.\n\nHOLD STILL I yell to him as I frantically begin the medical check.\n\nHe has 4 injuries and is already half dead. I bind one wound- OK. Another wound- OK. I bind the third wound.. ♥♥♥♥!! That wasn't a wound, I just took off a dirty bandage!!! At that moment, he dies. If I had bound the last wound instead of unbinding the old wound, he would have lived, but in the heat of the moment I couldn't focus and I got him killed.\n\nThere's silence. I head back to his safe house with the barricades and I take all of the best food we have scavenged so far from the fridge, with a plan to rendevous with him at his new spawn location.\n\nHis new character spawns, incredibly luckily, in MY safehouse. Barricaded windows. Two story for look outs. Sheets over everything to stop any zombies peeking inside. TONS OF FOOD IN THE FRIDGE.... oh and a bunch of turd weapons and backpacks. Sorted.\n\nI run back to meet him and we begin our plan of scavenging the streets for food and stockpiling it all over again. But this time, his character looks like Patrick Stewart.\n\nAnd my legs still broken.\n\nNext time we play, the plan is to get a small farm going, build a wall around the house to further protect it, and head out to try and find some assault rifles or axes.\n\nI honestly can't wait until they add cars and NPCs into the game. It's going to be incredible!!!\n\nMy friend came up with an awesome idea also, that there should be little missions that happen randomly like the power can just randomly cut off in a large area. Meaning that you have to go to a power plant or something to essentially fix it yourself. I added that without good electronics skills, you would have to just flip the switch, which would turn the power back on but it would set off a loud alarm which would make escaping and getting home difficult.\n\nThe hints that the military are going to be implemented and ideas about being able to sit in the back of pick up trucks shooting zombies while your friend drives around are the reasons why I've given up on all farming / survival games in favour of this one for the foreseeable future.\n\nCheck it out guys you won't be disappointed.","May 4","true","86.8"," 119 of 130 people (92%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","92","119","130","62","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/recommended/108600/","Duskspark","Duskspark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/","484 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nProject Zomboid is one of those rare zombie survival games that actually encourages you to survive in stead of facing wave after wave of the undead. It's truely unique with a visual style that may sadly not attract anyone, but its deep surviving system makes Project Zomboid one of the best zombie survival games in recent memory.\n\nThe Good:\n· Zombies aren't the only threat: you'll have to eat, drink, rest, calm down and avoid sickness among others in order to survive.\n· A simple yet clear looting system: there's your basic inventory and additional backpacks to carry more stuff around.\n· Retreat and recreate:  you could go outside and risk your life for some fresh water, or you can find a well-placed house your new home. Once you have what you need you can cover up the windows with sheets, stack your food and other recourses in fridges, closets and many others, relying on the water from the tap and the vegetables you plant.\n· Be the survivor you want to be for as long as you can: it's almost certain that you will die within the first half hour of playing Project Zomboid. Hell, I still die every half hour. But that teaches you that your approach to a certain situation was wrong. Did you kill al the zombies but died from a cold? Or did you try to stay inside and were forced out when all the food ran out? You can scavenge all houses (if you can make it that far, that is), you can choose a certain location and hold your ground, you can try to kill countless infected in order to scavenge in peace and so on. Options are almost limitless.\n· A true zombie survival experience: forget games like Resident Evil or Left 4 Dead that have you mowing down zombie after zombie in order to survive and progress. In Project Zomboid zombies can be the least of your worries when you play your cards right.\n\nThe Bad:\n· It's still in pre alpha, so some of the mechanics could use some extra polishing. The devs have been very active and do their very best to fix even the smallest of issues however, so I put my faith in them one hundred percent. This is the zombie game you'll want to play none the less, pre alpha or not.\n· The style of the game may not appeal to anyone. It feels pretty retro and yet uniquely innovative at the same time, so slapping a certain style on it isn't as easy as you'd think.\n\nThe Ugly:\n· Project Zomboid is gorgeous for what it aims to be. Obviously triple-A quality isn't expected (once again, depends on the style you like) but it manages to be pretty enough in terms of animations and effects to be immersive none the less.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nI have played unfortunately little games like Project Zomboid and I'm very glad the devs managed to create a one-of-a-kind zombie survival experience like this. It's thrilling, it's atmospheric, and it's everything you'll love from the zombie-genre. 8.5/10","February 27, 2014","true","11.9"," 120 of 133 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","120","133","0","9"

This game has something that I've never seen before in other zombie survival games. This game encourages you to team up with others and support eachother. Sure, there are people who will kill you for your stuff, but I have never met any. I think that this is because of how realistic the game is.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a game where broken bones and injuries take a pretty long time to heal, and you don't just bounce back. Additionally, food and weapons are not readily available in multiplayer. It gets to the point where the game is so hard that teaming up with others is an obviously wise move, compared to murdering them for the rare chance that they have a weapon or food. What I'm saying is that this game often makes you think like you're in an actual zombie apocalypse situation, where people are worth more than just what items they have.\n\nOnce I fell out of a two story building's window and ended up breaking a leg. Remember, Project Zomboid is not a game where mending broken bones and injuries just means slapping on a bandage. Broken bones are supposed to take weeks to heal in this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuckMeinAssholeHarter/recommended/108600/","FuckMeinAssholeHarter","Üven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuckMeinAssholeHarter/","143 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter almost two and-a-half days of my life invested into playing this game, and it now being one of my favourite games of all time, I feel it was only fair that I spent a little time writing a proper review for it. So, here goes.\n\nThis game, is actually the greatest of the great, to say the least, in the whole 'Zombie Sandbox-Survival' and now 'PVP/PVE Multiplayer Survival' genres.\n\nThe gameplay, to begin with is intense, fast-paced and complex to the greatest extent of these phrases I use to begin to even attempt to describe my feelings. The Indie-Stone, a small, multicultural dev-team have now spent day-in, day-out on this... Masterpiece, the first word to come to mind, since 2013. And boy, has it come far.\nEach patch, brings more and more depth and accompanying excitement, time and time again. And with the full-release 1.0 Update on the horizon, being in full manufacture by the small, yet just so detrimental and capable Indie-Stone most likely at this very moment.\n\nI am excited, to say the least. Off-topic, but back on track - Gameplay.\n\nThis isn't just your run-of-the-mill, chop-zombies-heads-off kind of game - Deep systems of mechanics, player development through skill points and experience, micro-management to the extent that we're keeping our own little person alive, in the same ways we keep ourselves alive today.\nYou will need to deal with fatigue, sickness, poisoning, infection, dehydration, malnutrition, exertion, broken bones, burns and our favourite; boredom. All fueled by decline in living standards accompanied by surviving successfully - Or in most cases, unsuccessfully, in a Zombie-Infested Knox County, Kentucky.\n\n- Combat is superb, with all the basic stuff; damage increase with skill levels, defense increase with skill levels. But then you throw in the fact that an average fire-axe used by Fire Departments in the United States weighs up to ten pounds, and your character only got five hours sleep because he got home from that loot run the night before far too late, you're gonna have a bad time - Damage decrease with exertion, damage decrease with ill-effects on the body, damage decrease if you just jumped from a second-story window to escape near-death.\n\n- Mechanics and Micro-management, eat, drink, farm, rest, stockpile, make a run to town, get scratched on your left arm trying to face one-too-many zombies with only a spoon for a means of self-defense, run home, open your first aid kit, tip everything out, clean your wound with whiskey, stitch the wound, disinfect a bandage with the same bottle of whiskey, apply the bandage, take some freakin' pain killers like Max Payne, sleep it off, bandage is dirty when you wake up, repeat steps 700-9,000,000. This game, will make you stress, more than you do, in real life - Especially if you are running a 5 month character, and your character is a hypochondriac. (One of the many customizable traits offered to you upon creating a character.)\nFarming is a huge thing, especially late game, depending on the fruit/vegetable you are growing, your harvest can take weeks of careful nurturing before you are able to reap your 230 Fresh Potatoes, and not be able to eat them, tortured by the fact you have to watch them go rotten, because you were simply unable to eat them all before the lack of refrigeration got to them. (Which may not be a problem, as alternate means of electricity generation are speculated/planned for the game's future! But that doesn't mean everyone will be able to wrap their thick mind around operating a 2,200-Watt Ryobi Generator! Professions, in their linear current state, are planned for a huge overhaul, in which certain lines of work, will restrict certain commodities to a particular person with the appropriate experience.)\n\nThis is enough for now I feel, I've spent about twenty minutes typing this, sharing my opinions and what-not.\nIf I think of anything else to add, I'll be sure to edit this and make additions where appropriate, setting aside this is already a massive wall of blabbering text to begin with.\n\nSaying that I 'recommend' this game, is an understatement, in all honesty.\nIf there was a way to donate, without purchasing the game over and over, I probably would have by now. There just isn't any words that begin to describe how exceptional Project Zomboid is, nor are there ways I can begin to thank the Indie-Stone for providing me with *days* of entertainment, at such a low cost, and with such an up-to-date forum and blog, providing your weekly Mondoids every Tuesday (Monday for America, I'm an Australian :P ) , there are no words other than : "You are one of the most amazing Development Teams to ever exist in the Indie Game content-base, and this is one of the greatest games ever created to date."\n\nWell done.","May 5, 2015","true","86.2"," 109 of 121 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","109","121","9","5"

Latest Edit: June 29, 2015\n\nPros:\n\nZombies don't 'spawn' in.\nAll the zombies in the town spawn at the start. Zombies can't spawn inside the safe area you set up. Realistic, and also an issue a lot of games get wrong. This also makes it technically possible to kill ALL the zombies in the game - good luck with that though.\nEdit: Zombies do now spawn in, but not in areas you are in - aka no 'magic zombies' like I mentioned above. Sandbox options allow this to be tweaked.\n\nThe isometric style works well for the genre.\nThe more 'old school' method of graphics actually enhances gameplay - especially if you are playing on a lower spec PC. You can have hundreds of zombies comming at you - and its not going to crash or lag. This simply cannot be accomplished realistically and effectively in a full 3d first person high-res format.\n\nYou aren't a super man.\nYou can't carry 6000 cubic feet of dirt, or wood, or potato chips. You are forced to make realistic decisions as you would in a real zombie apocalypse. Simply running through and clicking a 'loot all' button is not how this game functions. Also, don't expect to jump 6 feet into the air, or run 35 miles per hour either (Edit, a very fast character is currently possible, but with severe drawbacks). You also have realistic amounts of ammunition, which has weight - so even a well-off survivor isn't going to be spamming bullets.\n\nWhen you die, you're dead - or undead.\nRegardless of if you like this or not - you can't deny: Things just got real.\n\nGeneral Realism\nFood can spoil. Planned sickness and and infection (non zombie) system with medical system to combat such issues (Implemented Now). You can scavenge for food (bugs and berries). Fishing. Trapping. Hunting (Planned). Fatigue (Needs Tweaks). Mood system (Patiaally implemented).\n\nGood Community\nIts in the early stages of developement - and it already has a modding community thats doing some pretty good work - in fact, the developers are aware of this and support this, even working with a modder to incorporate their mod into the base game. (This has happened more than once now) Indie developing at its finest.\n\nGood Multiplayer\nYou can survive the end times with friends, or duke it out with them in the zombie apocolypse (Pvp needs tweaks, and those tweaks are planned) (Some tweaks already implented, I have not yet tested them.\n\nPlanned Singleplayer and multiplayer NPCs\nHigh quality NPC's planned, with the same functionality and needs as players. They eat the same, they kill them same. etc.\n\nVery good sandbox customization. Almost everything you could think of can be tweaked for your own personal optimal experience. Growth rates of plants, abundance of food, stregth of zombies and how often they spawn, or if they 'respawn'. Level of experience progression. All of these things can be tweaked to a players preferences.\n\nSeveral character profession options with more being worked on and added.\n\nCons:\nYou cannot rotate the camera.\nYou cannot and you won't ever be able to. It doesn't break the game in any way, but its a drag, we just have to deal with it.\n\nNeeds more hotkey options.\nItem binding buttons for switching to various items while still moving. Craft X options. Cook X options. (Upon release I'd like to play with a group, and it will just be easier for the guys cooking and whatnot.) Quality of life improvements mostly. There should be a hotkey to drop bags in a pinch if you need to abandon weight and run. There isn't\n\nWould like to see some minor automation. (Some of this has been implemented, much to my delight.)\nEx. You can build using wood at your feet currently, but if its a space over, you have to move it, or hold it to use it - all entered as separate commands. I would like a 'use nearby' option to be toggleable, for example. If I tell a guy to build a wall, I would like for him to walk (or run if toggled) back and forth to the wood pile and wall and build the wall/ floor, etc. if its reasonably close. It should also be toggleable to prevent this if unwanted. I would also like to see this with the cook or craft X options. Streamlining repetitive menial tasks improves the experience.\n\nRealism. and Lategame Tweaks. (This has been largely fixed with new zombie migration patterns and respawn behaviors. Only experienced players will be able to outplay zombies consistently with the difficulty turned up. This is a very very good thing for this game.)\n\nThe realism is good, but with realism comes even more expectations. I would like to see food preservation options. I would like to see societal rebuilding in the lategame (especially with NPCs) However due to the lategame currently being somewhat easy, I suggest that new challenges are thrown into the mix. Horde Migrations (Planned). Bandit/ Raider group - From another town? Vehicles and weapons to combat you with - that you can get if you win perhaps? Restore power (In minor ways). Restore running water (Partially). The idea is that eventually you must die, but farming made it possible to live indefinitely. I think surviving forever should be possible - but should be made difficult. Dudes attacking with machine guns and zombie hordes will always be a real threat.\n\n\nWaiting.\nLots of planned features. Good features, but features that take time, and as the indie market and development process is a somewhat new phenomenon, and it goes against the modern world's fast-life culture, it can be difficult at times. Movable funiture, Portable Storage (Wheelie bins, Wheelbarrows), Vehicles. NPC's. NPC's.  . . . . NPC's. All things we're waiting for.\n\nMinor Concerns\n\nTweaks Needed\nThere are various things that don't quite work that well yet, and need to be solved, like sleep/no sleep options in multiplayer - as well as how some moodles function (moodles are buffs/debuffs/warnings that describe various status effects on your character) - but the game is early release, so it gets a pass on those things for the time being.\n\nThe map is huge, but there is no 'random' map - and your map options are limited.\nThe only map options are what region/town on the map in which you spawn. The base map is fantastic, and features a good mix of environments, and they do continually expand the map. (If map expansion continues - especially beyond release - then one map only will make a lot more sense and this will go into the 'pro' category -  Especially if the map becomes ALL of kentucky like some rumors have suggested) [Even if its DLC, or if modders have to do this - DO IT. lol] - More maps are being made by modders as well.\n\nThe biggest issue for me currently is multiplayer sleeping. Currently, sleeping is simply removed from multiplayer, but I would like to see the option for a 'minecraft style' sleeping arrangement that is not default, but can be enabled for private servers. Removing a very integral requirement/need from characters in multiplayer really hurts the multiplayer experience. I know this will be resolved before final release, but in the interim I would like to see some options so we can at least pick our 'downside' to multiplayer sleep rather than have that experience choice made for us.","November 9, 2014","true","291.2"," 84 of 89 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","84","89","0","0"

I suppose I'm dying as I tell you this? If so, shut up and read. It'd be rude not to.\n\nI woke one morning, in the bathroom, and drank from the shower. Not really sure why, I just felt compelled to. I considered slurping some toilet water, but decided against it and left my bathroom. Not sure why I slept in there, either, but I was still alive. So f**k it, doesn't matter.\n\nI looked around my kitchen and decided I could no longer stay. Supplies were limited, and my dwindling resources would only get worse. So, after a quick raid of the cabinets, I was on my way. Armed with only pickles and beef jerky, I crept through the wooded plains of Kansas. Oh yeah, it was in Kansas.\n\nI'm going to f**king die in Kansas.\n\nHooray.\n\nEvery so often I would see herds of zombies (zomboids?) shuffling through the woods or on the city streets, and while one or two would attempt to give chase, they were slow shuffling meatbags that I quickly outpaced. I assume they got bored or just ran into trees, but when I arrived at the Country Market convienience store, I stopped to check the path I had taken. No zombies had followed.\n\nF**k it. Time to raid the store.\n\nThere was nothing in the store except a jar of mayonnaise. It was half eaten.\n\nAs I stared in confusion at the jar, I heard a voice from outside. "Hey!" it called, "Over here!" it continued. I looked, surprised to see another human. Hey, the text said this was how -I- died, didn't expect I'd have to share my dying spotlight with some other jerk. He climbed through the broken window of the store and cut his hand open on the glass.\n\nI laughed at him, and then shouted in surprise as he'd led a zombie directly into the store, shambling through the window after him. We both fled out of a window opposite the entrance it arrived, where I proceeded to cut my hand on escape. Why did karma always screw me? When we had cleared the zombies, we exchanged. . . something akin to pleasantries. He was a lumberjack, though his name isn't important. This is my story, screw you.\n\nWe decided to stick together, to find tweezers. You wouldn't believe how difficult it was to find tweezers. Instead of tweezers, sick of that word yet?, we found a third person to join our parade of misfortune; Billy Mays.  At least, he kept saying "BILLY MAYS HERE! WITH..." before any actual sentence.\n\nGood to know the zombie apocalypse happened circa 2008.\n\nA short time later, he'd found a home to call our safehouse. It was secluded, mostly free of zombies, and all the windows were boarded; meaning the dead couldn't see in. We'd found our new home. Alas, tragedy struck mere minutes after we settled in.\n\nDexter the Lumberjack wasn't happy. He demanded to know why I would put my food in my bedside cabinet instead of in the fridge. "It spoils that way!" he said, "All this is rotten now!"\n\nI munched on a stick of butter while glaring daggers into him. And then I ate a second. He wouldn't stop mouthing off, so while shirtless (oh yeah, Billy Mays had taken his shirt off at some point and was rushing around the town showing off his self-described 'beautiful chest hair') Billy Mays was out. . . I attacked Dexter.\n\nBeing a lumberjack he was pretty fit, but my sneak attack gave me the upper hand, helping me win the duel in the end. I stood over his dead body, satisfied, as I looted his corpse.\n\nI mean this literally. I looted his corpse. I put his body in our fridge, on the top shelf. I didn't want it to rot. He laid right next to my jar of pickles, when I noticed a rotting, dead mouse in his shirt pocket.\n\nWaste not, want not, right?\n\nI flipped the oven on and tossed the rotting carcass in.  Shirtless Billy Mays returned around this time, and I asked him to get a Leek from the fridge to help with the meal. For some reason he screamed and called me "disgusting" as he stormed out of the house. He left the fridge door open.\n\nSeriously, what'd I do?\n\nThe smell of the cooked rat meat was delicious, I can't describe anything like it. By the time I pulled the baking tray out of the oven, I was salivating at the taste. Without hesitation, I bit into the charred fur. And then I took another bite. I ate it all in one sitting; organs, spine, fur and all, though I feel this angered a passerby who happened to barge in, shouting obscenities at me. His name was. . . eh. . . I don't know.

Now I'm not.\nI started in my house. It was a small little cottage, in a suburb close to the city.\nBut there was a couple of pieces of food in the fridge, so I knew I needed to go out and actually scavenge.\nI did not know things were this bad though. Right when I stepped outside, one of them spotted me.\nNot wanting to lead it inside, I ran around the outside of my house. Little did I know that an entire group of them waited around the other side.\nI panicked and they spotted me. As they slowly shambled towards me, I ran back into my house into the bathroom. I frantically shut the door behind me. As soon as I did that I heard my windows shatter, along with pounding on my door and many low groans.\nI knew I couldn't stay there.\nI, as quietly as possible, snuck out my bathroom window while the horde pounded down my doors. I snuck past them and made my way to another small house down the road.\nOn my way I had to take down one of them with my fists. I frantically beat the infected woman down until each my blows were responded with a crunch. I searched her body to find a pistol and six bullets.\nWith that I felt invincible! Finally I had a weapon to use against them.\nNow when I got there I was exhausted. My house was destroyed and I had nowhere to go and no one to even talk to. I didn't even bother to check the house or close the curtains. I just immediately sunk into the closest bed I could find. I quickly fell into a deep slumber...\nSuddenly, I sprung up. I heard a window smash, and two figures were climbing through it, into my room. Terrified, I grab my pistol and fired at them, only landing about two shots.\nThat was my mistake. I heard hundreds of more groans outside. The sound was deafening. I sprinted through the house to escape. But just as I opened the door, another one of them was right behind it! I fell back, only to have one of the ones from earlier grab and bite my hand. I jerked it away, leaving my left hand cut and bleeding bad. I scrambled past them to the nearest room I could find.\nAs soon as I got in I slammed the door behind me. I was in another bathroom. But this one had no windows, no other doors, no ways to escape. As I turned back the way I came there was a loud 'thunk' on the door. It was quickly followed by another one.\nScared for my life, I sunk back into the corner. I was still bleeding badly and was starting to hurt real bad. I had no meds, so I took of my sweater and tore it up to form a makeshift bandage.\nHours pass. The banging on the door had continued relentlessly. I was still bleeding real bad and hurting even worse now. It felt like my bones would break with each move.\nI was now starting to think I was infected.\nThat sudden thought of dying sparked something in me. I suddenly felt brave. I could take on whatever was outside. It didn't matter that I was half awake and starving. I could do it.\nI powerfully swung the door open, only to knock back one of them onto the floor. It seems as if the rest of them just straight up and left after their meal "got away". I bravely stomped it down, and opened the door to take on the world.\nI ran straight to the city in my fit of bravery.\nBut the city quickly ended my fit of bravery.\nThere were a lot of them in the city. It seemed like tons were waiting around every corner.\nFeeling defeated, I sheepishly slinked down an alley to go back. Only to have one of them at the end spot me. As I prepared to fight it, all the pain, hunger and tiredness from earlier flooded my body again.\nI tried to fight, but was powerless against the creature. I pulled out my gun, but was in no condition to shoot, much less aim. I obviously missed.\nThat made it worse. The crowds funneled into the alley to feast on me as my body quickly was torn up. I drifted out of consciousness, into dark oblivion...\n\n\n\nAlso you can garden.\n","June 15, 2015","true","25.1"," 81 of 87 people (93%) found this review helpful 69 people found this review funny","93","81","87","69","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BadPunsBadTime/recommended/108600/","BadPunsBadTime","Lúcio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BadPunsBadTime/","76 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYou start off as a survivor in the apocalypse with nothing but your shirt, trousers and shoes. Luckily you spawn in a house which appears to be zombie free, giving you a chance to search for some food and a weapon. You wander around checking each draw, shelf, cupboard finding nothing but a pen, can of dog food, load of clothes and some nails! You've been in the apocalypse for a few months now but luckily electricity and water are still on. You check the fridge for supplies and find some uncooked chicken and watermelon. This won't last you very long but it is better than nothing. You decide you have to go out and look for more supplies if you plan on surviving any longer in this world. As you go outside you spot one zombie looking away from you, the only thing you have is a pen but it will have to do. You sneak up behind the zombie and jab the pen in its head, instantly killing it. Searching the body you find a diamond ring. In the previous world this might have been worth something but in this one it is worthless. You walk towards the opposite house and peer into the window. Seems clear. You open the window and climb in. Scavenging the entire house you find some supplies and a baseball bat, your first real weapon, sweet! But it looks like you had your back turned away for too long, a zombie sneaked up on you, luckily you turned around just in time and pushed it on to the floor and smash its head. Seeing it is getting dark you decide to close all the doors, get a bite to eat and then go upstairs to bed.\n\nYou wake up to the sound of gunshot in the distance. You look outside and see a horde of zombies walking towards your house! It just isn't your day. Looks like some of them spotted you and they are now banging their faces on the door, you rush downstairs and open the back door only to see more zombies, you turn around and run back upstairs, ripping your shirt and trousers off, turning them into a rope. You slam the bedroom door closed and throw the rope out the window. You quickly climb down the rope and run off down the road in nothing but your boxers and shoes. Since you are sprinting you're making  a lot of noise, causing even more zombies to start running towards you. You smash a window of a nearby house only to have the burglar alarm go off, bringing even more zombies to your location. You can't go back now! You jump into the house dive into the corner. They start pouring through the windows and doors. No escape. No hope. You take out a pencil and notated, writing your final words onto it. You have one last meal, a sip of whisky and whip out your bat for one last stand. They burst down the last door and charge straight at you. You whack at them but it is no use. They grab and surround you, pinning you down. You open the health tab to see everything flashing. Left arm being eaten, right leg gone. Then finally, you pass.\nI initially dismissed this zombie game as I thought it was going to be a 2D version of Dayz. How wrong I was, Project Zomboid exceeds my expectations, having everything I desire in an Indie game. Unlike Dayz, PZ is much easier to understand, a LOT less buggy and more vast in the zombie apocalypse.\nWhile the ingame map isn't randomly generated, it is large enough to keep you wandering for days (but there is an  online map	 [pzmap.crash-override.net] which helps you to pinpoint your location quickly). What you get in the game however is randomly generated. Anything you find in one play through may not be there in the next. But as one would expect, certain items will be found in certain places. By this I mean if you find a food shop, you will be more likely to find a load of food. If you find a construction site you are more likely to find a bucket full of concrete and a sledgehammer etc. I've only had it for a few days but I'm loving every bit of it. Some of the best things in the game currently are:\nHealth system - You get shot in the shoulder, you're going to need to pull the bullet out, disinfect the wound, stitch up the wound and bandage it. (pull out the stitches too soon and it will reopen).\n\nViewpoint - You see from your characters view point, not yours. If there is something behind your character you won't see it until it is right on top of you. You may hear a groan though, giving you a chance to retaliate.\n\nTraits - You character can be altered to survive different situations. One trait will make your character stronger, giving you extra damage, carry weight and knockback. While another might make you less prone to getting sick. This will cost points which you gain by picking negative traits, which give you more points depending on how severe it is so the total is 0 or more.\n\nJobs - You can pick a job you had before the apocalypse. Currently you can pick to be a police officer, fire officer, construction worker, night guard, ranger or unemployed. All but unemployed give bonuses corresponding to the job. For example, A night guard will need less sleep than everyone else. Police officers are better with guns. Currently they have plans to add even more jobs. UPDATE:   More jobs are coming next build [projectzomboid.com]\n\nTime - Over time things will change. The power and water may be on for the first few months but after that will shut off, leaving fridges, ovens, microwaves, taps and lights all useless. This means you'll either have to start making camp fires to cook and containers to collect rain water or finding non-perishable food and bottled water. Over time everything will also decay. The first month in the apocalypse will look quite tidy but a year later everything will be overgrown, cracking etc.\n\nShelter - When you need to rest you can't just go in a house and jump in a bed. Zombies may see you and start crawling in your house while your asleep. Unless you are in a zone with no zombies, you'll have to hang up sheets by the windows to stop zombies from spotting you in your house (this also stops you from looking out while they are closed so you'll have to rely on hearing). To be extra secure you could barricade all the windows and doors.\n\nSafety - Once you got a nice house, barricade the windows and the doors you might think you can stay in there for a few months. The game however might throw random noises in some direction like a helicopter flying over by or a gun shot, causing zombies to go towards the direction it came from. This may be towards your house, threatening your safety. Although they haven't seen you, you haven't seen them either. It could be 3 zombies outside moaning or 50. They may be on the other side or right in front of your doorstep. The only way to check is to look out, but if you look out you might be seen.\n\nSkills - You can level up as you use items or do certain things. These include how fast you can climb, how fast you can run, how well you can give first aid, how well you can cook, how good your aim is, how well you can barricade etc. This can create roles in a multiplayer server (one player might be the cook while another the doctor).\nIf you love zombie games, I definitely recommend you buy this. Beware this is still in early access so you won't have the full game and there will be bugs (although haven't found any at all yet). Compared to some other Indie games, this advances quickly (Previous update was on the 8th of September, current one was released unstable on 3rd of November and properly released late December). I am quite pleased with it. This game was gifted to me by a very kind stranger but if I knew it was this good, I wouldn't have spent all my money on other games and I would've spent it on this. While I can see it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is certainly one hell of an indie game!","January 1, 2015","true","73.6"," 77 of 82 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","77","82","5","7"

Finished or not, it's one of the best survival games to date.\nProject Zomboid is a hardcore survival game with the works. You have to manage the usual things like hunger and thirst, but also new considerations like sleep, overheating, freezing, fear, sickness and infection. It's a balancing act that has lasting appeal with an ever growing variety of ways to deal with your situation. Which brings me to Early Access.\n\nI personally don't find the distinction between a finished game and an unfinished one to be all that useful. The feeling of fun that I have while playing a game doesn't care if it's "finished" or not. If your game is functional and enjoyable before it is officially released, then I'll happily give you money to continue creating a product that I would have probably bought anyway. After all, this same method is how we have come to enjoy many games that likely wouldn't have been made. Some games, perhaps most famously Minecraft, will likely never be finished, with new content being added on a regular basis. Project Zomboid is possibly in the same situation. If being in Early Access is one of your considerations against buying a game, then I hope this review is at the very least informative for you.\n\nZombie survival often turns into dumb action, so it's nice to see a game that is more The Walking Dead than Dawn of the Dead. The Zombies themselves aren't that threatening in small clusters, but the real danger comes in numbers. I had an experience where I had boarded up a house with a small vegetable garden, only to wake up in the middle of the night to a horde migration on its way to the city. I escaped, but my stash became inaccessible. After the initial frustration, I looked back and thought, "that's a really cool feature". Coming across an event as catastrophic as a migration or even something mildly hazardous like finding a zombie behind a door that you weren't expecting add excitement to the gameplay. Once your character is dead, you have to start a new game, so even being scratched by an unnoticed zombie can be devastating, and in more than one case, lethal. I love this. You approach scavenging cautiously. You pick your targets and pass over ones that you think would end badly. It's an elegantly designed difficulty curve that while not unique to Project Zomboid, has been well implemented.\n\nA large part of the game is character progression. You create your character with a basic background and positive and negative traits, customise the games difficulty settings to your preference and then are dropped into rural America to fend for yourself. There are a selection of skills available to you. The way they improve is simple. The more you use a skill, the better you get at it. Thats it. This encourages variety in the way you play your game as new options open up the better you get at a skill. Currently there are 20 skills. Most are related to different physical abilities, but there are ones that affect how well you can farm, build, cook, trap, fish etc. While the system itself works mostly without player interaction, it's still nice to see something going on under the hood in a genre where most games are just content with a hunter-gatherer style of gameplay.\n\nSo what actually is the scope of the game? Well, when you start you literally just have the clothes on your back. Among your first concerns are food, water and a safe shelter to sleep through your first night. You will scavenge for anything of use and try to carry as much as you can without making you a slow, easy target for nearby zombies. Once you've found a nice place, preferable close but not actually in a town, you'll probably want to go about barricading it to reduce the risk of zombies breaking your windows or even worse, just wandering through the back door you forgot to close. Once you have found your new home, you'll go about nicking as much as you can and dropping it off for later use. Eventually, the utilities will be shut off, so you'll have to find alternatives to using refrigerators to keep food fresh and taps for easy access to water. Long before this, you'll need to consider actually growing and catching food yourself, a task made difficult by roaming walkers. This status quo balancing act can go on for months until you finally run out of bandages or meds to keep you going. I found the variety of things to manage to be really immersive, thanks in no small part to the attention to detail. If zombies are banging on your door, your character will become anxious so you need to give him sedatives or risk him being less effective when it comes time to run.\n\nI really liked Project Zomboid. It has a wealth of content in its current state and still has new things added to it each time I play. It is everything that I want from a survival game in a package that clearly has had a lot of care and attention put into it. Again, being an Early Access title, you'll have to decide for yourself whether you'll find value in this purchase. I certainly feel like I got my money's worth.","December 29, 2015","true","52.1"," 100 of 115 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","100","115","7","1"

You'll usually get an answer Very quickly (either from the developers or another player).  Plus the developers release weekly email updates on what they've accomplished to improve the game.  (I've read reviews complaining about the developers and I just don't understand - it seems like they're in CONSTANT contact with the players).\n\nUnfortunately, this game is still in early release.

It's not a DayZ clone, it's full-out survival, a thing this genre needed done right. REAL survival. Not a Free-For-All PVP Walking Simulator.\n\nGetting into a fight with even a single zombie can be dangerous, as a bite nearly guarantees that you will be infected. Scratches can also infect you, but it's not as likely as being bitten will. Always travel with a weapon ready, but be careful with what you use. A gun can bring in a MASSIVE amount of zombies from EVERY direction.\n\nOn top of that, weather and temperatures will affect your health as well. Out in the rain too long and got sick? Stay in your shelter and take it easy for a few in-game days. Too hot out? You'd better have something to drink.\n\nIf you survive all of the above, your life will get much, much harder. Eventually, water and electricity shut off for good, so you'll need to farm your own food and drink from wells or rain collecting barrels which you can build.\n\nThere's a lot more to the game, but I don't want to make this review too long.

If you are not into graphics and special effects and you want to play a sandbox survival game. Then this is a must for you.\n\nThe game has payed a lot of attention to survival detail. Your health is not only a bar that fills with red colour. You have to deal with stress, boredom, deseases and exoustion. You have to be prepared for situations, take a breath after fighting, probably smoke a bud and drink some whiskey before you continue looting or your character may become too stressed, have a nervous crysis breakdown or become insomniac and never get good rest. When hit by a zombie except the chance of infection your wound will start getting infected if you don't change and sanitise your bandages. Your inventar is not just a bunch of square containing things. It is complex and you have be aware of your speed and your overall stamina because you will have to cope with wearing a bagpack and sport bag in one hand, and probably a gun or something to defent yourself with in the other.\n\nThe electricity and water will stop. There will be no endless supplies of food and water. You will eventually want to start gardening, building and fishing because sooner or later you will run out of it and you will die or get a desease.\n\nThe game is really slow, don't expect forever runnig and forever killing.\n\nCons - the graphics are really bad, looks like the first Sims game. I was expecting when I zoom in for the game to scale the textures but instead everything gets really pixelated. It could go as "art" but if the game could have mroe HD feel would be better.\n\nPros - best survival game I have ever played and I have played a lot (resent are The Forest, DayZ SA, 7d2d and How to survive). The way you interact with the world is really easy and intuitive. You have to really mind all the small details.\n\nAnd for the end of my reviw just one thing - never - ever - ever - EVER forget your oven ON in your main HQ ...","December 15, 2014","true","14.1"," 86 of 98 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","86","98","0","0"

Not long ago, I was an aspiring cinematographer that just finished his work on a movie soon to be released; had a party with my wonderful friends to celebrate the wrap. Was about to propose to my girlfriend, Liz.\nBut now, I am all alone. It's a weird, terrible feeling to know you are alone in this world. It reminds me of the moment when I got lost at a mall, separated from my mom when I was a little child.\nNoone's there to give me a hug, to cheer me up, to dry my tears.\n\nAll my friends, my family, my colleagues turned into these terrible, mindless creatures that run after me and just have one thing in their minds: to disembowel me. Why am I still alive at all? It just doesn't make any sense to me.\n\nI need to leave our...I mean my house, all windows are broken and these monsters are just awaiting the moment I fall asleep to get me.\n\nJuly 24rd 2015\nI just found out that my neighbors fled to the north as I'm reading their note directed to their daughter who was expected to come home from college. I found her, in pieces on the floor and wallpaper. What a tragedy, she was so beautiful and smart.\n\nI knew her dad likes to drink so I took his whiskey and a few blankets. Maybe they get handy one day.\n\nI found a house to live in; but I don't feel safe- I need more blankets to disguise the windows. Luckily, the former owner had a good storage of food.\n\nOk, I will f***ing leave... just needed to kill five zombies- this area is polluted with these rats an I was wounded on my right hand.\nUsed the whisky to disinfect and blankets to bandage. Hopefully, it will help.... hopefully? Or isn't it better to die? I feel the urge to make a rope out of the blankets I found...\n\nJuly 25rd 2015\nI finally found a small, secure house. In the surrounding houses I found enough stuff to close the windows. I expected it would be difficult but in each house I found their owners turned to monsters. I don't know how many people I killed. Men, woman and even kids.\nAlthough I have a rather safe place to sleep, I feel like if each minute a small part of me dies.\n\nWhile accessing a house I cut both of my forearms on broken glas, I aches like hell. And finally, I accidentally triggered an alarm and there are hundreds of zombies around.\nI can't hear that sirene anymore. Hopefully, its battery dies soon. I feel like a  kid when I press my face into the pillow just not to hear that terrible noise of zombies scratching on the outside of my shelter.\nI'd like to drink the whisky to raise my mood but I need to keep it to clean my wounds.\n\nJuly 26rd 2015\nI spotted a zombie waiting on my front door.

HUGE, the devs are going to add Louisville(So I've heard) as well.\nThe map itself already sports four small towns, two of which are like mini cities in game, they are so big. The other two are like small towns(Still pretty big) Tons of woodland, farmhouses, hunting cabins and lakehouses. Gunstores, clothestores, supermarkets, trailer parks, and the Dreaded "The Mall."\n\nThe Mall has every item you could possibly want, But don't go there.\n\nSaying "The Mall" to a PZ player is like saying "Voldemort" to Harry Potter.\n*Everybody Shudders* (o.o)\n\nThe map is so big, you will probably never explore all of it in a week. I still haven't done it with all the hours I clocked in, I've barely scratched the surface.\nYou are currently only allowed to spawn in places like West Point and Muldraugh (the two mini cities)\nbut there are two smaller towns as well. One being called "Dixie" and the other Bedford (I think)\n\n- Realism (You will find no other game like this, it is incredibly challenging and makes you feel like you're actually surviving a zombie apocalypse.)\n\nThe water and power gets shut off, Nature overgrowth after a period of time, roads crack, food rots, seasons change affecting survival dramatically.\nYou could live off berries and trapping in the summer, but expect to survive solely on traps in the winter, as food is scarce.\n\n- Zombies (Because who doesnt love getting eaten at 3AM when you peek out of your safehouse)\n\n-Zombies beat down doors, smash windows and follow you out of two story windows, albeit jumping.\nThey Also Horde up, so dont be suprised. :P\n\n- Survival (Build traps, farm, build rain collectors, build your own house, walls, fish, forage, etc.)\n\n- Live practically anywhere (Its definately a game about decisions, tactics, and overall using your head. If you try to be A Rambo, you generally wind up dead within about 2 game days at the least (Standard Survival mode time, about 1 whole hour) Though I have been killed in just mere 16 in game hours. That being said, You can live anywhere you want, in any house, or just live in the woods.\n\n-Ridiculously challenging (Expect 1 zombie to do nothing to a door, but set off a house alarm and fail to leave the house in time, massive hordes will be beating down the front door in 20 seconds or less. Its realism in the game also makes it incredibly difficult as one bite and you're done. Zombies are everywhere, and one jump from a window, one untreated wound, eating a rotten bird or rabbit or just dehydration and you're done.\nJust like in real life, death is everywhere in this game; and it finds you eventually. It's not really combat based, the gameplay is more centered towards survival, so it makes you think.\n\n-It has Several mini games about trying to defend a house with randomly spawned items from hordes that increase in number. Great for Ingame strategy practice.\nHide behind that Bar with your ol' Twelve gauge and make a final stand, or barricade the windows and doors and ready that kitchen knife.\nThere was also a mini game where you wake up drunk in a burning house, but that brings back bad memories. I don't like to talk about it. ._.\n\n-Sandbox Mode, which is probably the most played game mode in PZ. Customise everything about your game, from Make zombies Sprinters (Like 28 Days later) or make them Shamblers like "Night of the living dead". You can customize their senses, i.e. how well they can smell fresh blood(Dont cut yourself on broken glass from those windows. :P), how well they detect sound, how well they can see...\nYou can increase the Zombie amount, Loot amount, season, time, The abundance of farming, foraging etc.\nYou can basically set the scenario how you want.\nBut Survival mode is the challenge, the default play of the game. Few make it past 3 months, even fewer live to see winter.\nThere are those who have survived over a Year in game, and they are what our little PZ community like to call "Gods" because if you bought the game an knew the situation we PZ players face, you too would call them "Gods" :P\n\n-Weapons: Whether you like it or not, sooner or later, you're going to have to fight. How you do that depends on what you prefer in real life. If you wanna kick open your safehouse and send the Undead back to hell with your sawnoff shotgun that you made, Go for it.\n\nIf you don't like guns and don't like the thought of stabbing with a knife, then nothing says "I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥" like flailing a claw hammer or some other blunt instrument in an attempt to fight the undead.\n\nIf you like Sticking to the shadows or Sniping from the rooftops with your hunting rifle, they got Sniper rifles with Scopes.\n\nIf you're passive aggressive they got pistols, meaning whilst you're trying to get out of that Gun store you're looting alive, you pop a couple zombies that are in your way and flee into the night with your 9mm as the Undead hordes chase after you.\n\nKeep to the shadows and live a quiet life with just your Club or blade, or be a tactical warrior who always looks to weigh any situation to their advantage, even if that means a couple boxes of 00 buckshot. (But Nothing says I'm pro like wiping out an undead horde with a camp fire.) :3\n\n-Guns: they got em. Shotguns, pistols and hunting rifles(Pretty accurate for Kentucky) with Customizations from long range scopes, ammo straps and using a Hacksaw to really polish your scattergun, if you know what I mean. ;)\nLasers for the pistols, red dot sights, etc.\nAmmo is pretty abundant if you know where to look. There are places to find guns all over the map, and zombies tend to drop pistols and ammo often (With the Lucky trait)\n\n-Fortify your base: Just like in real life, you can desperately kick in doors and make planks to barricade windows if you think that a zombie eating you alive whilst you sleep is gonna be a problem.\nThough nothing will save you if a horde comes and you chose to live in a one story house. D:\n\n-Jobs: Your character will be who you want them to be. If you choose the police officer as the job you had before the outbreak, then you will be calm in panicky situations and good with a gun.\nLots of Jobs to choose from though.\n\n- The Devs themselves are really loving, down to earth folks and respond to their customers and even ask for suggestions to add to the game. (Sometimes they even add it if they think its a good Idea) Which makes them unique. :)\n\nOf course I could go on and on (Which I already have done) :P But you get the idea.\n\nIts a really good game in that spectrum it offers far more than I mentioned, and I know its in Early access, so it isn't complete.\n\nCons\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nI live in Kentucky as I have stated, and the biggest problem I have seen that take away from realism in this game (Since it is based in Muldraugh) is that Kentucky is like most other states, except the people here, almost everyone and their grandmother owns guns, and hunting equipment. It rarely snows, and the summer heat is extremely intense, and it barely ever rains.\nThey got the extremely rural part right though. :P\n\n-It rains too often in game (Kentucky rarely gets rain, so our crops die alot. And the snow thing, we get a good snow about every 3 years, so ingame it should probably be rarer. It's usually just rainy and cold.)\n\n-Hunting and kitchen knives are rare in game, but in reality, Kentuckians own more knives than baseball bats, and golf clubs.\n\n-Guns are extremely Rare,  in reality as I have stated, every other household has a Gun here. I would expect it to be different in Project Zomboid.\n\nShoot, I watched my little 60 year old granny cut tree branches down with a Scattergun. Wait, what are we talkin about again? :P Yall take it easy and be sure an give this review a like or two.","June 5, 2015","true","174.1"," 76 of 86 people (88%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","88","76","86","17","0"

I Went outside and got attacked by zombies. I managed to kill a few with my pencil but got quite scratched up. I hopped the fence and got attacked again, My Pencil broke in a zombie skull and I got bitten on the arm. I managed to get away but was moving slowly due to my injuries. I found a house, ripped up a shirt and bandaged up my wounds. I went to the bathroom to look for some pain killers but found a zombie and got hurt again. I stumbled from the house and got attacked again, I headed towards some trees to try to lose the pursuing zombies but died just as I made it to cover.\nTime survived 6 hours. 4 zombies killed.\n\nAttempt 2.\n\nI spawned in a trailer park where I found a school bag which I filled with a selection of food from the fridge and a bottle of water.  I went trailer to trailer gathering more food until I found a baseball bat. I left heading north and found a house to stay the night. The house across the street looked like a good place for a base with a high fence around 3 sides. I went through neighbouring houses, sheds and garages for supply’s during the days and read some beginners books for carpentry and cooking by night. Zombies kept wandering into my garden over night and I had to clear a few out each day with my trusty baseball bat.  I found a warehouse while exploring and found a hammer, nails, saw and axe. After a day of chopping trees and sawing logs I closed off the entrance to my garden to a narrow opening and that seemed to keep the zombies out. I got good at killing zombies with my new axe while on supply runs, Things were going well. I got over confident and managed to scratch myself on a broken window. I bandaged it but after a two days of replacing bandages I had an infection. I pushed forward my plans to raid a medical centre I had seen a long way south. I travelled the train tracks and entered the medical centre. The alarm went off as I made my way through but I carried on stocking up on supplies even as I heard zombies entering the building from the front. I planned to hop out the back window when I was done but they came through there too, trapping me. I battled my way out of the building but was scratched and bitten and in a bad way. I headed to a nearby house I knew I was going to die. So I stashed my bags of gear in a cupboard and went outside to die.\nTime survived 8 days and 14 hours. 147 zombies killed.\n\nAttempt 3.\n\nI don’t know where I am but I've got a rolling pin and I’m gonna find my house and then go and get my stuff back!\n\n\nI would definitely recommend this game. I’m only interested in playing single player mode so I feel it really needs the planned NCP characters to add more interest to the game. Also looking forward to the addition of vehicles. The new animations in the weekly blog look like they will improve the look too.","March 4, 2015","true","32.6"," 89 of 106 people (84%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","84","89","106","30","1"

This game combines a zombie-survival gamemode with intentional pixelated graphics which makes the game one of my favorites. It has slow moving zombies that respond to the player's actions, such as firing a gun, or breaking a window. The game consists of many actions that the player may control, such as cooking, putting a sheet over a window so zombies/players cannot see in the house, boarding up windows/doors, and much more. Once you start playing it is hard to stop. 10/10 from me.","November 27, 2014","true","91.0"," 65 of 72 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","65","72","0","0"

I have dozens and dozens of games on steam but after a while I always start to get an itch to head back to the zombie infested worlds that I've spent hundreds of hours in already. PZ is not messing around and it will mercilessly end your existance. And again. And again. Then eventually you'll get some food, shelter, weapons, etc. and start feeling good about yourself. You might think you've "beaten" the game because there's no way you can die now. Then with no warning your power goes out, the water stops running, and all your food goes rotten. Yup. Such is life in the zombie apocolypse.\n\nProject Zomboid is a hardcore retro-style take on the zombie survival and Minecraft-esque games that have become so popular over the last several years. While there are games that do similar things to PZ, none do them quite as well. This is a hard game and it doesn't pretend to be easy. It demands both focus and patience. You're not going to just pick up a gun and start cleaning out the streets, you're going to be sneaking house to house terrified that you'll get seen and praising the heavens when you find a can of beans.\n\nEasily the best part of this game is the community that's built up around it. There are hundreds of mods available for the game in the workshop that add so much impressive content and whole new areas. The developers have done a great job of both adding their own content and working with the modding community to ensure that the game never gets stale. The multiplayer servers are also great. This is a game that will absolutely consume you if you give it enough of a chance.

Personally I had no trouble at all, it runs great except for occasionally closes out of the game completely upon exiting out of the current game, which should have brought me to the main menu.\n\nIt is often easy to forget that this game is still in early access. While there are many exciting items and features planned for the future, the game feels and plays almost like a finished game.\n\nHere are some features in the game at the time of this review that I like and/or appreciate and feel add a substantial amount to the immersion of Project Zomboid.\n\n-Crafting & Barricading.\n-*Combining.\n-Day & Night cycle.\n-Logical loot distribution.  In other words you will find loot in places that make sense in the world.\n-Hunger & Thirst system.\n-character creation process.  Play as a male or femle, name them, choose a pre apocolypse profession (each profession comes with bonuses) or unemployed, plus give them merits and flaws. (I am paraphrasing here, I forget what they are called in game).\n-Weather (rain, snow) and yes, seasons!\n-Temperature system.\n-The ability to create your own "custom sandbox" zombie apocolypse\n-Upgrading and repairing. Bat+hammer+nails=Spiked Baseball bat, then use tools to repair it when needed.\n-Item conditions. Weapons get damaged and then eventually break.\n-Functional L.O.S. (Line of Sight) for both players and Zombies.   In other words you can only see the zombies in the direction your character is facing.\n-Multiplayer. Lots of Servers to join.\n-Skill system where if you want to improve a skill, you have to keep using it...and live long enough to improve it! Also you can read books related to skills for a xp boost when said skill is used.\n*Combining. Example A: I already have a kitchen knife and a jar of peanut butter. Find some bread, use the knife to cut the bread, knife+sliced bread+peanut butter=peanut butter sandwiches.\n\nExample B: Enter a house that still has power. Already have a frying pan equipped. Look in the refrigerator. Frying pan+chicken+peas (perhaps with a dash of salt and/or pepper, optional) = chicken and vegetable stir fry. Turn on the stove, place the stir fry in the pan on the stove, cook, and yum!\n\nHonestly I am glad I paid full price. Yeah I know it might sound crazy, it was just on sale not long ago but honestly the devs deserve every cent.\n\nI would easily give this game in its current state a 9/10. *Important* Just keep one thing in mind, this game is hard. Actually for those who may not know, you CANNOT win. There is no cure for the zombie virus and I am not sure if that will ever change. Playing Project Zomboid is playing out the story of a character, the story of how they died. This may be a deal breaker for some, which is why I bring it up. There is no way to 'WIN" the game, you just survive as long as you can.","July 8, 2015","true","60.9"," 57 of 63 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","57","63","4","2"

It's hard to effectively convey how much fun this game is, because it doesn't seem like it would be fun and the trailers and screenshots do not do it justice, at all. But believe me when I say; if you're looking for a truely intense zombie apocalypse survival experience that is as realistic as it gets, where almost every moment incites true butterfly-inducing terror that resonates with your innermost being, while giving you all of this glistening, pant-soiling brilliance in a slightly retro, top-down, isometric view. This is your game.\n\nI mean, for pete's sakes, you have to change your bandages at least twice a day or you run the risk of making your wounds infected, which will slowly kill you, unless you disinfect them with alcohol and a sterilized bandage. You have to cover up windows with blankets, otherwise zombies will see you/lights inside houses and they absolutely, definitely, positively will check and break a window. When you get bitten? It slowly gets worse as you succumb to the zombie virus, you don't die instantly. You get paranoid of anything, you become fatigued and, after about a day, you die. Slowly, but surely. This game is cool as all hell.\n\nThe controls are easy to grasp and the game runs smoothly, even if you're running the server software the game comes with and hosting at the same time, which is something I do frequently, to play with friends. It's also very easy to set up and comes with it's own server options.\n\nSpeaking of options. Holy hell, the custom options for starting a new game are phenominal. You get to customize what your character is like, down to their personality as well as how often weapons spawn, how often things decay and what type of zombies you're dealing with. You could opt for a 28 Days Later feel, making them fast, strong and generally a massive pain in the backside, or if you're more into your Romero lore, you could set them up to be classic, brittle shamblers that seem to spot you from 700 lightyears away.\n\nOh yeah, it's hard as hell as well. Don't expect to live forever, like other zombie games seem to allow you to do. This game is very realistic and eventually, you'll most likely run out of food and water. If you do manage to ensure your indefinite survival, then congratulations. You'd probably end up surviving a real zombie apocalypse.\n\nThis game. Is awesome. 11/10. Best indie effort in ages.","February 8, 2015","true","12.4"," 45 of 46 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","45","46","4","0"

There will be NPC's added in future patches but the interactivity with these is still unknown, they will most likely be hostile.\n\nIn the early game your first challenge is finding a decent weapon, as a Spoon just doesn't cut it. However, breaking into peoples houses can set off security alarms, which attracts nearby Zombies that will chase you down unless your quiet and stay out of eyeline. During the first couple of weeks the Electricity is working so you can use household appliances like Ovens to cook food. It's not long before it turns off and you have to resort to eating canned food (if you have a can opener) or other dry products. Most food in the fridges will go off quickly as it is no longer chilled. You can cook your own meals by building a Campfire though I found this unnecessary as it's easy to stock pile large amounts of none perishables. Eventually the stored food will run out as well as the Water supply. You will have to come up with other ways of survival like Farming, Fishing and collecting Rainwater in Barrels. Learning Carpentry skills is essential as you can then use collected Wood to make all kinds of structures like Wall's, Box's, Furniture, even Barricades for your Doors and Windows to stop the Zombies getting in your safe House. BTW you can cut down Tree's with most weapons it just takes much longer than an Axe.\n\nThe game really is a survival sandbox with no real story except the one you make for yourself. Overall I enjoyed this game more so than games like DayZ. I like the isometric 3rd person viewpoint as opposed to 1st person as you can see if someone is sneaking up on you.\n\nThe developers have announced that future patches will contain NPC's and Vehicles which will add another dimension to the game.\n\nI give this game a solid 8/10 and can recommend it to people who like sandbox style survival games.\n\nTIPS: Always carry Beta Blockers with you as it reduces your panic level when around hordes of Zombies. Carry bandages & Painkillers as if you get bitten/scratched your less likely to turn if you attend to the wound immediately. Always carry a spare weapon as low durability can cause them to break. Take Drinks & none perishable Food with you as you may be away from your safe House for a long time. Find a "Large Hiking Bag" as it can carry the most items. When exploring buildings, whack Doors before you enter. This will let you know if there is a Zombie on the other side as they will start banging on the Door. Give yourself escape routes, when I enter a building I open all the Doors as you can quite easily get pinned down by charging Zombies. Take spare clothes with you (unless your already fully clothed) as you can die from Hyperthermia / Hypothermia if there is a sudden temperature change. Attack crawling Zombies from behind, they are slow to turn around and much less dangerous.","November 29, 2014","true","144.9"," 61 of 71 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","61","71","0","0"

All food was consumed, crops destroyed, ammo non existent. My weapons damaged, my body aching, my mind lost. I was wounded and in desperate need of medical attention. After rummaging through piles of bodies, I managed to find a dirty bandage. "I can't use this..." I said to myself, and after long contemplation and painful thinking I decided against it. "If I can clean it, I can use it" I dragged my broken body across half of town, exploring every inch of land in order to find cleaning materials. My last sip of water felt like days ago. I came across a shanty area,  a settlement of plywood, corrugated metal, sheets of plastic, and cardboard boxes. Wildly scavenging through heaps of sh#t, yes! A half empty bottle of bleach.\n\nI moved my way to a quiet and not known location, where I was able to sit and gather my breath. Frantically scouting to make sure I was ok, still sat down. I looked up into the sky and dreamed of what life used to be. "I need this bandage cleaned", opening up my bag to take out both the bandage and the bleach. "There is no threat here, take your time" I wish I had a mouse! I must of double tapped my track pad. With the bandage in my left hand, and the open bottle of bleach in my right, the double tap of the trackpad forced me to consume the bleach. Every last drop.\n\nStories were told of my valiant display of british grit, fighting off the barrage of zombies and ultimately falling to my death through a 16 hour massacre.

What they say they deliver not only is it a great game one of the only truly open ended games I have ever seen.   It also follows pretty much what would happen theoretically during a wide scale Emergency Event.\n\nThe Vanilla game is good, drop some Mods onto it and the entire game gets a depth that I have not seen in other franchises.  I have well over 2000 hours played on this game, but it needs to be said if you like a thought provoking game, where you will pay dearly for complaceny then this is the game for you.

I played it with my kids (there is an option to lift the zombies out) and tought them some fundamental survival skills though a game normal survival concepts work and pay off.\n\nI have also found the team at Indie Stone to be highly responsive to their gaming community and their pride in product shows.

Imagine climbing up a sheer cliff and then jumping off onto a giant comfy pillow.  That describes this game's difficulty curve.\n\nIn the beginning you will be unarmed, unskilled and uncertain of what to do.  After a few trial-and-error deaths you'll get the hang of combat, how to move around safely, and what sorts of items you need to bring back.  You'll learn that some skills, namely carpentry, are far more important than others.  At that point you'll be faced with a choice of building a carpenter character or grinding your existing character into a carpenter through endless repetitive tasks.\n\nWhy a carpenter?  One of the ultimate goals in this game is to build a safehouse that is impervious to zombie attacks.  You won't succeed without the carpentry skill, which lets you build walls, doors, storage devices and so on.  If you can build a wall around a water source and some dirt, you can eat and drink forever without risk of zombie attack.\n\nThis reveals the issue I have with Project Zomboid.  Once you have a nice stockpile and once you have a secure base, there is nothing else to do.  The zombies will never, ever be able to touch you unless you actively seek them out.  Even then, it's very easy to clear out the neighbourhood with an axe or gun to the point where you won't even see zombies anymore unless you set them to respawn in the world generation options.  In your safehouse you'll never run out of food or water so long as your sources are maintained behind safe walls.  Without the need to scavenge you'll have nothing to do except work on additional carpentry projects until you get bored, run outside with a shotgun and bag of shells, and court death in the middle of some giant horde.\n\nProject Zomboid says it is the story of how you died.  When you first start out, this will be absolutely true.  It's quite fun to sneak around town looking for bags of chips and planks of wood, although if you spend any time fighting you'll quickly learn how to lure zombies into chokepoints and kill them with impunity.\n\nThis game has been in Early Access for years.  I first played when you had to download versions from the Indie Stone forums, but I can't say that the game has really changed all that much.  It has a bit of a graphical overhaul, some additional features and types of loot, but also subtractions.  There used to be NPCs who would raid your house and hole up around town, but they've been removed and pending re-addition for ages.  All in all, it doesn't feel like the game has progressed significantly in spite of the years of development.  Likely, by the time a final release hits Steam 90% of the player base will have moved on to something else.\n\nThis is a single player review, but it also extends to multiplayer with friends.  It's even easier with a couple of friends to build an invulnerable safe house and wind up with nothing left to challenge you.\n\nFinal verdict:  It's quite fun for a few days, but once you get the hang of survival there will be no challenge.  Wait until if and when the game is finally done before you buy it, unless you love crafting games so much that you are desperate for a new one.  In that case, this game will tide you over.  If you have a lot of friends or want to play on a public server you can enjoy chaos, raiding and even warfare.  In that case the game may indeed be worth it.","September 8, 2015","false","26.3"," 73 of 97 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","73","97","0","8"

It's got depth, it's immersive, and when you are succeeding in your struggle to survive, it makes you feel like one man standing alone in the middle of the zombie apocalypse.\n\nYou can do all kinds of things in this game, fighting and avoiding zombies, obviously, but when you loot common-place items, you can use them in all kinds of ways.  Barricade yourself, create sheet rope to have an escape from a top storey window, cut down trees, create planks, build all kinds of defenses, structures and utility items.

However, this game is not another game where you play as "the Rambo of the apocalypse," shooting every zombie in sight, crafting better and better weapons. Instead, you play as the average Joe, who somehow managed to not become one of the hundereds of zombies occupying Knox County. Instead of having some crafting table where you can build a castle right off the bat, you need to find everything needed to build the walls just to protect your garden. The loot system works pretty well, you find stuff where you would normally find it. Houses have average loot, including food, bats, golf clubs, and the occasional gun or case of bullets. Warehouses will generally have crafting supplies, police stations will have guns and ammo, and so on. You will find the occasional out-of-place item, like a gun or bullets in the elementary school. You need to debate doing anything in the game, since one slip-up could spell certain death. There have been way too many times where I decide to go loot a building by the highway and am ingulfed in zombies. The dev team, The Indie Stone have done a superb job at creating this game, and every update makes the game much more fun, realistic, and, of course, difficult. You will not find a better zombie survival game out there, and I more than reccomend it.","May 10, 2015","true","152.0"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","40","45","3","1"

To be honest, I do not believe anything I say can bring justice to how fantastic this game is to me. Though I will attempt to keep this review as professional as possible, I do apologize if there are outbursts of bias within the contest. Project Zomboid is a top-down zombie survival game in which the player must create a character destined to die in the world with the goal of determining exactly how long they survived during the grueling face of an overrun population, with plagued populations of undead serving as the opposing force. Since this game is currently in Early Access at the time of this review’s posting, it does not yet contain all of the features that are planned for the full release. However, in its current build, I would recommend it at its current sale price.\nHere are just a few of the things that make Project Zomboid such an amusing title:\n\nThe Developers - I realize that this point is not a core component while playing the game itself, but I feel as though I must give recognition to the development team of Project Zomboid. I personally have never witnessed such a respectful cast of individuals when it comes to interacting with players and the game itself. As a primary mention, these individuals send notifications to subscribers consistently every Monday, termed Mondoid Monday by the Indie Stone, which provides readers with updates as to what ideas are to be implemented, answering questions from contributors, and informing players of the current build’s status. Though the game is currently in Early Access at the time of this review’s writing, these constant updates presented by the developers have the potential to comfort players such as myself as to the condition of the completed product. Project Zomboid may be considered by some to be concluded as it stands; this is much more satisfying in strict comparison to other Early Access titles that stereotype the build and tend to break promises.\n\nPre-Game Setup - In the general disarray that encompasses the world regarding defeating and surviving against an endless undead hoard, there are certainties in the abundance of pre-game editing that tailor the experience as one that is unique to the individual player.\n///  I would first like to speak about the initial world composition, which allows simple attributes while playing through modes such as Sandbox to be altered. With these features, the player creates how the apocalypse occurs by selecting a premade map, modifying certain functions such as how long a typical in-game day lasts-ranging from five minutes to a realistic twenty-four hours out of game-, and the period of time in which electricity and water will remain operational throughout the selected world. These attributes can be set to be more random while in Sandbox mode, but add so much to customization that they should not be overlooked; of course, the game was updated many times since my last online play-time so I may be missing out on some features as it stands.\n///  Character creation appears to be very simplistic but its intricate nature is revealed while the players flesh out their individual during play. The player selects a basic set of clothing as well as a profession, traits, and look; a character’s profession outline starting equipment and statistics while the character’s appearance is merely cosmetic. Character traits are where the game excels, though, as these allow the player to outline how they will possibly play. For example, a character with claustrophobia will be plagued with fear while indoors, but may have a trait which counteracts this. As players select possible traits, negatives must also be selected to even things out, so there is decent balance to this system.\n\nUndead Artificial Intelligence (AI) - The enemy AI react to players as you would expect them to: merciless, in a one-directional path with the intent of slaughtering the player’s created character to produce the end-game indication. As simple as this may sound, the undead AI in Project Zomboid is actually quite brilliant, as they can track your movements only if you are in a presented location-such as on the other side of an open window; a hoard crowds a character if a gunshot is heard. Interaction with these enemies intensifies the atmosphere of lay, and has likely been improved with more recent updates. Though neutral non-player characters are not yet present in Project Zomboid in the time of this review’s writing, tests by the developers suggest a promising finished product.\n\nGameplay and Mechanics - Your character has much more depth in-game then what is in their biography and statistics sheet. There are multiple conditions which must be monitored by the player-including thirst, hunger, fear, mood, and physical strain. Given status effects may afflict the player such as fatigue, and determine the player’s tactics, with enough openness to allow the use of multiple approaches; with a world infested by the undead this is highly necessary as the game’s open-world style should permit such an approach. Unlike other top-down zombie survival titles, Project Zomboid features an impression of realism few others can accomplish: line of sight is paramount for your character, which enhances the survival aspect perfectly; be sure to watch your back! Apart from the conditions and base statistics associated with your character, they can also learn new skills such as farming, carpentry, and cooking to perform unique and useful tasks by taking time in-game to read related books. This system permits the player to specialize in specific skills that may enhance play.\n\nTL:DR - I regretfully can say that there are some features such as the Steam Workshop and Creative mode that I have not yet experienced, however the base game is so fantastic that I would like to vouch for it being worthy of its current retail price of fifteen dollars. If you enjoy more realistic survival games and combatting or running from hordes of undead while scavenging a rather large world, then this game is most definitely for you. This title is also recommended for players who enjoy roleplaying as characters in an open-world adventure; I prefer to write journals for my characters to enhance this aspect. Please give this game a go even in its current Early Access state. Thanks for reading.\n\nDo you enjoy these reviews?

I played it when it was not very well developed. Then today I picked up a copy and I will share with you all my experiance.\n\nStarted out by clicking beginer.\nI am no noob to survivial games, so I started out in a nice house. It was a 1 bedorom flat with a open living/dining room. there were curtains on all the windows so I took the chance to close them after taking a glance out them to check my suroundings [It was all clear].\n\nI then had a small sence of security that I knew would not last for long, as all it takes is for my poorly spec'd char to make a noise and attract walkers (thankfully I did not see any runners).\n\nI then made my way to the kitchen and saw that there was 2 windows, one with no curtain and one by the door, which was really good as I did not want to open the door and be rushed by zombies.\nI grabbed a sheet I found and covered it over the other window.  The house was now poorly secured and would provide a temporary shelter. I then went though the house and looked for all things that i could put to use. Sadl all I found was some food, which I ate then decieded I had to journey out to the unknown or I would not survive an attack or defend my shelter, I looked out the windows and tried to get an idea of what was around me, I saw another house to the east of my location, so I had to get there and hope it was empty.\n\nAfter I left out the back door all sence of security left me, and I felt like a small part of a huge world. I looked around a bit and slowly made my way to the backdoor of the house, I then did not feel safe to just walk right in, so I snuck around to each window and peaked in and saw every room was empty, besides the one that did not have a window.\n\nI then entered the house via the backdoor, and started looking the house, I found a skill book (cannot remember which book it was) I then took a bat, some sheets, and some food, I then snuck back to the house I started in.\n\nAfter stuffing my face my character started feeling like a fat misserable person (depression kicked in). I then found a magaziene in the bookshelf and gave it a read hoping this might take the players mind of the depression, after a good 5 minutes of messing around I went to gets some sleep after going out and checking to see if the perimiter was safe and secure. I slept for 7 hours.\n\nI awoke with one thought; "How long can I survive like this"\n\nI searched and looted, and fought my way day by day, every day being harded than the last, food running shorter and shorter. I ended up getting caught while transvering the forest in the night (Which I still feel like an idiot for) I was panicing out in the rain in the dark, and was trying to get back to my shelter. I had not known that I had a pack of zombies on me, and I ran back into my shelter. within 2 minutes that had me surrounded so I knew I had no way out, I was a sitting duck, I managed to use up the ammo I did have and had to run upstair to fend off what I could before I met my maker, I was backed into a corner and fought to keep 15 zombies at bay with a hurt leg and bleeding for 3 minutes before I died...\n\n9/10 would die again and enjo my experiance anyday. was a good buy.

I have to say it's well worth the 15 bucks I spent.  The atmosphere is amazing.  When I play I usually turn off all lights, and then use a headset for a full immersion experience.  I love the fact that you make the story as you go along.  I haven't played for very long, but with that said I will be playing this game a ton from here on out.  In my last play through I lived 16 days.  I found a huge warehouse surrounded by loads of zombies.  I cleared them out for a full in game day.  Finally when I was done I searched the warehouse.  The power was off by this time in the game.  I was stumbling around in the dark as I forgot my flashlight.  I went to the 2nd floor trying to find a bed or couch to sleep as I was exausted.  I thought I saw a door......well was no door was a railing.  Fell to first floor and got stuck behind crates with a broken leg.  Eventually I died as I couldn't move.  I killed over 200 zombies, secured my safehouse area, gathered enough food and water to last me a month in game time, and the thing that kills me is that.

Seriously, this game is worth the 15 dollars, especially if you have a friend. It may be early access, and the devs might be a bit slow at releasing FULL new builds, but you can play the new builds in play testing pretty much every month. There is alot of polish on this game, which is probably why it takes so long to come out with new builds. This game is a SIMULATOR pretty much. Not a joke, you gotta eat, sleep, watch your wounds, not panic, not get tired....it's a tense experience all around. If you get bit, you might as well drink bleach or chug sleeping pills and wait for it to end, or go out in a blaze of glory. You can do whatever you want in this game, build a base at a motel, live in the forest by farming and collecting rain water, or just be a nomad. Just be prepared for when winter rolls around...... ANYWAY! This game gets a solid 9/10, completely reccommend. Only reason it isn't 10/10 is because, while it has enough content to justify even a 25 dollar price tag, it IS in early access. That comes with the full early access package of: Bugs, glitches, unfinished content, etc. But like i said before, these devs are trustworthy. And EVEN IF THEY DID run away with the money, it's still a game worth checking out considering it is comlpete enough to justify the price tag.","March 2, 2015","true","32.2"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","36","41","2","0"

They continue to show their passion for this project with regular updates, developer blogs, videos explaining new features, and much, much more. They have provided a strong example of how Early Access is supposed to be done, and I fully anticipate that they will have a full release of this game at some point (though, as far as I'm concerned, the game in its ‘early access’ state is worth far more than the $15.00 asking price).\n\nAs for the game, mechanics can be read about here in other reviews, found online (particularly in the Zomboid Wiki), or learned as you play – they aren’t that difficult to grasp, and their simplicity makes the game that much more charming.\n\nHOWEVER, do not be deceived by the surface simplicity – this game is incredibly challenging, and as a good game should, it rewards those who ‘get it’ with a truly unique gaming experience. Every time I start up a new character, I get further than I did on the last. Let that be a testament to the game’s consistency – you’re not going to die constantly from zombie bites if you know how to evade/fight them; you’re not going to bleed to death if you know not to climb through a broken window OR how to patch yourself up if you do.\n\nVirtually any building can be made into a shelter. Doors and windows can be barricaded. Ropes can attach to upper story windows for security. Furniture can be moved, taken from other buildings and brought to yours, or built. And with tools like the sledgehammer, virtually anything can be destroyed. You can even build entirely new structures once your carpentry skill is high enough and you have the supplies to do so.\n\nHow do you get the supplies? Looting. This game’s inventory system is simple and repetitive at times, but it gets the job done. Backpacks and hiking bags help you deal with the large amounts of weight you’re going to be carrying. Looting houses, diners, warehouses, and even banks requires thought and skill to decide what you need and what you don’t. Supplies are finite, so there’s always the constant thought of, “well, maybe I’ll need this box of paperclips sometime! Better grab it now while I’m here!”\n\nWhen looting, be careful of your surroundings. Zombies are almost always present, and while at times the game can feel like more of a general survival simulator rather than a zombie game, they’re always lurking around the next corner.\n\nI could go on and on about the intricacies of this marvelously crafted game, but suffice it to say that, if you’re looking for a zombie game that surpasses the norm and want to support fantastic indie developers, look no further than Project Zomboid.","April 12","true","96.5"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","34","39","0","0"

First of all, I do not know why I am writing this. It won't probably get noticed, but if you are reading this, and are thinking of buying it, listen up.\n\nDo you like left 4 dead? If you do, this game isn't similar to that, at all. This is a game where you create a story. Create a character and try your best to live his last days or weeks (or even months, if you're skilled enough). This is a game of patience. You have to slowly experience your character to his limits. You have to teach him how to fish. YOU have to teach him how to build a fort, and you have to teach him how to fight the greater evil.\n\nBe careful though. This isn't a story about how you suddenly met 100 zombies and went full rambo on them and now you're the old man telling your grandkids these tales. It is a story, a tale on how you survived against the dozens of hordses what came around when the mankind fell. This game, THIS GAME is the one where you can prove your point with your friends in the argument of "Who is the one of us to die first?" or "Who will last longest?". This is the suitable game for that. They are even going to add advanced NPC's soon that are going to function just like a normal player. Spooky, aint it?\n\nNow, back from the character. The music is extremely good. Let me give you an example of an interactive music demo from ingame music. Click on the link, and read the text and try to live the story. You don't have to listen to the whole song.\n\nImagine the violins playing when you've fought your last battle, and got bitten. You know you have a few hours left and decide to take your stuff and leave. You wander off to the city. The city is quiet, but suddenly zombies appear around every corner. You ready your shotgun.\n\nYour panic increases when you put the bullets in the barrel and you become slower every second. You dropped a bullet accidentally out of panic. There's no time for more reloading. You equip your shotgun and stand still for a few seconds to aim correctly into the horde. A few zombies fall, but it doesn't hinder the movement of the undead. You take a few steps back and you fall. You get up as fast as you can. You can hear the zombies growling a hundred feet away.\n\nYou arrive home. Your last moments are near. You open the drawer and find a picture of your family, dead a long time ago. Your tears drop down the picture, and it gets wet. After 30 minutes of crying, the tears start fueling your rage. You are after revenge.\n\nYou return to the horde. You walk slowly and wait until the zombies hunker near you. You have your trusty machete in your hand. As the zombies come you slice them up and roar like a predator from every slaughter. As you work your way through all of the zombies, they start to increase in numbers. Suddenly, when youre swinging the blade into the skull of the last nearby zombie, the color of your sight starts to disappear. You now see only in the colors of white and black. You try to retreat but eventually pass out.\n\nTHIS IS HOW YOU DIED.\n\nThe game will become even more masterful when the seasons, the medical overhaul, and the other survivors arrive. Just wait. I love this game. You should try out the demo if youre still considering, but I have a few things to tell you. Enter houses through windows, holding E when you are trying to access them. The doors are rarely open. You also have limited time, because the character youre playing as has got bitten. It gives some taste what the game is like. I have no idea how outdated it is what-so-ever.\n\nOh, its an early access game? The devs are the most active devs I've ever seen. They are very systematic, every monday there is an update of what they are doing, was it big or small, its still there every week. They are also open for suggestions, as they added a brilliant mod to the develop scheme a few weeks ago, what introduces seasons.\n\nI would reccommend this game to anyone, and soon you can still play it alone with no friends because of the NPC's. You can literally team up with them and arrange them to loot for food and such.","November 9, 2014","true","145.1"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","0"

The addition of more occupations for your character + perks/debuffs make for some very interesting character builds.\n\nWith almost no hand holding, you're plonked into a random house in the middle of a map that you'll have no idea how to navigate. With nothing but the clothes on your back and food in your fridge "plus anything else you're lucky to find" You set off on your adventure! Looting shops, houses, warehouses, farms, petrol stations all in the hopes you'll find a little more loot to help you survive that extra day.\n\nAll the while you're battling the hordes of the undead. The sandbox mod allows you to tweak the nasty biters any way you like. Want old school zombies? Sure! Want to try and survive in a scenario like 28 days later? Go for it! "although not recommended" You'll fight with whatever you can find. Kitchen knives, bats, axes, planks of wood. There are also firearms, but remember! the zombies react to sounds and a gunshot will likely make all your problems worse. Hordes of zombies migrate at random events that happen in game so don't ever think that large group won't think twice about seeing what tasty morsel hides in your home when a chopper goes overhead.\n\nAlong with the copious amounts of brains you'll be ejecting from skulls you will also have to contend with the isolation that is the zombie apocalypse. You'll be holed up in a house for days on end, fortifying, all whilst your character becomes bored, lonely and depressed at the thought they're the only one left.\n\nIf I could give a few tips to anyone new playing, It'd be invest in the future. Read the books and learn how to farm, fish and build. The power shuts off and any fresh food will go mouldy. The water will go and you will have to find other ways to sustain your thirst. So spend time learning how you're going to extend your life without the comforts we all take for granted.\n\nGood luck!

You spawn in random house in one of three small american towns (connected by roads) and are tasked with surviving as long as possible.\n\nIn the PvE servers I found this very fun. Zombies aren't very dangerous individually but when a zombie hits you it applies a 1 second invisible debuff that halves your movement speed. If multiple zombies are hitting you then it stacks to the point where you can barely move at all. What's more if you are wielding anything other than a knife then your character can only shove and grapple with zombies when they are pressed up against you meaning that if 4-5 zombies grab you then you are doomed, you will only be able to keep shoving them away but they close in again before you have pushed them all away from you.\n\nWith good timing you can still melee groups of 10 zombies, swinging just as they are about to enter range but this is absurdly dangerous and you will need to attempt to divide the groups by luring the slightly faster ones away or running around the group picking off stragglers. Or even just play is safe and avoid them, you get little loot from zombies and are encouraged to kill them only if ignoring them is even more dangerous.\n\nGuns are powerful but take skill to use with the exception of the shotgun which is almost as effective at low skill as high skill. However they make a lot of noise and draw zombies from VERY far to your location so you will mostly want to use melee weapons and only fire a gun if you have 100+ shotgun shells and intend to clear the entire area\n\nThe game uses a profession, trait and skill system. Different professions offer different skill boosts and even unique bonuses that cant be gained other ways like desensitization for a military veteran or high fitness for a fitness instructor. They also give positive or negative trait points which brings me to the traits. Positive traits cost trait points and negative traits give trait points. You cannot complete your character unless your trait points are 0 or higher. This encourages the player to pick positive and negative traits to reflect their intended role in the game\n\nFor instance a homemaker character might be a carpenter who has the traits that provide a starting skill boost and exp multiplier for carpentry, cooking, first aid, farming, fast learner and foraging, but to balance this they took the negative traits of cowardice, asthma, thin skinned, disorganisation, clumsy (loud) and poor healing\n\nOn the other hand a scavenger might be organised, aware, graceful (quiet), stealthy, athletic, a sprinter and lucky (high chance of good items in loot containers), but also illiterate, stupid, hemophobia and cowardly\n\nThen again a dedicated zombie slayer to accompany scavengers might be a fireman with brave, strong, fit, self-defense and thick skinned but illiterate, deaf and disorganized\n\nSadly there is a little balance in skills and some are more effective than others. Carpentry is amazing as the skill, as are the combat skills and sprinting, but farming, cooking, foraging and fishing are pretty useless, and first aid is pretty useless outside pvp too.\n\nOn the servers I played on there were plenty of resources when you know where to look, and once you get good at avoiding zombies or dividing groups to pick them off one by one the zombies aren't much of a threat either. The building materials (nails, axes) and ammo are usually hotly contested and a lot of players steal from each other. As a result the other thieving players become the greatest threat on pve servers and you will either have to hide your stash well such as in dense woods, or place traps throughout your house, and by that I mean removing floor tiles and covering them with zombie corpses that float over them so they can't see the hole. A fall means a guaranteed broken leg which leaves you moving at half speed and takes 3 weeks (21 hours) in-game to heal with the fast healer perk. Not impossible to heal I've managed it myself, but most players would just stash their items, commit suicide and make a new character than limp around for most of a real day. Unfortunately there are also griefers who put holes in public buildings to break the legs of other players and in a game with perma death it really is harsh\n\nI really wouldn't recommend pvp. The range of the screen is not that high and if you are running down a street the opposite direction to another player they will be in firing range by the time you realize it. Players can take a lot of bullets from guns before they die, but a single lodged bullet will cause a player to bleed out unless treated with rare medical tools. If you have 3+ lodged bullets you will bleed out before you can remove the bullet, stitch the wood and bandage all 3 woods even with high first aid and the dextrous trait. What's more the gunshots will draw zombies to your location forcing you to quickly vacate the area before you can even stop to treat the wounds. The only exception to this is if you chose to play a police officer and gun down about 3000 zombies to get to level 10 aiming. At 10 aiming a players fires a handgun like it's an uzi and each shot had about a 25% chance of killing instantly with a headshot. This means you will likely kill a player armed with a shotgun before they out more than 2 lodged bullets in you and if you creep up on them will likely kill them before they shoot you at all. But with a shotgun I'm not kidding here someone crept up on me and fired 6 shotgun shells point blank into my back and I still had time to turn around and shoot him twice before I died, causing him to die as well a minute later from blood loss. For pvp to work gunshots would have to be far more instantly deadly to players and the range of the screen would have to be extended or every player encounter results in mutual destruction regardless of the time each player has spent in-game\n\nThat said the community is the best I have ever seen, even on the pvp servers. Everyone is really helpful and friendly and quick to answer any question! There are a few bad apples and thieves but nowhere near to the extent of survival games like Rust and Reign of Kings.\n\nAnother interesting addition is challenge modes. Really CD DA day has the player start in a burning house, naked, wet (imminent cold that causes sneezing and attracting zombies like gunshots), drunk and with lodged glass shards in their crotch (equivalent to a lodged bullet). What's more the map is winter with sparse resources and maximum numbers of zombies, which I assure you is a lot. The player must escape the burning house, find clothes, sober up, find tweezers, bandages and a needle and thread to remove the glass, stitch the wound and bandage it, all while sneezing to attract the hordes, then find somewhere safe to rest and recover without starving to death or being killed!\n\n3 more interesting challenges have just been released, one where the player is in a small town with few zombies but after 1 day zombies appear at the edge of the map in a massive horde and head straight after the player, death isn't a question of if but when! In another map the player has 1 day before a frigid winter begins and before this the player must scavenge resources, and find a warm shelter to survive the winter if they can. In the third one the player is in a mall which is surrounded by thick masses of the dead, and in 3 hours the doors will open!\n\nAll in all I highly recommend this game. Even for an early access game there are plenty of features, the game is updated frequently, it's very intuitive and easy to get into and the amazing community is great fun to play with!\n\nFinal verdict: 9/10","June 1, 2015","true","232.8"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","33","40","0","0"

Whether it was sheer bad luck or stupidity on their end, or a combination of both - it doesn't matter, because they still manage to get back on their feet. Every. Time. I've patiently watched this game's development since its early development stage back when it was available exclusively through Desura. It's come a loooong way since then and it's an amazing feat.\n\nThe game's currently in Alpha stage, so be aware that there WILL be some bugs, but nothing so bad as to be gamebreaking. There's only one goal in the game - to build, fight, scavenge, and thus SURVIVE, for as long as you possibly can. Death is inevitable... It's just being prolonged.\n\nThe game features dark, eerie and spine-chilling music by young and talented Zach Beever[www.zachbeever.com], there are quite a few new features[pzwiki.net] planned, plus PZ has a very healthy and devoted modding community. Thus, it's pretty safe to assume that this just might be the next "Minecraft" hit. We shall wait and see.\n\nIf you enjoy harsh roguelike survival games of the likes of Don't Starve (another title I very highly recommend), then you'll most likely appreciate what this game has to offer, even in its unfinished state.","December 1, 2013","true","70.5"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

For starters, its top down view, not first person. This doesn't take anything away from the experience though! I've been made to jump a couple of times from walking into a room that I didn't know had a zombie inside!\n\nWhat I love most about PZ, is that it's truly a survival game, even without the zombies. Society has crashed which means you have to scavenge to survive, searching through houses, caravans, schools, apartments etc. to find food, water and supplies. But it's not just hunger you have to contend with, your character can get bored, stressed, scared, angry, even too hot or cold depending on the conditions.\nFor those who survive the first days, you can craft items like walls and doors, even grow plants!\n\nMultiplayer is in the game but in my personal experience it needs work. Every server I found was picked clean of everything, all the zombies were dead and the lag often made it unplayable.\nThe graphics aren't anything special, but they grow on you more and more over time. The devs have used lighting as a great way to make you feel uneasy, walking the streets at night can be a death trap when you can barely see whats around you!\n\n","December 29, 2014","true","20.7"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

It has collected all of the great things that I've been wishing to see in a zombie game, but never found executed in the correct way.\n\nEven in Early Access state, developers have pushed themselves to make it as stable as possible, so anyone who buys into it wouldn't feel like beta testers but actual consumers. There is nothing you can hate in Indie Stone. The Passion these developers have about their game is enormous. At it's stage the game already has a huge list of languages you can play with, completely translated by the community.\n\nMod tools, Last Stand, Sandbox, Survival, Story - Combine all of that, and you'd get carried away for longer than you might expect.

DayZ подошел очень близко моим ожиданиям, но быстро был перехвачен людьми, которые убивали без всякого повода. Наткнулся на Project Zomboid несколько лет назад, и сразу влюбился в команду разработчиков. Они, как оказалось, на равне со мной рады выпустить игру как эта.\n\nНе смотря на то, что игра в Early Access, разработчики вложили все свои силы чтобы сделать игру незабываемой, и чтобы баги отвлекали насколько можно меньше от игрового процесса. Естественно - баги будут присутствовать, но по сравнению с остальными играми про зомби что я здесь видел (иногда даже полностью выпущенные, как WarZ) Zomboid стабильнее, чем вы ожидаете. Они даже умудрились внедрить целый лист языков, на котором вы сможете играть в эту игру, полностью переведено их комьюнити. Я вложил свои силы чтобы перевести игру на русский. Буду и дальше работать, надеюсь старания не пропадут даром)\n\nПоддержка модов, Последний Рубеж (Битва), Песочница, Выживание, Истории - все это вы сможете увидеть в будущем, и если вы огромный фанат серьезных игр про зомби - вы просто ДОЛЖНЫ приобрести эту игру.","November 8, 2013","true","490.9"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

Stop what you're doing and throw money at it.\nProject Zomboid ticks all the boxes for a complex but enjoyable apocalypse survival game. Beating up hordes of your reanimated neighbours barely scratches the surface.\n\nThere's no ending so to speak, which gives it limitless replayability - you dictate the story of how your character dies. You might survive three days or six months, you might starve to death, your safehouse might be demolished by a horde, or you might venture into a cupboard and never return. The game does progressively get harder and admittedly has a fairly steep learning curve, but manages to stay enjoyable throughout. You'll quickly find a balance between hoarding all the items that you find and scavenging too little, or relying too heavily on supplies that won't last forever such as an electricity and water supply.\n\nA complex system of emotions (moodles) influenced constantly and in realtime by your immediate environment and character's wellbeing govern all aspects of your survival, like stress, boredom, stamina, pain and panic. Magazines and books are just as essential to your wellbeing as food and water. Moreover even something as mundane as maintaining a proper sleeping pattern during the apocalypse to make sure you aren't caught out after sundown on your journey home, or keeping your character warm or cool during the varying seasons to make sure they don't become ill - should this be the case though, you'll find getting lots of sleep along with a stockpile of food, books and magazines comes in handy while your character stays at home to recover.\n\nIt's not uncommon to have to abandon safehouses and retreat to a backup location due to gunshots and helicopters attracting too many zombies to deal with, quickly grabbing as many essential supplies as you can in the hope they'll last long enough for you to fortify your backup safehouse on the other side of town. The key skill is being prepared for whatever the game may throw at you.\n\nIt's all well and good having stockpiles of essentials and a fortified house to live, but in the end all it takes is one bite or scratch to become infected. And the game won't tell you you're infected, oh no, you'll have to diagnose it yourself. The usual cure is a swig of bleach, an overdose on sleeping pills or a good two or three storey fall.\n\nThese are the end times.\nThere was no hope of survival.\nThis is how you died.","May 8","true","416.4"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","25","31","5","4"

My hours played are much higher and I'd say are in high hundreds if not above a thousand as I have played the game mostly off steam]\n\nReview Build - Build 33\nI recommend this game but I will start my review with the cons and not the pros.\n\nCons:\n- InDev for at least 5 years as of writing this review.\nI suspect a mayor feature creep being the problem, having read all "Mondoids" (Developer Updates) I've seen some features make it in without being mentioned before while the ones that are promised "soon" are constantly being delayed. While the explanation is always given I can't help but say that The Developer team has a policy of not promising anything with a release date that they failed to keep that on numerous occasions.\n\nPros:\n- No DRM\nA huge pro for me as I hate DRM in all of it's forms, steamworks and having to keep steam client on included, you can play the game without steam client if you so wish. (I bought it before InDev Launched on GOG)\n- Single Player Zombie Survival\nAnother huge one for me as I'm a very single player oriented gamer. Probably the only zombie survival game in which Single Player is actually enjoyable. Why that is, later. There is multiplayer of course but I can't say much about it as I didn't play it.\n- Modding\nThe game is extremely modable with plenty of great mods that expand the game available already. A huge pro from a gamer like me who likes to mod and play with other mods.\n- Sandbox Mode\nI will say, I am not a fan of preset difficulty modes, the game allows you to customize just about all aspects of your game in it's Sandbox mode, zombie lore included (How the infection spreads, zombie intelligence and whether or not they can run is up to you)\n- Survival Itself\nI believe that over the past few builds the game has really became a heaven for those who enjoy survival. All of the options are valid. You can do risky loot runs and live off canned dog food, have a farm, set up traps for small animals or forage for mushrooms and berries. Believe me when I say it, no matter what you like, you'll get it, whether you're an action oriented gamer who likes to bash Z brains in like me or one who prefers to keep in the shadows. Mechanics are there and they work.\n- Graphics\nA game from an isometric perspective that mixes 2D and 3D. It looks a tad worse than Fallout Tactics to be honest (I love that game) but I have found it's style to be the perfect thing for someone like me. I admit that this is very subjective though. If you like isometric graphics games like Fallout 1,2 or Tactics, you'll like this, if you expect CryEngine type of stuff and can't live without it, consider this a BIG con as I know that not liking graphics can seriously kill the enjoyment.\n- Audio/Soundtrack\nPZ has recently integrated the FMOD system, the sound quality is good, you can tell where they are coming from and there is plenty of ambient sounds to make the world feel alive. The soundtrack is a masterpiece of zombie genre, I want to buy it now, the guy who composed it really knows his stuff and I believe he designed some of the best music you will hear in a zombie game. Different music will play in-game depending on what is currently happening and it works very well.\n- Community\nNever saw a better one to be honest and that is all I'll say.\n- Active Developers\nThe developers provide the community with regular updates* (*read cons) they frequently reply to criticism with well founded arguments and are, in general, very helpful to the community whenether we have any questions.\n\nAll In All. I truly recommend this game to all fans of Zombie Survival Genre. ESPECIALLY if you're sick of all the FPS/TPS zombie games. This is something fresh for you despite being older than DayZ itself. It is a game crafted by people who wanted a Zombie game before Zombie games were a thing and it shows.\n\nNote: Everything I mentioned in this review is In the game as of Build 33. I might update it if something big changes and I will update it after release.","February 20","true","26.5"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","23","28","2","0"

They're not afraid to tear down doors and smash windows to get to you.\nAt the moment, NPCs are not yet in the game, but indications from the developer are that they will come soon, and will behave with intelligence and survival instinct.\nThe developers are releasing plenty of updates, despite some very huge setbacks during the development of the project.

And I've been playing games on steam (and PC games in general) for a long time. So this game had quite an effect on me for me to write this review in the first place. I should also note that I'm extremely inclined to love anything zombie related, so of course a game like this is going to stand out to me]\n\nAs much as I absolutely love this game, it isn't for everybody, so I'm going to get the "bad" out of the way before my glowing praise, because like most other games it does have it's flaws.\n\nTHE BAD\n--------------------------\n\n-It's still being developed, so it comes with it's own share of bugs and incomplete content. With that being said, none of the bugs that I've run into are really gamebreaking by any means, just minor annoyances or visual stuff. The missing content is also fairly negligable, because it's usually small things. Most of the major content is pretty fleshed out.\n\n-A little bit clunky (at first). It will probably feel a little awkward at first, and combat will take a lot of getting used to. But as long as you don't ragequit, and take some time to figure out what works and what doesn't, what used to feel clunky will actually begin to feel fairly smooth.\n\n-Lack of a real "objective" (other than simply surviving of course, which I suppose in a zombie apocalypse is as good an objective as any. But you know what I mean). As it stands right now, the game is completely sandbox mode, so you have to make your own fun. But the tools provided to you are top notch, so most of the time fun will end up finding you.\n\n\nTHE GOOD\n----------------------\nSimply put, this game will make you feel like you're in an episode of the Walking Dead, or playing out your own version of a Romero Movie (you do have the option to customize the zombies' speed and power in sandbox mode). I've been hosting a LAN Hamachi server for my friend and I to play together, and it may possibly be the most fun we've had in any LAN game. The atmosphere is top notch.\n\nThis is a game that is filled with incredible moments; say for example, your friend accidently leaving the oven on with salmon cooking inside it and burning down your safehouse, or; huddling in a dark kitchen with only the glow of a lighter to see and sheets covering the windows hoping zombies don't see you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yourself inside, then the sound of shattering glass and seeing them pour through a window across the room.\n\nThe combat is fun and nerve wracking once you get used to the controls, and looting your way through buildings has never been more satisfying. Managing your character's "moodles" (think "The Sims", little icons that let you know when your character needs something) allows lots of levels of realism, and the unforgiving and brutal combat/medical system makes stealth and zombie avoidance a neccesity; trust me, you do not want to get bitten or scratched. The RPG elements are fairly simple and straightforward, but work well within the game's design. Levelling up your skills is fluid and intuitive.\n\n\nThere's too much to go into, really, you might as well read the wiki page at this point. But let me just say, if you want to play the best Zombie Apocolypse simulator, than look no further than Project Zomboid.\n\n\n","January 25, 2015","true","007.1"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","1"

When I got home I discovered my broccoli patch had rotted. Just another day in Zomboid land.\n\nTo qualify this a little; I have no real interest in zombies (either in games, film or tv) and don't much care for survival games, even less so early access. Took a punt on this after Steam threw it up randomly in my recommended list (I think because I play Alien: Isolation) and I read a few reviews.\n\nPZ manages that rare thing of being a pretty hardcore, serious game which should be quite depressing in many ways but somehow manages to also provide deeply satisfying moments of hilarity and 'how the hell did I get out of that?' gameplay.\n\nIt throws you in at the deepend and resolutely refuses to offer you a hand, let alone a life vest. You will die, often and when you least expect it. You will only have yourself to blame, or the git who put a burglar alarm on their house. I'd recommend reading as little as possible by way of guides and wikis and just going at it, the sense of bewilderment and confusion and the resultant satisfaction from figuring stuff out is part of the fun.\n\nLastly, the devs seem very active in the community and there are great looking updates on the horizon. This game is shaping up to be a bit of a cult classic.","November 10, 2014","true","27.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

The reason is that your life is very fragile and everything you're up against isn't. It's like a watermelon against a sledgehammer. Surviving in this game is like real life - one screw up and it's over.\n\n2) Whatever 'skill' you choose know that no matter how proficient you get at it - if you level it from skill level 2 up to skill level 7 and you get bit. You can kiss all that progress goodbye.\n\n3) When you die, you're dead. It literally makes you start a brand new character so don't get too attached.\n\n4) You will die... like a lot\n\n5) First several times you play you'll know very little and feel like it. Its easy to get frusturated but stick with it. If you're one to easily give up this game is not for you.\n\n6) Multiplayer can be super fun if you can have your own server like we do\n\n7) Single player is a totally unique experience to multiplayer but man does it feel good to survive alone building your own shelter and growing your ownfood/catching your own food. It's so satisfying because you know you're on your A game if you make it.\n\n\nPros\n-----------------\n+ Excellent survival engine\n+ Zombie AI is very impressive but not perfect\n+ Zombies are kind of creepy but need a few more styles\n+ Wide array of items\n+ Excellent character creation (traits mostly)\n+ Feeling of hopelessness, stress, heart thumping action\n+ Realistic feeling town and just the right dab of guns/weapons/food/etc.\n+ Base building is very good and on a grid system - masterful\n+ Multiplayer with a server is amazing\n+ Singleplayer very fun and challenging\n\nCons\n--------\n- Could use NPC's and vehicles because damn some of these trips are LONG\n- Sometimes zombie AI is TOO good like how do they always know to knock on the doors and not the walls?\n- Trapping is kind of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ (Ive had minimal success)\n- Cooking and farming can be kind of tedious but very helpful\n- Should have a server save state option so we dont get corrupted files from things like a power outage\n- Items sometimes vanish into the void (mostly when harvesting crops which is SUPER annoying)\n- Sometimes you get a cheap death like I one time looked in a window and didn't see any zomie so I hopped in and was instantly bitten as the animation to land inside was still going - wtf\n- When you forage it doesnt show on the screen what you picked up (if anything) can we at least get a quick little pop up that fades away after 2 seconds?\n\nOverall this game is excellent and I was pleasantly suprised how good it actually is. I didn't even realize it's in EA it's that polished and good. Impressive.

Your first couple of runs might not feel very fun or make much sense, and you may feel this game is lacking content. But keep playing, and you'll understand what this game is all about. If you're one of those people who can't appreciate a good soundtrack, an immersive experience, and patient gameplay, stick to your H1Z1/CoD.\n\n9/10 overall. Brilliant, not overpriced, with active developers, mod support, and there's even local/online multiplayer. Can't go wrong with this. It's just sheer good-ness.\n\nAnyway. Onto a REAL review.\n\nProject Zomboid is one of the few games that actually makes me feel on edge whilst I'm playing. The game expresses how you ARE going to die, no matter what. And it's true. You WILL die. One scratch from a zombie can get infected, killing you irreversibly.\n\n'Surely that's too powerful', you may be thinking, but no. This game stresses for you to skillfully outmanouver and sneak past zombies instead of killing them just because you can, or for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty 'XP'. Weapons are effective, and zombies are easy to kill, true... but one misclick is all it takes for your life to be over.\n\nAnd you know why it's not even frustrating when you die? Because the game told you that you were going to die. You knew this moment would come. I like to randomly generate a character, and 'live their story' if you like, trying to guide them through this unforgiving world as long as you can.\n\nWhen it comes to crafting, it takes effort to get the knowledge to actually craft things. As it should be. The building systems in other Early Access games are fun, aye, but they don't make much sense. Let's take 7 Days to Die, for example. 7dtd is a brilliant game, don't get me wrong - but Project Zomboid is more fun in terms of IMMERSION and REALISM.\n\nAnd there's one small feature in the game that I really love. In one of the soundtrack songs, there's the sound of a clock ticking in the background. That clock ticking signifies your time left to live before you die. Such a simple feature keeps you on edge, and keeps you as alert as a meerkat as you stroll around with your trusty butter knife.\n\nThe only gripe I have is that I'd like to see some more/better animations on the player model. The combat system could be a little better too, as I often find myself 'charging' attacks, but I'm not even sure if charging my attacks matters or not most of the time.\n\nRegardless of those, this game is brilliance, created by innovative, clever, and active developers. It's fun, engaging, and a wonderful way to pass a few hours by. Mods are awesome with it, too.\n\nA must buy for zombie game lovers. 9/10.","October 12, 2015","true","61.0"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","22","27","2","1"

Finally I grew a pair and watched my dad play Project Zomboid. I got hooked and I asked my dad "yo dad can I play with you?" and he said "HELLS YEAH!" and It took me a few minutes to get used to the controles and I was hooked. I wanted the game my self, But I have absolutely no money so my dad did this amazing thing that lets me play his version of it on my computer and now almost like clockwork I get on Steam and play Project Zomboid right after i get done with my homework and after my cat nap. and i play it until it is time for me to go to bed. With only bathroom breaks and breaks for dinner or snacks.\n\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone I mean ANYONE who like Sims, because it is basecly Sims but you have to survive, kill zombies (or walkers what ever you want to call the walking dead) and try to survive as long as you possibly can. There are lots of places to explore, they have Malls, 7-11 (but of cource they aren't called that in the game because thats copyright), houses (LOTS and LOTS of houses, you got two story houses one story houses also you have trailer parks ((Now you can call the zombies, trailer trash Zombies, they even act like trailer trash and are pains in the butt.))) The one thing you have to be careful about is the Alarms on the houses or stores because they sometimes attract a few zombies and sometimes they attract a whole hoard of zombies (It is really Freaking hard to kill zombies when you are surrounded and are trying to kill 30 of them because unlike trying to kill just 4 or 5 of them which you can just attack and run a few feet away and attack again, you cannot do that with 30 of them because they are all coming at you and if they bite you, you're dead because the bite could get infected if left unattended (the bad thing is that when you die and turn into a zombie you cannot play as the zombie.) another fun thing to do is to get drunk. (its as if you were to get drunk in real life, you cant walk straight. you have terrible aim, and any other thing that you know about getting drunk they got it (except the part where some people who get drunk can't shut up, your person doesn't say anything, Its like if you were to get your friend drunk and duck tape there mouth so they cant say anything.)\n\n\nBefore you even start the game you can pick traits that you would like to have (Good and Bad) a really good trait that I always get is Claustraphobic because it is amazing. If you want to kill zombies all the time I would recommend that you get thick skinned. You get to name your character and even get to sorta choose what he or she is wearing and pick a hair style that you like.\n\n\nSo if you want to play a game that is Like the Sims and you like killing zombies you need to get and play this game (because I know some of you will get the game and not play it ((it would be a Waist of a perfectly good game))","May 18, 2015","true","18.1"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","20","24","5","1"

You become a lone survivour, in zombie-dominated world. Your duty? Stay alive as long as you can. Sounds simple, but in-game you will see it is not. At the beggining you have to create yourself a survivour. Game offers a few customisation options, such as name, hair, and skin colour - not much, but game is still in early acces. Then you pick a profession, with a few aviable at the moment. Each of them have bonus or two, like fireman has bonus to axe usage, policeman better shooting ect. Then you can get some more traits, but each of them comes with a value, with starting value of 0. So you need to pick some bad traits as unlucky or fat, to get some good ones.\nWhen you finally end up on the map, you will find yourself in some building, picked randomly from all around the map (there are 2 maps to choose at the moment). Its a good idea to avoid fighting, as even the smalles scratch can be deadly. The best idea to start? Find yourself a house. It will be your safe place. When you find one big enough, secure it - put sheets in the windows, make sure there are no zombies inside, and then... then you can live there. Then you will need to look for food in other houses - non persistant such as chips and canned soups are a great find, while persistant ones are good at the beggining - because electricity will be turned off after some time. With electricyty you lose fridge, so your pesistant food can be gone anytime. Same with water - water bottles are great thing to store, because water can be turned off anytime. Then - survive. You can't win - even the loading screen shows: This is how you died.\nWhile starting a game you can change a lot of things - from amount and strength of zombies to frequency of finding food and weapons. Which means - you can have difficulity as you want - from walk in the park to necessity to fight for barest scrap of progress.\nAs for me, even though it's an early acces game, Project Zomboid can give a lot of entertainment. Finding a first gun, figuring out how to drink and so on can be really satisfying. Although price can seem to be a bit high, its a solid piece of work.\n","March 18, 2015","true","13.8"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

This game is about surviving in a zombie apocalypse in rural Kentucky, and you are tasked with doing it alone, or with a friend in the very rare PC local multiplayer. I would mention the online multiplayer, but this game requires fast reactions in order to stay alive, and I can't find a server with a decent ping to "save my life" as it were. This game has many realistic elements about it, such as exertion, injury that halts ALL progress, panic as a game mechanic, zombies hearing your footsteps and following noise, sight, and smell, and perhaps my favourite touch of realism, the inability to see all around you at once. You need to rely solely on your senses in order to gauge the number of zombies currently breaking down your door, and surrounding your base, there's no minimap with radar, you just need to run out and hope for the best. Another great element of this game is that it is permadeath, which in case you are a dunce, means that when you die, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. In sandbox (Which I heartily recommend over survival, as you can tweak the settings), after you die, you respawn in another random location in your spawn town, and have to work your isometric ♥♥♥ off to get back to your base, and rebuild your skills.\n\nOne large issue with the game right now (which will in fact be fixed), is that the world is rather lonely. There are currently no other NPC's to hang about with. The biggest flaw of the game is that once you have nailed the perfect farming cycle, got all the guns, and fortified yourself to the point that a nuke couldn't dislodge you, there's nothing left to do! You're done at that point! I mean, if you set the zombies to never respawn, I guess you could clear out all of the zombies in the game, but that accomplishes nothing at the end of the day! Some might say that you could explore the vast map, and look for all the best items, but you don't really need to. If you use the PZ crash map like I did, finding your way around is no longer a challenge! Now I know that I shouldn't have used the map, but I thought it made the game more realistic, I mean, I know my city very well, I know where things are, and even if I didn't I could simply raid a gas station and get a map!\n\n\n\nSo, overall, this game is worth dumping your time into. It's a great zombie survival game, and I personally think that it is underrated. I am still super amped to have vehicles and NPC's but that's not happening for a while.\n\n\n\nGET THIS GAME!\n-8.7/10","April 9, 2015","true","71.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Perfect simulation of how they would act(as if I would know). I am writing this review right after losing.\nSo I decide to tell you "how I died".\n\nI woke up in a house. The house i would later die in, the house was a two story,empty house probably for sale.knowing that there will be no food, water, or weapons/supplies I left the house to find somewhere to get my supplies.\nI am walking,very slowly, to the next door house. Me being stupid i tripped over my foot and attracted the attention of the near by zombie. I ran faster than ever to the house next door. Running in the house i had went through my whole list of what i should and shouldn't keep to be most efficient... I still picked up everything.\nI had found a knife, a fork, canned food, and a bottle of bleach. Me being depressed and paranoid i was compensating on wether i take the bleach and drink it, or use it to clean my water. A zombie had walked in and scratched me while i was thinking about that. I stopped thinking, got out my knife, and stabbed it until it was dead. It fell over, so i stomped its head until it had no head. I had scratch but not a big scratch, so i tore a piece of my clothes and wrapped it around me wound.\nI went to another house, without attracting attention, it was a two story, clean, house the family must have been alive longer than the others. luckily i found all the supplies i needed. I found 2 aid kits, an axe, and some planks. I got all the materials out of it to sanitise my wound so i don't get infected or feel pain at the worst moments. there had been left over food in the house. For a few days i had been making plans, organizing, and living like i would before the apocolypse.\nI went back to the house I had woke up in to start building walls, and more space to keep future supplies organized. My arm had went numb and I wasn't acting normal. Seeing anything that looked like a person made me want to attack them.\nThat is when i realized... I am turning into a zombie. I had learned that even a scratch will get me infected, and that I didnt get cloth on my arm in time to stop it. the first aid kit wouldn't have helped due to the amount of time without the sanitary circumstances. That is how i died... and it was a nice life, but i could've...done better.\n\n\n8/10 IGN too little water","April 4, 2015","true","18.6"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","21","27","7","0"

You aren't the big hero, meant to save the world. You're just an average joe, trying to carve out a living in the unforgiving world. Power and water shut off, seasons change,  and in the end, only the most experienced and resilient players survive. Let me be clear right now. You will die. A lot. This game is as unforgiving as they come, and newer players will almost certainly be dead within an in-game week. But every time you die, you still have the knowledge to improve upon your tactics and survive for just a bit longer. In short, this is a great game with great developers and a great community.

Spinning to face a zombie, I recalled my son's reaction when I beat a guy one-on-one in a shootout in WolfET.  He looked at my dead opponent and said "thank you for sucking".\n\nI bring this up because I can set Sandbox Mode to ease me into harder and harder levels.  Nobody's gona watch me on YouTube if I'd been recording my playthroughs (I haven't been)(you're welcome), but poor little Joey Fatone has a pretty good base set up, and his much tougher brother Fred Fatone is working on his own.  I'm learning the system, and having a ball.\n\nMost guys will play PZ like it's Dwarf Fortress ("Losing is Fun!") which is great, but it's your call.  There's a deep and satisfying skill system, but that's poorly suited to die-in-a-week scenarios.  So you make an important choice when you start the game, entirely apart from which Fatone brother to play and what skills he has.  Sandbox can be adjusted to encourage learning a lot,\n\nSurvival, well, not so much unless you're adept.  I've seen enough playthroughs to convince me that very, very few guys, and I don't mean old ones like me, will bother much with most skills if they know that living a month is unlikely.   The game has not yet reached a point, however, where an effective base will be fun for very long, at least not your second or third one.  If you make yourself safe and reasonably self-sustaining, you've won, and it's probably time for a new Fatone.\n\nBut, the game lets you pick what style you want.

Update few minor changes, milk profit for a while as it becomes on the top of the "recently updated" steam front page. Then when player base decrease and sales number goes down, they update another very minor change, often from community mod, to repeat their process. By the way, the way they post the changes, it's ridiculous. Other game devs will literally laugh at them how the Indiestone devs try to stretch simple patchnote into freaking 5 page essay.\n\nGame has a lot of good potential, but no ETA policy and "Indie Project takes long time" excuse they use for 4 YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT TIME makes me question the morality of the devs. Stay away. At least until they finish it. It's probably going to take about same time as Duke Nukem Forever dev time. Difference is, this devs are milking the game to the max while DNF bankrupted 3D Realm.","June 15, 2015","false","164.7"," 115 of 197 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","115","197","4","30"

THAT'S why you should give this game a try. ;-)\n\nI'm a fan of builder games and zombies, so when I saw a zombie game where I can build, I had to have it. I wasn't sure I would care as much for the gameplay, but it definitely gets addicting. I spent my first few tries in an easymode sandbox and still managed to die. The graphics actually suit me great, since I'm an old-school gamer and prefer it more simpler than newer games today have. The action is pretty much the same no matter what you do, but the way it goes down differs. You could lose your focus and walk into a bathroom without paying attention and a zombie will lunge at you from behind the door. You could turn a corner and walk right into a herd. You could be bashing a zombie in the head with a shovel and think you're winning, but a zombie out of your line of sight comes up from behind and you're now infected. I once survived for 3 months and had stocked up on everything to outlive a lifespan, and then fell from a roof I was building and died anyways. Why do I keep restarting after such heartbreak? It must be a good game!\nI am excited for more updates on this game. We definitely could use more to build, more items throughout, and my most requested is different maps to explore. I'd love to not only have more maps to choose from, but maps that edge to another map.","January 26","true","272.0"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","21","28","2","0"

So many complex feelings, so little time! Well, for starters: This certainly isn't currently a game for everyone.\n\nYes, it's quite playable and the amount of bugs is kept at a minimum, the developers are dedicated and keep in constant touch and the community is quite excellent at snapping up the details as they keep pouring out. So yes, this game IS going to be finished, one way or another. And as far as I'm concerned, it's going to be grand!\n\nThis game is dedicated to creating realistic gameplay, so you'll have to contend with much more than zombies to survive. There are currently no human NPCs, but just trying to keep yourself alive is a challenge as you have to manage hunger, thirst, disease, fear, various kinds of wounds, (damn you broken glass!) and even boredom if you can get that far.\nI'm afraid, however, that boredom isn't simply a modlet, it can also affect the player. The main problem with this game is poor pacing.\n\nIt's quite nerve-tingling, trying to sneak around without being overwhelmed by the undead horde and get bitten, resulting in slow, unavoidable permadeath. You look for tools, supplies and weapons to stay alive and defend yourself. How you do this is up to you, though some strategies are more likely to succeed than others. With some careful scavenging you can even cut down trees to barricade your house, or even build your own if that's more your style. You can grow crops, fish, trap small animals and generally get by well in the apocalypse. You can even learn to build rain catchers. And if everything else fails: Flee to the woods and forage for nuts and berries, sticks and stones. There's always an option for survival, but there's no zombrex...\n\nAnd from what I've heard (and experienced) all of this means that players usually end up barricading themselves, stockpiling a huge amount of resources, set up some water catchers, start a farm and just rest into infinity... or get bored really quickly and go out hunting zombies, get overwhelmed and/or bitten, end of story. So yes, the pacing herein is far from perfect...\nBut the developers are very aware of this flaw, and are working on it with about the same vigour as with their human NPCs. So worry not dear gamers. This game is far from complete, yet it already presents you with a surprisingly engaging survival scenario. And if you're a survivalistic hoarder like myself, then I think you'll understand exactly what makes me hopeful for the future of both this game, and anything else these brilliant developers will create in the future.\n\nAlso, I don't care how desperate you get: Don't drink that bleach! Just don't do it!","February 18, 2015","true","744.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

While players have the options to make the apocalypse as they desire, it's still virtually the same, making it either slow (and boring) or annoyingly fast, good luck trying to find a middle point, surivival it's supposed to be like that, but it wasn't made for anyone either.\nWhile the develompent team is probably one of the best i have seen so far, they fail when it comes to add content in their "big updates": You get a -few- good things and ♥♥♥♥♥on of bug fixes.\nThe main reason that has made me not reccomend this game has been the lastest updates, this is what they have added in the lastest builds:\n-TVs and Radios: While the idea seems good, it really add nothing to the game; while TVs give you some backstory of the game, they... well, that's it, just some text and when you turn on a TV the volume is set on max as default, bringing zombies nearby; same with radios, they might be useful in MP.\n-Molotovs and Pipe bombs: They cause more damage that they are supposed to solve, with molotovs you end up burning half of the town and with pipe bombs you just attract more zeds, whooo... At least these are good to grief in MP, especially when combined with traps.\n-Moveable furnitures: You still need some experience in carpentry to move a lot of furniture so ♥♥♥♥ no.\n-FMOD: While this is quite nice, it doesn't really change your gameplay experience much, if you have good hearing and headphones is might come in handy.\n-Generators: Useful when the power cuts off. You need fuel for them, but you cant get gas from the stations when the power cuts off.\n-Bug fixes: A lot of them, but at least they keep the game bug-free\n-Build 31 added some big changes to it [It was released on Feb. 09, 2015, anyways].\nWith all of the above being said, that is not the only thing i dont like about, we also have the so controversial NPCs... I've been waiting for years, playing the game without realizing that i wasn't really enjoying it (Because the game has brought NOTHING since build 31), I'm one of those who played the games when Bob and Kate was on it... And now we don't have any news because a ♥♥♥♥ing crybaby posted some trash-talk in the forums (True trash-talk)... I'm not dissapointed with it, but it completely made me lost all the interest in the game, there's no reason to me to play it anymore, not with these updates, i dont even care in defending TIS anymore, neither do i care for the NPCs...","February 2","false","129.3"," 48 of 78 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","48","78","6","3"

Do not let the "Early Access" fool you; this game is so immense in features that it actually feels finished.\n\nThis game is like a storyless Fallout with its intense depth, woo-hooless Sims with its building and crafting, tacticless Jagged Alliance with its coop gameplay, and missionless Syndicate with its art style.\n\nWhat is awesome:\n\n- Well, first of all, it gave one of the best Co-Op experiences till now. The glasses breaking, zombies walking in, the sense of pitch black when it's midnight, the desperation to get to safety, the "omg the glass just broke" feeling, the "this door is locked man, we have to find another exit, I lure them into this room and close the door from behind, you find another door" type of conversations... It's fun.\n- The content! So much to do. So much to craft. So many things to use as weapons. Every item you find that is lootlable is somehow usable. Every single thing can be used somewhere somehow. There is no "garbage loot" (except for a few stuff which don't have functionality attached to them yet, such as some pieces of clothing).\n- The "apocalypse" feel: Yes, they nailed it. You walk into a motel, just to find some doors open, blood everywhere, with two zombies shuffling in the bathroom when you open the door. The hoard of zombies that shuffle around the streets. The hordes filling the room at midnight when accidently a gun goes off.\n\nWhat the game needs:\n- Currently the only things that I've seen missing are the sprites (backpacks on the back or carried as secondary), unique art for some hand-held items (rolling pin looks like and is handled like a baseball bat), some animations (water drinking animations) and character-related stuff to add variation (more hairstyles) and so forth.\n- Instead of basic texturized lawns and such, the developers could go for rather more sophisticated "environment design sprites" for some locations, which would be static, hand-drawn images for backgrounds. The way it's done in the Fallout games, Wasteland 1-2 and the new Torment game (Tides of Numenera). Sure, mapmaking is dead easy right now probably using an incredibly easy-to-use tool that adds blocks, paints roads, etc., but still...\n- The game could also benefit more from character creation and customization options. Sure; the trait system is fine, but somewhat lacking in content. There are only 5 pre-selectable professions, and about 12 or so traits, half of them being negative and the other positive. So it doesn't always give a unique combination for each character created.\n- Better UI overall. The in-game inventory UI is fine, interactivity is good, but may need "quick switch" buttons so that we don't have to sift through the huge inventory to find the damn rolling pin.\n\nLast thoughts:\nConsidering that driving, vehicles and more cities/towns will be added to the game in the future, the current level of depth in such a short period of time (despite everything the developers have gone through), I can positively believe that any promised feature will be delivered by the developers.\n\nIt will definitely not be for people who like isometric games, but if you can get past that prejudice, you can unlock the full potential of Project Zomboid.","June 23, 2014","true","9.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

This is the 1st game review I have ever written. I own over 160 games on steam, and this is my 1st review!!!\nSo why review Project Zomboid? Well you could say im a little bit of a graphics Wh@#%... That I thought there is no way in hell I would play this game. To old school!!! There's just no way... Well the story goes like this.\nMy alienware 18x had to be sent off for a repair and I had to break out my old laptop. Was looking for a game that was'nt as graphics intensive. So my search began. Looked at tons of games, but I have really been into survival games the last year or so. The pickings are slim as I own most of them. All of them disappointments by the way ( in more than one way for most ).I seen Project Zomboid and just kept passing it over. There's no way I would enjoy Zomboid. So was kinda eyeing Miscreated which had just come out, but while it looks ok . Seems like it just released way to early with not enough to offer. I could'nt bring myself to buy it though. To many others are stuck in this same state ( that I own) for me to commit to purchasing.\nWell then I clicked on Project Zomboid (negative thoughts running through my mind). Read about the game. Scrolled down to reviews and started reading some( almost 6k positive and under 400 negative ).. Well hell that says alot right there. Most zombie survival games are about 1/2 and 1/2 with pos/neg reviews. So I wnt to youtube and started watching reviews on PZ. Took me about 2hrs to commit to buying PZ. Mind you I was still pretty darn sure I would'nt like it, but with so many positive reviews and positive community behind it. I figured I would give it a try.\n\nI must say boy was I wrong. Just like minecraft this game proves graphics aren't everything. This game has really blown me away. Most complete and satisfying zombie survival to date for me ( hands down ). I can't say enough about PZ. Im still shocked that Im enjoying this game this much..If your on the fence just buy it. If your like me and thought no way? Just buy it... But wait there'ssssss Moooooore!!!!!!! This games not done yet. They still have alot to add, and the direction they are going sounds amazing. This game is only going to get better people.\n\nLong story short. Just Buy The D@%$ Game.....\n\nP.S: to those 370 Negative Reviewers WTH did you play the same game I did =p","November 16, 2014","true","45.6"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","4"

While it had potential it was a visually ugly, buggy experience.\n\nFast forward nearly two years and I returned after reading about the new visual engine and changes to the default Survival mode. Now I think it's one of the best early access games around (since Kerbal left the EA stable).\n\nAnyway you live in Knox County (an absolutely massive map btw) which has a couple of substantial towns, out of town mega-mall (go there if you want to die) and many other out of the way locales.\n\nI really can't be bothered writing any more here. Just trust me (how could you not!) that this is a beast of a game with many levels of gameplay (medicine, crafting, cooking etc..) to keep you interested. Game can be played as pure roguelike by creating a new world each time you die, or - what I do - roguelite by having the next character spawn in the pre-existing world and recovering your old safe house and inventory.\n\nThe downside to playing the same world with a new toon is that by then you will be a month or two into the apocalypse. What this means is NO ELECTRICITY, NO WATER, MANY FOODSTUFF SPOILED and an expanded Zombie population.\n\nJust try the game, or wait till it leaves early access. Either way it doesn't bother me because I don't know you and if I did, I probably wouldn't like you enough to be steam friends and travel the world in MP together. Don't be sad about that, you'll find "FUN" in this game even without me.","October 5, 2015","true","31.3"," 37 of 59 people (63%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","63","37","59","8","8"

It's early release now but already oozes potential and will no doubt get much better as time goes on. It's a permadeath survival game with many mechanics such as weather, exposure, moodlets, cooking, scavenging, infection, positive/negative trait tradeoffs, enormous map to explore, electricity/water supplies, crafting and a bunch of other stuff.

When I first played this game I was getting killed just about every day and thought 'meh'.  I started again recently and instead of playing 'gung ho' style(sing it with me) I have been taking my time, reading tutorials, tips and crafting guides when I get stuck.\nI've tried Survival and Sandbox and much prefer the sandbox version of the game(I don't die as quickly).  The thing I love about this game?  If I die my body becomes a zombie, I then can create a new character and can go and kill that zombie and get all my stuff back.  Any structure I created is there for that new character, hell even down to  keeping a journal, die, pick up the old journal and continue the journal as a new character has some weird satisfaction.\nThis game is not for the 'half an hour at a time player', not to say you cant play that way, but it's best played if you have about 3 hours or more to spend at a time.\nThe map is large, I didn't realize just how large this map was till running from point A to B trying to find the user created maps I added.\nGraphics are not what this games about but they do the job.\nCustomization before a sandbox game begins gives you just about everything you could think of to tweak it to your own liking.\n\nI have left 7DTD to play this game, and I absolutely believed that it couldn't get better than 7DTD, time will tell!","May 9, 2015","true","195.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

Zombies are fun to kill and very challenging at times. Crafting is fairly in depth and should get better with time. There is no multiplyer as of yet but that is something that is planning on being released.\n\nWhen raiding houses or any building for supplies you never know what to expect with is awesome.

It is supposed to fill the gap between crafting games and survival games but (in my opinion) fails in some important aspects.\n\nAfter a fun character creation (profession, many ridicolous attributes to choose from: deaf, obese ...) and a difficulty choice you spawn in your apartment in an undead infested world. You explore a giant world with towns and forrests all the while defending yourself against zombies and the elements of nature. There is no hope of survival! (and thats the problem)\n\nThis is one of those games you think should be great but once you actually try it out, its just lackluster and a waste of time. Here is why:\n\nFighting System\n\nYou kill endless hordes of undead which all behave the same (some slower or faster but thats it) and look pretty similar after some time. This might be "classic zombie behaviour" but has to be counteracted by engaging and fun combat mechanics.\nIts simply not fun to right click, then hold the attack until the zombie is in reach and release the mouse button. The zombie either stumbles and falls over or you have to walk backwards and repeat. Once its down simply stomp it to death.\n\nThis is fun  for like a hundred zombies and becomes a chore afterwards.\n\nI dont mind killing zombie hordes after hordes in any other zombie game but somehow this game sucked the fun out of it. Even worse that the whole map is crawling with zombies and you have to waste many real life hours to clear an area. But then you wont meet a damn zombie there for a loong time since they only respawn when you leave area for a longer period of time.\n\nNot even the guns can salvage the complete lack of zombie-slaying fun since they are hard to come by (good) but utterly useless since they alarm every zombie around. They are also clunky and require a high shooting skill to hit anything even in close proximity. You also have no real way of aiming with a crosshair, only general pointing and praying for a hit.\n\nVariation\n\nThere are multiple weapons in this game: Pencils, knifes, axes, baseball bats, shotguns, pistol and lots more.\nBUT they mostly look literally the same (a lot of melee weapons look like the baseball bat) and handle pretty similar in combat.\n\nCrafting seems exciting since you have they choice between hundreds of recipes (even generators which can power lamps or a fridge). But the amount of stuff you have to find until you can craft these things is huge and can take a long time of wandering around the map searching for random loot. The result is simply not worth the grind. The UI makes handling you inventory quite annoying and needs a serious overhaul.\n\n\nLong term goal/ motivation\n\nThe main reason i cant recommend this is the complete lack of motivation to actually survive. You gonna die anyway so why even hoard supplies or farm endlessly? L4d has saferooms and some kind of escape in the unknown. 7 days to die has huge building projects to undertake (also kind of pointless but still). Resident Evil, Dying Light and many other zombie games use a story line to keep the player engaged.\n\nProject Zomboid has nothing but building youself a poor mans fort and play farmer till you get bored to death. Of course you can still have a lot of fun but simply imagining a story in your head but why take this from the devs shoulders? There is mainly one thing which would boost the stale gameplay: NPCs combined with some long term goal ( cure, Escape or whatever). This brings us to:\n\nDevelopment Pace\n\nThis game is in development for about 5 years and gets updates every few weeks but doesnt progress anymore. The recently addet TVs and radios dont even have sound! They just repeat the same written lines like in retro games (sounds in fallout 2 for example).\nThe developer essays are interesting to read at first but get annoying very soon. If there happens a major update which actually implements some kind of content apart from wandering the map, killing samey zombies and looting endless containers i will gladly update my review.\n\nUntil then i cannot recommend this game at all.\n","January 26","false","54.7"," 55 of 93 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","55","93","2","18"

I picked up some food and a baseball bat and ran around smashing windows, climbing inside people's houses and looting. After caving in a few Z-heads I was told I was thirsty. I drank some water from a toilet and all was well. I was then told I was hungry. Searching in a house I found a "TV Dinner", which sounded perfect. I walked over and put it in the oven. While I was waiting for it to cook I read a book. A short time later I came over to the oven only to find I had burnt my TV dinner. The game told me I would get depressed and unhappy should I eat it. I did. I was instantly overwhelmed with depression and told I was tired. I went to sleep on the couch.\n\nDay 2\nThe next morning I awoke in an unhappy mood. I was playing about with the controls and somehow managed to accelerate time at an alarming rate. After smashing some keys I finally got it back to normal. My character was hungry, thirsty, bored, depressed and tired now. O goodie.\n\nI found a steak and slung it in the oven to cook. I was not going to let this meal burn, so I stood there watching it cook. The instant it was finished I grabbed it and scoffed the whole thing. As is tradition, I washed it down with some toilet water. I was told my character was going to collapse (presumably because he had been awake for about 2 days solid due to the time accelerating-issue). I curled up on the sofa and went to sleep.\n\nDay 4?\nI woke up in the middle of the night and could not see a thing. I thought it best I continue with my book in the pitch black, so began reading for a bit. Morning came and I was hungry and thirsty. I searched around the neighbourhood for supplies and came across a packet of cigarettes and some peanut butter. I ate the cigarettes and the peanut butter and sipped some more toilet water. I also found a backpack and various other supplies. I went on a journey north. My mood seemed to change as I smashed Z after Z' head in. My depression lifted and I found new vigour. As the day went on I looted a liquor shop for crisps and ice-cream and broke into a farm house to steal a hammer and nails.\n\n....that's pretty much how my game went so far.\n\nJimbo Rating: 7/10","October 8, 2014","true","12.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It takes place in the town of Muldraugh Kentucky and the surrounding areas of Knox County. (Fun fact, the scene in which the villians  men are marching up a street with a tank towards Fort Knox in the James Bond film "Gold Finger" was shot in Muldraugh.) Over the course of it's development, Project Zomboid has suffered some outstanding set backs. Paypal and Google freezing Indie Stones accounts, Piracy of the game early in it's development, and the theft of a large amount of code stored on a pair of laptops. Despite all that, Project Zomboid is still here, and it has come a hell of a long way.\n\nGameplay involves scavanging supplies from the houses belonging to your ex neighbors, fortifying a house to hold off the steadily increasing number of zombies, and generally trying to set up some kind of long term survival. Zombies have infectious bites/scratches, which is an issue I have with the game. When you get bit or scratched, you might as well just quit. No point in continuing to play a doomed character. Fortunately, the sandbox mode allows you to turn the infection off, or tweak the gameplay and zombies in many other ways. The game also features basic crafting and construction, which allow you to make a few small utility items, or build very simple structures. Cooking is a good source of fun, especially when you are playing with friends. The best part is making rat soup and making your friends eat it. The game also features a fair bit of random variable when it comes to the zombies. Noises of any kind usually attract them, including the ambient noises you hear around you as you explore. A major source of game ending noise are burgler alarms and helicopters. The burgler alarm triggers sometimes when you break into a house, the noise it makes can be heard for miles and will attract every single zombie within that area of effect. They will descend upon the house and rip it apart searching for the source of the noise, not to mention you if you are fool enough to hang around said house. The other source, helicopters, have a large range of noise and if they come by while you are outside, they will follow you around. Imagine a news helicopter trying to get footage of an unfortunate survivor, unaware that their presence is dooming him/her. Other noises such as gunshots, barking dogs, screaming people, serve the same purposes but to a lesser extent. The ambiant noises occur once, and basically just move zombies in a shortish range towards the sounds origin point. It also serves as a bit of atmosphere. Speaking of screaming people, NPC are planned. You can go to the community hub and see as everyone demands and complains ceaselessly about the lack of NPC's. Some of them even know that zomboid DID have NPC's once. They were horrifyingly buggy and were removed to be worked on at a later date. For now, the game is perfectly playable as is, if a little empty. If you want to fill that world out a bit, make it seems a bit less empty...\n\nYou can play Zomboid with your friends. The new easy co-op is out as of 5/9/2016 and I am deeply thankful that it is. Hosting multiplayer with friends has gone was a horrifying hassle of opening and forewarding ports, running external server programs, and friends issues with relayed tunneling. It is now a simple, streamlined, click-and-go system. Thanks Indie stone, and thanks to General Arcade for helping them get it worked out. The new co-op multiplayer is great. You can even allocate how much ram you want for the server from inside the game. It is really easy to use, and thanks to it, I can force my friends to eat rat based meals and roasted cockroaches.","May 10","true","313.8"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","17","24","2","0"

During the winter sale I was looking for a new survival game to play, and this always proves to be a difficult task because there are so many fake survival games, games that with enough grinding you can easily thrive.\n\nSo I decided to give project zomboid a try, and the game positively surprised me.\nIt is a really hard game where if you be careful enough, you'll be able to survive, but a minor screw up can and will kill you. Wasn't prepared for that zombie in the bathroom of a house you thought was empty? He can scratch you or bite you, giving you a high chance of zombification, an illness with no cure in the game. Yes, you a zombie manages to scratch or bite you, there's a big chance that the game over timer will start ticking.\nAnd even if you isolate yourself from the huge amounts of zombie in the forested areas of the huge (HUGE) map, you'll still will have to deal with food and water. Food can be preserved for more time in fridges, but guess what? After a random amount of days, the power will be cut out. You can drink water from sinks and toilets, but just like the power, water will also be cut out after a random amount of days.\n\nThe character creation is fantastic as well, and the trait system reminds me of old fallout games. You have good and bad traits that give you negative and positive points, respectively. You can only start the game if you have 0 or more points so you'll need to balance your character accordingly.\n\nAnd it has multiplayer! I had loads of fun playing with two people, scavenging the city for supplies, reinforcing a place to call home...\n\nAnd finally, another thing that really surprised me was the amount of zombies in the game. Depending on your luck and area in the game, you can stumble upon hordes and hordes of zombies. This feels just like the walking dead, and in fact it's one of the games that feels most like the series, apart from the telltale's ones, of course.\n\nThis game is still in early access and it's loads of fun. I can't even think of how it will look and play when it's done.","January 7","true","40.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

There have been 2 updates this year, yes, since January 1st 2015 until August 31st 2015, only 2 new builds that haven't offered anything more than a few pieces of new content that are buggy and unbalanced. Back at the beginning of the year the devs said NPCs should come out around the end of Q2.

That doesn't change the fact that updates are seldom to the extreme even for indie games and often don't include much to actually improve or expand upon existing gameplay.

However, this game is a masterpiece in the open world survival genre, pitting you against mankind's greatest foe. Care to take a guess? The answer is not zombies. It's your own bodily functions. The easy to avoid zombies start to look a little more dangerous with each bit of your health slowly disappearing over time, whether you're spiraling into insanity, or catching the common cold, or growing bored and wet. And you thought hunger and thirst were bad enough.\n\nTo further add onto the awesome, Zomboid has a functioning split-screen mode as well as a working online mutliplayer that came as quite a shock to a number of players who never expected it to see the light of day. Among that, it features a micromanageable difficulty in which you can alter anything from playing with a mass of zombies or completely alone (which is oddly terrifying), to altering how much loot you have, what kind of weather you'll see, infection conditions, and even modify zombie AI. And then you get a lot of mod functionality from allowing gameplay changes to custom professions. Even at Early Access, Project Zomboid is already working on a solid (and a little buggy) foundation, and is definitely worth checking out.","November 21, 2013","true","31.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Something I could play for awhile, something that wouldn't leave me feeling like there could be 'more'a. I remeber the first time I heard of H1Z1, and DayZ- they both sounded amazing. Looking at screenshots, how could I not be impressed?\n\nHow naive. If you really look around for any zombie apocalypse games, those two names are bound to come up, and with them, their history of major, major disappointment.\n\nA couple days ago, I was looking through my Steam Queue, and Project Zomboid happened to pop up. Watching the video, I was intrigued. Yeah, the graphics weren't photorealistic, but then again, when did they ever have to be? When I looked towards the reviews and comments, I was estatic, and could only hope it measured up.\n\nIt totally did.\n\nI've only played a few hours as of this review, but I'm absolutely hooked. In its current state, it is completely playable, and worth its $14.99 price tag.\n\nPros\n- Realistic survival simulation\n\nDeath comes swift and quick for those who don't pay enough attention. From basic survival needs like food and water, the game goes beyond and even throws in challenges in other forms. Staying out in the rain might get you sick, and if you don't take care of that, you might be visiting the Grim Reaper pretty soon. You can be cold, scratched, bitten, and you can bleed, and feel nausea and so much more. Honestly, you get screwed over pretty quick\n\n- Good UI\n\nNot much to say. It's got clean menus, and useful graphics.\n\n- Good Personalization\n\nDo you love zombie games? Do you still suck at killing them? No worries. This game has quite a few different play styles, each one taking place at a different time in the apocalypse. The Initial Infection (a non-canon play for those of us who suck at the games we love), The First Week (where things start to pick up, and those zombies really start to pay closer attention to you), Six Months Later (the name says it all, but you better know how to get water for yourself...), and the last mode, Survival, where you see how long it takes you to die.\n\nThe first three modes even have more difficulty options within them, so you really get to pick what type of game you want to play.\n\n-  The fact that this is only Early Access\n\nThis game feels full, alive (or, uh, undead?), and pretty complet minus some bugs here or there. The fact that this game will only get better is really exciting!\n\nCons\n- Melee/ selection dificulties\n\nBy no means rendering the game unplayable, but melee is always the way I go. This could just be my game, but I occasionally have issues with fighting zombies. I'll be aimed right on them, but whatever weapon I'm beating them with will move right through them. Moving around a bit usually helps this, but it can be an ocasional annoyance.\n\n-  Cooking is burdensome\n\nNot something that is super problematic, but still worth mentioning. Some players have found cooking to be a hit and miss problem without the help of the wikia or other guides. Recipes, unless you know them, can leave you confused on what you can and can't cook. Yeah, you can make soup. But, no, you can't make bowls of cereal and milk (which I know from my own tragic expirience).\n\nConclusion or tl;dr\nThe problems in Project Zomboid are very minimal, and are not enough to turn a player away from the game. What you get with this a really fun game that you can play for hours on end. Whether you want to build a fort, or leech off existing houses, live in a Zombie-filled city, or a blank country side, you're in charge of your own tragic and inevitable death.\n\nIt's fifteen bucks of sign-me-the-♥♥♥♥-up. If you wanna see how you'd fair in the zombie apocalypse, here's your game\n\nPluss the mascot is a raccoon. A cute raccoon.

It was shaping up to be the zombie survival game I've always wanted. After playing it for the first time, I fell in love. It had the right amount of depth and realism needed to really make it special. You had to deal with all the struggles of surviving in a zombie outbreak, from not getting eaten alive by the zombies themselves to depression. The game also has a good amount of difficulty, even if the game is easy to learn and master after multiple playthroughs. Surviving for a skilled player becomes trivial. That's where the NPCs come in though, to spice up the playthrough.\n\nAnd that's the reason why I am not able to recommend this game, unfortunately. I understand the NPCs the devs had planned were very ambitious (probably too ambitious for a small team) and need time to get right. I also understand that the devs have went through development hell, and that's also part of the reason for NPCs not being close to finished. However, it's been about 6 years since I started following this game, and I'm beginning to give up hope of ever seeing NPCs in this game anytime in the near future.\n\nFor me, NPCs are a big component of this game, and not having them just makes the game seem hollow. Sure, you have all this depth to this survival experience, but it's really hard to have the motivation to survive if you have nothing to survive for. I feel like NPCs are what would take this game and really turn it into something special. Unfortunately, the devs have decided not to reveal anything about NPCs until they are in their final phases of development. While I understand why they are doing this, it is causing many people who follow this game (me included) to lose hope of ever seeing NPCs in the game.\n\nHowever, there is multiplayer. If you are the type of player who loves multiplayer survival games, then go ahead and pick this game up. It works very well from what I've played of it. However, I personally am a singleplayer fan, and so NPCs are what makes or breaks this game for me. Unfortunately, until NPCs are added (or we get any news about it in the upcoming months) I cannot recommend this game for anyone who isn't wanting to play multiplayer. While it is fun for a bit, the singleplayer will get old rather quickly.\n\nMy biggest fear is that they will start to focus exclusively on multiplayer rather than NPCs. I really hope this is not the case, as I've always wanted a good singleplayer zombie survival experience.","April 30","false","11.3"," 66 of 117 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","66","117","3","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/recommended/108600/","Coeco","Coe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/","270 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA real solid survival game that unfortunately ends up falling a bit short due to the huge and arguably broken random factor. Surviving your first couple of days is easy since food is borderline abundant in every house along with water being a common commodity at every tap, toilet and bathtub. Eventually, however, these resources will dwindle, not only by the human consumption but due to the basic services shutting down.\n\nElectricity and the Waterworks will abruptly be cut off after some time, leaving any fridge-dependant foods to be almost instantly spoiled, leaving you very dependant on rare canned foods, chips and other conserverd commodities which will run out real fast depending on your character. "Just create a farm!" you say? Fantastic Idea! Just one flaw: You need to find a shovel/trowel and plant seeds. While seeds are rather common, trowel/shovels are not. I have spent countless of hours, killing hundreds of zombies to clear out a big piece of farm-land just to spend even more time searching dumbly for seemingly common tools In order to have any kind of chance to survive. And even then, surviving for any seriously long amount of time won't be possible because your sources of water will run dry faster than you can say "Kebab" as any and all plantations require gigantic sources of water that will need to be hauled back and forth by you, consuming very large amounts of time for little to no actual food seeing how the watering of plants doesn't last for more than half a day or so.\n\nBut that Isn't even your biggest issue. The method of getting these supplies of water will be unavailable eventually as the city's water works off will turn off. "Just go to a lake!" you say? Nope. No lakes, no rivers and no oceans. Only the very rare 1-2 wells per map which are waaaay outside the actual playing zone/spawn and the only real other way to create a sustainable, although random way of water income is to create rain collection barrels. You'll need Nails, a hammer, a garbage plastic bag and some planks for that.\n\nDoesn't sound too bad, right? Wrong. To create planks, you need wooden logs. To create wooden logs, you need to chop down trees... Which you essentially need an Axe for. An even moreso rare item than Trowels and nowhere does this get more annoying than when you search through countless workshops in hope for an axe and Instead get a Saw! "Cut down trees with that"! You say? Nope. Can't do that. You NEED an axe to produce any significant quantities, which comedically enough, has an ingame model of a fireaxe out of all things. No common house-hold hatchets, no making your own improvised axe, no machete or other blunt cutting weapons. You need. An Axe. To produce ANY significant amount of logs. Sure, you can get a good laugh and chop down trees by using a fork If you want to humiliate the already embarassingly stupid sense of logic programmed by the devs but that will take over 200 swings (literally and figuratively slapping a wet blanket up against a tree) but If you're playing said survival game with the promise of It being realistic, it better damn iron out the assigning of item usages and a more realistic loot palette, preferrably designed by someone who doesn't live on an deserted island in the pacific.\n\nAnd as I also described earlier, In one of my playthroughs, I cleared out a huge farmland that had a gigantic harvest of Wheat/Corn in the middle of it, which I couldn't pick. No big deal there, would have been overpowered. Now what I did get frustrated on was another smaller piece of farm land, with fences around it and the ground already being dug up neatly. I cleared the remaining zombies before i eagerly grabbed my seeds and the dozens of water-filled Gardening Spray Cans I found earlier in Workshops/storages and ran out in the dug-up mounds of dirt, standing there like an idiot for minutes on end, trying to figure out just how the game wanted me to put my seeds into the ground before trying all possible combinations, visiting the game wiki and getting a big "F*ck you" finger up in my face on how you NEED a TROWEL/SHOVEL to drop seeds from your hands and into the loose dirt.\n\nAdding on a 25+ digit of the previously 40+ houses I searched before reaching the farm, I still ended up with not finding an axe. Not finding a trowel. Not finding a shovel. Nothing. Just more nails, some glue, duct tape and a saw, endlessly taunting me In the face on just what I could have done at my small farmstead in the forest at this point Instead of running around like a complete and utter jackass, struggling to find a specific bent piece of metal so I can put down some seeds on an already processed piece of soil Instead of using my hands, other tools such as hammers that have plowing capacities with the tail, a shoe, an empty soup can, a spoon or my hands. But no, that wouldn't be according to the game logic of this "Simulator". Simply put, If you run to a nearby Workshop and don't get a Shovel/Trowel, a Fireaxe and a Saw, your playthrough already has been signed It's death warrant by none other than the developers.\n\nAnd as I said, Project Zomboid is by all means, a solid game that I also happen to enjoy much personally. but If you look at the on-going 3-4+ years of development time and the current state It is in, one is fair to call it a pile of f*cking rubbish as mods made by lone people in their spare time develop features into this game so much faster than a team of 6 (discluding dozens of associates) fully paid professionals, It's downright frikking embarassing, especially considering the game Is not even 3d, so as of right now, I will unfortunately recommend everyone to avoid this title right now until the developers take the energy they do on advertising updates or explaining why they screwed up on delivering these updates in time and put that effort into making said, promised updates.\n\nI would however, recommend to buy It on a sale.\n\n\nUPDATE: The developers have gone out of their way to ♥♥♥♥♥ the reputation of this title up even more by spending MASSIVE amounts of manpower to integrate user mods into the base game. Yes, that's right. This company that has now been slamming a hammer non-stop for 5+ years on this game has now resorted to spending company time to do less of the sorely needed actual development on the game to force-feed it user made modifications that ANYONE could use at ANY TIME with ANY VERSION of the game OUT OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL prior to this. And to make matters even worse, they have also gone out of their way to start quoting positive Steam user reviews on the store page and have the actual review be consistent of "lol gud geym ei playd a bunhc 10/10 xd" and rightfully so, the reviews they linked have about 25% out of 100% user approval for being retárded.\n\nAnd of course as I recommended to get this game on a sale following my negative review of the game, there has been next to none of them from what I can only presume is only an act of good old fashioned cócky greed at the devs end as Steam now allows any studio to instantly put their products on sale, leaving no marketing excuse as to why not.\n\nAvoid this turd like the plague.","March 1, 2014","false","32.7"," 654 of 1,217 people (54%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","54","654","1","46","90"

This game's interface looks so simplistic by today's standards, and yet the Indie Stone team has managed to possibly create one of the best post-apocalyptic zombie survival games in existence to date.\n\nIn a sea of games set in the rapidly-becoming-trite-and-humdrum End Of The World By Way Of Zombies scenarios, this one outshines them all.  Yes, even in its alpha stage.\n\nIn the sandbox game, you create your character and are greeted with the cheery messages telling you, basically, that you're *going* to die.  There's no rescue coming, the end isn't just nigh, it's done come and gone.  You're on your own.  Your goal is basically just to survive as long as you can.  And die you will.  Many, many times, at least unti you get the hang of the game's mechanics and how to avoid becoming some poor deceased fast food worker's lunch.  Barricade windows and doors, erect walls, keep yourself fed and watered, and don't let your character get bored and depressed.  Flee town and start a farm to live off the land, or hole up in an abandoned warehouse and periodically raid the surrounding buildings for supplies, all while avoiding the relentless horde which believably reacts to sight, sound, and smell.\n\nFor those of you used to games like Left 4 Dead, taking on a horde of fifty zombies with a shotgun is one of the worst things you can do in this game.  The noise brings every zombie in a five mile radius bearing down on you, and your ammo supply is typically very limited.  Even one zombie hiding in that corner you forgot to check is a threat.  Whoa, there was one in the tall grass you didn't see, and he wasn't dead.  Now he's gnawing on your ankle.  Whoops, is that a bite?  Welp.  You're infected.  Expect to live another couple of days in game before turning.  Or you could just chug that bottle of bleach you found in the bathroom earlier to end it now...\n\nIn short, this game delivers one of the most intense and gripping presentations of the zombie apocalypse I've seen in a video game yet.  Pessimistic and gritty, and incredibly addicting, even without the option of mowing down hundreds of cannon fodder corpses.  I've probably logged more than 150 hours in this game in total, and I still can't get enough.\n\nThe best part is that the development team is still working hard, cranking out more and more updates, polishing features, ironing out the bugs, and keeping their players informed about what's to come.  This game is well, WELL worth the $15 they're asking for.","September 1, 2014","true","291.0"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","3"

It is a great indie survival zombiegame. You can build walls, craft weapons or farm your vegetables for the soup you cooked for example. But you don't have to. Loot houses, shops and kill zombies. You are free to do everything you want, but believe me you will die! The question is just, how long will you survive :D That's fun, because u have to think about your next steps. You need to find your own way to survive. Even if it is early acces, i decided to purchase this game. I really appericiate Project Zomboid. If this sounds interesting for you, play the demo. Many features aren't released yet, like factions, npc and the Story Mode with a Tutorial, but this Early Access / Demo ist still fun. Try it out. It is very hard in the beginning to survive, but give it a chance :) . . . i look forward to the full release, but the makers of PZ need some time to present it perfect i guess. And that's good i think. When you like to play a tactical zombiegame with a huge upcoming and already existing gameplay this could be a nice game for you.

But this game has incredible depth. Managing your various states whether you are hungry or thirsty, in a state of panic or anger, wet or overheated, encumbered, sleepy, sick and much much more.\n\nThis game is tough, the procedural generation makes each play through unique and can be your best friend or your worst enemy. You might load into a house with an axe and a pistol or you could be heading out armed with a spoon or fork and this is what makes this game great.\n\nEach game feels like a real survivors story, you are not a hero, you are just trying to stay alive as long as you can before meeting your untimely demise.\n\nI am excited for future development of this game and the new features promised look to improve this great game even further.\n\nAs for the bad, my only current complaint is the multiplayer system. Hosting a server is a nightmare to do and a server tool or using steam would greatly improve this issue aside from that I am enjoying the game and hope they create a better multiplayer option soon.","October 8, 2014","true","2.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The goal of the game is simple, you must get from being a survivor to a rebuilder of a one-man society. You are on a time limit as the utilities will soon shut down within weeks, so you must quickly locate your pernament base and fortify it, then start building a garden and several rain catcher barrels to produce food and water. Melee weapons are more important than firearms, and fire can cause a little more destruction than necessary. The zombies, of course, can see, hear, and smell you, so cover up the windows and stick to the shadows and downwind to avoid detection. Remember that a single bite or scratch, even if it is disinfected and bandaged, will strike you ill and kill you no matter what, so don't be cocky and decide to take on an entire herd unless you have a stronghold to take shelter for your dramatic final stand.\n\nThe goal for me is always the same. Once the game is started, I quickly go out and search for a suitable shelter or stay in the one I have spawned in. Then I shelter-in-place, you know, cover up all the windows and such. I take inventory of my food, then one everything is situated, I go out into the industrial areas of the map to locate three things: An axe, a saw, a hammer, and lots of nails. The idea is to get an axe to chop down the many confiers that grow in the game world, then use the saw to turn them into wooden planks, then use those planks to build walls, doors, and all sorts of useful furniture to hold your important gear. Once the structure of the base is established, I started fixing up a garden. Sometimes I have to move dirt around, usually up on the roof where I don't have to worry about zombies trampling on my crops. I also build my kitchen outdoors, using a campfire as a stove. With the power and water lines being finite resources, it is imperative to get your self-sufficient base established as soon as possible.\n\nIf you are wondering there are vehicles in this game, then the answer is no, there is no planes, trains, and automobiles in Project Zomboid. Your own two feet is your way in moving around the map. Due to the nature of the game engine, I do not expect to find vehicles in this game anytime soon.","December 25, 2014","true","154.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The warmth of the fire from the stone helped me calm my nerves as the moans of the undead could be heard not far from where I was. I checked the cabinets for food. No luck. I checked the fridge. Nothing. There had to be something in this place. If the dead didn't get to me, starvation would. Finally, after searching the entire house, I found a bag of chips underneath the couch in the living room. They were the best stale chips I've had in what felt like days. For the very first time, I felt like everything was going to be alright, until I noticed the curtains in the living room window were still open, and the undead had spotted me. Their moans attracted more of them as they began to surround the house, smashing through the windows. Me, with my trust crowbar ran into the bathroom, fearing that this was the end. I closed the door behind me and frankly searched for a way out. Panic settled in as the realization that I had no way out with the undead banging at the bathroom door sank in.\nI didn't survive 20 minutes after starting the game. 10 out of 10.\nFor a game that's only in Early Access and has come this far makes me proud to play it.

There is a mystery as to why the zombie outbreak occurred, and you might even find some answers before you die. Ultimately though, Project Zomboid does not represent an against-all-odds struggle where you overcome the undead. Instead, after dying, every subsequent playthrough just lets you survive a little longer, do a little better, and  learn a little more.\n\nDeath can come in many, many ways. You have to manage needs, similar to The Sims . You need to eat, sleep, and even need to rest your legs if you're running around too much . You aren't able to see meters that indicate your exact state, but moodlets will appear to let you know exactly what your character is thinking or feeling at any given time. Injuries are common, so if you're scratched or bitten by a zombie, you better tend to them quickly.\n\nThe town is populated by other survivors and looters, some just as desperate as you. Everyone is  scared by the thousands of zombies roaming the city, and a looter just might find you and put a shotgun round in your chest as he takes your food and other supplies. Scripted events like this will keep you on your toes, but with every failure comes the chance to prepare a little better for next time.\n\nThe zombies themselves are the slow and lumbering kind. You can fairly easily outrun them, but they are legion, and don't easily forget. They are attracted by blood and noise, and all it takes is a single mistake to advertise your location to the horde. You've never had to think in so many different directions and cover your butt in so many different ways before. As a result, every moment is exciting because you never know what lurks around the corner and whether you missed that one thing that will give away your position. Getting into a routine and locking down your safehouse will be just as important as finding food and scavenging for weapons.\n\nCrafting is also a large part of Project Zomboid. At the moment, your character already "knows" the recipes needed to create objects to help him: combining a can opener, a can of soup, and a pot results in a big pot of edible soup, for example. Cooking will eventually be part of the game as well, adding another layer of complexity to basic survival; after all, you don't want to be suffering from food poisoning due to eating undercooked meat if you're being chased down by zombies.\n\nOverall, well worth a buy. It's easy to see that Project Zomboid has potential and lots of merits.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","October 23, 2014","true","4.6"," 25 of 41 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","25","41","0","1"

Blends survival, (real survival) action, simulation, RPG mechanics and of course, zombies. While the zombie genre has been over used to death, (just like that pun) this game really brings something fresh. The greatest aspect is the certainty that you WILL DIE. The real question is when.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are pleasing for me, the style mixes really well and nothing ever sticks out of place except bugs in the art and lighting. The developers are costantly working on this though.\n\nMap\nThe map is set out realisticly and has many locations including lumber yards, farms, wilderness, houses, shops, motels, and more. It is important to mention here that the world is NOT procedurally generated. I think this is good because it makes the world feel far more real and considering how big the developers plan the world to be - it's not going to be a problem.\n\nGameplay\nIf you love survival games, this game will be perfect for you. You can play heaps of different ways and even allows for the "run and gun" tactics which will definitly lead to an untimely end. The developers do stress that if you want to survive long term, you must stay down, sneak around zombies and avoid running - for one scratch could mean zombification. You must keep healthy, scavenge supplies, eat, drink, craft, explore, barricade and heaps more. Keep in mind these are slow zombies, and is tailored for a Romero audience. While you can play sandbox mode and set the zombies to sprinters, this is extremley challenging due to all the other factors you have to survive too,\n\nPlanned\nThere are many planned features, including multiplayer, vehicles, an even larger map, hunting and far far more. I suggest you check the forums for planned features.\n\nGripes\nThe only major gripes I have with this game in its current state is the occasional graphical glitches which can really take you out of the game. Another gripe is the UI glitches. They have recently given their UI an overhaul, and while the new inventory system is amazing, some of the pop up menu's look glitchy.\n\nVerdict\nThis game has the potential to be incredible, even in its current state I could sink hours into it (and have), my lack of game time on my profile is due to me backing this game back in 2011 and I have played many hours of the non-steam version. So, if you love survival zombie games and have a solid zombie apocalypse plan that you want to put into action, this is the game for you.","November 25, 2013","true","49.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This is a survival game in the truest definition of the word. With the settings on singleplayer you're able to hone the game exactly to your liking from zombie density to loot rarity all the way down to infection mortality time.\n\nA really deep (yet not very upfront) crafting system, a pretty solid building system with other nice features such as cooking recipes (found a frying pan? have some steak and some vegetables? how about a stirfry to raise your mood and get rid of that boredom)\n\nThe character system is a nice break down as well, you can see exactly where you're injured and take action directly from there whether it be switching bandages, or applying disinfectant directly to a wound.\n\nThe dev's really take into consideration what the players are suggesting and try to implement ideas the best as possible, it's truly what an early access game should be.\n\nThere are flaws though, an awkward camera and movement system that takes some getting used to, there's very few tooltips to explain what items can be used for. The game is not very user friendly, you have to do quite a bit of researching either on the Wiki or by trial-and-error, but all in all... it's a real solid early access and besides The Long Dark one of the only TRUE survival games out there.\n\n\nUPDATE: June 2015\n\nThe expiremental branch is really coming along and the devs continue to deliver on their promises, still one of (if not the) best early access games on Steam.\n\nTL:DR -- Very deep survival game, camera takes some getting used to, highly recommended.","January 10, 2015","true","36.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The devs are working hard to improve the gameplay, and update often enough. Most importantly, for those of you who are looking to opt in during early access, the game is not only playable, but very fun. While not feature complete, it could be released as is and be a perfectly solid, complete game. This is an example of early access done right.\n\nAs for the specifics of why this game is worth a buy (at any stage of its development), it has a lot going for it in terms of gameplay. It feels desperate, and it's tough as nails, but you never feel like you got screwed randomly. You're in control of how much risk you take on in your endeavors, and with increased risk comes greater reward. Scavenging in a mall may be far more lucrative than in a trailer park, but there are far more zombies in a mall, for instance.\n\nIt's unlike other survival games in that it isn't all about endlessly spamming crafting, though crafting does play a vital role. It's not like other zombie games in that the zombies are actually what made zombies cool 25-30 years ago (as opposed to lame and played out in 2015). They're terrifying in numbers, but are a total joke individually. That said, a moment of negligence could end your life.\n\nYou won't regret buying this, and now that Steam offers easy refunds, why not give it a go? It's potentially a classic in the genre. You'd be cheating yourself if you passed this up.","June 29, 2015","true","13.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

It's a fantastic game as-is and definitely worth the price, and yet the potential of this game is vast.\n\nDon't be deterred by the dated graphics of project zomboid. What it lacks in graphic definition it easily makes up for in gameplay and content. In fact I consider the simple graphics a boon to the game, giving ease for developers and modders to add droves of great content.\n\nThe only thing that would make this more realistic is a Crapped Your Pants! moodlet, which I assure you would be the first one that would actually happen to me.","June 2, 2015","true","97.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","10","13","4","2"

Bandits/ gangs. Vehicles that can be torched, looted/driven. If the right person sees the possibilites in this game, then he/she will be famous. Already there is so much things you can do in this game, and thanks to the bright minds in the modding community the list of doable things keeps growing everyday.\n\nI usually never buy a "early access" game, i dont like and i dont need the frustration, buuut i read this game was well worth owing it in its current state. Yes they were right, never before has it been so delightful to smash the empty head of my ever nagging neighbour.\nEveryday for ten years he has been around my door with his Jehovas witness propaganda when im watchin tv and having a beer. But yesterday i finally managed to get even, i grabbed the frying pan his wife gave me for christmas decades ago and smashed his head clean off his shoulders, The jebus propaganda flew everywhere, the walls were sprayed with blood. I went outside, noone to see, and noone yelling at me. Good!\n\nWhen i now walk down the street, everyone bow for me. Could it be because i am so nice and good and clean? Maybe- or could it be because i am carrying a bloody axe over my shoulder? Probably..\n\nThis game is worth supporting, i only hope more additions keep coming. We want to see well detailed fires, crumbling buildings. Explosives- and drivable cars you can run over people or into structures.\n\nNow if you all excuse me, i have an appointment with some empty skulls drooling on my doorstep\n\nHave fun children And remember what your dad always told you every night when you were  a kid:  "Always keep you axe sharp and clean my son"","May 13","true","31.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

Despite some of the major, teeth-grinding glitches, it is very fun.  The game description is essentially what it says; it's a zombie apocalypse simulator. If you loot a house, it's gonna stay empty. If you die with loads of loot at your safehouse, it's going to stay there until your new guy can find it again.\nThe game also adds a great challenge to its survival aspect. It's not like traditional zombie games like Dead Rising where you can kill 500 zombies within five minutes. I get nervous when I'm up against more than two. You know how in the movies when a character is bitten, and then they turn? That's exactly what happens in Project Zomboid. One bite is all it takes for you to lose the character you've spent the last couple of hours leveling up.\nDespite the many, many bugs in this game, it's a great idea and it provides endless hours of fun, scavenging and zombie-slaying!\n\n8.5/10","December 13, 2013","true","56.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Despite some of the major, teeth-grinding glitches, it is very fun.  The game description is essentially what it says; it's a zombie apocalypse simulator. If you loot a house, it's gonna stay empty. If you die with loads of loot at your safehouse, it's going to stay there until your new guy can find it again.\nThe game also adds a great challenge to its survival aspect. It's not like traditional zombie games like Dead Rising where you can kill 500 zombies within five minutes. I get nervous when I'm up against more than two. You know how in the movies when a character is bitten, and then they turn? That's exactly what happens in Project Zomboid. One bite is all it takes for you to lose the character you've spent the last couple of hours leveling up.\nDespite the many, many bugs in this game, it's a great idea and it provides endless hours of fun, scavenging and zombie-slaying!\n\n8.5/10","December 13, 2013","true","56.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Accuracy sucks at low levels and takes ages to skill up, shotguns can only take out 3 zombies max and that's only likely when firing into a huge crowd, and each shot fired will bring in zombies crazy quick and from long distances. Any situation where discharging a firearm seems like a good idea is a situation already lost.\n\nCars and NPCs will supposedly be implemented at some point (when they're done!)

The community of the game is great and the developers are very active. I have been following this game for a very long time now. I believe I bought this game in 2011 before it came out via Early Access on Steam. Every Monday the Developers update their blog telling us what's new in their development and sometimes showing us videos of what's new.\n\nAnyways, down to the gameplay. Now obviously, this game is in Early Access. But, some bugs are quite hard to find in the stable branch. So the game is very much playable. When you first start out playing this game you will probably die much faster than veteran players(unless you're me). But, after awhile you will learn how things work and be able to build a safehouse and even have yourself an efficient farm without having much fear of the zeds trying to kill you. There is also multiplayer! Sadly though, the multiplayer is a bit buggy in a few ways(mostly the zeds). But it is very much playable.\n\nProject Zomboid is a very good game even being Early Access.

But hell, I loved the game back then, and I still do, if it comes to any zombie survival games - this is it. None other game recreates such tactical thinking, such fear of dying as this game does, every step you make you think about the consequences, you think about where you should set your base, and what to do to protect it best, but what made this game even better was for me was the addition of MP, I've waited since alpha for the game to have Multiplayer added to the game, and I always felt like it would change the game completely, and hell, it did. Multiplayer, especially with friends, added this serious survival feel I didn't feel ever before in a game, not in DayZ, nor Rust, nor any multiplayer survival game. You care for your friend in-game, you don't want them to get injured, or worse - bitten, but you also don't want them standing, doing nothing. As a good example, I'd like to share this survivor's story:\n\nWe all assigned roles to what we'll do, one would take care of the food, another would secure the area of zombies, every once in a while we'd send out people to look for supplies, it was amazing, however, while we grew bigger, we needed better supplies, as well as some shotguns, so we decided to go to West Point, we left our home behind, hoping that we'd come back to it still being in shape...Well, at least most of it.  On the way there one of our friend's condition was getting worse - if we wouldn't find medication, he probably wouldn't make it. On the way there, we tactically dealt with zombies, or sneaked through them,  when the odds were too high, I'd fire a couple of rounds to distract a crowd of zombies, we'd get supplies at a drive-by diner and kept going, but unless we hurried - our friend wasn't going to make it, and sadly, he didn't, and it meant more than in any game, and that, is what I'd call a true survival experience. You cared that your friend died, with that one less man, not only do your possibilities go down, but so do your chances go down, every bullet you take, took and will take will make an impact, and a brilliant idea done poorly will cause the death of your team, and this is what I love about the game. While playing it, I felt like I was in some weird mix between The Last Of Us, The Walking Dead and something like Fallout, as amazing as it might be...However, I really think that there should be more of a 'leveling' system, since, even though you do have a bunch of skills to level, if you die, you quickly shake it off, I hope that the devs add something that would make you more attached to your character than you are now.\n\nProject Zomboid is packed with features and things to do and a lot of places to go to, there are a ton of items, and a ton of items to craft, but some currently don't have any use, as mentioned, this game is still fairly early in the development, some features that aren't in the game may be fairly important to survival, for example, a generator, that you'll need to get electricity from when the power runs out, luckily water barrels are buildable, so you won't dehydrate when you run out of water. But those are some things to keep in mind.\n\nThe game is very stable right now, there are a few bugs, which is to be expected, considering the game isn't finished, but I'd recommend this game to anyway, since this game is made purely from passion and talent, and it has to be one of my favourite survival singleplayer games, and one of the best (if not the best) of survival multiplayer games, and it ain't even finished yet!","March 4, 2014","true","29.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

My fondest memory was spawning in the house, finding and drinking bleach, walking out of the house and then falling over dead. I didn't play it too much after that.\n\nBUT, they recently unleashed online test to the public, at which point my friend immediately set up a server for us and we were away on our adventure. As I am typing this, we have been playing for a solid 3 hours, many notable moments being burning down several houses, barricaded a warehouse, and having friends go out scavenging for supplies while I cooked at home. This is the game that many zombie survival games tried to be (Such as DayZ, which contrary to popular belief was developed long after this game was started). This game gets all of the feels that a zombie survival game should. Instead of immediately searching for weapons to kill zombies with, you always have thoughts in the back of your head as to: Will we have enough food? Will we have time to cook some good food to keep everyone from getting depressed? Did I turn the stove off?\n\nWhile playing, our favorite thought was having a server that would be able to run 200 players at the same time. Think of the communities that would start with the fact that you can build walls and even houses from scratch, and with the proper tools you can tear down other houses for supplies. Needless to say, I have never been more excited for the future of a single game until now. I feel that anyone who likes tense survival with friends should play this game. This game is, as all 4 of us agreed, is DayZ done right.\n\nTL:DR DayZ but not rushed, with similar ideas of Fallout and The Sims.","February 17, 2014","true","10.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nukejockey/recommended/108600/","nukejockey","NukeJockey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nukejockey/","636 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNOTE: This is a review I wrote for an Australian computer and technology forum, figured I would post it on here as well, as I think extremely highly of this game. This review isn't exactly written in the style of your standard steam reviews, but it outlines some of the gameplay mechanics and other things in that game make it one of the more enjoyable titles around at the moment, due in part to the multiplayer that is now part of the game.\n\n\n\n\nOver the last several years, I've eagerly been watching this game grow and evolve, once in a while I would download the latest build and test it out. Everything was very promising. Here I had a game that offered a True Zombie Apocalypse "Simulator", a game where there is no real goal other than to survive, this was well before games like Day Z started popping up too.\n\nProject Zomboid is much different however, first of all the game uses an isometric viewing angle, secondly it tries to "simulate" everything. From cooking, to building to reading books. There are literally hundreds of different items in the game, majority of them have a use. Canned soup can be consumed, but only if you have a can opener, access to a fire or stove and a pot to cook it in. Books can be read to increase your skills in things like fishing, carpentry or farming. All of this takes "time" to do. Your character can be affected by dozens of different things, go out in the rain, you get wet, stay wet for too long, you can get sick. If you're wet, you can change your clothes or dry off with a towel. If you get sick, you can find painkillers and other meds to help you get over it. Get scared by too many zombies and cant find any survivors and your character can start to become panicky and depressed. This is just scratching the surface of what can be done in the game though.\n\n\nThe world is persistent, this means you can barricade houses, as long as you have a hammer, nails and some planks, you can cover open windows with sheets so the Zs cant see you inside. Weapons can be repaired with things like Duct Tape or glue, weapons can be modified (not sure how many at this stage have mods) ie. getting a baseball bat and hammering some nails to make it a "nailed baseball bat". You can build doors, doorframes, walls, floors, stairs etc. and essentially build your own fortress, or connect several houses together with wooden walls being used as passageways, so you are safe from the Zs when going between houses.\n\nThe Zs themselves are quite cool as well, if you play Sandbox or multiplayer mode, you are able to change several different things about the zombies to make them easier or harder, this allows you to customise the Zs to be similar to the ones from your favourite movies (fast, slow, blind/deaf etc) Zombies also give chase, depending on their memory settings, you can lose them just by getting a certain distance away, or you may have to lead them on a merry chase through houses and the bush to make them lose your scent and successfully escape.\n\nCombat is fairly standard, however it works great is very satisfying if you get your timing right. There are guns in the game, but majority of the time you will opt for melee weapons, guns will attract zombies, to the point where you can inadvertently attract a horde of 30+ zombies. It makes for some great gameplay and very tense moments.\n\nOn top of all of this, the game now has multiplayer, at the moment it is join by IP only, so no proper server browser, but once you make/find a server to play in, you will find that the world is persistent, items don't respawn, neither do zombies, zombies will often wander around and may eventually occupying an area that you have previously cleared, but overall this means you can essentially clear out an area and be safe from Zombie Hordes, as they won't respawn once you kill them.\n\nThis all comes together to create the most enjoyable Co-op experience I have had in as long as I can remember. For $15 on steam, I cannot recommend this game enough. If you still love zombie games, you may find that despite how the game is presented (look at it on the steam store, first reaction is usually that it graphically looks quite dated) it is one of the most feature rich and amazing Zombie Survival games on the market.\n\nThere is far more that I could list about this great game, but I suggest if it sounds interesting enough from my explanation above, take the plunge and see how you like it. There is also a demo available  which is still quite indicative of what you can expect should you decide to purchase the full game.\n\nSeriously guys, get on it.","May 15, 2014","true","22.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

This game is one of my favourite games of all time. But what does PZ bring to the table? PZ brings a fun yet dramatic system into the game where as if you die. You DIE. No second chances. You are dead. This in itself is pretty upsetting when you create a character who has live maybe a year in game (If you can make it that far) and dies like a hero. It has a fairly decent multiplayer which I do not recommend playing until maybe a patch but is up to you. And has a GREAT art style (I'm a sucka for pixles.)\n\nSo should you get PZ? Yes. It is what other zombie games want to be and is ever improving.\n\nThis is a zombie game even for the most hardcore.","August 18, 2014","true","56.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You must grit your teeth and carve out some space for your character to call 'home'.  Barricade the doors, shut the curtains, create a sheet rope to access the second floor window.  Then get building your perimeter wall and planting your crops.  Don't forget rain collectors.  Now you have the basics of survival, you can make forays into the dangers of the city, staying in cleared out houses along the way and making sure to attract as little attention as possible.\n\nThis game has the potential to leave a huge, huge indent on future zombie games, probably the same way DayZ has already done.  When NPCs and multiplayer are added (especially LAN which would be incredible), this could become the FTL of the zombie genre.\n\nConsidering I have got 30 hours of fun from this game, I would say that it's definitely worth £5.  In terms of £10, it's your choice: either wait until the game is a little more advanced and REALLY get your value, or jump in and support the developers early on and enjoy running around a town full of 4500 zombies with no NPCs.\n\nRight now I would rate this game a compelling 7/10 but it has the potential to hit 9 or 10/10.\n\nFor reference here is how I rate other non-arcade zombie games:\n\nResident Evil 4: 9/10\nTellTale Games The Walking Dead: 8.5/10\nLeft 4 Dead: 8.5/10\nResident Evil 2 or 1: 8.5/10\nLeft 4 Dead 2: 7.5/10\nDead Island: 7/10\nDead Rising: 7/10\nThe Last of Us: 7/10\nDayZ (currently): 6/10 (with the potential to be much higher)\nDead Rising 2: 5/10\n\nAs you can see I have left a space at the top for 9.5 and 10/10.  Reason being there has never actually been a zombie game that lives up to the tension, excitement and cloying exigency for survival that permeates the finest zombie movies.\n\nProject Zomboid does have a chance to reach that level or somewhere near it.  The fact that the merest scratch can but not necessarily will turn you eventually into a zombie is a welcome change to the superhero melee murder spree that many other zombie games offer.  The fact that you can die of hunger, thirst, regular disease and being soaked to the bone by freezing rain adds tension.  Your crops can die of diseases, a horde of zombies can shamble up to your safehouse and lay siege to it.  Firing your gun attracts three times as many zombies as you originally intended to engage.\n\nSo there you have my take on this charming, albeit incomplete, little game.","January 4, 2014","true","31.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Once you learn how to survive you will feel pretty devastated when you inevitably die due to the amount of time and care that is invested in your character.\n\nNPCs are planned to be released in the future and that will really bring the game together.\n\nThe Dev Team is the best I've had experience with. They are very active on their forums at theindiestone.com and interact with the members there. More importantly they listen to what the community has to say and make adjustments to the game based off that.","May 13, 2015","true","324.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

One encouter with a zombie could mean the end of years of hardwork and gameplay. Even though it has a static map, every game seems diffrent. are you gonna spawn in a house with a good weapon?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weilard/recommended/108600/","weilard","Weilard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weilard/","1061 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nИгру заприметил еще на старте разработки. Подкупающей была тематика (ещё не заезженная на тот момент), пиксель-арт и, конечно же – изометрия. На данный момент это стильный и действительно интересный симулятор выживания на фоне зомби-апокалипсиса. И вовсе не только лишь потому, что изометрия и пиксельная графика. Игра обладает определенным шармом и без этого. Хотя бы на уровне своих возможностей. Будучи небольшой по размерам и миниатюрной в исполнении, игра оставляет за собой многие новинки из Early Access (далее по тексту EA).\n\nВ большинстве игр подобной тематики вы оказываетесь в декорациях, которые служат подстилкой для массированного PVP, где, в общем и целом, кроме него заниматься нечем. Мало кто прорабатывает «изнанку мира» (англ. background). В PZ подноготная рядом. Есть два небольших городка где-то в американской глубинке, фермы, поселки и леса. Существует даже карта на манер Google-карт созданная каким-то умельцем. Она позволят оценить размах умирающего мира. Здесь умирает всё, в том числе и вы. Это история где рано или поздно будет поставлена трагическая точка.\n\nЗа регулярными вылазками в город в поисках медикаментов, продуктов и необходимых для выживания вещей (да-да, даже медицинскому пинцету найдется здесь дело) вы краем глаза замечаете, что и город меняется. Происходит отключение от глобальной системы энергоснабжения, постепенно прекращает свою работу трубопровод, подававший в населенные пункты воду. Еда в холодильниках портиться, и вы уже вряд ли сможете порадоваться хорошо прожаренной отбивной. Города подвергаются армейской зачистке, не сулящей вам ничего хорошего, да и ходячих с каждым днем становится всё больше.\n\nЕсли совместить естественное умирание города с набегами других выживших, то картинка порой становится и вовсе унылой. Вместо богатства, ожидающего мародера посетившего брошенное место, вам часто приходиться довольствоваться каким-то мелочами. Нож для масла в качестве оружия, женская блузка вместо свитера, мусорный пакет или школьный ранец вместо хорошей сумки. собранный вручную топор, что развалится после нескольких ударов. Аутентичность на этом не заканчивается - забудете выключить газ на кухне (пока он еще остался в баллонах) и ваш дом превратиться в пепелище.\n\nС тех пор как появился мультиплеер игра ещё больше расцвела. Помимо PVP серверов существуют PVE сервера и даже «ролевые». Попав туда, вы придерживаетесь канвы повествования. Вы больше не Ваня или Джон зашедшие покрошить других игроков. Теперь вы вполне реальный персонаж, переговаривающийся с другими выжившими по радио, помогающий другим выжить. Отыгрыш сбивает людей в группы, чтобы противостоять ходячим вместе. Богатство игровых ситуаций описать трудно. Ровно как и богатство способов умереть.\n\nРазбил окно, полез в закрытый дом, разодрался в кровь влезая в него, впоследствии умер от заражения. Отравился плохой едой, отлеживался в каком-то доме, оказался в осаде - умер, будучи съеденным, заживо. Попал в засаду, был ранен, убежал, нашел какой-то дом полный алкоголя. Долго пил и радовался жизни. Выздоровел. Вышел наружу и столкнулся с ордой. Долго удирал от нее, забаррикадировался в каком-то отеле, затем спрыгнул с крыши второго этажа, сломал бедро, отполз в местный туалет и там умер. Всё это проза PZ дня. А ведь есть романы, поэзия. Всё это у вас будет, и каждый ваш опыт от игровой сессии будет разным.\n\nХотите быть фермером и уйти от этого кошмара – это возможно. Хотите быть скавенджером и войти в историю маленького мира как лучший сборщик всякой всячины – не воспрещается. Хотите стать торгашом, по прозвищу Консерва-Боб, собрав всевозможные консервы и затем устроить магазин – да пожалуйста.  Хотите прослыть самым жестоким «убийцей на западе» доступно и это. Вы можете быть кем угодно, и прожить свой конец как угодно. Какой путь вы бы не выбрали - он будет оригинальным. Вас может погубить что угодно. К примеру, осколки стекла, застрявшие в руке, когда вы разбили стекло очередного дома. Спасти вас, впрочем, тоже может что угодно. Меня спасли грибы и дождевые черви. Серьезно. Их тоже можно есть. Правда от такой пищи наступает депрессия.\n\nОпределенно – маленькая жемчужина, которая со временем станет настоящим жемчужным ожерельем или колье. Не поддержать такую игру будет неверным решением. Сейчас она, до сих пор в EA, до сих пор развивается, до сих пор дарит каждой своей сессией что-то новое.","January 24, 2015","true","107.8"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","24","41","0","4"

They exist, and it is possible to host a server, but awkward for a computer novice.  BUT, a very fun adventure that captures the essence of isolation, desperation, and determination inherent in a survival experience.  The fact that there are zombies just gives a backdrop.  A lot of little details that leave you with a robust and lovingly-crafted world to explore.  This game has medications such as beta-blockers, sleeping aids, painkillers, and even vitamins.  Name another game with that.\n\nAlso, there seems to be a lot of active development and mod content from the community.  I'm not certain how much longer the challenge of existing will keep me occupied in a single player experience, but I can certainly envision this game's development will bring me back periodically to enjoy the new content.\n\nWould buy again.","February 16, 2015","true","134.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The attention to detail around the perk system, base-building, sound travelling, etc. is a sign this developer knows what they're doing and it's a really nice example of a zombie-survival game taking a slightly different tack from the rest of the pack.","June 3, 2014","true","13.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmartandDumbBrandon/recommended/108600/","SmartandDumbBrandon","Brandon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmartandDumbBrandon/","64 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nProject Zomboid is one of the most unique zombie games ever made. It asks the question "In the zombie apocalypse, How will you survive, and what will be the cause of your demise?" This is a game that, if all its planned features are added, will rival other zombie survival horror games such as DayZ or 7 Days to Die. In the event you do not know the full extent of what they are looking to add, this includes an in depth survivor system that will allow you to join or start your own enclave of survivors, then supply them with the means to protect your new home. They also plan to add hostile NPC's because everyone knows in the event of the zombie apocalypse, their is nothing to stop a group of people from coming to your home and robbing everything you used to own, then shooting you and putting an end to your shortlived life in the Project Zomboid world. Did I mention that one day these muggers may not be NPC's, but entire bands of other players? No? Thats one of this games planned features as well.\n\nWith all this being said, and there are still hundreds of more things to come, Project Zomboid is a game worth getting now, and a game worth the wait for later. I will recollect some of my expereinces to all who read this so you may furthur understand how this game is the zombie game we have all been waiting for.\n\nThis story begins as it is my first time playing, my charactar is wearing a sweater and a little moodlet pops up on the side showing that it makes him a little warm, and so I swap the sweater with a vest and start to loot the rest of the house I had spawned in. After a long day of looting my charactar becomes hungry, thirsty and tired. After taking care of his Food and Water needs, I put him to bed. However in the middle of the night, two gunshots ring off close to the house, and while there are no NPC's yet, it still put me under the impression that someone was outside my house. The gunshots almost immediatly woke me up, and after waking up I heard a very distinct set of moans, and it is obvious to anyone that the gunshot drew a couple of the undead. However I did not grasp the danger of this situation until I stepped outside to a full on Horde. Only one of them noticed me as I bolted back inside and I hatched a plan. I would draw the horde in, then attempt to burn down the house. After coming up with this Idea I kept in mind this house had 6 exits, 4 including the windows around the house, and the 2 doors on opposite ends. I shoved a bunch of food and maybe some things not meant for the oven- into the oven, and turned it on. Over time electricity and plumbing turn off in this game but for now I was fortunate that it had not. After this I drew a large chunk of the horde into my home once the kitchen set ablaze. I didn't stop to see if it worked, I just simply ran on and on, putting as much distance between me and that horde as possible.\n\nI beleive that story to be best to show off how diverse the system of Project Zomboid is, with the appropriatly named "Sinister Ai" the game will generate random events such as house alarms for when you break into the window in an attempt to loot the place, or as you saw, random enviromental sounds such as jets, helicopters, gunshots and alarms that will draw or lead away hordes. Overall the pros of this game leave your screen and roll outside your house, yet the cons do as well. While this game is a great colaboration of everything any zombie fan has ever wanted in a zombie game, it still doesnt have ALL the features and it still is in Early Access, which means there will be a LOT of bugs, but if you can get past this you will get a game that will truly give you a fresh expereince every time.","February 8, 2014","true","79.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

They spent two years working on a whole new game engine and map tools, which perhaps was of long term benefit, but what have they done in the other 5 years? Added some crafting and farming (fair enough, good), multiplayer (could have waited in favour of other stuff), redid interfaces, stats and other minor stuff.\n\nIf you buy the game, you will get some enjoyment out of it for a while. You'll enjoy exploring the town, breaking in to various buildings and searching for useful stuff to help you survive, dodging or fighting off zombies along the way. You'll enjoy trying to build your zombie proof home.\n\nAnd then you'll get bored of it. The developers might keep you interested in how the development is going with their weekly essays on how awesome the game is going to be once they add the extra features that they've been working on for the last X years, but even that will wear thin sooner or later.\n\nIf you're bored and want a distraction for a little while, then perhaps buy this and play it until you get bored again. But don't buy it based on promised content or improvements 'cos it'll be years away, if it arrives at all.\n\nEdit: For those questioning my time frame. I moved house about 5 years ago, and I played Zomboid at least a year or two before that, back when it was using Java (before the change of game code/engine, as stated above). Long before Steam EA (as stated above), so don't bother quoting that at me.\n\nPlenty of other games just as complex have been fully developed on EA and released in that time, so the argument "development takes time", yes it does. But for someone who has been following this game on and off for so long, this is just getting silly.\n\nGive it a couple more years, we'll see if you're still as zealous then.","December 23, 2015","false","2.6"," 76 of 141 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","76","141","5","13"

In my humble opinion, one of the best survival games to date especially considering that there are a lot of zombie/survival games. I haven’t reviewed an early access title before, but, I wanted to do my part, however small, to help out The Indie Stone and make people aware of this amazing game, this studio has done amazing work despite all their troubles and I think that that’s really admirable, I won’t go into detail but, if you’re curious I would suggest researching on the net to find out more.  *PC*This game is only on PC. The options for the game are befitting of a PC, the game itself isn’t a major powerhouse so much older systems should have no problem running the game, and currently you can play with a controller (with split-screen co-op!) A very good PC game.  *PLOT*There is no story to speak of at the time of this review, there are however, plans to bring a story mode to the finished game, sandbox is all you’ll find. You do however have a lot of options for your sandbox game, going so far as to decided how long the apocalypse has been going on for (with gameplay changes, more on that later),the game simply starts by putting you inside a house with the crazy world outside.  *STYLE*This game is isometric (top-down view) with art style that reminds me of Commands 2 Men of Courage, it’s got great detail and a very fitting look, I like this type of realistic style because, the proportions of the character to the world makes sense and, the world itself is very realistic with buildings and houses that look more modern. I do wish there were more style differences with clothes, weapons and zombies (especially as time goes on) but, what’s here is still pretty good (plus the game is mod-able) and there is always more being added. The music in this game can be very moody and fitting, this is my own personal taste but, I personally dislike the music with the parts of the middle eastern music (seems like a lot of zombie games have it strangely enough), it’s not that I dislike the genre in general, but, the game has this music that makes it feel very somber, sometimes peaceful, sometimes depressing, and it really gets me into the game, however, when that music starts in (and the women makes the ‘chanting’ noise) I get completely ripped out of it, it’s very jarring in my opinion, I think the game would be better with a focus on atmospheric music similar to that of Fallout or Wasteland 2 even, again it’s a personal preference of mine but, the style and feel of this game just doesn’t seem fitting with that type of music. Still a great style overall, I really enjoy isometric games as I feel you can get a lot more out of it visually and that especially works well with Project Zomboid.  *GAMEPLAY* Project Zomboid is perhaps one of the most realisticgames I have ever played and I don’t use that term often in association with video games. The game rewards you for very logical thinking, more so than in most video games (not to say video games need logic to be fun, but, referring to Payday 2, logically you shouldn’t be able to answer pagers period, much less four) as such this game is all about survival. Besides taking care of the basics, you’ll need to keep your character healthy and sane, really the only thing missing is your characters don’t have to shower, or, go to the bathroom, everything else is pretty much there, the first aid system is pretty involved too, I climbed through a broken window, had to take out glass shards with tweezers, disinfect the cuts, and when the bandages got too bloody, had to replace them and clean the old ones. The other part of what adds to the realism is the length of time, you have great control over your settings of the world and can make it match up with the real world if you so wish, either way, in-game healing isn’t instant, if you break a bone you’re looking at a few weeks in-game before its healed, suffering from the negative affect all the while. Farming also takes months to yield any results, and that’s assuming your planets don’t get trampled by zombies or die of disease and you’re watering them regularly. As time progresses eventually, the running water and power that are available in the houses (or not depending on your options) will turn off, you’ll need to plan ahead for these and if you don’t it’ll be a slow painful death.  *COMBAT*Combat is pretty simple, you have your choice of melee weapons, guns and throwing weapons (like the classic Molotov-cocktail), you ready your weapon, point in a direction and swing/shoot. The longer you ready your weapon, the better the accuracy, and when zombies get close you can shove them away (some may even fall over) and either make a run for it or bash their brains in. Goes without saying that loud noises attracts more zombies and, fire spreads so be careful. You can also sneak past zombies. Combat does take its toll on your character, it’s enjoyable if simple, hopefully more weapons and toys are added to make going out with a bang more of a literal option.  *VERDICT*If you enjoy survival games or zombie games, you’ll love this game, this is the most realistic game I’ve played. Honestly, even if you don’t this is the type of game that is so good it might get you into a genre you’ve never tried before. Its co-op and local split screen, so if you’ve got a passive interest I highly encourage you to check it out, maybe get a friend to play with you, it can and is a lot of fun. And it’s priced at $14.99 USD and I see it on sale often, it’s well worth the asking price. Thank you The Indie Stone for an amazing game!  TL/DRA zombie survival game from The Indie Stone, they’ve hit some rough patches, but, have still created one of the best survival games to date which is still only in early access. There is a ton of stuff planned for the future, but, what is here is a great game, it’s rewarding in all the right ways, makes you feel awesome for being smart and playing like a real survivalist. Its co-op and local split-screen, and the regular price is $14.99 USD which is a steal for this amazing game. If you’ve ever had any interest I highly encourage you to take a hard look and really consider grabbing this game, it simply deserves to be played and I get excited for the day it finally sees a full release.  Thanks for the amazing experience  The Indie Stone!\n\n–Two Thumbs Up from Royial\nVideo Reviews @: The-RoyialNetwork","November 4, 2015","true","68.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I have stayed up until 6am playing this.\n\nIf you like isometric, survival/crafting, zombie, adventure, rpg games, then you will absolutely love Project Zomboid!\n\nFor an isometric game, the aesthetics are fantastic! The detail put into the environment is great, and the building/wall camera vision style will switch automatically, allowing you to always see your character (think Sims style) - unless, of course, you are being swarmed by zombies. There is also a great field of vision mechanic where you can only see in a cone radius in front of your character - so you can turn around to see a zombie standing right next to you (this game has prompted many screams from me lol). The music is perfect for the inensity of the game, of every single moment where it can be your last.\n\nThe controls can take a little bit of getting used to, especially considering that you have multiple menus to deal with (ex: inventory, character stats). You have the option of keeping the menus locked open, making looting much faster if you can handle the space each menu takes up on the screen.\n\nThere is a lot you can do in PZ, and it is highly recommended that you keep the unofficial map handy for quick reference. The game allows you to choose your profession, which will grant skills like higher resistance to zombie bites and scratches. You can also balance perks and negative skills, making the game more interesting. The custom mode provides a way to test out the game, allowing you to select the frequency of encountering zombies, their overall stats, how long until the electricity and water supply run out (yes, this is a critical element of the game), etc. If you want to get a good feel of the game, I recommend you start of here, just so you can better understand what you need to do without the pressure of dying at a moment's notice.\n\nThe learning curve and difficulty of this game is moderate, however, I would consider survival mode (how the game is meant to be played) to be fairly hard.\n\nYou will start off at in a random house, with only the clothes on your back. From here, you can loot supplies, hopefully finding some sort of bag item - which you can wear on your back, increasing your carrying capacity. Securing food and water is essential. Any container objects like bowls or bottles can be used to hold water from the sink, and this is critical to remember because the water supply will eventually run out. Perishable food will rot when not refrigerated.\n\nYou increase in proficiencies as you do certain things - for example, whever you sneak around zombies you will gain points in nimblness, sneaking, etc. When you attain enough xp points, you will be able to "master" the first level of a "completed" skill. So, if I have cooked enough meals to fill my first block on the skill menu (level 1), and have a level up point, I can select the skill, mastering it and improving the quality of things that I cook. You will not be able to fill higher level skill blocks until you first master the lowest tier - this prevents you from just cooking for the entire game since you have to be mastering each level as you progress. Reading specialty books also provides a bonus multiplier to the respective skill, and there are different books for both skills, and their respective levels (ex: carpentry for begineers vs. advanced carpentry).\n\nWhile you play, you will have to balance your needs, eating, sleeping, and staying hydrated. You can also get bored if you are inactive, and becoming unhappy is also a possibility (leads to depression). There are items you can take to help with these needs (like beta pills, antidepressants, reading newspapers, etc), and you can also take sleeping pills to allow you to go to bed (you cannot keep sleeping unless your character is actually tired) - this is very useful for trying to settle sleeping patterns into a rhythm where you are sleeping during night time and awake in time to maximize the daylight visibility.\n\nThe crafting is not too complex, you will need to find an axe and chop down trees for logs, then convert them into wood. Crafting a rain collector is a priority - with successfully finding an area to plant/farm as a close second.\n\nI have played this game a lot, and there was one time when I had spent 3 hours securing a base and building nice walls around it. I even had set up a farm and rain barrel, with pretty decent skills leveled up already. While looting a nearby house, I opened a window, but the alarm went off. Being overconfident in my abilities, I went in anyway, thinking I would be able to loot and leave before the house was stormed by zombies. While looting the upstairs rooms, I heard the door break open. I quickly run down and spot zombies rushing in through the front door. I try the back door, but zombies are piling in from a broken window next to the fridge. Panicking, I run upstairs, loot a shirt, tear it into sheet rope, and fashion a climbable rope on the second-level window. I slide down, but zombies are surrounding the house, and I have no way out. I hop over a broken window on the first floor and attempt to juke through the zombie horde. I take a scratch, and immediately see that I am about to die. I try to drop my bag, but it is too late. I have joined the dead.\n\nI stare at the screen for a good 2 minutes, sigh sadly, then load up a new game.\n\nI love this game.\n\nIf you load a save where you have died, everything you have done will remain intact, so securing and transforming a safehouse will not be wasted. You can even find your corpse walking around if you are lucky.\n\nThe mod support is not as extensive as say, Space Engineers or Starbound, however, there is a lot of potential for great user-made content. The developers, unlock Starbound, are also very active, releasing builds at good intervals. Be warned, however, not to invest to much in your saves, as you may not be able to transfer over your saves to newer builds when they are released.\n\nIf you are interested at all, give this game a try. For an early-access game, it is quite impressive and very well-done.\n\nHighly recommend!","July 13, 2014","true","48.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I have stayed up until 6am playing this.\n\nIf you like isometric, survival/crafting, zombie, adventure, rpg games, then you will absolutely love Project Zomboid!\n\nFor an isometric game, the aesthetics are fantastic! The detail put into the environment is great, and the building/wall camera vision style will switch automatically, allowing you to always see your character (think Sims style) - unless, of course, you are being swarmed by zombies. There is also a great field of vision mechanic where you can only see in a cone radius in front of your character - so you can turn around to see a zombie standing right next to you (this game has prompted many screams from me lol). The music is perfect for the inensity of the game, of every single moment where it can be your last.\n\nThe controls can take a little bit of getting used to, especially considering that you have multiple menus to deal with (ex: inventory, character stats). You have the option of keeping the menus locked open, making looting much faster if you can handle the space each menu takes up on the screen.\n\nThere is a lot you can do in PZ, and it is highly recommended that you keep the unofficial map handy for quick reference. The game allows you to choose your profession, which will grant skills like higher resistance to zombie bites and scratches. You can also balance perks and negative skills, making the game more interesting. The custom mode provides a way to test out the game, allowing you to select the frequency of encountering zombies, their overall stats, how long until the electricity and water supply run out (yes, this is a critical element of the game), etc. If you want to get a good feel of the game, I recommend you start of here, just so you can better understand what you need to do without the pressure of dying at a moment's notice.\n\nThe learning curve and difficulty of this game is moderate, however, I would consider survival mode (how the game is meant to be played) to be fairly hard.\n\nYou will start off at in a random house, with only the clothes on your back. From here, you can loot supplies, hopefully finding some sort of bag item - which you can wear on your back, increasing your carrying capacity. Securing food and water is essential. Any container objects like bowls or bottles can be used to hold water from the sink, and this is critical to remember because the water supply will eventually run out. Perishable food will rot when not refrigerated.\n\nYou increase in proficiencies as you do certain things - for example, whever you sneak around zombies you will gain points in nimblness, sneaking, etc. When you attain enough xp points, you will be able to "master" the first level of a "completed" skill.

(Futurama referace right there !) I had this game for months on the Desrua Client and the moment I saw they ported it to Steam I had to get my copy. For only 15.00 dollars you get in my opinion one of the best zombie survial simulations you could ask for. The game only leaves you off with one statement, " This is how you die"\nYou see this is your story of survial. There are no arrows pointing you anywhere, or time limit, or kill objective to accomplish, it is simply you in the mist of a zombie apocalypse trying to gather supplies and build up a base.

I feel the "endgame" a bit lacking. It's very rougelike in that you can be smothered early on.  I haven't played long enough in the new build to learn how to survive because I don't know that I want to play a single game of PZ that last that long because a single game does get boring and I'm not sure farming is going to fix it.","November 25, 2013","true","3.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tosayu/recommended/108600/","tosayu","Tosayu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tosayu/","264 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n"These are the end-times\nThere was no hope of survival\nThis is how you died"\n\nEvery time I start up the game and see those words I get chills.  Project Zomboid is an isometric view survival zombie game. It involves managing hunger/thirst, mood, physical well being, zombies, and figuring out how to live once the power and water shuts off.  You can tell by my hours spent in game I LOVE it!\n\nPros\n\nA very unique game.  I have never played anything like it. Every time I play this game I want to watch The Walking Dead. Every time I watch The Walking Dead I want to play this game.  It is a custom built game engine that is THE zombie survival game I always wanted.\n\nUpdates are meaningful and consistent.  Every time an update comes out I know I am in for a treat.  You can test the update before it is part of the official steam release, but I only did that once. When they release it the update is very stable with only very minor bugs.\n\nThere is a sense of desperation. As you character gets panicked and tired and you are far from your safe house the tension goes up.  When you finally use that gun you know you will be overwhelmed by a horde because of the noise.  Scavenging has never been so fun.\n\nMultiplayer adds a great way to play with friends or join a server for  more competitive play.\n\nModding is supported. Players are starting to make really cool custom maps and interesting mods.\n\nIt is just fun.\n\nCons\n\nOnce you clear out an area, establish you house, create a few rain barrels, and start farming, the game looses lots of tension. Zombies don't spawn after you kill so many. The engine redistributes zombies by in game events that are limited to gun fire and helicopter noises, but in practice they don't bring that many after you truly cleared your area and the surrounding area.  In one game I no longer feel I am in threat of dying.\n\nThe early history of the game has a pretty bad black eye involving loosing all their work because they didn't back it up and their laptops were stolen.  TotalBiscuit still referenced it recently when he talked about it in his breakdown of the daily summer sales.\n\nFinale Thoughts\n\nBuild 27 (the current stable build as I write this) advances the game to the point I can finally wholeheartedly recommend it.  Even if they never do another update, the game is fun enough and unique enough to establish itself as a worthy game at full price.\n\nThere is a challenge mode, multiplayer, and mods. Even if you get to the point of feeling safe (like I do now), I can always start new or jump on my online server with friends, join a public server, or try the challenge mode.   I am going to see how long my current guy can last. So far 700+ zombies killed and over 2 months alive! woot!!\n\nBUT...it is not going to stop updating anytime soon. The most anticipated update is NPCs. They used to be in the game, but they rebuilt under the hood stuff so they can introduce them with a sadistic AI. It will open up a higher degree of tension and give modders great tools to work with.\n\nThe UI is slated to be updated, crafting and skills keep getting tweaked (as they should be), and minor bugs are getting ironed out. The map is expanding, items and recipes are increasing, and new features are still being implemented.\n\nI believe they are even working on a system to better redistribute zombies or keep them spawning. I hope so anyway.  I thought I read that they intend to add more zombie spawning options-multiplayer servers particularly need that option as they cuurently depend on the admin manually spawning zombies.\n\nAs of now admins can also do a soft reset that respawns zombies and loot, turns back on power and water while restarting the clock to their shutdown, but the soft reset keeps player crafted buildings intact.\n\nIt will be better if automated zombie spawning is implemented or zombie spawning scripts can be utilized.\n\nThe company has more then atoned for their early days and are a shining example of being persistent and overcoming very real mistakes and making a better product for it.  Don't be fooled by old reviews or info.\n\nThis is the golden age to get the game. Full price is still cheap. The current full price is worth it. The Indie Stone has enough of a track record and community involvement to feel confident this great game will only get better. Don't pass this one up!\n\nNPCs, vehicles, and hunting are just around the corner, as well as the official release.\n\nThe music and sound effects are very immersive.","June 23, 2014","true","179.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amazingsully/recommended/108600/","amazingsully","AmazingSully","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amazingsully/","121 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst off I want to say that I don't really play the single player of this game, so the review is based entirely on multiplay.\n\nI personally love playing this game with friends... it's the only multiplayer zombie survival game I've come across that I've enjoyed.  It's incredibly simple, yet incredibly complicated at the same time.  Don't expect to just jump in the game and do well... the wiki is an incredibly valued resource that you will need to read over at least once.  I'll also mention that this is an early access game, but doesn't play like one.  Far too often we see games launch as early access which are barely playable... project zomboid however is wonderful.  Take note devs... this is how you early access.\n\nWhat really caused me to love this game was that they actually managed to get zombies right.  Far too often do zombie games have overpowered, super monsters.  Zombies are slow, stupid, and easy to kill... their danger comes in their numbers... this is something almost every piece in zombie related media screws up.  Project zomboid nails it though.  Suburbs have fewer zombies than cities, and a city has the number you would expect (note: it's a lot).\n\nThe game very accurately lets you feel what it would be like to be an ordinary person thrust deep into a zombie apocalypse... think you'd be able to survive? Think again.  I strongly recommend this game to people (at least if you have friends to play with... I've heard a lot of complaints about single player not being nearly as entertaining).  The greatest thing the creators of this game did was give you the option to modify the world.  You can alter how long it takes for the electricity and water to turn off, how sparse loot is, how many zombies there are, experience multipliers, whether or not loot respawns, how quick zombies are... all of it.  You can really try out all sorts of scenarios.  And how easily the game is modded... this allows a lot of user generated content to enhance the experience.\n\nCons of the game:\n\n- Combat takes a little bit to get used to and can be frustrating to newcomers.  It's a shame, but practice and I guarantee you'll get over it.\n- The zombie virus infection rate can't be altered.  Currently it's 96% infection rate on a bite, and 25% on a scratch.  I'd love to see these numbers be customizable to the server (personally I'd love 100% bite and 0% scratch)... but I think them adding this feature would improve the game drastically\n- There is no in game map.  You would think if you lived in a city you would know your way around it... unfortunately you have to figure this out for yourself.  There is a map online, but I think either having a map option or adding a map as a rare loot would be a wonderful addition.\n- Multiplay can be tough to set up at first... especially if you need to port forward.  I would love to see them implement some form of steam assisted multiplayer setup including "Invite to Game" option.\n- [EDIT: THIS HAS BEEN FIXED] Having items with durability or that are equipped that stack in your inventory can cause issues.  When you want to drop one but can't specify which one you can spend a bit of time fumbling.  Nothing is worse when you're running from zombies, but carrying too much weight so you decide you want to drop your second baseball bat, only to find that you dropped the one you had equipped and now you have no weapon equipped to defend yourself.  And I can't tell you how many times I've chosen to rip a spare shirt into bandages only for my character to disrobe and rip the one he's wearing instead.\n\nThe cons seem many and the pros seem few, but I assure you they aren't... that's just my inability to articulate properly.  The game is really enjoyable and I recommend it to everyone.  The pricetag is a little high in my opinion, but still a wonderful game to pick up.","April 18, 2015","true","76.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

As you go on it gets progressivly harder and adds different challenges. At the beginning you have to find food, shelter, weapons, and avoid zombies. Eventually you'll have to worry about defending a fortress, growing your own food because you've looted all of it (unless you have loot respawn on) and getting the most use out of your tools, which will eventually break. Another great thing is that there is a lot of customization in the sandbox mode; you can have a lot of zombies or even no zombies, you can change how long into the apocolypes you are (o-12 months in), you can change how fast nature takes over, how fast crops grow, the spawn rate of zombies and loot, the rarity of loot, and even the lore of the zombies; are they fast or slow? how well can they navigate? (can they use doors or not?) how long does it take to get infected? how easy is it to get infected? how good is their memory? how good is their hearing, sight, and smell? the list goes on. It's also quite easy to set up a server, even if you don't want to take the time to port forward (meaning you use a program such as Hamachi). All the files that are need to run the server are already in the directory. Servers are also expected to be brought over to Steam in the near future.\n\nIf you're the kind of person that doesn't trust Early Access games, don't worry about this. This game is, in my opinion, good enought to be a full game. It's also not that expensive; $17 CAN full price. I'd pay up to $30 or more for this. Also the game is still in development so their adding more stuff and at a fast rate too. At the time of writing this review, they are working on adding syncronized TVs that update you on the situation of the world and a massive new city.

We've got ourselves some sheets, a baseball bat, a handgun with 10 rounds and some food.  "Well we don't want the zombies to see us.  Let's throw some sheets over the windows for some makeshift curtains."  I'm loading my gun while he starts cooking us some food.  Hold up.  We've got some zombies banging on our back door.  Grab the bat.  We pound him into the dirt to let off some steam.  Wait.  What's that.  THE STOVE IS ON FIRE.  THE FARM.  NOOOO!  We had to abandon the farm as it burned to the ground.

They care about their game, AND their community. They listen to what you have to say, and take it into great consideration. THAT BEING SAID; their update progress is slow. When they do update the game however, hardly anything is broken.\n\nThe game as it stands, is very very enjoyable; with a great community. Gameplay can change at a moments notice, as you are sorting through your bag, a zombie could take a bite out of your neck, yikes! Project Zomboid makes you feel afraid. It doesn't hold your hand, it tells you "This is how you die.". And they're not wrong. You will die. Exploring buildings and looting can be great fun, as you get into tight situations with the undead. When you do manage to scratch out an existance in the game, it's a great feeling. Until the undead come crashing through your door...\n\nI'd rate this game right now at a 7.5/10\nOnly because it's still in beta, or alpha or whatever. Updates are slow, but good when they release.\n\n","September 30, 2015","true","12.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

When I was a kid I literally dreamed about having a game like this and now I do. Yes, there have been some set backs in it's progress along the way but even in Early Access this game is AMAZING and the developers are still adding features. HUGE map, great crafting system, hundreds of buildings to fortify and make your own as well as plenty Zed to kill and burn. This game isn't just hands down my favorite indie game, it's one of my favorite games of all time. I recommend this game to anyone who loves base-building, city-looting, zombie-killing fun. 11/10 Would accidently burn down the school again","October 1, 2015","true","113.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

While the statement is untrue, the premise behind it is. Right now, at the current momment, the game has more than enough content to fullfill your needs. That's right, the developers could literally  say the game was done and I would still buy it at the final price. The game has a hardcore survival mode, sandbox mode, and a last stand mode I am yet to try. More are on the way.\n\nWhile the game does not have a lot of weapons (at least, not a lot of firearms) in the current state, every weapon type has it's standard use that would lead the player to not need much variation anyways. That doesn't mean more variation isn't coming though, because it is.\n\nIf you liked Minecraft, State of Decay, or any other freedom-weighted survival game, PZ is a must have for your library.\n\nDespite the surprisingly great polish, it is apparently nowhere near finished. The devs are hard workers that know what's going on and update with new, big things over time. A lot of the reason behind the slow progress is that they have a good habit of 'streamlining' their new additions before they put them out, instead of just putting out the base feature only to slowly update it and fix major bugs that could have been caught early on, unlike some other games (I'm looking at you, Dead Linger). That habit also supports the thought that the game could be a finished product in it's current state, as basically everything the game has set in currently all functions.\n\nAnd the multiplayer in the game is spectacular. Situations like those portrayed on TV and in stories just naturally happen in the game. You can set up a functioning, self-supporting community with a large group of people and deal with players, zombies, injuries, social issues and the other obvious things just as you would in something like the Walking Dead, not requiring roleplay or structured events for it to work. And the fact that you can do anything you want to set up your home ranging from camping under the stars to living on a rooftop is an obvious plus for this as well.","February 11, 2014","true","473.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

My biggest issue with this game is how slow it takes you to get from point A to point B. I mean god if you want to go to that mall or other town you'll actually have to spend a good hour or two maybe more irl just to get there. This game is in dire need of transportation, like cars or bikes. Seriously, I think this is the only zombie game I played that has zero broken down cars or working cars in it.

You must fight to survive and delay your impending doom but what sets this game apart from every other zombie game is the realistic sandbox survival tone the game gives. Although it can be frustrating in the beginning due to the steep learning curves and it's hardcore permadeath YOLO style, you will have a ton of fun surviving until your demise and can't help but start the process all over again.","January 9, 2014","true","134.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Many parts of the game (survivors, fire, parts of the map) are a part of that unfinished product.\n3. The game is playable, but overall, does not offer much in the way of varied play style and things to do within the PZ world.\n4.

This game has so many features in its early version. There are hundreds of different items and foods. Tools, weapons, and materials can be used to create entire buildings up to several stories tall. There is a simple crafting system allowing you to use improvised weapons and tools as well. Carpentry, farming and cooking all of in-depth systems and recipes to get what you want and need to survive more successfully than your predecessors. You can get trapped on the second story of a building and be trapped by a ravenous horde controlling the first floor. You can choose to risk your health and life to jump out the window and make your dashing escape with or without injury...or you can rip off the curtains and tie them into a rope stable enough to lower yourself down and out of the infested building. Scavenging a local house you can open a closet to find a zombie who then rushes you and sinks his teeth into your neck. Even if you destroy him and survive you only have mere hours, possibly days before you turn. All this and more is in this game currently but don't be fooled. This is NOT a complete and perfect game. Several in-game items have no purpose even when they look useful and several items and weapons have placeholder icons or textures. Planned and promised features are aplenty such as vehicles and NPCs. This is a small developement team and will take its time making this game even greater than it already is turning out to be, be patient and you'll get a survival experience like no other.","November 25, 2013","true","38.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Sometimes we purchase games that are fun, but after hours of playing you loose your feel for the game. We sometimes purchase games that are hard to run without a beefy computer. Those are some of the most painful ways a passionate gamer experiences more than just once. If you do read the reviews and do your research on that game then you might feel comfident that the game is worth the purchase and you hope it won't get dry after the first week of owning the game. If you're reading this review, congratulations!\n\nPROJECT ZOMBOID\n\nThis game is very unique from the millions of apocalyptic games. First of all its a simulator, There aren't a lot of great simulators for the apocalypse. Well most of them aren't still in EARLY development, Most of them are released as they are and don't update as frequently and have new content, but Project Zomboid does. New patches release adding new mechanics, bug fixes, customization, and so much more thats just one of the greatest aspects of Project Zomboid.\n\nOnce you launch Project Zomboid you're greeted with an amazing soundtrack. If you don't believe me launch it for yourself! At the main menu you're shown these catigories " Mods, Survival, Sandbox, Laststand " and in the background it shows a heartwarming illustration of what appears to be a man hugging his sick wife. In these catigories you can play Survival, Sandbox or Laststand.\n\nSURVIVAL. In survival you get to choose the two maps created so far, make your character and traits your character has and what their career was before the apocalypse struck.\n\nSANDBOX. In sandbox you get the choice to make the world how you'd like it to be. You can change the way zombies see, hear, and smell. You can change how often loot spawns, the season you start in, how long the water and electricity will shut off etc. . .\n\nLASTSTAND. In laststand you instantly spawn in a house with a crate carrying weapons to defend yourself. You takedown the hordes until they break in and take you down. There is a timer so you can see how long you survived which makes it fun to challenge yourself or brag to your friends!\n\nFor the price Project Zomboid is right now I would call it a steal! 15 US dollars for a game as it is now plus all the updates and patches coming, this Indie game could definitly go for more. You can't beat the fact it goes on sale every now and then for even less!\n\nThis is how you died.\nPROJECT ZOMBOID","March 31, 2014","true","15.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Even in it's early stages, the amount of things do to  in order to survive is incredible. It pay attention to things most games miss like the power or water cutting off. The Dev's are very vocal on the forums and are quick to respond to bugs etc. They are friendly and easy to approach if you have an idea or question. The multiplayer, even at this stage is incredibly fun as a group of you work together to try and salvage tins of food and make a stand in the bleak apocalypse. Get this game and get your friends to get it too.\n\nEDIT\nSince my last review this game has come along leaps and bounds. The aiming system has had an overhaul, making the shooting on the game more sensible and feeling right for the kind of game it is. The stamina system has been implemented so you can no longer run cross map without even breaking a sweat. Now you have to decided whether you have the energy to take those 10 zombies blocking your way, or try to get past them. The medical system has been implemented, meaning even climbing through a broken window could leave you injured. The variety of injuries and appropriate treatments has added an extra depth to the game, which is always welcome. Falling from heights now causes fractures, limiting movement speed until a splint is on the wound and a few days of rest have passed. (Hope you have a lot of skill books to pass the time!)\n\nThe erosion feature means that after a certain time has passed, the world will change. Roots and weeds will sprout through the highway, football fields will start to grow small trees, and the buildings you loot will become cracked and weatherworn. Combine this with an ever expanding map, new skills for survival such as Trapping, Foraging and a way to preserve certain foods, and the much anticipated NPC's (no ETA's!)\n\nIn short, this game remains one of the best I have played in a very long time, and i have spent many many more hours than my steam profile shows. Whenever the chance arises, i buy a copy of this game for my friends and they get immediately sucked into the game. Buy a copy, or buy a 4 pack, dish a few out to your friends, and try to start a colony in the apocalypse that is Project Zomboid.","June 8, 2014","true","846.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

IT will get even harder to get used to if you haven't thought about survival situations in your life. The day I realized I loved Zomboid is when I decided to try and craft something, without knowing the recipe, a molotov cocktail. I drank a bottle of whiskey, and ripped up a sheet, I then tried pouring a bottle of whiskey on the sheet, it didn't work. A couple of game days later I came across a gas can, I substituted the whiskey for gas, and 'lo and behold a molotov was created. These are the kind of possibilities that will keep you coming back forever. Everything makes sense.\n\nThere are no shortage of "oh ♥♥♥♥ I better drink some bleach because I'm about to turn in to a zombie" moments, or "The house is filled with zombies, I'm stuck in a second floor bedroom, I'm going to have to risk breaking my legs jumping out the 2nd story window". The zombies are dangerous, they can and will kill you in some of the most miserable ways. Sometimes it is as simple as looking through the window before you break in to a house to prevent a surprise attack from a hole filled friend. Shooting a gun is always dangerous and rarely can you take on a horde on your own, oh yeah this game is multiplayer too...\n\nWith so much content it is hard to believe a game beyond early access and with things like NPC's (really well done) and offline co-op on the way, there is an exciting future to zomboid.","January 3, 2015","true","96.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Sleep, hunger, and thirst are something you have to watch for obviously, yes, but at the same time there's also fear, pain, depression, boredom, sickness, even temperature is taken into consideration. And everything will affect your character in some way.\n\nIt has one of the most comprehensive damage systems I've ever seen. Rather than just "You've taken damage! Don't let your health hit 0!", there's more to it than that. Scratches, bites, fractures, burns, infections, and bleeding can occur in all of your limbs, requiring you to take appropriate action to treat. One time I had to barricade myself in a room to perform extensive treatment; I had a deep wound in my arm from climbing in through a broken window, complete with a glass shard stuck in my character's arm. I had to remove the glass shard with tweezers, disinfect the wound, stitch it, bandage it, and keep an eye on it in case the bandage became dirty. And while it wasn't necessary, I sterilized the bandage while I was at it. Healing is something that takes place over time- unlike other games where you heal instantaneously, you'll only get better if you take care of your injuries and rest. They can even become infected if you don't take proper care of them. It's a level of realism that I've legitimately never seen in another game, and I appreciate that they took the time to implement it.\n\nOne thing I like is that zombies are actually a threat in this game; one or two might not be so bad if you're properly armed, but a horde busting down a door when you're in a tight hallway is beyond horrifying. You can't just be a super zombie slayer like Tallahassee from Zombieland or any character from The Walking Dead; you have to be careful, observant, and patient. Busting through a door without any regard to what may be on the other side could harmless... or you could walk straight into a dozen zombies that have already swarmed you before you can react. And once a group of zombies has you, you're done for. GG. Been nice knowing you.\n\nMost of all though, Project Zomboid understands what it means to be a survival game. While there is multiplayer as well as single player, it's not just a PvP manhunt disguised as a surival game like DayZ. PvP does exist, but even if you are in multiplayer, more often than not you have other concerns as opposed to hunting down other players for their food (though it is possible.) It places PvE first and foremost- it's you against the world, and the world is full of dead things. And depression, and the lack of food, and houses with alarms to alert said dead things, and uncertainty, and many other things out to ruin your day and get you killed. PvP is merely a feature if you want to do multiplayer.\n\nThere's so many things I could go into about this game and why it's one of the best survival games out there. Best suggestion I can give is to play it for yourself. If you're a fan of survival games, this is probably one of the most intense survival games you'll find, and I have to say it's really hard to beat Don't Starve in that department. For hardcore survival fans it's a must-own.","November 25, 2013","true","21.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jdmbt/recommended/108600/","Jdmbt","Jdmbt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jdmbt/","275 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nProject Zomboid is one of those few gems that is released every 5-7 years, where should I begin this review?\n\nLet's start with the concept of the game. The whole idea of PZ is to survive as long as possible, there are no objectives,  no end goal, just survive. Now this may sound easy, but in a world full of zombies constantly out to get whatever they smell/hear/see this can become rather challenging. We all know what zombies are and do, they are dead corpses that were reanimated by some sort of virus or disease and now out to infect everything in sight. And if you're an avid zombie hunter, then this game may sound like just another game with zombies in it, it's not.\n\nLet's get to the actual gameplay elements;\n\nCrafting: You can literally build what ever type of base you want, now this is by far one of the coolest features, you can wall off entire city blocks if you wanted to. (that would require quite a bit of resources though, I'll get to that in a minute) You can build doors, floors, walls, bars, stairs, and light posts among other things. You can craft weapons, or repair ones you've broken, you can add modifications to said weapons too! Got a baseball bat, some nails, and a hammer? Create a spiked baseball bat that deals pretty significant damage and does it in style too.\n\nBarricading: This should probably go in the crafting section, but whatever. Barricading is something most of us zombie hunters have wanted to do for some time now, and sure some zombie games do have it, but Project Zomboid executes it brilliantly, the resources required for barricading are pretty rare depending on how lucky you are and what type of settings you selected before you started your game. (only in Sandbox mode can you select said options) You can barricade windows and doors, which not only helps keep the creeping zeds at bay, but also makes it so they can't see you through said windows, which is really cool. (you can also put sheets up to block outsiders from looking into your safehouse)\n\nScavenging: This has been a part of modern zombie games for quite some time now, however this game does do one of the more realistic approches to it, food that you scavenge must be kept in a fridge or else it will spoil and make you sick if you attempt to eat it. Items that you need for crafting/barricading are pretty rare and thus valuable when found. You really need to pick and choose only the stuff you'll need at that moment when scavenging because you can only carry so much before becoming over encumbered, and don't forget you can always come back for whatever you can not bring with you at that time. There is another cool option about this, you can carry two bags with you at a time (this would require you to equip one bag in the secondary slot, and a big/normal, hiking/school bag equiped on your back) which gives you plenty of more space along with weight reductions applied from the bag(s) you have equiped at the time.\n\nMoodles: These are moodlets that pop up every now and then to tell you what your character is feeling/thinking, think The Sims, it's just like that. These can range anywhere from being tired, to getting cold, you'll want to keep a close eye on these. Most are not that important, however they're are some that do require your attention and you'll want to be on the lookout for such as, exhaustion, starving, getting sick, getting cold, getting wet, (when it rains) bleeding, and being in pain. A couple tips. 1) You'll want to avoid going out looting/killing during a storm because you'll get wet and will have an increased chance of becoming sick which could be the death of you if you don't take things easy. (killing zombies, running) 2) Lay down every now and then, you're not superman, your character needs sleep just as much as you do. 3) Make sure to always carry bandages/bandaids on you, in case you need to break open a window or patch up a wound, these are a necessity.\n\nSkills: This is a really fun feature in the game, you will develope skills according to how you play overtime. Do you like sneaking around avoiding the undead masses? Or do you like running in swinging hand over foot? either way will get you XP in these skills, which in time will unlock skill points that you can assign to your favorite most used abilities. Remember though, this is not carried over to multiple characters, if your character dies, all the abilities you've unlocked die with them.\n\nFarming: This is a pretty cool feature, it requires quite a few resources that may or may not be tricky to find depending on where you are and what options you've chose before starting the game. I'm not too experienced in this aspect as of the time of this review, however I do know that it is a great food source after the power/water has went out. You can grow your own crops inside your safe zone, or where ever, it really doesn't matter as long as you have the right materials you need, you can start your own little Farmville. (without being bombarded with 53,721 requests from people you barely know. I'm looking at you, Facebook)\n\nDistracting: You can distract the zombies with a few different methods, distracting a group of zombies could end up saving your life for another day. If you've got some gasoline handy and a few matches/lighter you could light up a near by house distracting the horde of undead while you easily sneak by and loot the otherwise damn near impossible house/building with ease. If you're playing with a friend(s) you can distract zombies while your friend goes in and loots the place dry by shouting at them, this will make your life a little bit harder though depending on how many of them there actually are, and Vice versa. Alams in houses can provide a quick distraction, if you're quick enough that is. Break a window or force it open in certain homes and you'll hear an alarm buzz for about 20-30 seconds, if you're quick enough to get out you can easily evade the on coming hordes making it easier to loot the outer area around the house you just sounded off, however this could very well be the end of your life if you get caught up in an oncoming group of zeds.\n\nWeapons: As with most zombie games, this game is based on melee/close quarter combat, there are guns available, however they're pretty rare, most are found in the cities and or gun stores, but of course those areas are hard to get to and loot without proper means, meaning you'll be doing most of your killing with a good ol' baseball bat/crowbar/golfclub, which is by no means a bad choice. (well except maybe the golfclub, you'd be better off fighting them with a toothbrush) The baseball bat has pretty decent durability, and is great against zombies, you can kill most zeds with a couple blows from a baseball bat, same with the crowbar, the better more rarer melee weapons such as the Axe and Sledgehammer are great too, however they're mostly located in the city areas, consider yourself lucky if you find one in the suburbs. Guns are great for clearing out areas, just make sure that you have enough ammo on you, because once you pull that trigger, it's on, that's like a dinnerbell to the infected.\n\nBe SMART: This game is heavily focused on realism, this isn't a game where you're an overpowered solider that cannot be killed, you can and probably will be killed quite a bit starting out. Only RUN when needed. Don't be a glutton and eat everything in sight, you may need that for another day. If you think it's a bad idea, then it is, and you shouldn't do it. And one last thing, STAY AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS AT ALL TIMES.\n\nThose are the main features of the game as of 4/20/2014 (Yea I know what day it is har har har)\n\nI'd like to add in that you will NEED to think before you act if you want to survive efficiently, this game is about your experience in the zombie apocalypse, what would you do in this situation if it actually happened? That's up to you, however, don't be careless, or else you will not survive for long.","April 21, 2014","true","129.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

If you die in this game, it's game over. No second chances, no revivals. Straight back to the main menu.\nThe game does a very good job of handling the things you would feel in a zombie apocolypse. Stress, Lack of sleep, Pain, Panic, the full monty. It uses a rather unique "Moodles" system. It has different tiers of emotions that you go through, for instance anxiety, onto stress, onto extreme stress, onto terrified.\n\nThe game has it's problems. For example they use both a number system and a moodles system and it gets confusing. I don't mind the moodles system, in fact I admire the originality but I would say make the number stats system visible too.\n\nOn the whole I really appreciate the game, it has brilliant developers, posting the oh-so amazing mondoids and with a sense of humor anyone'd die for.  Keep up the good work, dev team if you're reading this, and if you're thinking of buying the game, I say go for it as long as you don't mind a bit of hardcore. It has LOADS to do to keep you busy and theres constantly new features as well as the option to go back to the previous build. The price is great too, it's nice and compact and the animation is pretty darn good.

Even in it's early stages, the amount of things do to  in order to survive is incredible. It pay attention to things most games miss like the power or water cutting off. The Dev's are very vocal on the forums and are quick to respond to bugs etc. They are friendly and easy to approach if you have an idea or question. The multiplayer, even at this stage is incredibly fun as a group of you work together to try and salvage tins of food and make a stand in the bleak apocalypse. Get this game and get your friends to get it too.\n\nEDIT\nSince my last review this game has come along leaps and bounds. The aiming system has had an overhaul, making the shooting on the game more sensible and feeling right for the kind of game it is. The stamina system has been implemented so you can no longer run cross map without even breaking a sweat. Now you have to decided whether you have the energy to take those 10 zombies blocking your way, or try to get past them. The medical system has been implemented, meaning even climbing through a broken window could leave you injured. The variety of injuries and appropriate treatments has added an extra depth to the game, which is always welcome. Falling from heights now causes fractures, limiting movement speed until a splint is on the wound and a few days of rest have passed. (Hope you have a lot of skill books to pass the time!)\n\nThe erosion feature means that after a certain time has passed, the world will change. Roots and weeds will sprout through the highway, football fields will start to grow small trees, and the buildings you loot will become cracked and weatherworn. Combine this with an ever expanding map, new skills for survival such as Trapping, Foraging and a way to preserve certain foods, and the much anticipated NPC's (no ETA's!)\n\nIn short, this game remains one of the best I have played in a very long time, and i have spent many many more hours than my steam profile shows. Whenever the chance arises, i buy a copy of this game for my friends and they get immediately sucked into the game. Buy a copy, or buy a 4 pack, dish a few out to your friends, and try to start a colony in the apocalypse that is Project Zomboid.","June 8, 2014","true","846.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've played it since the early days on Desura, and it's grown immensely since then.

Don't let your health hit 0!", there's more to it than that. Scratches, bites, fractures, burns, infections, and bleeding can occur in all of your limbs, requiring you to take appropriate action to treat. One time I had to barricade myself in a room to perform extensive treatment; I had a deep wound in my arm from climbing in through a broken window, complete with a glass shard stuck in my character's arm. I had to remove the glass shard with tweezers, disinfect the wound, stitch it, bandage it, and keep an eye on it in case the bandage became dirty. And while it wasn't necessary, I sterilized the bandage while I was at it. Healing is something that takes place over time- unlike other games where you heal instantaneously, you'll only get better if you take care of your injuries and rest. They can even become infected if you don't take proper care of them. It's a level of realism that I've legitimately never seen in another game, and I appreciate that they took the time to implement it.\n\nOne thing I like is that zombies are actually a threat in this game; one or two might not be so bad if you're properly armed, but a horde busting down a door when you're in a tight hallway is beyond horrifying. You can't just be a super zombie slayer like Tallahassee from Zombieland or any character from The Walking Dead; you have to be careful, observant, and patient. Busting through a door without any regard to what may be on the other side could harmless... or you could walk straight into a dozen zombies that have already swarmed you before you can react. And once a group of zombies has you, you're done for. GG. Been nice knowing you.\n\nMost of all though, Project Zomboid understands what it means to be a survival game. While there is multiplayer as well as single player, it's not just a PvP manhunt disguised as a surival game like DayZ. PvP does exist, but even if you are in multiplayer, more often than not you have other concerns as opposed to hunting down other players for their food (though it is possible.) It places PvE first and foremost- it's you against the world, and the world is full of dead things. And depression, and the lack of food, and houses with alarms to alert said dead things, and uncertainty, and many other things out to ruin your day and get you killed. PvP is merely a feature if you want to do multiplayer.\n\nThere's so many things I could go into about this game and why it's one of the best survival games out there. Best suggestion I can give is to play it for yourself. If you're a fan of survival games, this is probably one of the most intense survival games you'll find, and I have to say it's really hard to beat Don't Starve in that department. For hardcore survival fans it's a must-own.","November 25, 2013","true","21.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

IT will get even harder to get used to if you haven't thought about survival situations in your life. The day I realized I loved Zomboid is when I decided to try and craft something, without knowing the recipe, a molotov cocktail. I drank a bottle of whiskey, and ripped up a sheet, I then tried pouring a bottle of whiskey on the sheet, it didn't work. A couple of game days later I came across a gas can, I substituted the whiskey for gas, and 'lo and behold a molotov was created. These are the kind of possibilities that will keep you coming back forever. Everything makes sense.\n\nThere are no shortage of "oh ♥♥♥♥ I better drink some bleach because I'm about to turn in to a zombie" moments, or "The house is filled with zombies, I'm stuck in a second floor bedroom, I'm going to have to risk breaking my legs jumping out the 2nd story window". The zombies are dangerous, they can and will kill you in some of the most miserable ways. Sometimes it is as simple as looking through the window before you break in to a house to prevent a surprise attack from a hole filled friend. Shooting a gun is always dangerous and rarely can you take on a horde on your own, oh yeah this game is multiplayer too...\n\nWith so much content it is hard to believe a game beyond early access and with things like NPC's (really well done) and offline co-op on the way, there is an exciting future to zomboid.","January 3, 2015","true","96.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

For WAY too long, companies has been making Zombie Shooters, and calling them Zombie "Survival" games. DayZ might be TRYING to bring the Zombie Survival up from the grave (Zombie pun, not intended) But the zombies...Well, they arent really a threat.\n\nProject Zomboid is something COMEPLETELY different though. In this game (Still in "early" development) You don't need to just make sure that you eat and drink. In this you need to make sure you: Don't get infected, Have a safe house, don't get robbed by other survivors (WIP), Don't get addicted to stuff like Cigarettes and Alchohol and MUCH much more.\n\nThis game has a very interesting Combat system. I like it alot, but I still think it could be improved a little. For example, when "Sneaking" you need to hold down the same button as you need to when you get ready to attack. Therefore, I have many times accidentally swung at a door, instead of opening it.\n\n\nAll in all, Its a GREAT game.

I'm a big fan of zombies and I heard about Project Zomboid on a website and it sounded really appealing to me. I figured after finding it on Steam I'd try out the demo.... after dodging some zombies , opening the door to a gun shop and being confronted with the first zombie I ever fought I was hooked... Since then I`ve bought the game and played it the last couple of days, and it`s amazing.... the zombies can be avoided if you remain unseen and unheard but if one sees you its best to fight him rather than run because although you can out-run them, you``ll have a horde following you if you do....\n\nThere`s so much you can do in the game that I haven`t done yet, I plan on collecting supplies and building a base in the woods away from the city eventually... My only advice is to keep playing this game, practise different techniques until you find what works best for you, and if you find it too hard play it in Sandbox mode which allows you to set up the setting to low population zombies (which still is a lot), Etc.\n\nThis game has so much to offer, you can honestly feel the experience of survival in this zombie apacolypse, and its not even the finished result yet, in my opinion it`s definitely stable enough to play, has multiplayer option and one day will have a lot more than it does now including hunting, driving and looting cars, etc.\n\nIf you`re thinking about buying this game play the demo, and if you`re intrigued, buy it while it`s still early access, it`ll be worth a lot more in the future... its a good deal, you get updated everytime they add something even after buying the game, and it runs on low requirements computers as long as it has a decent graphics card, 1-2 gb ram and the hard drive space required, I definitely recommend it.","April 23, 2014","true","18.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But for the words by me, I suggest buying it at a later date, assuming that the pirates didn't drain the developers wallet dry. The game was just recently upgraded with a server browsing list and some mod support, so it's definitly more ripe and shinier than what it first started out.

In previous incarnations, the game was undeniably promising but very rough round the edges, meaning the absorbing battle against the environment and the monsters that inhabit it was punctuated with jarring bugs and glitches like falling through stairs, walking straight through walls and so on.\nMany of the more troublesome gremlins have been zapped, and while there are still a few that pop up from time to time, the game is a lot less likely to do something utterly bizarre, and a lot more likely to kill you with cold, hard logic and survival elements.\n\nThe developers have handled the release fairly well, providing steady and worthwhile updates whilst continuing to listen to their community and prioritising the issues that matter most to the fans (stability and the addition of multiplayer). This has resulted in a game that I feel a lot more players would consider 'truly' playable and could sink many hours into, even in its current state.\n\nThere IS still a long way to go - NPCs seem like they're still a way off, and it's odd to see entire towns almost perfectly modelled, but without a single car in sight - wrecked or otherwise. These things will no doubt be sorted in time - the developers have proven over the past 12 months on Steam that they are happy to take their time working on things until they're ready rather than risking adding things too early and bringing in a host of bugs and issues.\n\nOverall:\n\nFun?: Yes\nAny Game-Breaking Issues?: Not really game-breaking, but it's not finished.\nWorth the Price of Admission?: Yes.\n\n============================================================================\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nFirst things first - I've been playing Project Zomboid since I first learned about it on Steam Greenlight way back when it was one of the flagship titles, so obviously the game-time in Steam doesn't really reflect that. Just for disclosure there. :)\n\nAnyway, onto the game, and the first question you're going to want to know is 'is it worth it?'\n\nAnd annoyingly, it's kind of difficult to answer right now. Let's get this out of the way right now - in its CURRENT STATE, Zomboid is bug-riddled and missing many key features. If you're buying it right now (November 2013), you need to understand that this is absolutely an Alpha - entire chunks of the game simply aren't there right now, in particular NPCs.\nIt's also clunky to control, has a learning curve that's almost Dwarf Fortress-esque in its steepness, and occasionally difficult to navigate.\n\nBut the one thing that keeps me coming back and that convinced me to part with my money in the first place is the potential. It's not the 'War Z' potential where the devs are making grand promises with absolutely no idea how on earth they're going to keep them - the basics are in there: the map is freaking enormous, and it's gloriously detailed. The zombie behaviour is excellent - individually they're not a threat, but make a loud noise or stumble into a horde and you're in a whole WORLD of trouble. The parts of the game that are complete show an attention to detail and that little spark of inspiration that give the player confidence that whatever's being promised/worked on is going to arrive, and when it does, it'll be awesome.\n\nSo to conclude, although it's often banded about these days, it's more true than most in the case of Project Zomboid - when you hand over your £9.99 (or regional equivalent, I guess!), you're buying the game it's GOING to be, not the game it is right now. If you're not convinced that this is a gamble worth taking, you might be better off waiting six months for the game to take a little more shape, but you should be aware that the price will likely creep up again slightly, as the developers have confirmed that they want to reward early adopters by offering it to them for less than 'full price', whatever that may end up being.\n\nFun to Play?: Yes\nAny Gamebreaking issues?: Lots\nWorth the admission price?: Depends on your patience.","November 29, 2013","true","30.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Most of you have. Let me say, if you think you could survive better than some of the characters in the walking dead, this game is your challenge. You have to fight numerous zombies, I have yet to have a save where i have not killed one zombie. You have to scavenge through the city trying to be unoticed the mass amounts of hordes of zombies and find what little food there is left. Eventually the zombies will find your safehouse, so you need to make defenses. you need to barricade your windows, build walls, and maybe build more rooms and crates for storage. eventually, the city will run out of food, so you need to either get the supplies to go fishing, or trap mice and rats and make a campfire to cook them. This game is the real deal. This will test your survivability. This is your chance to prove you can do it. This is the end.\n---\nOLD REVIEW:\nIf you like zombie games, and games that require a little bit of strategy and skill, this is the game for you. at first when i saw this game, and i admit, i thought it was stupid. My best friend had showed it to me, and my first thoughts were that its stupid. i watched him play it anyway because i like to give games a chance. as i saw all of the techniques he used, it started to change my mind a little bit.  then i saw that in this game, you can barricade windows, build walls and barrels to collect rain in for when the water goes out, and saw that you can even farm food and cook food like steak, chicken, and meat patties, my opinion completley changed. This, is probably the most realistic zombie game that i have ever seen and/or played. this game will very soonly have multiplayer and NPC's. I have played this for 25 hrs. on steam record and i am not even close to bored with it. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME.\n-\nUPDATE 12/7/2014\ni've had this game for almost a year now, and i am still very happy with my purchase. this game is slow paced, and i took about a 4 month break from it because i got some other games that i was interested in, and to be honest, i got bored of this game. after a few updates had come out for the game, including a multiplayer update, (which i play on public servers a lot) and some graphic changes, including 3D models that look amazing, FPS optimization, and the ability to see if things are in shelves (which sounds like nothing, but before everything looked empty even if you had like 24 items on it) i came back to this game yesterday, and put about 15 hours into it since. This game is very fun, especially if you get a nice safehouse running with reinforced walls and such. well, thanks for reading my review, if you have any questions, let me know by commenting, and i will do my best to respond ASAP! Have a good day, and i hope that if you choose to purchase this game, you get many hours out of it!","February 14, 2014","true","79.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

For early acces, the game is deep and exciting but on the other hand it has few bugs as a movement of zombies (they sometimes stop and freeze around obstacles) and gunshots (which triggers zombie migration) goes in loops from time to time.

You can use the sandbox feature to create the zombie survival mode of your choice. Want to slowly build a fortress to keep back George Romero style hordes then you can. If you'd rather create d shortsighted, morbidly obese character and see how many seconds you can last against a rush of 28 days later zeds then that's also an option. The gameplay is solid. The "early access" tag conceals the fact that there's already a strong game here. The developers are active and committed and seem to be happy to let the community influence the direction that this game develops. PZ is good.

When I first saw it on ImmortalHD's channel I thought it was a semi decent game that would be fun to play. Little did I know it would evolve into what it is now. This game has come along way with the addition of an advanced medical system and the (hopefully soon to be) addition of NPCs.\n\nPros:\n\n- Interesting. Can keep you immersed if played properly for days\n- One of the MOST realistic survival simulators out there. (Might not be like DayZ, but in terms of survival it is)\n\nCons:\n\n- Little boring on single player if you are new (I prefer multiplayer experiences)\n\nLittle Multiplayer Story:\n\nMe and my friend were playing in a server. We decided to head to the hunting lodge up in West Point (That's where we thought the others in the game would be at) and found it to be empty of other players. We searched through the building to find a shotgun and a few shells. I was told to keep watch since I had no weapons and out of the corner of my eye I saw two men outside fighting off zombies. I screamed to my friend "THEY'RE OUTSIDE!! HURRY! I SEE THEM! THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE!!" He came to the door only to bust out screaming shooting blindly at them. One was gunned down in the process and the other took a severe wound to his chest. I picked up his weapon and we followed him into the woods. We assume he bled out... but we will never know to this day.\n\n10/10 would search again","January 21, 2015","true","28.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

If you happen to accidentally take a wrong turn or make a noise too loud, you can end up being bitten, and as soon as you're bitten, you genuinely die. Being bitten will actually progress into zombification (if that's the word). You've gotta choose your own safehouse, build your own defenses and scavenge for food yourself.

Don't get me wrong, this is a good game, but development is rather slow but the bigger problem is that the developers don't prioritise things that most players are complaining about. My major concerns are:\n\n-The game is difficult to get into for new players. There is a small survival guide but really you will need to go to the online wiki and online map if you are to have any hope of surviving. There should be much more in game help and tooltips, especially with regard to crafting.\n- There really should be an in-game map (or an option to turn it on). It makes no sense that your character who is living in the town has no idea what the layout of the town is. I mean there is already an online map and everybody seems to be using it so the only reason for the developers not to include it is because they can't be bothered.\n\nThis is not a bad game, I bought it and it is a nice experience for 15$. I just wish the developers would stop wasting their time on things like making the game map bigger while there are other more pressing issues to sort out.","February 14, 2015","false","33.5"," 76 of 146 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","76","146","0","11"

Threats are all around you, and you will not survive, but the real question is how far will you make it? Thirst,  hunger, sleep deprivation, heat, cold, depression, boredom, sickness, infection, and of course: Zombies. The choices you make will determine how long you will  last, leading to some difficult decision making. The game does a fantastic job of portraying a zombie apocalypse in all it's horror and darkness.\n\nThe zombies are "proper" zombies. That being, slow, shambling, and non-superhuman undead as portrayed in Max Brook's "Zombie Survival Guide" and "World War Z" (The BOOK not the movie!). The threat of infection is real. One scratch is all it takes unless you're lucky. And if you've been bitten, it's game over no matter how much you try and fight it; what's left is how you choose to spend the last few days of you're life. It'll make you think twice before courageously taking on a small horde of zombies with your baseball bat.\n\nSimply by playing the game, you are creating your own story for your character. It's a dynamic world full of zombies and you get to decide what you want to do and what your priorities are. There is lengthy character progression through a skill system, making you're character all the more precious as you invest more time into them. The longer you're alive, the more you'll want to survive.\n\nThe game is still in Alpha, so it's considered incomplete by the developers, meaning there are many more features to come.\n\nI can't wait to see what they add to this game as time goes on. It already feels like a complete experience, so anything new they put in can only add to it.\n\nThis game is worth every penny. Something that I have a lot of difficulty saying about many other games.","March 31, 2014","true","111.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is not for you.\n\nNow that's out of the way Project Zombiod is a 2D zombie survival game. Its simple you wake up in a house in a large town split into two districts. You search around the houses cupboards, draws and even the fridge for supply's. Now you go to the window and see that their are many other house's around you probabaly containing even more loot. You open your front door and look out and see no sigh of trouble. You walk over to the house and find that the front door is locked. You walk around the side and open the window. You enter the house and start to look around. You manage to find yourself a new crowbar to use as a weapon. You also use a plastic bag to help you hold more food. You walk up the stairs and see a Zombie jump out at you. You beat it to death but notice that your character is now worried and frightened. You walk back to your house but as you open the front door a zombie sneaks up from behind and attacks you. You spin around, pull out your crowbar and beat it to death.\n\nYou walk inside than treat yourself to a nice cold TV Dinner. 15 minutes later you get sick and die. Because you didnt cook the food.\n\nThat was my first 20 Minutes in project zomboid and it made an impression. Sure its a simple survival zombie game but its felt real. The scaverging is where the games best moments are. Breaking into houses and carfully moving from room to room, collecting bed sheets to put on the windows as curtains back home so Zombies arn't attracted to the light.\n\nThe game plays like any basic 2D game. Just move and click. You have two menus which display your inventory and whats around you. It is very basic in that way. But its how your character is and feels that works well. If you get attacked by a zombie your player will become panicked and won't be as accurate with his hits. Or if your at your base waiting around or reading about new skills your chacter will become bored which can lead to the charcter being un-happy. The weapons are basic. You just swing your bat in the direction and the target and it will hit it. Or if you have a gun its pre much auto-lock. No skill is required you just look,shoot and you hit your target. Their are no cars in the game so your always walking which can become repative and boring. The game is fair from realistc but feels real in a way that you always find stuff in places where you would expect stuff to be. Unlike in Dayz where you find stuff lying on the floor. Here you look in draws,shelfs and fridges to find loot. I love entering new houses or areas not knowing what is going to be there.\n\nThe game isn't extremly easy. If you find yourself in a horde of zombies, to put it nicely. You're ♥♥♥♥ed. Zombies are a threat even though they can be taken down by one shot at times with a gun, zombies will hear this shot and close in on you. Once me and my friend were trying to loot a bank, we ran into the parking lot to find a horde of zombies waiting for us. We panicked smashed the window and jumped inside. I lost sight of my friend as 4 zombies that were already in the building closed in on me. I freaked out, pulled out my pistol and shot all 4. Worst decison of my life. Now zombies were flodding in, smashing windows  and breaking down the door's. As I had now discoverd my friend had left me for dead. I ran upstairs and tried to find a new way out and had no luck. As I tried to open a window to see if I could climb out. Zombies snuck up behind me and started attacking me. Already injuired I was dead in seconds. The game isn't easy seeing that zombies are easily attracted to noise and you can only see a small distance where your chacter is facing. The game can be hard on your own. But play it right or with friends and you will grasp it.\n\nNow eventually you will find yourself sellting down and buliding a base. Base building consits of two things, Physical Bulding and Farming. You can build walls to fortify your house and make a large farming area that you have to fertilise and water. It's basic but it works. Farming is also a great idea because eventually all water and power supply stops. So you cant keep your food in the fridge or drink water from the tap.\n\nOnce you have a base I can find the game can begin to get repatative and boring. Eventually I found myself repeating the same thing. Going out and scaving as much as I can than bring it home. With the occasional farm. That is where the game really lacks. It get's boring. Their's no big multipalyer too. Sure you can join  populated severs but its just a cluster-♥♥♥♥. In the single player theirs no AI, no objectives, no events or anything like that. I wish their was the occasional moment when you run into a gang of AI and have a all out war. Or find other bases to break into or raid. Or maybe make a town and have AI work in it. All this can be added and I wish it will. Im sure AI will be added at some point with other features because right now after a while the game gets boring. But that is a matter of hours in. You can always start a new life fresh on your own or with friends and do it all again.\n\nThe music in the game is great I have to say.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\n\nPros:\n-Zombie AI works great\n-Scavaging is fun\n- Looks fresh and new\n-Good fun with friends\n-Feels real but not too real\n-Base building\n\nCons:\n-Not a whole lot to it\n-Gets repeative after a while\n-No AI makes the only threat zombies\n-Big severs don't work\n\nRATING: 8/10\n\nThe game is worth the price by a mile. I know the game is in early acceses so they will add new things and the game will get even better and the score would probably be bosted up to and 8 or maybe even a 9. But for now it's diffently worth it.","June 7, 2014","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are a multitude of ways to customise your game before you play. From the type of game, time, character settings, traits, zombie movement and amount etc. Never one game will be the same. With the addition of multiplayer in the future and a lot of planned features you can see on the store page, this is definitely a great purchase.\n\nAs to how this game plays, it is not a walk in the park. This game is true survival at heart and you can't be complacent and the more risks you take, the more likely you are to die. Some ways I have died have been from not clearing a house before looting, getting cornered by a horde inside a house and also outside, eating rotten vegetable, getting sick from being out in the rain too much, falling off the stairs (early beta), not making sure a zombie on the ground is dead, walking through a forest and then suddenly getting set on by a horde, leaving the lights on or window open for visibility, getting shot by an npc (early beta), attacking a zombie on the road only to attact more further down it, burning the house down by leaving the oven on. Longest I've lived for was 10 days.\n\nI'm still new to this game and have heard about the farming, building and crafting available to build defences and to hold out against a moving zombie horde. Great game and definitely would recommend it to friends.\n\nLooting houses, hospitals, churches, markets, shopping centres, schools, sheds, cabbins, apartments, restaurants, gp centre, warehouses, commercial buildings what more can you ask for?","March 28, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The music, art style and morbid tone of Project Zomboid created an experience that kept me coming back again and again. I highly recommend this game!\n\nThe people who made it have been adding new skills, items and crafting recpies recently, creating more survival options and play-styles. The content planned for the future (NPCs, vehicles, more towns etc.) sounds really promising and I hope the game lives up to it's huge potntial.\n\nI think the problems with this game are that building two-storey houses is too buggy at the moment. Also, the frame rate and resolutution needs to be improved. They do plan to do this soon apparently. That said, the hours I played this game speaks for itself. PZ gave me some truly emotional, memorable, exciting and heartbreaking experiences..

Zombies serve only as target practice. The aspect of prolonged survival in a post apocalyptic world is pretty much ignored, other than the occassional reference or scene. The concept of rebuilding in this new world is also forgotten. You just go from point A to B and shoot some zombies, that's it. And then there's Project Zomboid. You get to shoot zombies (bad idea!), but you also get the chance to rebuild. Find a good spot, build a wall and before you know it, you've got your own base to defend.\n\nOf course, it's not that easy, but it should give a good idea. The game has carpentry, farming and most recently even hunting was added (to an extent). Which brings me to the second point. The company constantly adds more content. It's a good habit, one I hope to keep seeing for a long time.\n\nSo I definitely recommend this game.","July 11, 2014","true","68.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you want a fast paced, not too challenging romp through the zombie apocalypse... This is not the game for you and there are friendlier, better-looking alternatives.\n\nBut if you want to play the game that comes closest to simulating what an actual zombie apocalypse would be like, this is for you. This game is TOUGh; the intro states that "there was no hope of survival" and that "this is how you die", and it's spot on. You WILL die, over and over, until you start to learn how the game works, how to take things slowly and steadily, and how to pick your fights.\n\nThe game itself is full of content. It has a deep medical/injury/mood system, a large map (unfinished but still full of buildings to loot and zombies to kill), a working crafting system for everything from a hammer to a wooden house, farming, and a dynamic world which will evolve and change as time passes, with seasons, water and power shutouts, etc. etc., forcing you to change your strategy as you survive longer and longer. But no worries, it will take you multiple attempts to even reach that point.\n\nAlso worth mentioning are the character creation system, where you need to pick negative traits (such as being grumpy, overweight, a coward, etc.) and positive traits (athletic, brave, eagle-eyed...) whose point values even each other out; and the multiplayer which allows you to do everything I've listed with a friend, and which I've found is very playable, even in alpha.\n\nOn top of all of this, the devs are present on the forums and community pages and consistently pump out new content for us to enjoy, which in this world of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t "grab the money and run" or "promise some stuff and then never deliver" or even "straight up lie to customers about the plans you have for the game" early access projects is really something to value. In fact, the devs love the game too, and have even pumped up the difficulty in recent patches, by making zombies more aware of movement and sound around them and tightening up zombie hordes instead of having them all spaced out. They want to make a true zombie survival experience, not some easy, popular but short-lived zombie killing action game, and I think they deserve praise for that.\n\nIn short, the game in its current state is already very playable and full of hours of content, both in single and multiplayer. And at 10 pounds or 15 USD, it's a steal imho.","January 26, 2015","true","32.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

The demo gave me a strong impression on what it is capable of so I decided to buy it for a low cost compared to other indie games.\n\nThe Alpha: Bugs, glitches, crashes will happen in every single alpha so I tend to ignore these a little whiles doing a review unless it is a major issue which it is not and I am happy to continue this review.\n\nThe main menu is brilliant, the lightning flashes with the music kicking in that reveals a hidden dark secret to the two characters on screen, you have three game modes Survival, Last Stand, Sandbox.\n\nSurvival; As the game is meant to be, you create your character with its pros and cons, you start in  one out of two worlds which random generates items and your starting area which opens your eyes up and scares you from roaming too far in the early stage, you need to keep fed, watered, fit and infection free! If you're a zombie fan then playing this is logical, play it as a movie and real life scenerios for survival and you will not have a problem on keeping alive....until you meet zombies, they are slow, fast, weak and strong...some walk, some run, some crawls, they're all attracted to smell of blood dripping, sound and sight which creates or breaks hordes up.\n\nSandbox; just like survival but you're in control for a while on what the world can be like for zombies, make them weak or super hard.\n\nLaststand: You're holding out aslong as you can before death, there is only one way to win.... stand and defend as long as you can.....Winning is death in my eyes.\n\nGraphics might look weak to you but they really fit the game well, sounds are brilliant from zombie growls, sounds of guns, alarms, windows smasing, doors breaking and more.\n\nFor an Alpha it is well done for its pre-release, if you can not hack bugs, crashes, glitches then wait until people report less and less.\n\n\n6.6 rating for alpha. I will review it once again when the game has improved to be held by its title on its own which will be on my site.\n\nYES I will recommend it to my friends.

I literally can only play in short spurts as it's almost too scary in terms of realism.  Zombies can be deadly,  and it's generally safer to avoid them.  Collect food, gather water (the waterworks WILL fail after some time), and establish a safe(r) place to sleep and store your ransacked goods.

A lot of games that call themselves survival simulators,  aren't much more than shooters with rudimentary crafting elements thrown in. Project zomboid on the other hand really contains very extensive survival elements, from physical to psychological effects and needs to elaborate crafting mechanics.\n\nCons:\nThere are some small bugs and at some points I had to restart the game. Didn't bother me too much. On OSX it runs A LOT more stable for me though, than on Windows 7. No idea why. From a design standpoint I really miss an optional save function. It is really fun to play whit to constant fear of death for some hours - but then it has gotten old for me. After surviving for about 30 days, I started to copy the save-games folder all the time, cause I wanted to experiment with the crafting and expand my characters skills. Sure you can return to your buldings with a new character but why not include an optional save function when I can copy the save games folder anway. Some people will dislike this statement, but for me the constant fear of getting killed and losing my characters progress got old after some time. Save finctionality could also be some kind of achievement you get after surviving for a month or so.\n\nPS: don't get confused by my playtime on steam. I played this some weeks / months before it was on steam.","December 11, 2013","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Add in the base building, wheather effects, and very extensive crafting and you have a real gem. Cant wait till they add multiplayer but well worth it for anyone that is gaming on a laptop or Pad as it is not very graphically intensive but gives quite a bit  more then most survival  games when it comes to the quantity of things to do when it comes to survival.

Simply amazing. It's probably the best zombie sim you will play. I bought this game over a year ago on Desura and have enjoyed it since (with and with out bugs). There is a lot to deal with. Unlike Day Z you don't have to worry about other players. This is great because it puts the focus on survival and zombies. The game will have co op and multiplayer later from what I understand. The game itself is open world so you get dropped in and have to scavange and fend for yourself. One of the first things you will probably want to do is establish some sort of safe house. From there what you do is entirely up to you. You can choose to loot nearby buildings, kill zombies, look for other NPC's, build a farm,  etc.\n\nThe game has a fairly deep building system. it works kind of like Dead Rising except not as crazy. You can grab a bat and put it together with nails to form a nailed bat or you can combine liqour with a rag for molotov cocktails. The building system also extends to safe houses. You can barricade doors, windows, etc. This is vital in case your house gets hit by a zombie horde. Most safe houses don't stay safe for long. There are a lot of factors that can put your home in danger. Looter NPC's making too much noise and attracting zombies are just a few of the dangers.\n\nYou can't just stay in your safe house however, eventually hunger and other factors set in. Your character is susceptible to things ranging from boredom to sleep deprivation. Some of these things can be curbed a bit because the game offers a nice character creation system. You can invest in things like courage to make yuor character less likely to freak out during a zombie fight. You can also choos to make him a better runner, etc. This seems generic but there is a neat little twist. For every "good" trait you choose you must balance it out with a "bad" trait. This prevents you from making a super powerful character. Some traits have a higher cost than others and this really creates a balanced and unique character creation system.\n\nOne of the things I really enjoyed about this game is the fact that you can adjust the zombies. You can make them Romero style (slow) or 28 Days Later (runners). You can also adjust minute things like infection spreading. This is simply fantastic since it gives you the ability to play with different zombie types. This isn't the only thing you can change however. This game has a great modding community and the developers seem to support modding for this game heavily. There are already a bunch of great mods out for this game and I would highly suggest you try some out.\n\nOne of the things I didn't like about the game is the inventory system. You need to carry bags to lighten your carry weight. The more you have on your body the slower you move. Makes sense and a great system used in other games.  Different bags have different carry capacity. The problem I had with this is that while you are out and about you really want to carry a minimum set of things (weapons, food, etc). While out scavenging you may have to find some where to sleep for the night or may need some supplies. Carrying items in different bags seems a bit cumbersome. I understand the need for the bags but I feel like it could be done a little better.\n\nOver all this game has a lot going for it and I was very excited when it was green lit on Steam. If you want a nice variety in zombie simulation you should give this game a try. It has a lot going for it and you can definitely see the developers have a lot of love for the community and zombie fans in general.\n\n+ Great open world\n+ Amazing simulator\n+ Good  customization\n+ Lots of options for different style of gameplay\n\n- Not so awesome inventory system.\n\n4.5/5","December 20, 2013","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Still in alpha, but with plenty of game play to keep players entertained for hours, Project Zomboid drops you in the middle of a suburban landscape as the sole (in the current build at least) survivor of a classic zombie outbreak. You will die, this is inevitable. The question (and objective) the game poses is: how long will you survive?\n\nSurviving isn't as simple as staying indoors and out of sight however. Like a normal person you have needs. Hunger, thirst, sleep, and entertainment are periodic needs that must be fulfilled lest you risk your health and sanity. Satisfying these needs will require venturing outside and scavenging for supplies. At first it all seems so simple: find some food to eat, maybe some magazines to read and you're all set, water's still coming out of the tap after all and as long as the window shades are closed no zombie will come looking for you, that is until one follows you home and starts pounding on the window.\n\n"Maybe he'll just go away" you think, but before you can act the window is broken and the zombie is inside. Run or fight, those are your options. You've spent too long gathering supplies to run and you're too tired to get very far so you're going to have to fight, but with what? Quick! To the counter! The kitchen knife. You grab the knife just in time and violently stab the intruder over and over before finally it succumbs.\n\nMaybe the house isn't as secure as you thought and now the window is broken. Perhaps if you had a hammer, some boards, and nails you could barricade it up. If you're going to head out to find these things however you'll need a better weapon and you'll have to find that too. Maybe surviving isn't going to be so easy afterall.","December 24, 2013","true","20.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was also one of the first Indie games that I ever purchased. The game challenges you to survive for as long as possible, At first, the world is very similar to how it would be without zombies, only they are roaming outside. But as you survive, the electricity shuts off, lights no longer work. You must roam with a flashlight to cut through the dark Mudlraugh wilderness. Then the water shuts off, you must collect water bottles, pop bottles. Or construct a barrel to store some rain water. All while evading hordes of zombies, and risking infection in all of your close quarter battles. You are a regular survivor, every scratch and bite has a chance to turn you into a moaning, bloody mess. Sometimes a frying pan isnt enough to save you when zombies are breaking in through every entrance of your shelter. PZ is updated roughly every couple weeks, and the devs are about to finish up the new engine that will make the game run much smoother again, along with adding NPCs and the story again soon, which were removed so they could be revamped to fit all of the new changes in the game. The game is definitely worth the $15, as i have far more hours on it than almost any commercial game, and the moaning of zombies is calling you to fight or die. However, a warning, when you get insanely addicted to this, and want more zombies, you will be disappointed by the other games.\n\nVisuals - 9 for what its meant to be and an Indie\nSound/Music - 10, scary moaning and awesome soundtrack\nStory - Not back in place\nGameplay - 10\n\nEDIT: Game is getting lots of updates, they're putting the new 3D engine in and its looking fantastic!","November 10, 2013","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Single player's great right now, but I don't recommend multiplayer yet.\n\nMultiplayer's not great yet, because it lacks a speed-time feature. At night time, it's hard to see. If you don't want your character to roam around in the dark, then you have to wait for nighttime to slowly pass. You get to sit and stare as your character stands around in the dark, because your character doesn't sleep and you can't fast-forward. In single-player, this isn't a problem. You get sleepy, go to bed, and time speeds while you sleep. You can also fast-forward time whenever you want to. This means that you can focus on playing, and avoid nighttime. You can also avoid having to sit and wait for rain to stop, too. The developers have been good about polishing the game, and it keeps shining. So, multiplayer will likely be fixed in the future. However, for now, multiplayer's not great.\n\nSingle-player is fun already. The world has a nice sandbox feel to it. You can zoom in close or keep the camera far out, which allows for a nice, customizable view. There are many items to find, and the developers keep adding in more. The map has a large area to explore, and the developers keep adding more to it, too. You can cook, build, garden and, apparently, fish. (I still haven't gotten around to fishing.) Hunting's another new thing.\n\nThe only issue I have with it is that its gotten easy for me, but this is after dozens of hours of playing it. (Once you get into a rhythm with an axe and a shotgun, zombies are less intimidating.) And it's still fun anyway. I'll gather up shotgun shells and corral zombies, because there's a certain joy to thinning out the horde while zigging and zagging between the undead. I'm looking forward to when NPCs are added back in, and for multiplayer to be improved. Overall, this is a good game that keeps getting better.","June 19, 2014","true","415.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Still in alpha, but with plenty of game play to keep players entertained for hours, Project Zomboid drops you in the middle of a suburban landscape as the sole (in the current build at least) survivor of a classic zombie outbreak. You will die, this is inevitable. The question (and objective) the game poses is: how long will you survive?\n\nSurviving isn't as simple as staying indoors and out of sight however. Like a normal person you have needs. Hunger, thirst, sleep, and entertainment are periodic needs that must be fulfilled lest you risk your health and sanity. Satisfying these needs will require venturing outside and scavenging for supplies. At first it all seems so simple: find some food to eat, maybe some magazines to read and you're all set, water's still coming out of the tap after all and as long as the window shades are closed no zombie will come looking for you, that is until one follows you home and starts pounding on the window.\n\n"Maybe he'll just go away" you think, but before you can act the window is broken and the zombie is inside. Run or fight, those are your options. You've spent too long gathering supplies to run and you're too tired to get very far so you're going to have to fight, but with what? Quick! To the counter! The kitchen knife. You grab the knife just in time and violently stab the intruder over and over before finally it succumbs.\n\nMaybe the house isn't as secure as you thought and now the window is broken. Perhaps if you had a hammer, some boards, and nails you could barricade it up. If you're going to head out to find these things however you'll need a better weapon and you'll have to find that too. Maybe surviving isn't going to be so easy afterall.","December 24, 2013","true","20.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're not to sure about it, watch some videos, play the demo, I highly recommend this game to any survival/zombie fanatic out there! 4.5/5  :)","December 30, 2013","true","19.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Where this game really shines is with the multiplayer in the state its in right now the MP is a little hard for new people to figure out. You have to go find IPs for the PZ forms or the Steam Hub. They are working on adding a server list for the game just like TF2. With that aside what made me pick up the game is it reminded me of old school games like Roller Coaster tycoon with is asymmetric art style. witch is my favorite video game art style. Its from a bird's eye perspective, you can only see what's in front of you such as… if there is a zombie in front of you and you turnaround the zombie disappears until you look at it again. Its a hard game to get a hold of, there is no tutorial to tell you how to fight or do anything. There is no way you can “win” the game on the loading screen it tells you “This Is How You Die.” The only this in the game are zombies and you. They are close to finishing the NPC. When they add them I will start playing again but for now its gotten a little boring but I still recommend this game if you want a hard game to play.","September 10, 2014","true","98.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maizano/recommended/108600/","Maizano","Maizano","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maizano/","65 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet's start off by saying this game is in no sense casual, it is for the hardcore zombie genre fans who want a challenge and who have been looking for a realistic zombie apocalypse simulator. I for one have been on the search for a zombie game that put all the elements of its predecessors into one perfect representation. From helpful but not over the top skills to the building that is not obnoxious but gives you versatility and creativity to create the zombie safe house or fort of your dreams.\n\nThis game also makes you control your charter completely from getting sick to going insane; you must not only build a base and survive by eating but taking care of your charter as if he were yourself. At first the game mechanics and controls may seem foreign but once you sit down and get to know them, they are very fluent. Talking more about the crafting system and various items in the game, there is not a single item in the game that does not have a use at this point, this brilliant plan of having every item in the game have its own specific role gives this game an immersion level like no other. Yes the graphics are not HD, but they execute the feeling and atmosphere of the game flawlessly, and could have been done no other way to give the game the feel that is has, on top of the amazing sound track that is simple and not too much.  The top down type gameplay with all the "weird" black space may seem odd and even annoying at first glance, but once you sink your teeth into this game and get familiar with the load out, it’s used and executed perfectly to again give an immersion level like no other.  I will say this, PZ is a game that is absolutely brutal and will kick you down and keep you there unless you play through it and get familiar with the game. Do not go into this game thinking you will live forever and never die.  One little scratch or run in with a zombie or two maybe even hordes of hundreds just because you shot your gun can be the end of you, after all the game tells you during the load screen that this  your experience  is a story of how you died.  On top of everything so far there is an amazing modding community that are coming out with mods and different maps to play if you eventually get tired of playing the two stock maps, the community as a whole is small but mighty with many active and helpful players.  I would have to say that this game is best played with a friend for an even more enjoyable experience. I could sit here and break down each aspect of the game and tell you all the amazing features this game has to offer, which by the way is still in early access for only $15 but no matter what I say you can never truly experience this masterpiece of a game until you sit down and write you own story.\n\nIf you would like to read up more on the mechanics and features of the game, feel free to visit the wiki here: "http://pzwiki.net/wiki/Main_Page" which explains all of the mechanics in great depth, there is also a sub reddit to get your questions answered.  Last but not least resort to this map of you ever end up lost in the world it is a lifesaver :http://pzmap.crash-override.net" This game is one of the most underrated games in steam and a once in a lifetime experience. The developers who put this together deserve a standing ovation and for you to buy this game, to help them further the games development process. I would have to rate this game a 10/10 for superb gameplay mechanics, and flawless execution of what surviving a zombie apocalypse would be like.\n\n| Reviewed on 7/27/2015 Build 32 |\n","July 27, 2015","true","36.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/A1Mike_W/recommended/108600/","A1Mike_W","A1Mike_W","http://steamcommunity.com/id/A1Mike_W/","23 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've been playing this game for a little while now and I haven't written a review for it, so here it is.\n\nProject Zomboid is an amazing zombie apocalypse simulator. As a fan of most zombie games, and especially open-world RPG's, I cannot begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this title.\nLet me begin;\n\nPros:    Great graphics (if you're more into the retro look)\nGratifying gameplay (the game always offers something different, with TREMENDOUS replay value)\nSandbox mode, allowing you to customise how you want to play the game. You can change anything from the speed of zombies to their toughness, how often rare items come up, the temperature of the world, how fast the time progresses, what happens once you are bitten, and much, much more.\nRealism. Of course, the game isn't completely realistic, however for a fictional zombie game it does an amazing job at keeping the game fairly realistic.\nCharacter customisation. You're allowed to choose traits for your character which not only give you an advantage (or disadvantage) in the game, but also allow for roleplay. Again, I'd like to remind that there's tremendous replay value. Want to find out how well an overweight police officer would do in the zombie apocalypse? You got it. Curious about how well a lucky construction worker with a hearty appetite would do if zombies could sprint but were more fragile? You got that, too. There's a lot of space to try out different scenarios which is exactly what this game is about.\nRandomness. The whole game relies on chance, since all the items generated and the location where you spawn are (usually) different with each playthrough, you are allowed to experience what the zombie apocalypse would be like in different scenarios. I saw reviews of this game where people complained about how the random generation aspect of the game ruins it, but I rather like it; you won't always have a shotgun and an axe around when the apocalypse starts, and you are certainly less likely to find ammo nearby. If you're out in the city when the apocalypse starts and you're surrounded from every direction, you should try to get out alive and not complain about it. You won't always be out in the countryside when it starts, and it just so happens that it's a simulator to allow you to experience what it'd be like. I guarantee you will not be in a reinforced safehouse stocked with guns and ammo and food, away from people and zombies at the time when the apocalypse starts. The randomness is part of the challenge and realism.\nPlay the game how you want to play it. Want to go from house to house, from store to store stacking up on resources and surviving day to day? Go for it. How about finding a good house (or any building) that looks easily defensible, fortifying it and stocking it up with non-perishables while you go out and gather materials for reinforcing the perimeter and starting a farm so you can live off the land? Maybe a mix of both but not heavily relying on either? What about finding as many weapons and as much ammo as you can and killing as many zombies in the shortest amount of time? The possibilities are endless.\nThe Developers are extremely dedicated to the project and have yet to disappoint me in any way. They are friendly and actually listen to what the community wants, and try to satisfy everyone. Of course, the only problem is that the team is rather small which means that they cannot work too fast, but I admire how well they have handled things thus far.\nFrequent updates, with more and more features coming out. I really love the 3D models which were recently added, however I've yet to try the fishing. Features such as multiplayer are already available, and NPC's are planned for the future.\nAn immersing, dark atmosphere centred around loneliness and caring only for yourself. I've yet to play multiplayer and NPC's have yet to come, however currently the game places you in the middle of a wasteland where the only sources of entertainment and good food and the odd book or magazine once in a while. Your character is alone and must survive alone. Grab all the resources you can and run. You're never 100% safe in any given place, no matter how much you reinforce it. You will die eventually, and the only thing you can do is try to live the longest and most fulfilling life possible. The dark atmosphere isn't enough to scare you, however you will develop a bond with your character and every encounter with a zombie which doesn't go according to plan will cause you to jump slightly as there is enough chance in one second of the game to screw up - something you should be terrified of seeing as permadeath is a feature that is heavily emphasized.\nI have yet to encounter any bugs, even after playing the game for a little while.\nAny approach is a good approach, as long as it is executed properly. Continue fighting as the number of zombies increases, and your ammo decreases. Fight off as many as you can, and retreat, then reinforce all doors and windows and attack them from behind with an improvised Molotov cocktail. Push them back and slow them down, while attempting to run away as fast as possible. Lock yourself in a bathroom, board up the door, and drink a bottle of bleach from under the sink. Every action you take will have different consequences and depending on how well you play it out, it'll either get you killed or allow you to live for one more day. Every such encounter increases your knowledge and allows you to play for longer and longer with each playthrough.\nI've never seen a game like it; the uniqueness really caught my eye.\nCons:    Rather monotonous at times, and hard to get into. There is no in-game tutorial and you are forced to learn everything yourself, either through playing or research. The tutorial is going to be implemented again soon, though.\nThe style is not for everyone, and may put some people off. Initially most of the difficulty comes from not knowing how to play the game. Make sure you know what you're buying; there is a free demo provided and a lot of videos and photos that cover what the game is like. Another good idea would be to check the wiki.\nIt's still in development, which is clearly indicated, so the game isn't as good as it will be. However, it's still an extremely excellent game, and is very satisfying to play at this stage of the development.\n\n\nOverall, it the game I'm the most satisfied with buying, and I have never before been this happy to help out a team of developers. The work they do is amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed their game.\nIf you like open-world zombie games focused on survival rather than killing as many zombies as possible, then you should definitely invest in the game (or at the very least try out the demo)\n\n11/10, highly recommend.","July 25, 2014","true","109.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glaucomys/recommended/108600/","glaucomys","Maxwell218","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glaucomys/","140 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor the 90 hours that I've put into this game (Singleplayer Survival Only), I can tell you that this game has a lot, A LOT, of potential. Of course, this game is all about survival, no happy ending, no cure, no nothing, and this is a concept that a lot of Zombie Survival Game out there forgot. Survivalism isn't that threatening in those other games, but in Project Zomboid, things are different. I mean, as soon as you create a game, you can clearly read "This is how you die".\n\nOf course, some people might say that there is no point at all, no goals, no "missions", etc. This is not entirely true, as the point of the game is to create your own stories after all. How will you die? This question as yet to have been answered by you! Also, when I said that this game has a lot of potential, I was referencing to the future features that it has to offer (it's in Early Access for a reason). To begin with, NPCs (not yet implemented) will have a huge impact on the gameplay, since they will bring a whole new meaning to the word fun. Plus, NPCs will be able to give more goals to the player, as he will be able to interact with them in many different ways.\n\nTo sum up, Project Zomboid might be in Early Access for a while, but it will definitely be worth it. From building a community for all survivors to putting them out of their misery when they get bitten by a zombie, Project Zomboid is one of the best, if not the best Zombie Survival Game of all time!","July 11, 2015","true","233.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The development staff has weekly updates to let you know what will be released and what is on the agenda. The gameplay is smooth and fun. This is a survival game at it's best. An immersive medical system and cooking system. Combat is being worked on to contain more moves and animations so it does feel a bit dull right now. The graphics are a top down, isometric look. Your character is customizable down to the skills they possess. As you play the game, your skills will level up and you can add points to certain skills, blunt and accuracy are an example of them under the melee skills. You will die eventually either due to carelessness or unproper planning. The game time can extends to days as your in game time spans years. With the new updates you can watch the world around you deteriorate. Radio broadcasts and in game events will keep you aware of how society is devolving.\n\nPlease buy this game and support these devs if these things interest you. In comparison to other games alpha releases this game ALONE stands the test of time with constant updates and dev to community transparency. This game WILL be updated and WILL become better. It already has a ton of content and will have more in the future from NPCs to new items in game, including cars.\n\n10/10 would survive again for a year and die in the winter due to crop failure in my huge built up fortress","December 29, 2014","true","129.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Threats are all around you, and you will not survive, but the real question is how far will you make it? Thirst,  hunger, sleep deprivation, heat, cold, depression, boredom, sickness, infection, and of course: Zombies. The choices you make will determine how long you will  last, leading to some difficult decision making. The game does a fantastic job of portraying a zombie apocalypse in all it's horror and darkness.\n\nThe zombies are "proper" zombies. That being, slow, shambling, and non-superhuman undead as portrayed in Max Brook's "Zombie Survival Guide" and "World War Z" (The BOOK not the movie!). The threat of infection is real. One scratch is all it takes unless you're lucky. And if you've been bitten, it's game over no matter how much you try and fight it; what's left is how you choose to spend the last few days of you're life. It'll make you think twice before courageously taking on a small horde of zombies with your baseball bat.\n\nSimply by playing the game, you are creating your own story for your character. It's a dynamic world full of zombies and you get to decide what you want to do and what your priorities are. There is lengthy character progression through a skill system, making you're character all the more precious as you invest more time into them. The longer you're alive, the more you'll want to survive.\n\nThe game is still in Alpha, so it's considered incomplete by the developers, meaning there are many more features to come.\n\nI can't wait to see what they add to this game as time goes on. It already feels like a complete experience, so anything new they put in can only add to it.\n\nThis game is worth every penny. Something that I have a lot of difficulty saying about many other games.","March 31, 2014","true","111.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The content planned for the future (NPCs, vehicles, more towns etc.) sounds really promising and I hope the game lives up to it's huge potntial.\n\nI think the problems with this game are that building two-storey houses is too buggy at the moment. Also, the frame rate and resolutution needs to be improved. They do plan to do this soon apparently. That said, the hours I played this game speaks for itself.

Single player's great right now, but I don't recommend multiplayer yet.\n\nMultiplayer's not great yet, because it lacks a speed-time feature. At night time, it's hard to see. If you don't want your character to roam around in the dark, then you have to wait for nighttime to slowly pass. You get to sit and stare as your character stands around in the dark, because your character doesn't sleep and you can't fast-forward. In single-player, this isn't a problem. You get sleepy, go to bed, and time speeds while you sleep. You can also fast-forward time whenever you want to. This means that you can focus on playing, and avoid nighttime. You can also avoid having to sit and wait for rain to stop, too. The developers have been good about polishing the game, and it keeps shining. So, multiplayer will likely be fixed in the future. However, for now, multiplayer's not great.\n\nSingle-player is fun already. The world has a nice sandbox feel to it. You can zoom in close or keep the camera far out, which allows for a nice, customizable view. There are many items to find, and the developers keep adding in more. The map has a large area to explore, and the developers keep adding more to it, too. You can cook, build, garden and, apparently, fish. (I still haven't gotten around to fishing.) Hunting's another new thing.\n\nThe only issue I have with it is that its gotten easy for me, but this is after dozens of hours of playing it. (Once you get into a rhythm with an axe and a shotgun, zombies are less intimidating.) And it's still fun anyway. I'll gather up shotgun shells and corral zombies, because there's a certain joy to thinning out the horde while zigging and zagging between the undead. I'm looking forward to when NPCs are added back in, and for multiplayer to be improved. Overall, this is a good game that keeps getting better.","June 19, 2014","true","415.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is a constant sense of dread and fear that I don't really feel in many other games, which is probably a weird thing to put as a positive point, but trying to survive and thrive with these constant overbearing themes is quite the experience.\n\nThe field of vision system works great, in that even though it's third person you can only see zombies etc that are in the direction you are facing, making some night walks particularly tense when you can hear a zombie creeping up behind you, and turn around to see it biting your arm and making the next few hours a horrible struggle to try and stem the infection (which is pretty much hopeless, I find).\n\nThe feeling of isolation the game brings isn't even lost in the (currently very beta) multiplayer - constantly losing sight of each other in the same way as zombies made for many scary moments when we couldn't find each other. It just shows that games don't need cutting edge visuals to deliver the most authentic experience, for example Silent Hill 1 is still probably the scariest game I have ever played.\n\nThere is still a lot more to the game I haven't even tried, such as the crafting and more advanced cooking, mainly because I'm too busy being paranoid about making sure all my lights are off and curtains are closed. A favourite of mine is peering out of the curtains and accidentally locking eyes with a zombie outside, who will proceed to thump his head against your window until the dull thuds drive you insane enough to go deal with it yourself. Which you should do - it turns out they do break the windows eventually, as I so unfortunately discovered.\n\nAll in all, even in the early access state it's in the game is a great experience. I'm looking forward to seeing what's going to be added. A tenner for a game is never really a bad deal, and if you can pick it up in a sale, then it's a no-brainer. As you will soon be when the massive undead hordes get chased from the cities into your sleepy suburb. Good luck.","February 22, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The current build feels finished, but the game will have SO MUCH MORE when its finished. That being said, this game... is awesome. Singleplayer will give you endless hours of fun, but only if you have patience. Multiplayer is very fun, but i recomend at least playing the tutorial before you jump on some random server (No-one likes a noob who cant even feed themselves). Heres how my first multiplayer experience went down:\n>spawn in\n>begin looting spawn house\n>another player spawns in\n>player asks if i want to team\n>short while later, me and my new found friend head out into the unforgiving streets of Westpoint\n>after looting houses for about 10 minutes, we encounter another player\n>now with the 3 of us, we decide to assault the police station (some dumbass got a horde stuck in it)\n>5 minutes later, our newest friend gets eaten alive by said horde while trying to lead them away from us.\n>after mourning his death for about 5 seconds, me and my remaining friend try to lose the horde chasing us in some houses.\n>i get bit inside one of the houses\n>decide to not tell friend\n>while friend is fixing mouse, i die and become a zombie\n>my zombified self bites my friend\n>friend runs away yelling "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" because i died\n>the end\n\nAs you can see, some crazy ♥♥♥♥ can go down, and this game still has atleast another year and a half of development befor the finished product, so you can amagin how ♥♥♥♥ing cool this game will be.

If you want a fast paced, not too challenging romp through the zombie apocalypse... This is not the game for you and there are friendlier, better-looking alternatives.\n\nBut if you want to play the game that comes closest to simulating what an actual zombie apocalypse would be like, this is for you. This game is TOUGh; the intro states that "there was no hope of survival" and that "this is how you die", and it's spot on. You WILL die, over and over, until you start to learn how the game works, how to take things slowly and steadily, and how to pick your fights.\n\nThe game itself is full of content. It has a deep medical/injury/mood system, a large map (unfinished but still full of buildings to loot and zombies to kill), a working crafting system for everything from a hammer to a wooden house, farming, and a dynamic world which will evolve and change as time passes, with seasons, water and power shutouts, etc. etc., forcing you to change your strategy as you survive longer and longer. But no worries, it will take you multiple attempts to even reach that point.\n\nAlso worth mentioning are the character creation system, where you need to pick negative traits (such as being grumpy, overweight, a coward, etc.) and positive traits (athletic, brave, eagle-eyed...) whose point values even each other out; and the multiplayer which allows you to do everything I've listed with a friend, and which I've found is very playable, even in alpha.\n\nOn top of all of this, the devs are present on the forums and community pages and consistently pump out new content for us to enjoy, which in this world of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t "grab the money and run" or "promise some stuff and then never deliver" or even "straight up lie to customers about the plans you have for the game" early access projects is really something to value. In fact, the devs love the game too, and have even pumped up the difficulty in recent patches, by making zombies more aware of movement and sound around them and tightening up zombie hordes instead of having them all spaced out. They want to make a true zombie survival experience, not some easy, popular but short-lived zombie killing action game, and I think they deserve praise for that.\n\nIn short, the game in its current state is already very playable and full of hours of content, both in single and multiplayer. And at 10 pounds or 15 USD, it's a steal imho.","January 26, 2015","true","32.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

THEN I SAW IT ON STEAM :D\n\nThis is by far one of the best zombie games I've played, ever. Maybe it's cause it's this kind of zombie game I've been waiting for, maybe it's cause the game itself is amazing, maybe it's cause they paid me to say this (loljk)... I'd say the first two. PZ is an open-world zombie game based on SURVIVAL- yes, SURVIVAL, not "HACK SLASH SHOOT BURN EVERY ZOMBIE YEAHHHHH" it isn't one of those. You can TRY to do that, it won't work very well. Almost every imaginable aspect involved in surviving a zombie apocalpyse is included in this game- noise, food, water, shelter, and of course, avoiding and killing zombies. There's a lot of content in this game (most of which I haven't even discovered yet lol) and it still isn't 1.0 yet. Multiplayer will be introduced (even though it's already been released, it sucks, BAD; but don't worry, it'll be fixed) very soon, so you can play with all your friends! And kill random people, yay!\n\nSo if you love survival games, strategy games, and zombie games, I highly recommend this to you. It'll provide you with many, many hours of gameplay. Play alone, with friends, the possibilities are limitless, especially with the mods.

You must brave the elements, weather storms, sickness, boredom, panic attacks, food poisonings, food spoilage, tainted water, and trying to make do without the myriad of other everyday conveniences like refrigeration, healthcare, food and shelter.\n\nZomboid is also grimly fatalistic- you will die. Even the game's opening intro always ends with 'This is a story of how you died.' You may survive, but accidents, bad luck or just plain bad planning can end your life in a heartbeat. Thankfully, the game does not end with death, and you're allowed to create another character in the world, perhaps a bit wiser this time.\n\nThe game features an extensive crafting, building and farming system, already fully implemented, even 'tho the game is in EA. Latest additions also added fishing, and the game world is still growing, with new features such as character classes, new items and areas being added in a steady pace.\n\nMy only major grievance with the game is the inexplainably high ping, even on servers that are not remote from my location. I've seen pings rise from 40 ms to 1000, and on one occasion, even 18k. Hopefully, the devs can finetune the game code for servers and such in the future, allowing smoother multiplayer experiences.\n\nSo far, I've generally played on cooperative and non-hostile PvE servers- the community is nice enough, unlike on most FPS gaming communities, but not free of griefers, player killers or people abusing external voice chat to annoy others. Thankfully, the latter can always be muted, but one should be wary of players coming at you with an axe or handgun, either out of sadistic troll mentality, or interest in the contents of your backpack.\n\nAll in all, the game doesn't offer much interest in the singleplayer department as of yet- the scenarios originally released with the game involving Baldspot and his wife Kate have been removed for now, as have been the NPCs, which would have definitely added more colour to the game world. Still, supposing you can find an adequetely populated server, I guess you can set up a survivalist commune, and fight the zombies (and humans) together, bringing extra fun to the game experience.","March 22, 2015","true","402.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The've come a long way from 2011, the game looks MUCH better and polished, and it's not even done.\n\n* You can pretty much turn the game to whatever you like, if you like classic dumb zombies you can do that, or superhuman fast zombies.\n* Don't let the looks fool you, you can farm and build in this game. Medical attention is very fun since it's not just "drink soda or eat something to restore hp", It actually focuses on the parts of the body that are damaged and require tools to attend to your wounds.\n*Skills are good, but I feel like it's kinda tedious how the XP system works at the moment (just an opinion).\n*The map is HUGE. and there's custom maps. I'm really excited for vehicles cause It's pretty tedious to just run whenever you want to go, and you have to travel several days to other spots of the map.\n*The map actually degrades overtime. Trash accumulates, windows break, walls crack, vines grow over walls and windows, grass starts to grow around the concrete, it's very nice.\n*Multiplayer is fun but it's better to play with friends if you don't play on a daily basis.\n*NPCs were removed but they are working on them again, so you won't be alone when surviving.\n\n\nOverall it's a pretty fun game so far, a couple little bugs and a couple things I'd love they implemented but it's still under development. Devs are cool, they give you every monday a blog post about what are they working on and the news about the next build. It's very much worth the 15 dollars.","May 10, 2015","true","159.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Im really abit at a loss at what to list as an example.\n\nOf course theres cooking with an extensive array of utensils and ingredients. You could drink a bottle of whiskey to get abit happier. Then you could fill that bottle with water to have something to drink when theres no toilet (yup) or sink near. Then you could put that bottle into a plastic bag you found for abit of weight reduction, but then you of course could use only one handed weapons, better to have a backpack. Then when you get hungry you could pour that water into a bowl and if you had flour you could make dough, if you had ramen you put that together and then put it into any near oven. If you dont want the zombos to disturb you you could hang some sheets on the windows and switch of the light, and read a magazine to reduce some boredom while you wait until its done. And theres lots of other interactions like that.\n\nCombat is simple but functional, as are the graphics (abit of Postal 1 and Jagged Alliance) and controls. Inventory management/looting seems complicated at first but its really not if you get a hang of the menues.\n\nIt really seems like a waste that this great framework of interactivity is wasted on yet another "fart around until you die" sandbox instead of being the basis for at least an rpg-lite with at least a few rudimentary goals. But seeing as its exactly advertised as a "fart around until you die" sandbox it delivers, and boy can you fart around.

The've come a long way from 2011, the game looks MUCH better and polished, and it's not even done.\n\n* You can pretty much turn the game to whatever you like, if you like classic dumb zombies you can do that, or superhuman fast zombies.\n* Don't let the looks fool you, you can farm and build in this game. Medical attention is very fun since it's not just "drink soda or eat something to restore hp", It actually focuses on the parts of the body that are damaged and require tools to attend to your wounds.\n*Skills are good, but I feel like it's kinda tedious how the XP system works at the moment (just an opinion).\n*The map is HUGE. and there's custom maps. I'm really excited for vehicles cause It's pretty tedious to just run whenever you want to go, and you have to travel several days to other spots of the map.\n*The map actually degrades overtime. Trash accumulates, windows break, walls crack, vines grow over walls and windows, grass starts to grow around the concrete, it's very nice.\n*Multiplayer is fun but it's better to play with friends if you don't play on a daily basis.\n*NPCs were removed but they are working on them again, so you won't be alone when surviving.\n\n\nOverall it's a pretty fun game so far, a couple little bugs and a couple things I'd love they implemented but it's still under development. Devs are cool, they give you every monday a blog post about what are they working on and the news about the next build. It's very much worth the 15 dollars.","May 10, 2015","true","159.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is how you died.\n\nI've been keeping up with Zomboid for longer than I'd like to think about. When it was first announced and gathering attention, the gaming world was abuzz with a zombie survival game the likes of which we had never really seen done well. The initial game they pumped out was fun and the promises of the game to come sounded like a dream come true for hardcore gamers.\n\nBut as time went on, I lost interest due to slow updates. The game kept progressing, and every year or so I'd check up on it. I was generally impressed, but eventually just felt like there were enough zombie survival games emerging like Dayz that Project Zomboid had lost its chance. Finally, I decided to check its progress out one last time.\n\nAnd I was finally hooked.\n\nThe experience it delivers is one that no other games to date have really offered. This is a true zombie survival horror game. It does not about action. It is not forgiving. You are thrust in the middle of a zombie apocalpyse with nothing but the clothes on your back and must survive any way you can for as long as you can. There is no happy ending here. The game only gets harder, and you will eventually die.\n\nYou create your character picking a profession and using a beneficial/detrimental perk point system, meaning if you want your character to be strong you will have to give something up, such as asmtha or illiteracy. There are tough choices to be made, and many skills that are very useful. There are skills for cooking, gardening, foraging, and of course combat, and you are unlikely to get many of them very high unless you survive a long time. You will have to specialize your character.\n\nIf you leave your oven on, it will burn your house to the ground. But maybe that's a good thing as you lured a horde of zombies to a house far from your safehouse and incinerated them all inside. The simple act of climbing through a broken window can give you an infection leading to death if you are not slow and careful. Running is taboo. Fighting every zombie is a chance of being bit and dead.\n\nThe music is good ambient music that will set the mood, from a quiet slow terror to a banging intense beat if you are running from a herd. The sounds are functional and also quite terrifying. The graphics look nice while being low enough to be able to handle hundreds of zombies on screen and hundreds more off screen lumbering around. One thing that is not as functional is the animations, most of which are decent but I feel the game could use more of them to make things more clear in a game where there is no room for error.\n\nThe game gives you a great amount of customization for your gaming experience, and you can start on a good beginner difficulty to learn how to survive in a safer enviroment or pump up the zombies from Dawn of the Dead to 28 Days Later fast and die quicker. Multiplayer is offered, but at the time of this writing has a long way to go to being something amazing. The potential is there and there are some great encounters to be had with some friends but public servers seem to still be off.\n\nThis game is slow to move, but the developers are good about paying attention to the community and I have faith that if/when they finally deliver this game to it's full form, it will be the definitive zombie survival experience.\n","July 8, 2015","true","204.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is how you died.\n\nI've been keeping up with Zomboid for longer than I'd like to think about. When it was first announced and gathering attention, the gaming world was abuzz with a zombie survival game the likes of which we had never really seen done well. The initial game they pumped out was fun and the promises of the game to come sounded like a dream come true for hardcore gamers.\n\nBut as time went on, I lost interest due to slow updates. The game kept progressing, and every year or so I'd check up on it. I was generally impressed, but eventually just felt like there were enough zombie survival games emerging like Dayz that Project Zomboid had lost its chance. Finally, I decided to check its progress out one last time.\n\nAnd I was finally hooked.\n\nThe experience it delivers is one that no other games to date have really offered. This is a true zombie survival horror game. It does not about action. It is not forgiving. You are thrust in the middle of a zombie apocalpyse with nothing but the clothes on your back and must survive any way you can for as long as you can. There is no happy ending here. The game only gets harder, and you will eventually die.\n\nYou create your character picking a profession and using a beneficial/detrimental perk point system, meaning if you want your character to be strong you will have to give something up, such as asmtha or illiteracy. There are tough choices to be made, and many skills that are very useful. There are skills for cooking, gardening, foraging, and of course combat, and you are unlikely to get many of them very high unless you survive a long time. You will have to specialize your character.\n\nIf you leave your oven on, it will burn your house to the ground. But maybe that's a good thing as you lured a horde of zombies to a house far from your safehouse and incinerated them all inside. The simple act of climbing through a broken window can give you an infection leading to death if you are not slow and careful. Running is taboo. Fighting every zombie is a chance of being bit and dead.\n\nThe music is good ambient music that will set the mood, from a quiet slow terror to a banging intense beat if you are running from a herd. The sounds are functional and also quite terrifying. The graphics look nice while being low enough to be able to handle hundreds of zombies on screen and hundreds more off screen lumbering around. One thing that is not as functional is the animations, most of which are decent but I feel the game could use more of them to make things more clear in a game where there is no room for error.\n\nThe game gives you a great amount of customization for your gaming experience, and you can start on a good beginner difficulty to learn how to survive in a safer enviroment or pump up the zombies from Dawn of the Dead to 28 Days Later fast and die quicker. Multiplayer is offered, but at the time of this writing has a long way to go to being something amazing. The potential is there and there are some great encounters to be had with some friends but public servers seem to still be off.\n\nThis game is slow to move, but the developers are good about paying attention to the community and I have faith that if/when they finally deliver this game to it's full form, it will be the definitive zombie survival experience.\n","July 8, 2015","true","204.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I mean from the configurable settings to the weather and the amount of things you can do in the game, looking after yourself is vital to your survival from depression and boredom to stress & temperature, every aspect of the human condition is counted as a survival mechanism and for you to truly survive & thrive in this environment you must manage all of this effectively, failure to do so results in death, and not just "you die, and then respawn" once you die in this game the whole world is gone, you could call it permadeath, all of your hard work gone, just because you decided to investigate that abandoned police station. (Police stations are dangerous; I did this once, and died almost instantly).\n\nBut that's not all, you have to scavenge for vital supplies such as food, water even rope & weapons, because after a while has passed (6 in-game months by default) water and electricity will be cut off to the town and you are left to fend for yourself. However you can build defences to not only hold off the advancing zombie hordes but to provide sustenance, shelter, warmth & storage.\n\nFood spoils and water becomes tainted, so what do you do? You build makeshift water catchers to provide clean & safe water, find seeds and plant crops in a safe place...look after them and maybe one day, they will flourish into clean, edible food!\n\nAnd to top it all off, updates, and the community, updates on game come out every Monday (They are called the mondoid) usually these don't include any game updates (they're usually once a month) but instead just what they have been working on for the past week, and they are usually interesting!\n\nWhat was bad about the game?\nI can't really think of much that is wrong with this game, other than that there are no NPC's (Non-player characters) and there are also no cars, but it has been confirmed that these things are going to be integrated into the game in the coming months.","December 29, 2015","true","39.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

And I have to say, I do get a little bored everynow and then, this is usually remedied by actually going outside IRL and playing in the woods. Seems Legit.\n\nTHIS IS THE BEST ZOMBIE GAME EVER. I was surfing steam and saw some bad reviews on another game and I wondered if this game had any bad revies ( I want to play some PZ now so Ill be quick-ish). There are a few bad reviews for this game, but if you take the time to actually play the game then read through the reviews:\n\nA: They are all rage reviews\nB: They are all rage reviews\nC: They are all rage reviews\n\nIts that simple...\n\nPZ is a game where you survive a zombie apocalypse, seems simple ; but after falling out of a window and breaking your leg, then getting eaten by zombies trying to get to a clinic, you will realise this game is not for the faint of heart. If you are serious about surviving, this game is for you. I have spent 30+ hours playing and have yet to see the power/water to go out. This can make the game seem redundent. Ask your friends what their plans are for the ZApocalypse and try it out.\n\nNot only is this game deep and makes your work to get anywhere, it shows alot of promise. Although it has been in Early Access for ALONG TIME, this has no effect on how fun the game is, in fact it just shows the devs are "devicated" (insert facepalm here). With talk of NPC's and cars, it's only a matter of time until I will be playing PZ 24/7. I love this game.\n\nMy only issue would be that the game gets a bit redundent. But that only really happens when you try to live in the same house 7 playthroughs straight. Trust me, dont do that. If you want an interesting challenge, make a charecter that you know from a book or TV series. Make sure to put in all of their negatives and positives - Example: Shane from TWD. Im not going to list out all of the traits because this is already long but :P. I spent the part of the 50$ steam card I got to buy KSP on this game. Why? I still don't know. The graphics arent the greatest and all of that, but this game is great.\n\n10/10 would recommend this again.\n\nEdit: There are mods that add rediculous amount of extra stuff to do :P","August 7, 2015","true","147.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"
