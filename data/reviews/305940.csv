So I have been most pleasently surprise by the depth and complexity of this game, which is still in it's infancy. If you want a complete game then buy a complete game, this is not, as it says it is an alpha or beta if you prefer and many things don't exist yet. But if you are a patient gamer who likes to see a game grow and want to support a really good City Builder game in a futuristic setting, than this is the game for you. It is my considered opinion that those who have written the negetive reviews don't understand early access and have bad mouthed this game out of fustration, they are entitled to thier opinions but other then the ones who readily admit it is not far along as they though this game is playable and interesting and I would suggests the nay sayers give it another try\n","August 8, 2015","true","32.8"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","44","48","0","0"

It has a lot going for it, but bare in mind that this is not a game for everybody. What you get here is a vary deep production-chain and population manager. It has long production chains like in the Settler series. For instance just to produce the most basic food product- the seaweed portion you need a ship to bring in the raw sea weed. The ♥♥♥♥ needs a hangar, and a pilot. The hangar needs a director and a technican to maintain it. Then the seaweed needs to be processed. First you need to fatten the seaweed- for that you need a bioreactor plus a farmer of two. Once the seaweed is fattened you need to dry it, that needs another facility and a operator or two. And then you get the most basic food type. Don't get me even started on bread. And the game is a grind. And that can be disheartening at times. You need to invest a lot time into the game to get anything done. And there is a lot of micromanaging. This game is a micromanagers wet dream. You control everything, every individuals workplace, job, diet. The game is also very atmospheric- if you are into chillout music Stellardrone plays in the soundtrack. I'm having a lot of fun here. It is a breathe of fresh air after simple economic games like Anno. So if you are into micromanagment, complex production chains and you are not pulled off by grinding- thant this is a game for you. If you are looking for a quick, easy game- maybe not so much. There is still much that needs to be implemented to the game for it to truly shine- like disasters or research. But it is already playable and enjoyable and you can see where it is going. I think it is worth supporting in early access.","April 26","true","37.6"," 35 of 35 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","35","35","0","1"

At the time of this writing, the devs have a very strong skeleton in place and are working hard to flesh things out and balance the different systems.

No random citazens joining or problems with educating citazens. You can keep a tight control over everyone while slowly getting past the point of just feeding your citazens to slowly and exponentially growing your city. Buildings are customizable to a certain degree to be able to fit within your plots as needed but also function how you need them to be. Grouping parts up in one big plot costs less in the long term, but take up all that space. How are you going to customize anything at any particular point is up to your design? Only downside but also an upside is the slow speed of the game. While it's tougher to snail along at times, you don't have to worry about missing much and have plenty of time to get each thing done. Still a work in progress game, but I'm enjoying it MUCH more than any other city builder I've played. Steep learning curve so check out other reviews and steam guides for better insight on how to start.

The goal of Project Aura is to create a self-sustaining city for survivors of a global climate change disaster. Unlike other city-building games, PA emphasizes the administrative side of running a city - foodstocks, medicines, production of fabrication materials to construct buildings, technology to support said buildings, and the logistical planning for put a functional colony together.\n\nAs far as city-builders are concerned, PA is a unique experience. The administrative aspect of running a self-sustaining city requires much planning, critical awareness of systems and supplies, and expanding when the need or ability arises to combat various challenges facing the colony. In my opinion, PA provides a futuristic image of the post-human era, with the last vestiges of humanity attempting to survive on a now-hostile planet.\n\nI would whole-heartedly endorse Project Aura, as it provides hours of entertainment and challenge. The developers have worked hard at creating a cohesive, complex, and creative world respelndant with motifs of crisis, resilience, and survival. If you want something different from shooters, rogue-like clones, flights sims, or an RPG, check out Project Aura. There's a great community of people playing this game, so you'll join a corps of colonial directors determined to save humanity!","March 20","true","141.0"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","33","35","0","0"

Project Aura seems to be in the process of becoming one of the greats in the genre.\n\nIt's still fairly raw and has issues, both minor and major, but overall it's been very enjoyable. The current tutorials do a good job of showing how to do things, but not what to do or when so the learning curve is a bit steep. I trashed my first 2 attempts to play the game when I realized some assumptions I'd made were wrong. So be prepared to learn as you go and make some mistakes along the way.\n\nThankfully you don't get punished much for making mistakes, buildings can be demolished and 100% of the materials used to build them reclaimed. So if you position something incorrectly or realize the building you built isn't what you needed you can just knock it down and you lose nothing but time.\n\nYour citizens require food and water, but it's no real loss if they go without for a while. The worst that can happen is they leave your city and you just have to wake up some replacements. In fact the only current way to really lose the game as far as I can tell is to never feed your people until they all leave and you don't have enough credits to wake up replacements. There are UI elements for hazard warnings and weather disasters, but currently they don't seem to be implemented so the game world appears to be danger free for the moment.\n\nI can't be sure, but it looks like all the buildings are available from the start and I haven't found any use for a couple of the items you can have your citizens construct. I'm guessing they'll be used in the Technology Research part of the game once that's implemented. The quest system also isn't active so there are no objectives to complete other than seeing how big you can build your city and I haven't found any sort of 'endgame' either.\n\nMost of the materials you need to build things can be purchased using the ingame currency, which is how you'll start out building your city. But once you get some basic infrastructure built you can start collecting resources and making those materials yourself. It can take a while, but that's what x8 speed is for (shift/+ for increasing speed, shift/- for reducing speed).\n\nAt the moment I have 2 key gripes about the game:\n1. There are some UI sound effects that aren't controlled by the ingame  volume sliders and will always play at maximum volume...it's extremely annoying\n2. There's no way to tell your food producing buildings to deliver their goods directly to the Larder so you're constantly having to manually refill it. It's not a big deal for basic food/water because you can produce them far faster than you'll consume them. But it's a major hassle with the special foods because unless you're devoting a large portion of your population to farming there's no real way to keep up with the demand so you're constantly draging and dropping food items like tomatoes and baked goods from your inventory to the larder.\n\nThese 2 issues combine to make the experience just as annoying for your housemates and neighbors as it is for you unless you turn off your sound, which isn't a real loss considering there aren't any warning sirens or voice acting outside the tutorials atm. But the music is nice and the sound effects are good and I hate playing games without sound :(\n\nAt the end of it all though I still recommend this game wholeheartedly to anyone that's a fan of city building and micromanagement games like SimCity, Banished, and Prison Architect. 4/5 stars from me on this and it clearly has potential to become a 5/5 game if they finish it well.","March 24, 2015","true","44.9"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","29","30","0","0"

It's pretty much a bug free environment too,  I was able to play for many hours without any issue.\n\nThere are going to be a lot of risks/challenges when the game is launched,   so it's not your average city-builder at all.   You'll be managing a sinking ship almost,  keeping it afloat through micro-management,  resource management and thinking ahead.\n\nWhen you take into account the road map for what's coming,  then this is a very exciting development,   especially when you consider how alert the developers are,  and how open they are for feedback.\n\nI do recommend others to buy in now and support the game.\n\nIt's well priced for what it currently is,  and I would not be surprised if they put the price up further down the road,  as it becomes a lot more functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 25, 2015","true","8.8"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","25","25","0","0"

It's tricky to work out what to do at the start as the tutorial gives you quite a few things that aren't available at the game start and you have to work out how to get them.  Just working out what you need for basic food takes a while and if you want to start creating the mats for your own buildings...it's not simple.  But then, I like a challenge!\n\nPlayed for 60 days in game time, built everything there is to build and kinda ran out of things to do.  Made enough money to buy everything and expand to the max ... so... waiting for more content I guess.  Only takes a couple of days (IRL) to run out of stuff to do so only buy this if you're in for a long dev lead time.\n\nOne thing the game really needs - the ability to queue jobs.  Sending your spaceship out on a particular recovery mission is great and you can rinse and repeat this as many times as you like but if you want your ship to vary what it does you have to set each task manually.  This becomes a bit of a pain after a while - would be great to be able to queue up 'get seaweed' followed by 'get flora' and 'then go get me some metal waste' etc etc..\n\nOther thing I don't like is when you un-assign a worker you can't remove him from the org window.  Not a stopper but not great either.\n\nLike I said at the start...great potential... :)","June 18, 2015","true","27.2"," 25 of 25 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","25","25","0","0"

Specially for hardcore players.\n\nIt's slightly more slow paced and deep than most of the strategy games in the market, but if you give it a try and get used to it, it has a great charm. First it seems to have subtle layers of depth, then, after a few hours you discover more layers, and then more, and more... limiteless posibilities to customize your colony open up before you: food management, waste management, what to develop, how, what are your priorities, what do you want to produce to survive, what to sell...\n\nStill, since it's not a 100% finished game, there are things that are missing, little tweaks to make here and there.

As of Beta 2, your main goal is to funnel your limited resources into creating a self-sufficient ocean-based colony. There's not a whole lot of bredth to the game yet, but there are still a whole lot of places for you to mess up your resource chains, run out of money, and inevitably sit in your seat watching as your citizens starve.\n\nIf you want a city builder game that holds your hand while you set everthing up- come back later. This game is complicated, the UI is obtuse, and there's very little information on how to play thus far. The tutorials in the game barely touch upon production of necessary resources (fertilizer is the main thing they skip over), and don't cover anything more than how to grow seaweed and allocate workers.\n\nThat said, with a little bit of trial-and-error, most of the core mechanics of the game become obvious, and it isn't terribly hard to set up a fairly self-sufficient farming community. Once you understand how to navigate the UI, everything gets a lot easier really quickly.\n\nUnfortunately, the endgame features are a little sparse, as colony expansion and research are locked off for the time being- but they look like they have a lot of potential. Their planned features page for Beta 3 is pretty encouraging, and I really hope they release a much larger roadmap of what they hope to accomplish with Project Aura, as I'd like to see even more depth to this game.\n\nThe visuals are great (nicely modeled/textured with a very sleek sci-fi aesthetic), but suffers from weird blurring around the edges of various structures (especially the tutorial bot). This will likely be fixed by the final version though, but is a current issue in Beta 2.\n\nThe music is fairly good, but ultimately forgettable. Which honestly is better than an extremely noticeable one, as players will likely sink dozens of hours into this game- and a noticeable soundtrack can quickly become an obnoxious one after a while.\n\nAlso, while not really a review, if you want to see some basic gameplay/how to play, I made a video of Project Aura:\nhttp://youtu.be/L0NnnrnN5yA","January 5, 2015","true","3.4"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","35","42","0","0"

Not bad at all... It took a while to get into and there are some VERY lengthy processes to make things along with very little in game help... (There is some, just not as much as I would like. Perhaps a process tree which shows you what you need in order to get what you want. Select the item from a very long list and the tree would come up beside it)\n\nI think the tutorials need a revamp to better explain things as the 4 available were very short indeed and the last one which shows you how to feed your colony didn't really cover all the bases. The resources needed were handed to you rather than explaining the very lengthy process of obtaining them without buying from the market.\n\nAs an example, to get food being produced, you need to gather organic waste using an aircraft hanger, process it into seaweed and fertiliser in the recycling plant, feed the seaweed with the fertiliser to get fed seaweed which can then be dried to give you seaweed portions and water. A total of 4 processes, spread across 3 buildings... Google had to help me with that and it was the very first thing you need to produce to support your colony!  In the tutorial, you get given seaweed and fertiliser (IIRC). Jump to the main game and lo and behold, no fertiliser available in the market place. Hurumph. GOOGLE!\n\nIt is an early access game though so it will improve... probably.\n\nThat being said, I can see myself throwing a lot of hours at it. It is relatively slow paced (nothing has come along to disrupt my steady growh yet) and so long as you have food production giving you more than you need for your colonists, you have a (somewhat slow) income from selling it off.\n\nThe water is very pretty.","September 13, 2015","true","14.6"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","1"

It has all the elements a city builder micromanagement player could ask for without the clutter of extreme warfare.  Think sci-fi Banished on water, but more complicated.  So many games these days have great developement in city/colony management but you are either put under time constraints or you whole city is devoted to weaponary because you are in a warzone.  Also, so far, there aren't any lame need to pay real dollars for contiued play elements.  It is early access but I hope these money grab elements remain not included - there is a member screen within the game so I'm wary.  If you pay for the game, that should be it unless it's a DLC where you get more game for your money.  Not seeds or something rediculous just to play the game.  I'm assuming at some point climate will play a factor in this game.  That should be interesting.  The graphics are very pleasing and handle acceleration nicely if your system is up for it but it still looks great stripped.  I haven't hit a bug yet and it runs smooth.  So far it seems set on an individual playing field.  You seem to be the only colony.  This may change.  If you are looking for a game to play with a friend, I doubt this one will have that.  Maybe a trade element in the future, who knows.  Anyway, the game is intensly hands on, very addicting, and it isn't even done yet.  Hopefully they don't screw it up because so far I can't stop playing the unfinished version :D.","May 5, 2015","true","35.6"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

Typicly that makes me walk away and not return, but thankfully I was persistant this time and kept doing new city after new city unitl I finally got the tech tree right. Hopefuly, the tutorials will get an overhaul and be made more compleate as the current setup is very lacking.\n\nThe visuals are sub-par compared to other games within this genra and era, but the layout and mechanics does make up for it enough so as not to become a problem. I do like how that the tech tree is rather well spread out, and its made up so you are not fixed into one path, but there are certainly those that are easier to follow than others (for example, I like to make money by spamming water/seaweed. Its low value compared to others, but easy to complete and avalible at game onset). The diversity of the crew that you can recruit is also a nice touch as you need to pair up the best citizen with the job in question. A good idea is also to give the ability to shoehorn in other citizens when your optimal choice is not readily avalible so you still do get room to play if your impatient (I'm a perfectionist so I typicly wait for the right citizen to spawn)\n\nOne of my favorite compontents is the blueprints for building contruction. It gives you a lot of versitility early and late game. To start you can keep things small but later on when you want to start building mega-complexes to limit staff needs (have one director instead of four, and only two workshops instead of four). Plus altering existing bluprints does not affect existing constructs which can be very handy. I would like to see the blueprint areas to expland slightly by a few more squares, but that is more of a nice touch than a requirement.\n\nAnother component of the game that I very much enjoy is the recycling theme. While its a great nod to enviromentalisim, it does play in a huge part of the mechanics of the game. To start with you rely heavily on money, but once you get your infastructure up, you rely on cash less and less as your ability to produce your needs rise. Additionally, very much of what you build for your city is recyclable, allowing you to nuke-n-pave your city as you learn the game and expand without signifigant punishment as (at least in easy mode) you get 100% of your materials back.\n\nMy biggest complaint, which may be fixed as the game develops, is the pacing of the game early on. It can take a large amount of patience to get your colony self-sufficent in the early stages until your able to produce food and plastic(or)metal on a sustainable scale. One reason is that your still reliant on having a cash income to which you can only gain by selling what you produce, but another hangup is being able to awaken the right staff at any given time. Right now, your randomly presented a list of staff that can be awakened to join your colony from a list of one to a dozen, and quite often I found myself waiting for a technitian or director to pop up just so I can get a building to even be funtional. Yes I could have pluged in other staff, but as I said above I am a perfectionist. What I would like to see is the ability to force-select a particular junior citizen but at a high cost so one does not have to wait for the RNG to give up your need.\n\nOverall I do belive that once polished it will be a fantasic game and for those looking for something a little different than the typical city-builder and is looking for a challenge, its a good game to pick up. I hope the makers will continue to give us updates to enjoy. Be warned, it can be quite a timesink once you get hooked into it.","April 21, 2015","true","151.7"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","4"

And every time I remember why I love it and spend the next 10+ hours playing it nonstop. This game is the pinnacle of resource management games, and will be even better when all features are implemented. But even if development stops tomorrow it'd still be a game well worth the (scrolls down) $16.99. I thought I remembered paying $20 for it, and it was worth every penny. I highly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys balancing inputs and outputs of materials, building ratios, population management, and any other types of administrative gameplay. I loved Sim City (originals, not the crappy 2013 one), I love Cities Skylines, I love Factorio, and if you like those games too then you will enjoy this one.\n\nDevelopment is continuing, and the dev(s?) is always very quick to respond to suggestions/requests on the forums, which makes me more willing to contribute.\n\nGiven that it's early access, unimplemented mecanics don't really count as cons.\n\nThe only real con is that there is an unusually high barrier to entry. It probably took me a good two hours to figure out all of the mechanics and UI tricks to get to the point where I didn't want to do something and have no idea how to do it. But the depth of the game is comparable to the amount of time it takes to learn. Nobody sits down and understands how to play Europa Universalis IV or Crusader Kings II in the first two hours. This game is to city management as those games are to 4X Strategy.  In other words, the best and most in-depth.\n\nThat being said, pretty much all of the keyboard shortcus that you would want are there. It's even pretty easy to figure things out once you realize that you can probably do what you want if you hold shift or ctrl while pressing the button.\n\nLastly, one thing I love about this game (but could see being off-putting for other city builder liking types) would be that there is very little layout management. Oh, there's a lot of nit picking you can do with exactly how to shape the buildings in the plot size, but mostly the game comes down to the fact that you don't spend a lot of time designing your colony. Rather, you spend your time running it. If you love building roads then this game isn't for you. If building roads and finding the most efficient layout is a sometimes fun but mostly tedious process (as it is for me) then this is the game for you.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend it. Buy it. I hope this game gets big, because it deserves it.","March 26","true","62.7"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

Only really has a sandbox mode in its current state, and even on easy mode (starting with twice as much money) the start of the game is about as interactive as a "clicker game" of setting up a few buildings, hireing people and appointing them jobs and then waiting ages until you can afford anything new because the start of the game you make money at a snails pace and everything is fairly expensive.\n\nAlright, with all the (important)negitives out of the way (there are a few more small negitives, but I was more concerned about the bigger things), this game is a fairly interesting game that definitly shows some depth to the management.  It's not to disimilar to factoria where at the very start you have to do everything by hand and it is very slow going but as you get more built up you can start to automate more and more things. Again biggest complaint of being how long it goes at a snails pace before you start to be able to do more interesting things.\n\nIn the current state would I say the game is worth $17?

It does a couple things really well (and a couple of things not-so-well), but ultimately doesn't really have any charm. There's no real objective other than "survive", but surviving never really feels like a struggle until you hit about 50 colonists and morale becomes a gigantic issue out of nowhere (colonists either die to poor health from not enough food/water or if you fix that problem they become rebels from poor morale due to not enough tier 2 food stuffs). The gap in difficulty between tier 1 food and tier 2 food is astoundingly high and feels like one of the biggest flaws in the design of the game's supply chain. It's way too hard to recover seeds, plant and grow said seeds, ensure you have new seeds left over from the previous crop, etc. It requires a fair amount of micromanagement, and inevitably everything goes horribly wrong while you're paying attention to one aspect of the game and another goes kerblewy. You could play the game on pause, but that would only be more tedious than the game already tends to be.\n\nUltimately, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was on a never-ending quest to get to the next tier of item, which would require progressively more micromanagement to sustain.

Obviously since it is early access you should expect bugs and incomplete features. Currently the game is playable but is not near completion. The tutorial is in so you will not have to struggle to figure out the mechanics yourself. If you are not prepared to deal with bugs and changing features though i would recommend waiting until launch.

This game shows great promise in the simulation/colony-building genre. As with most early access games, this game has quite a number of features lacking and it does not have about half of its major content, which should be released soon when it hits beta 3.\n\nWhat hooked me into this game was the intricate economy system and the production workflows which is affected by the differing skill levels of the colonists you awake from cryosleep, which are in some ways similar to games like Anno 2070 and the likes. The game is also pretty challenging and that is where hardcore fans of this genre will not be disappointed, as the default difficulty will already present a decent challenge, not to mention that there are still 2 more difficulty levels after that.","January 13, 2015","true","68.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

I've also viewed a gameplay video and decided to buy it myself since its only about 6 bucks here.\n\nAt the moment it appears to be in a very... very raw state indeed to the point of being barely playable.\n\nTwo major issues encountered right at the main menu - title music gets so loud at some point that it almost hurts your ears while type font is pretty close to being unreadable and hurting your eyes. Assaulting a player at two fronts simultaneously in the first couple of minutes is not a good start.\n\nI've launched the tutorial and found it decent enough for an alpha. The graphics were quite pleasant, especially shield animation and rain outside said shield. I wish the were more "elements" outside like acid rains, snows, thunder strikes, radiation or at least a sun, but the world seems to be bare at the moment - its just ocean and rain all around you. Night and day cycle doesn't exist either though shadows appear to be moving along. At this point i've also encountered a lighting bug (everything went dark) which was fixed when i switched off anti-aliasing (its not a major issue for an early access game, just mentioning it for others who might encounter same bug).\n\nWhen i got to the actual game it reminded me of Capitalism and Capitalism Lab because of the constant micromanagement it involves. It also became apparent that tutorial was completely useless and did not cover even 1/10 of the information you need to start playing. If i hadn't seen the gameplay video on youtube i would not have known how to play at all. Tutorial didn't even mention how to speed up the game (shift and numpad + by the way) which is essential if you don't want to wait for hours to fabricate the stuff you need.\n\nThen there's a fabrication process itself which relies completely on your micromanagement skills - you'll have to manually start the process often since you simply won't have enough resources to put it on several cycles at ones. It would've been swell if you didn't have to wait for an essential "fertilizer" for several minutes to get seaweed rations and tomatos which also take quite a lot of time to make. At the very least they could've made fabrication process completely automatic so it would craft the items without needing to constantly start the process manually even if you don't have enough resources at the moment.\n\nTutorial doesn't even explain how can you get that fertilizer by the way, so i had to search forums where you are being directed to wiki which is currently "under works". Even putting food inside a menu or placing buildings is a chore since sometimes your clicks do not register properly for some reason.\n\nBuildings can be made into templates, which basically consist of an entrance, main factory or house and additional modules. I like this idea i just wish that popup windows been more responsive and text more readable. Right now its incredibly frustrating to make those templates and buy needed resources on the market (also not explained in the tutorial) as you can barely see what you are doing.\n\nThe last part of this game involves "unfreezing" colonists so you can use them as workers/directors/technicians at your plants which would've been an amazing feature if you could actually select them yourself instead of relying on a "roulette" style of getting them, where you get them at random and might end up with a lot of useless mouth's to feed later on. Its your colony - shouldn't you be able to select whomever you want to settle it? Perhaps making it harder and more expensive to unfreeze different skills and levels of colonists would've been a better idea.\n\nOverall - the game is pretty raw even by the early access standards. It can be compared to "war for the overworld" in being barely playable and not exactly fun at the moment. Slapping it with an "alpha" tag would've been appropriate.\n\nI really want to like this game and i hope that i will change my mind when or if this game is finished but right now i can't recommend it.","January 7, 2015","false","2.8"," 82 of 141 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","82","141","3","6"

Pixel Quality Games have hit the balance of micromanagement and survival difficulty perfectly, and created and extremely addictive game. My only criticisms are that some of the mechanics are unclear, and many of the menus are difficult to navigate. However, Pixel are welcoming all player feedback and I am sure these minor issue will be finessed in later updates. I can't wait to see the final shape of this game and will continue to play along throughout its development.\n\nProject Aura is the first venture for Pixel Quality Games, and has received widespread community support through Steam Greenlight. Aura is a survival/strategy game currently in Early Access. I am a big fan of the concept behind this game. The developers are aiming to make an engaging gaming experience, while conveying a message of sustainability, and climate change awareness. In support of the message behind the game, the devs are also contributing 2% of all game earnings to environmental causes that will be selected through voting, on social networks.\n\nAt sometime in the 21st century, global warming multiplied by human activities was responsible for the extinction of most of the life on Earth. Those who survived built floating cities on the ocean surface. Within each city the survivors slept in cryo-preservation, awaiting a time when they could awaken and rebuild.\n\nThe player is in charge of one such floating city, and must build the structures required to house and support the newly awakened survivors. All of the building materials required can be purchased from the market or gathered and recycled through various colony structures. Players are also responsible for assigning each survivor a job in the colony, and must take into consideration the natural aptitude of each person.\n\nFood rationing must also be managed throughout the game, and players who do not construct a food production line early on, will inevitably watch as their colonists slowly starve. I had a great time building structures and gather resources, and it is very satisfying reaching the point of colony self sufficiency.\n\nAura is in the first stages of Early Access, so making a colony self sufficient and then maintaining its population growth is all that's on offer at the moment. Even with these limited mechanics I got hooked easily on this title and I can't wait to see the inclusion of, research goals, quests, city energy shield management and many other mechanics in the final release. There is an in game tutorial included with the Beta, but it is a bit bare bones, so I recommend reading the forums before starting, as some of the key bindings are not obvious but are needed to facilitate the experience.\n\nFor my full review and other delicious content see Glitch","January 9, 2015","true","6.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

If you never played a game that is in early access Beta and do not want to be bothered by it's "incompleteness", at present this game is not for you. Remember this game is an early acess Beta and not a publisher Beta. There is a difference between those two concepts.\n\nYou have most likely read the other user reviews and maybe even read some of my postings about the current game build and it's balancing issues so I won't go into game specifics. I would need to highlight that there is a steep learning curve when playing this game as though there is a tutorial, it's very basic. It does not cover basic "early game" concepts like resource gathering, production of building materials, and energy/maintenance management. Research and tech upgrading has not been implemented as of yet, as with a host of other game features.\n\nFor now the game is a sandbox where you can just really expiriment with "Tetris" style buiding template design, resource gathering, and resource management. This game, as of right now, requires you to micromanage your colony and it's associated resource gathering and production. Through in the fact that you will need to mind your energy reserves as each building and production of materials requires both energy points and maintenance points, which all buildings will require and fight over.

A very intricate and complicated one.\n\nGranted, a very interesting one too, given that it's still EARLY ACCESS.\n\nBut I can't see the final game to be any more than this.\n\nI can't "feel" the background of the story. It's supposed to be about the "survivors" of the mother of all climate changes, but then right from the get-go, you find out that there are...corporations to trade with. Uhhhh....\n\nThere goes the backstory.\n\nSo apparently, human economy and industry outside your domed colony has survived all these years that the colonists spent in cryo-stasis.\n\nWould be nice if we could have a backstory to these "corporations" that fit in with the rest of the backstory. How the heck did they survive all these years? Who the heck were their clients that they did business with? It can't be just the survivors in Project Aura. They were all asleep until now.\n\n\n\nSo, like I said, it's nothing more than a very intricate and complicated "production line" type of game. Your first moves would probably be to "buy" a cargo plane and materials to build it's hangar and awaken the right kinds of colonists to operate this facility, so you could go out of your dome to look for raw materials. Once you have food and water self-sufficiency, you'd probably aim to built some kind of industry, or expand your food production capabilities. Whichever, at this time, your concern would be to sell stuff that you acquire/manufacture. Recycling within your colony is given a premium. You even get to recycle your colonists' #1 and #2. You send out your planes to gather all sorts of garbage, and turn them into something useful.\n\nIf you're into this type of games, then you'll love this game. I can't say that I am into this kind of game though. I do find it quite interesting, but sooner or later, it may just end up like how Banished ended up in my Steam Library.","June 22, 2015","true","38.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dlcoates1/recommended/305940/","dlcoates1","[IJWTB] DLCoates1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dlcoates1/","146 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirstly, for a bit of a back story (Feel free to skip to the actual review):\nI originally noticed the game on steam greenlight back in February of last year. It seemed interesting enough, so I supported it. The next day, I logged on and noticed it had been fully supported. Ok, so now the wait. Pretty soon after, I noticed that about 3 minutes after I logged in one morning, an announcement was posted that their website just went up and preorders were now available. Keep in mind during the wait between, videos and such were posted as teasers. Within 3 seconds of the announcement going up, I was already on the purchase page clicking order (I was actually the first to preorder the game). After ordering, and checking the timeline, the wait was on. Then after almost a year later, the day finally came when keys were being sent out. I had a problem receiving my key at first, however it was quickly sorted out. Shortly after it came out I imediately started playing to learn as much as I could about it, and have used that knowledge to help develope the Wikia for it along with Nomeg.\n\nNow for the actual review:\n1:) Tutorial\nAfter initially playing on Beta 1 (Before steam early access), I noticed the tutorials were a bit too quick. They didn't cover everything in Beta 2 (They still don't, this should be improved later on). You were able to fly though them all in about 10 minutes. The graphics are excellent, even on the lowest settings (Which I play at simply for recording purposes). It covered most of the controls in game very well, as well as a few other details which are very handy. One thing that they didn't seem to cover for the actual sandbox mode, is how to get certain objects such as fertilizer. After playing around for a bit, I was taken back to the employment tutorial, and I realized that all buildings have employment setups (This includes the residential buildings). With that in mind I was able to start production on fertilizer, however it's a slow process and the the tutorial also didn't go over how to speed the game up, and still doesn't (Again, should be updated later on). Other then the few things it doesn't show you how to do, it was an enjoyable experience.\n\n2:) Main Game (Sandbox mode)\nUpon the launch of the sandbox mode, You are taken into a blank "Atlantis" looking platform center. At this point, it's easy to become confused and make it seem like you were robbed out of about $15. However, after playing around enough, I was able to find the market place and find the objects I needed to purchase in order to start on residential housing. From there, I focused on getting a steady steam of items in work for my colony to self sustain itself. Doing this was a bit tricky, as the tutorial also doesn't go over how the production cycles work, how to maximize production cycles, or even tell you what buildings can do what. The building menu lists the name of the building, however not what it does or needs (excluding materials, it does show this, I meant as in worker types, etc.). The layout could use a bit of a change to include a description of what the building does and such in my opinion. Another thing I noticed is that sometimes the errors were a bit buggy (before the hotfix) and would show in spanish, even if the game was set to english. At points, there were also times were I was confused why there are still things in the current version that shouldn't be there (Since they aren't fully working, turns out this was to save time for the next release) and why certain things weren't working such as the shields or extra cargo storage for ships. In the current release, the risk factor tends to skyrocket at points, and will sit at 100% even though the system that's being developed for it (Can't tell you guys what it is, but you're going to like it) isn't implemented just yet. There were also a few other bugs that are there, but overall, nothing that greatly effects the gameplay itself. Now while the game does just toss you in with minimal help from the tutorial (at the time of this review), and some may give it negative reviews because of that, keep in mind there were other games that did the same thing and turned out to be highly supported. Games such as Life is Feudal and Banished do the same thing. Now, please keep in mind as an early access beta game, I am basing my review off of the gameplay itself, not anything else since this is how games at this stage should be rated.\n\nGraphics: As a laptop user, it's hard for me to play games at max settings sometimes. This game can be hard on my computer from time to time, especially while recording. That being said though, even on the lowest settings, the graphics are still very well done, clean, crisp, and smooth. I've tried changing the settings, and between High and Low settings, there is very minimal difference from what I could tell aside from the animations and extra particles. 10/10 for graphics.\n\nSound: The sound at times can be annoying, particularly when in the main menu, or when dragging objects around from one place to another (loud annoying base sound, rip headphone users). There is also a lack of ambient sounds, however this will be added later on. For now though, there is a very nice background album, very reminiscent of kerbal space program. Given the futuristic theme to the game, the music fits in well for it. 7/10 on sound.\n\nGameplay: The overall gameplay isn't bad. It isn't necessarily good, however it isn't bad. While it could use some improvements and will be receiving some, the current core gameplay tends to leave you feeling like it needs something more. As for what, I'm not sure, we will have to see on a future update. The gameplay is smooth, however due to the lack of what the tutorial teaches you, it's also a bit challenging. It adds a nice mix for a while, until you get the hang of the game, which then leaves you feeling empty and at times, bored. It has a nice blend of micromanagement to it, and an overall decent feel. Most of the GUI is well designed, although as I mentioned earlier, some of it could use a redesign especially when it comes to the construction menu. I will give the gameplay a 7/10 as well. As I stated, it could use some improvements and I know some are coming, however as I stated based on the current gameplay it's decent. Not bad, not good or great, but it's playable, and enjoyable for the most part.\n\nWhy I recommend this game:\nLet me put it to you like I did for NoBull and a few others when they asked me what this game is like. If you like Banished, Anno 2070, SimCity, or X-COM, then you will like this, because the basis is like Banished, meets X-Com, meets Simcity in a sense with an Anno 2070 plot. Or as NoBull reworded it, it's like Banished and Anno 2070 had a baby and this is that baby. It currently has the potential to become a great game, given enough support and feedback. The devs are constantly talking to players, getting their opinions, and working with people when they have problems with bugs or other problems. It runs like a dream on low end machines unlike other city builders or survival simulators, yet that maintains clear, crisp HD look and feel. If you manage to brush aside the little bugs and issues with the current version, the gameplay is very enjoyable, and is easy to play for hours on end (So much so that you will probably lose track of time). Also some of you may wish to wait to purchase it until it becomes more stable, however I would like to remind you that playing with bugs may be worth it in the long run, since we all know after games come off early access you will be spending more money on it (Which for some may not be a problem, however I am addressing the ones that can't always afford to do so).\n\nOverall, I give the game a 8/10 rating.","January 9, 2015","true","8.7"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

This is a building game that offers one linear path in order to accomplish anything. There is no variation and you can customize very little, other than how things look a little bit. This is a developer in my opinion who needs to spend a little bit of time playing Banished to get an idea of how to make a game feel like you are making choices for your city building survival. The illusion that you are in control of anything is based on when you choose to implement your citizens but it ends there.

Yes, I know it's early access at this point and it's not done, but I do want to make some constructive criticisms.\n\nFirst off, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around the game concept and feel it needs some refining.  The premise behind the game is that a future society is in a cryo-stasis and is using technology to allow someone (you) from the past to restore their society and "wake them up" and begin the process of repopulation and restoration of life on the planet.  I don't get why only certain types of classes of personell are available at some random time.  If they're all in cryo, what's the problem with getting access to them?\n\nAnd what's with the stores?  If eveyone on the planet is in cryo, who am I buying from?  It would make more sense to me if there was a cache of materials and that's all there is, the rest I have to procure on my own.\n\nThus far orders given to buildings to produce are not repeating.  The production rates are varying for each shelter so once a resource is found to be short, the building just stops.  You're constantly having to go back to buildings to check on their status...  down right annoying.\n\nAnd finally, the remaining aspect of the game is akin to watching paint dry.  It's nothing more than an animated spreadsheet at present and needs something more to make it entertaining to play.","March 22, 2015","false","5.2"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","15","34","0","8"

They have added a lot of features and different things, giving it a just massive collage of stuff and even harder to understand some aspects. Now some aspects are very easy! But its potential as a game is very high they just ruin it in some functions.\n\nThe Graphics are great, my main criticism is it needs to not be calculator looking. It has great potential, just needs to tone down on all the technicality and make it more basic of a game, and get rid of all the calculator theme for the numbers, its ugly.\n\nIll change my review once I see some progress.","October 30, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","1"

While I do enjoy playing, it has a long ways to go and would not recommend this to the average person. Most of this review points out negative parts of this game but I will say I enjoyed it and hope the dev continues to give this gem some love it deserves.\n\nMy first 5 hours of gameplay was restarting the game multiple times learning from my mistakes with the lack of information given or intuitiveness of the game. There is a voice interactive tutorial and F1 for help screen but it's not enough for you to really get started. You will need guides or to watch lets plays which means you;re going to have spoilers instead of discovering the game for yourself. I really hate it when game require a wiki. I just do.\n\nThe first issue is early game every building is unlocked and are game over landmines because they are useless...\n\nI built a recycling center only to find out it had no use. Later I saw on youtube a guy bought organic waste to process so I built it again in another game and sure enough the market didn't sell it for me. Money down the drain.\n\nI built the garden thing. It wanted apple seeds yet the market only had tomato seeds. It took forever fiddling around, looking at things in the market, wondering if I had the building setup correctly to find a small gear icon to change what a building can produce. A+ tutorial.\n\nI built the lowest tier housing to find out you can't produce enough food (hard mode) but block housing does alright. So why are the basic houses even in the game?\n\nBuilt the medical station because all my guys were at 50% health and didn't want them to die. Turns out I didn't need one. First time I've ever played a game where if you're at 50% health don't worry about it, it's considered average health, not half way dead.\n\nBuild the second type of research building. Again a waste of money because things like invention cards aren't in the game but we will let you wast money on the building itself.\n\nNext issue is things are in the game that aren't usable. I already mention the second research building being useless. At the top of the screen are research points. I'm trying to learn the ins and outs of this game I don't need to discover parts of the main UI has info of no use in the current version of the game. I click on tech button and it says coming in beta 3. Don't put this stuff in the game if it has no use whatsoever.\n\nNext issue is the start of the game is a grind and not in a fun way. The type of grind on mobile games where you come back in a few hours. Even at 8x speed getting some cash to advance takes forever. Mandatory 2 to 3 hour grind when starting a new game to even gather a pittance of cash to be able to do anything with it. I leave teh game running for 20 minute periods while I go do something else. That reminds me of mobile, not pc gaming. I like a challenge but not the wait times. Give us a x16 and x32 speed.\n\nHad game crash after 2 hours of play from my last save. Lost all progress from population 50 to 150. I'm sorry but I am done with this grind fest game. Making things take forever is not fun or challenging. Makes me not want to play again.","August 8, 2015","false","39.6"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","3"

At the moment managing things is to much of a pain unless your really ready to dedicat yourself to it and I was not. There are a few parts I could recomend, its aesthetics for one are a very good choice and I feel limiting the space you can work with would provide a fun challenge.

You'll learn what most of the buttons do but not the overall picture. They show you how to set up the *second* production step for basic food (raw seaweed+fertilizer->food rations), then dump you into the game. Good luck figuring out where you're supposed to get those ingredients to start with.\n\nThe graphics are surprisingly good for this type of game, but it's only skin deep. The camera controls are finicky and won't let you zoom out enough to get a decent panorama view. Buildings look interesting and many have cool work animations, but there's almost zero information conveyed. The salvage planes flying in and out are pretty cool; now if only I could distinguish between the three types, or what materials they're carrying. Even the platforms that you expand onto lack clarity. You have to build the floor and the power system separately (again, something the tutorial and help screens fail to explain). The difference between an unpowered platform (that you can't build on) and a powered platform (that you can) is a thin line around the edge that glows red.\n\nThe UI is your worst enemy. You'll find yourself clicking through the same menus over and over again because the important controls are hidden behind three layers. Meanwhile, there are eight top-level buttons that have hotkeys. These include three rarely-needed status/upgrade menus, one temperamental and out-of-theme building menu, and two menus for features that *aren't implemented yet*.\n\nThere's no good overview menu. It's hard to even manage your inventory to see what items you have and what you need; forget about seeing the flow of production in your colony. You can't even see whether your buildings are working or not without carefully mouse-overing each one. And if you do see something is stopped, you'll still need to click through to figure out why. Did it run out of input materials? Did you forget to click the "run forever" button? Did you click that button, but not the "restart when new materials are ready" button?\n\nAnd if you forget what this building is even producing, don't worry, that's an extra click. On each production line.\n\nAs previously mentioned, key game components are still missing, notably the research system. This actually wouldn't be a big deal except that the system is half-implemented. So you can building research labs and produce research tokens (color-coded science items), but then the only thing to do with those tokens is sell them on the market.","June 7, 2015","false","20.9"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","1"

Here's my main gripe. After 6 hours, I think I finally figured out how to start a colony.  Which isn't bad; I don't mind complexity.  And AURA is definitely complex.\n\nThe problem is it crashes a lot if you switch between programs (alt+tabbing).

It's extremely slow and boring. It feels like nothing happens. Increasing speed doesn't help game still feels dead.\nIn other city sims you see people, traffic, events.. here nothing happens.\n\n\nThere is a basic tutorial but limited to essentials, after that you are on your own so you have to learn it the hard way by playing again and again until you figure out how everything works. Some of the functions are disabled for beta (e.g. research)\n\nNo help, no info tips, interface is broken, several panels around screen for no apparent reason. Things that should be together are apart. Several unknown stats. Numbers and numbers..\nBut if you want to check how much money you have, you have to open your storage panel!\nColors are mostly white and grey not just the interface but the whole game..\n\nCreating a colony is a very slow process. Production is micromanagement nightmare.\nYou start with very basic, the food, you need to buy, build, employ lots of stuff and citizens to produce the most basic food.\n\nEvery building needs a director which comes from colonist pool the "Vital Reserve" they are random so if he is not there you wait or exchange one of the colonists for the one you want at a price.\n\nAfter director you need to buy blueprints for production, e.g. Seaweed fattening and Seaweed drying blueprints. And of course you need farmers and operators in each blueprint.\n\nAnd finally you need resources to produce which you have to buy from the market or get them from Recycler another building more blueprints, more citizens etc etc.\n\nIf you need to produce something more complicate it becomes a real nightmare, you need lots more buildings, blueprints and to start producing item A, you need B and C, but for B you need D and F similarly for C.... it's just crazy.\n\nThis game is no fun at all.. it's masochism...\n\nI'm very experienced in strategy and city sim games this one feels undeveloped, slow, unprofessional, boring.\nIt could be improved a lot if production is simplified, interface redesigned, and put some spirit into it, something to keep you interested.\n\nIn this state the game is terrible, I regret for buying it.","May 10, 2015","false","13.7"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","3","17","0","0"

Sadly what I found was a game touted as Beta when the game barely qualifies as an Alpha.\n\nThe first black eye comes in the tutorial system, not only is it short(which to some may be a blessing)but also entirely inadequate for teaching you the game. Some people like going in blind, but you game should at least the absolute basics, which it kinda does and doesn't.\n\nNext sucker punch is no rebindable keys or even a listing of what the keys do. I understand it's beta, but that kind of thing takes all of five minutes to do.\n\nNext up is the performance...oh my the perfromance. The game is not high activity, high resulution and could easily pass for a game made between 2005 and 2007. I know optimization is typically the last thing dev teams do, but the fact that a game as bland looking as this tanks a 980 with no problems leaves much to be desired. Also after the review I noticed the game eating up 4.3 GB of ram...I can run 4 mmos at the same time and it doesn't eat up that much(that much ram for basically ♥♥♥♥ all going on).\n\nThe next problem is everything is missing, aside from the fiddly micromanagement of the colonists and the builtings, there is nothing else to do. Four different systems are missing from the game(Yes I know, Beta is beta) but, it leaves it bare bones and boring. It doesn't qualify as a beta if more than 50% of the games functionality is missing(in this case 75% or more is AWAL).\n\nLastly, mechanics. Colinists drop jobs randomly without telling you, clicks don't register properly sometimes, stupid corperation system that makes the game feel like I'm playing some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cow clicker mobile game. The game also runs at a snails pace early on AND doesn't run in the backround at all(also windowed mode is busted slightly). Top this off with getting the right job roulette at the right time makes the game more a test of your iron patience than skill.\n\nHonestly you can get civ 3 complete for 5$ now or even get civ 4 on steam duringa sale for around 10-15$. As of now the asking price of 15$ is too much for a game that is basically a very bare Alpha.\n\nMaybe when they get some of the other systems working will it be worth taking a look at, but for now there are better things to spend your money on.\n\nthe video review can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83owE7vPZGs","January 10, 2015","false","14.2"," 12 of 41 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","12","41","0","6"

However in it's current state I CANNOT recommend paying for it.\n\nSome feedback I would give to the dev from the time I've wasted on it so far:\n- "Are you ready?" confirmation is redundant.\n- If you're going to have a time scale (cycles/days), and give the ability to adjust the game speed, then the passing of time should be linked to the adjustment of game speed. It would probably have meant I wouldn'tve ended up falling asleep at the keyboard. Also, letting the player know that 'cycle' basically equals a game hour would have been a good thing. Also (again), when you do get the link between adjustment of game speed and the games actual speed fixed, I'm thinking there'll be a few players (I'm one of them) who'll want faster speeds than x4. x10 would be good. Perhaps even faster, I'll have to see what it's like at x10.\n- Why can't I have maintenance modules separate to other work modules and then link them so that one maintenance module can be applied to multiple work modules?\n- Why am I applying multiple transport modules to the same pad? Why can't one transportation module apply to all buildings on the same pad?\n- The degree of experience of employees affects the rate at which the module/part works, and also degrades. In which case, why can't I expand the building, after it's already been laid down, with additional module/parts for the ones that are falling behind?\n- If I'm told there is 6 new people available to wake, then there should be 6, not 4 or 3. And yes, I did check the different tabs for the differing experience levels.\n\nNow, hopefully the dev has plans to adjust the above in their roadmap. But above all else, until the point in time where the adjustment of game speed also affects the passing of game time, I CANNOT recommend this 'game' to anyone.\n\nBeing so bored that I'm falling asleep is a sad indictment on it's current state.","March 16, 2015","false","28.6"," 4 of 23 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","23","0","2"

I have already played for 80+ hours, and the content that is meant for play time such as quests and missions are not even implimented yet.  So I hope to get my play time well over 200 hours when those hit the release shelf.\n\nThe progress seems to be a bit slower than most alpha titles, but its obvious they are working hard and most of the efforts are in the tasks that we do not see as players.    I would rather have the game made on a task by task approach than just publishing stuff new every few weeks to keep the nay sayers happy about when the next update.\n\nGetting an update that is solid over how much it adds to the game seems to be the attitude of PQG.\nNow from personal experience you can never be satisfied with the state, so for them to pump out the updates they have put out with the massivly low amount of game bugs and glitches, I say keep on guys.\n\nThe only bug I have really EVER!!! had with this game was no audio, but that has been solved, so now I really have nothing to complain about other than mabye things like I wish you did this instead type of changes.","July 27, 2015","false","92.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Don't get me wrong, it's understandable and not too hard to figure out, but still not pleasant to work with.\n\nMultiple menus are generally required to perform any action, and basic actions require more individual steps than required.\n\nThe actions of your colony don't happen right in front of you.\n\nIt seems like there's unecessary micromanagement without adding enough interesting depth - you're planning out every detail of your colonists lives and organization\n\nThe build space is fairly inflexible and doesn't expand organically\n\nAn example of several of these problems happens when you need to feed people, you might need to purchase something from a market place, then drag it from inventory to a larder, then use the larder to design a meal. An alternate would just be having colonists eat what they need from inventory. But, basically every other aspect of the game suffers from this problem.\n\nOverall, if you're going to play a colony sim, try something else","June 5","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
