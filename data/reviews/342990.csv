"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Itaros/recommended/342990/","Itaros","Itaros","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Itaros/","268 products in account","Very nice adventure game from 2010, but it is quite different from current flagships of genre like Deponia, Syberia and even The New Beginning. Its strong part is story dynamic - it flows continously. Actions which are required for progression are grouped in small sets of locations to minimize the frustration of pixelhunting. Actually, I haven't noticed any major 'how-to-progress' gameplay stalling.\n\nPros:\n1)Graphics is quite pleasing even for 2010\n2)Continous story progression due to smart areas segmentation(it behaves more like interactive movie than brainbreaker)\n3)Story is quite positive with its own dark twists(If you played The New Beginning you may notice similar character motives and EVEN GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS in puzzles)\n4)Puzzles are grotesque, but simple enough to take just enough time to be fun instead of PITA\n5)The Cop Character is powered by mild metagaming. It is hard to explain. You need to play the game to get the idea. Maybe it was intentional to give player that 'cop intuition' feel xD\n6)Able to create tension and suspence without ugly timers on screen and 'game over' messages. Just the wild ways of the story and you.\nCons:\n1)Crashbugs! Tonns of it. Save often, but nothing gamebreaking.\n2)Characters are stereotypes. Actually it helps the story, but some people don't like when it is that way.\n3)Game beginning is a bit chaotic and has no backstory except on need-to-know basis\n4)A bit hardcore: it doesn't have 'journals' or task indicators, but it is mostly straightforward\n5)One ending. But, you know, movies have only one ending too ;)\n\nHighly recommended. I love it.","April 3, 2015","true","6.0"," 63 of 71 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","63","71","4","2"

It's not a good game either, more of a "meh" experience, but it doesn't entirely deserve the negative rating here.\n\nPros:\n- Interesting story.\n- Decent graphics.\n- Very good voice acting.\n- Great movement controls - you can walk, run, fast travel between rooms and teleport on the map.\n- Skippable cutscenes and dialogues!\n\nCons:\n- During the 9 hours of my playtime the game crashed 15+ time. That's a lot. It's even worse that the game doesn't have autosave so you have to save a lot. Thankfully, all cutscenes can be skipped so you can quickly catch up from an older save. Also, one cutscene at the end of the game crashes every single time. After many tries I had to skip the cutscene and watch it on YouTube.\n- The game has no journal and the protagonists give you no clues on what you are supposed to do next. So if you don't remember everything everyone said you will be lost all the time. This is especially bad if your playthrough is split between several days.\n- Bad audio balance in dialogues. Often the background noise was so loud I couldn't hear the dialogue. Thankfully the game has subtitles.\n- Bad minigames. Fortunately skippable.","March 5","true","9.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Unfortunately the game is very prone to crash. So be sure to save a lot. Usually after restarting the game it then didn't crash at the point it did before, but one part I really couldn't get past a scene without crashing, so I was forced to watch the scene on YouTube and just cancel the scene that caused me to crash by hitting escape which allowed me to continue.","December 14, 2015","true","6.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

To be fair, I agree with the following flaws: The game crashes, a lot. I was a bit worried I wasn't going to make it through to the end becuase sometimes it would crash in the same spot, but I did. Just keep re-loading till it works and save often. The other major flaw is that there really aren't very many puzzles at all. Mostly you click on things and the story progresses (this was minor for me though, cuz I wanted something easy).\n\nOn the plus side I found the story interesting, and kept wanting to come back to it. Sure it has some plotholes and a few too many coincidences, but overall not bad. This is the 2nd time that House of Tales has entertained me. Overall I'd say give it a play, its a few hours of fun.","April 10","true","6.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I got your number from the internet image board known as 4chen.gov. Sorry, Ii'll keep this short. I heard that you were in a game based in the UK (to authenticate this, there were Fish n Chipz trucks left and right as well as bad weather sometimes). I would ask that you refrain from participating in such games from this point forward. Our family name has been dragged through the mud on many occassions and I wouldn't want it to happen again. Please stay away from Africans. Even though they say they'll give you money (2 million nigerian dillars), they are more than likely scamming you. Also, how are you? Spot's dead, cancer. Lost him just recently. How have you been? It's dad, don't be mad. I know we've had our differences that I won't go into for absolutely no reason, but I really think you should give me a call. I won't leave my number. Spot's dead, cancer.\n\nWhile I have your attention, I recently constructed my own game from the ground up known as Project RPG. I would appreciate it if you could spend a cool, crisp, hard-earned 3.99 dollar bill, and get off your fat ♥♥♥ and purchase it (I know you're fat, because all gamers are. This is what the local news has taught me). Spot's dead, cancer.\n\nHave a great day and please buy my game. The children are starving and I can't afford the rent.\n\nSpot's dead, cancer.","June 5","false","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game crashes frequently and it was a bit of an endurance test to get through it - the graphics are dated, and the story doesnt really grip you.  Puzzles are more a trial and error than  logical - and some of the use a with b, and move the mouse pointer till you find the hotspot on the screen, sorry not really good - even for a 2009 game.

Not sure it's worth £8.99 but on sale it's worth trying out.\nIt's a point and click mystery/adventure style game. The storyline is really nicely done, which is what makes me recommend this game. It's quite cutscene and speech heavy so don't get this if all you want is action. You can't die or lose so really this is about playing for solving reasonably simple puzzles and progressing the storyline.\n\nCons:\nCrashes quite a lot. Save often.\nShort gameplay time. Probably around 15 hrs for most.\n\nOther folk on here are right that the movement and conversations are slightly clunky, but this didn't put me off at all as I'm not often bothered about it functioning perfectly if the meat of the game is right.","January 18","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
