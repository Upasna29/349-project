The plot twists and turns nicely during the game. Unfortunately the puzzle design isn't very original and most of the puzzles aren't very challenging, although moving the puzzle solving to 3D does make some of the problems seem new and refreshing. The voice acting is occasionally very annoying but you get used to it. Overall Memento Mori is a good purchase for an adventure gamer Both its story and the shocking finale linger on the edge of thoughts for a long time after playing through the game. This is the way to end a game.","March 8, 2014","true","4.1"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","50","57","0","0"

In most of games, there are generic animations to take or put an object, but not in this one. That's a huge work the devs have done. This really is a good game, with many endings, even if the story is a bit special (but i won't spoil).","February 26, 2014","true","6.5"," 63 of 78 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","63","78","0","0"

I enjoyed it but the number of flaws it has makes £9.99 too expensive. If I had to rate it I would give it 5/10. If you want to buy it, wait for a sale and I'd recommend you spend a maximum of £5 for it.\n\nThe most enjoyable bit of this game is its plot. It's nicely detailed, intriguing and unpredictable. The puzzles are mostly logical and enjoyable too.\n\nThe reason I give this game a mediocre score is that everything else is lack-lustre. The visuals are adequate, the background music ia a bit poor and the voice acting highly variable.The interface takes a little while to get used to. You have an iicon that appears over a useable object that should display what right click and left click will do but this icon is really hard to see.\n\nThe worst thing about the game is the script writing and characterisation. With the exception of Lara (one of the two player characters), everyone in the game seems pretty unpleasant. Conversations feel forced and too drawn out. Sometimes it is even difficult to figure out what a character is trying to say because the wording is so weird and unnatural.\n\nIf you like story-rich point and clicks, wait for a sale and get this. Otherwise don't bother.","January 4, 2015","false","16.2"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","0"

He said that it was like a fancy car without an engine. That is exactly what Memento Mori is like. It may look great, but it just can't do that much. The look of the game is really great. The beginning is very promising with a dead scientist surfacing and it is apparent that you will be involved in finding out why and how he died and your first task in this point and click adventure is to get dressed and find your cell phone so you can charge it. I'm dead serious. The game is full of mundane tasks like this. Point and clicks are usually known for their puzzles and their stories. The puzzles are pretty lacking, and even when you do get a puzzle, they aren't that difficult. There are more mundane tasks then puzzles in this game.\nWell, if the story is great it doesn't matter about the lack of puzzles right? Well....The story isn't bad. I've ready other reviews saying that this is a story driven game that pushes you to keep playing. I beg to differ. I felt that the story was nothing really special. Honestly, this game was a chore to play, due to the lack of brainpower this game required and the cast of characters. On the whole, the performances are hit and miss. Sometimes the voice acting is great, and other times you can almost visualise the actor in the booth with the script in front of him. What also drives me crazy is that while you may hear anger or frustration in the characters voice, the body language and facial expressions of the character do not convey any of this emotion. It's very easy to separate the voice from the character, and that is annoying. This game has also been praised for its ending. Depending on what you do and say throughout the game (Mass Effect even affected point and click games) you will get one of six endings. The problem that I see with the ending is that it feels disjointed from the rest of the game. The focus of the ending is entirely different from the rest of the game, which can really throw you off.\nNow to the only good point, the look of the game. It is great to look at. The cinematics are fitting and the places you get to visit are beautifully rendered. Every action has an animation. A lot of work went into the graphic design and it is the only solid gold star I can give this game.\nHopefully, Memento Mori 2 will be less of a disapppointment. I bought the Memento Mori Bundle for 7.99. Memento More 2 will have to be incredible for me to believe that buying these games is worth suffering through the first one.","March 19, 2015","false","15.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","1"

None of this is as bad as the awful dialog system, however, in which you are typically presented with 3 different responses: positive, negative, and curious.  The problem is that the game doesn't bother to tell you the specifics of what your character will say when you pick one of these--you just have to pick the attitude that most closely matches what you WANT to say and hope that that's what the game designers had in mind as well.  The story probably would have been interesting if not for the badly written and poorly voice-acted dialog.  Can't recommend this one.","June 6, 2014","false","3.3"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/recommended/200490/","LVS84","Little B Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LVS84/","416 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84jEsLSe91Y\n\nMemento Mori – remember that you can die. This is the medieval Latin theory and practice of reflection on mortality, especially as a means of considering the vanity of earthly life and the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. It is related to the ars moriendi ("The Art of Dying") and related literature. Memento Mori has been an important part of ascetic disciplines as a means of perfecting the character, by cultivating detachment and other virtues, and turning the attention towards the immortality of the soul and the afterlife. This is taken from Wikipedia and it's essential for part of the game.\n\nThis game have a lot of options. The game is highly scalable – resolution, monitor frequency, V-sync, AA, shader quality, texture filtering, mipmaping, dynamic shadows and reflections. But when I put everything on high the framerate tanks. I have decent PC and this shouldn't happen, the game is from 2008. Also there are a lot of audio options and even if you want your cursor can be animated or not, which is a neat little feature.\n\nIn the game you control two characters. The first is Larisa Svetlova – ex-police officer in Russia, now working for Interpol. The second and the main character here is Maxim Durrand. He use to forge painting and sell, until he got caught by Larisa. Instead sending him to jail, he agree to become informant for the russian police. Both Max and Lara are drag in investigation by Colonel Ostankovich. There was an alarm failure in Hermitage museum in Saint Petersburg and Ostankovich that something happens. He force Lara to send Max to see if it's missing something in the museum. Of course there is – few paintings From here on their own they travel to Lisbon, Lyon, residence in Scotland and even in Finland in search for the missing paintings. Their journey is acompanied by mysterious deaths, secret signs, interrogating suspects and solving puzzles. The story is good, but not great. It starts slow and took a few hours to get interesteing and for a adventure game this is not great. I don't want to spoil anything, but the last act throws a lot on you, that wasn't hinted throughout the game that this maybe how it will end. This is good and bad. Just it came from nowhere. The game wraps up really well. It was enjoyble, connects all the little hints, that you see, but from which you can't piece the ending before you see it. It's hard to explain without ruining the end, so trust me on this one. I just wish the story wasn't dragging so much in the beginning.\n\nFor an adventure game the most important things for me are story and puzzles. I already cover the story. As for the puzzles I can say they are not hard. I was stuck briefly on one or two. All of them have common sense – pick up this, put it there, combine objects, look at some inside your inventory or around you. I didn't find any obscure or illogical. Some of them are quite unique. They are 3D puzzles. What I mean is you look an object and you can rotate the camera around it in 360 degrees. I like them, but they are few and far between.\n\nYou have a conversation system with 3 type of answers most of the time, but what will a character say when you choose “positively”, “negatively” or “questionably”, you can't really tell. Most of the times they will say things that doesn't sound like what you choose.\n\nThe graphics are alright. Here all backgrounds are 3D, not pre-render like older adventure games and they look great. But some characters model doesn't look that good, like Maxs for example. And NPC's also suffer with the lack of enough polish.\n\nAlso the character movement is not good. It looks cluncky. It's like the game didn't came out in 2008.\n\nThe level design is really great. I like all the places you visit and they have a lot of detail put in them. There almost always things that can be clicked just for the character to say something and they are not essential for the story and puzzles. It's great to have a minor thing like that. It's about the atmosphere. Even something like Lara's office looks nice and have enough background details to feel like a real place.\n\nFor me the worst part here is the sound design, especually the voice acting. It's bad. It's not unbearably bad, but still. The only one I like is the narrator. Lara and Max suppose to have accents, but the feel forced and the line delivery is not great. At one scene Max is supose to be angry, but it's so badly played and I just cringe. This ruin the moment.\n\nAs for the music I can't point a single track. It's not bad, it's just nothing special, nothing to remember. Most of them include a piano, but the melodies feels like i've heard them before in movies and games. There are occasional deep male vocals accompanied by orchestra, but non of the tracks contribute that much for the atmosphere.\n\nThe sound effects are are really good. Things like walking, moving an object, hitting crushing and envoirmental sounds and feel proper. I wish the music and voice acting were on the same level.\n\nThere are quite number of issues I have with the game, mostly are minor things, but nonetheless they drag the game down. Cutscene. They don''t look good. They are blurry, like you have something on the screen. Character movement. When you make Lara or Max take something, for example, it take them ages to do it and it's frustrating. Speaking. When character observe something, he is saying out loud. Sometimes it's important and an NPC shouldn't hear it. It's bizzare. Lip sync. It's bad and you can even barely seen the mouths moving. Camera. A lot of times obstruct my view and I wonder around trying to figure out what am I supose to do. And in cutscenes often is badly placed and heads are cutoff. Lara. She is not an interestig character. I didn't care for her like I care about Max. Some are minor issues, but when you combine with the pacing of the story and bad voice acting, you see why the game is dragged down.\n\nI consider Memento Mori decent adventure game. As a whole the game won't be stuck in my mind, but the ending will be. It have great locations, good plot, not-so-hard puzzles and few endings, but pacing, bad voice acting and other little issues drag the game down. I recommend it, but on deep sale.","January 25","true","8.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I've been a fan of adventure point and click games since their heyday in the 90s. It does have some good elements and some that are lacking. For the short version; if it's on sale and you need something to do for the next 10 hours, get it. If you're expecting a great adventure game on the scale of Longest Journey or Syberia, you're in for a big letdown. I'm only going to select the "yes" for recommending this game because I don't want this genre to die. I want more developers to create more adventure games!\n\nPros:\n****The characters' voices all have appropriate regional accents. The French character of Max has a French accent and the Russian character of Lara has a charming Russian accent. Points for authenticity!\n****Like most adventure games, there are puzzles and they all fit into the context of the game and had logical answers. Some may have been a little too easy while others required a bit too much pixel hunting. All in all though, the puzzles were good.\n****Nice graphics and scenery design. I'm a digital artist so I always appreciate great graphics and well rendered 3D models. Some character animations were used time and again but I came to see them as just character quirks rather than the developer recycling animations.\n****The game took about 10 hours for me to complete and I only had to check a walk-through once because I missed clicking on something in a scene. Since I bought this game when is was about $3, I'd say I made a fantastic investment.\n\nCons\n****The story doesn't really make any sense and by the time you get to the ending you will have a feeling of  WTF?! Even though they had the character explain the entire story and why everything happened at the end of the game (it was a worse "entire plot explanation" than you'd find in one of the old Sean Connery James Bond movies), it still made no sense to me at all. You know what people say about the ending of Lost? This ending tops that. I understand what they were saying but, logically, it makes no sense to me.\n****The "multiple endings" thing is a joke. If you don't do something in a few scenes then you get a different voice-over epilogue. That's it. I was quite disappointed by that. I love games were my choices matter but this had nothing to do with choice and everything to do with just crossing all the T's and dotting the I's.\n\nSo yeah, technically good but story-wise it's confusing and forgettable. Like I said, if it goes on sale again at a cheap price then pick it up for a great time-killer. If you're expecting a great adventure game where your choices actually matter and there is a fantastic story, go look up Dreamfall Chapters.","October 11, 2015","true","9.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And it's a bad one. My findings:\n\n1. Absolutely horrible frame rate at miniature screen resolutions (1024xSomething). I was in fact astounded by that slide-show. I have never seen another game on my computer (intel i5 with nvidia 525m) with that low frame rate.\n2. As soon as Lara got her clothes on in her Lyon apartment (the absolute beginning of the game after pressing "new game" button), game crashed with "Memento.exe caused a EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION blablabla" stack trace dialog.\n\nI expect games I buy to be relatively stable and work out of box. Performance might be forgiven, especially if it's an adventure which doesn't require fast reflexes, but crashes mid-game (in this case, before game really begins) are such a turn-off. In fact, THIS is the first game I bought on Steam for which I would like to have my moneys back! On the other hand I'm glad I only paid 1.99 euros for it yesterday when it was on sale, so not much damage taken, fortunately.\n\nMy recommendation: DO NOT BUY.\n","May 17, 2014","false","0.5"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","7","26","0","0"

First of all it is good story. It is serious, creepy, consistent and mysterious. Good police quest. There is no crazy level of  stereotypes about russia, no stalin, ♥♥♥♥ and drunken murders, as we get used this days in popular culture. Thanks to devs for that.\n\nAt the same time character and story development a bit slow, there is not many crazy twists and turns. Game is pretty straightforward.\n\nI recommend it, it was fun to play and to follow the story.","May 15, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had to go on the internet twice, once for some dialogue refresh to remember what I was trying to do next and then for the symbol puzzle towards the end which I don't think was done as well as the others in terms of figuring it out for yourself.\n\nI'd say a very solid 8.5/10","January 3","true","15.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The solutions to puzzles and combining items is not clear and often I was unsure how to proceed in the game or what the current goal was. Meh to put it simply. I would also like to add this game has alternate endings depending on the player's actions and ability. The better you do the happier the ending; the worse you play the more bleak and depressing the ending.","May 18","false","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
