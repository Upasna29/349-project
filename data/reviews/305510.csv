There's no wait period, no breathing room, no chance for you to think for a moment about your next step.\nIt's "hurry and teleport in" before someone steals your rez node and then you gotta turn around 'cause you already have baddies gunning at your dropship.\n\nIf you somehow survived the first wave AND managed to snag at least one node, then you have very little time to build up your strength before the meteorites show.\nThey show every 800 resources. Global. Meaning that if you didn't get one of the first two nodes, you're screwed with only your servo and the starter turret.\n\nIf you manage to get a roving force and destroy one of the two meteors (they drop them in pairs, I think), then another one will take its place.\n\nI can't recall of any other strategy game that does this. Dawn of War, Starcraft, Age of Empires... Even the freaking MOBAs give you a little breather between waves.\n\nThis reminds me of a map I once made for Blood. Since I made it, I knew the order and where every secret was located at, and assumed everyone would be able to figure it out.\nNot the case. I received evey complaint about difficulty and got a bad score because I realized you could glitch the dogs at the first room by going prone under them, but not everyone else did.\n\n\n----------------\nAbout the AI\n----------------\n\nJesus ♥♥♥♥ing Christ.\n\nWhy on Earth would you allow allies to build within your influence if THERE IS NO RESOURCE SHARING!?\n\nSO. MANY. ♥♥♥♥ING. TIMES. I have had the AI claim all the resource spots when THEY'RE NOT EVEN THERE!\n\nI've only been able to play this with AI, since I haven't been able to get paired with someone online, but I'm absolutely certain you can get stuck with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammate that will steal every resource node from under you, leaving you wandering aimlessly, telling yourself "Why did I download this?"\n\nI know it's an early access game. I don't care. It's currently not worth the buy.\n\n----------------\nAbout the customization\n----------------\n\nYou'd think that for a game that boasts about customization, they'd have at least several different parts set up. So far, I've only seen:\n-first weapon\n-sword\n-pistol\n-rifle\n-shoulder rocket (single)\n-shoulder grenade launcher\n\nAll bodyparts are exactly the same, with slight variations in color.\n\nOh yeah. There as a shield unit in there, but it was so weak that It was essentially the same as going naked.\n\n----------------\nFinal thoughts\n----------------\n\nRight now it's not worth the buy. Maybe check again in a few months.\n\nDon't buy early access stuff this early! If they sell every copy during early access, they won't have any reason to finish the game!","September 24, 2015","false","1.9"," 65 of 101 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","65","101","0","6"

If you're one of THOSE guys, that just want to know if the game is good.....well...look no further either.\nLet's start with the short one.\n\nGame good. You play. You smile. You happy. The End.\n\nAnd now for those of you who want to know MY thoughts and experiences with the game. Also know, I go for a full blown out review, as such is my...way of the ninja? Cause I have quite a bit I really want to get out. So bare with me. Or not.\n\n\nFirst a little story about me.\nAs a young little ninja child Age of Empires were pretty much my one favorite game. Even to this day it pretty much is. So you can probably understand that, when I read, and I quote, "key create talent behind the beloved Age of Empires seriers", I got pretty excited in my...head. So, no questions asked, it's an early access game, but who cares, I bought it and I bought it GOOD. I even straight ahead recommended it to a few friends whom I used to play AoE with as a child. Needless to say, they got pretty excited as well. I downloaded it, I played it and boy did I love it.\n\nI really love RTS games, if done right, and a RTS game with mechs makes it just all that better. Mecha games has a special place in my heart, so you must understand that, AoE creators making a new RTS game with a mecha theme, I got EXTREMLY excited. BUT enough about me and my love for RTS and mechas. Now about the game.\n\n\nNote that when you buy this game, you buy an EARLY ACCESS game, there isn't that much content as of yet.\n\nThe game itself is really good and well balanced, going into combat doesn't feel like the enemy is outpowering yourself, but this is because of the fact that there currently only is ONE...faction I guess you could call it, Earth. More, probably, will be added later on. There are a few enjoyable game modes as well as maps, although VERY FEW, they are still enjoyable. From what I can tell there's only about 4 maps (or maybe it was 3? 5?, oh well), the game modes can vary depending on which map you chose. We got the standard Deathmatch, PvP or PvB.\nAlso note that the maps are only able to hold up to two players at once. So playing with a friend against and AI bot is right now not a thing, unless you and your friend want to tackle the horde mode together against swarms of enemies. We also got the Arena mode where you play up to five maps in different ways, by betting 1000 cash, you can win, sometimes, quite a few good things at the end.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that I haven't gone out to play against other human players yet. Not that I don't fancy it, but that I tried and failed. There's not THAT many playing yet. Most is still getting a hang of the game.\n\nThe whole "make your ideal team" thing isn't all that good yet, but still good. There's not that many parts to chose from when it comes to weapons and such. There's only 3 pilots along with their Servos (as the mechas are called) available by the time I'm reviewing this. Each with his/her own special ability. But, despite the lack of weapons and such, there's still quite a bit of ways to make YOUR ideal team. There's your sword, shield, pistols and rifles and fists. Swords can be dual wielded or you can go with a shield in the off hand instead. Pistols can also be dual wielded, but I prefer the rifles to be honest. I do hope spears and axes as well as deployable mines.\nLet's take my current team, which I no doubt will change in the near future.\n\n(Edit: More than those weapons do exist. They are just higher level parts, such as a drill (dual wielding).\n(Edit #2: Deployable mines do exist within the game, found out playing against an "Insane" difficulty bot)\n\nI go for "Sword and Shield along with a few launchers on the back", a "long range sniper along with some swarm missile launchers on back" and then a "dual wielding swords man, with a few tricks up his back as well". By combining your "heroes" abilities you can do some devastating damage, with an EMP blast and a acid pool of awesomness on the ground and my sniper swarming the enemy with missiles, a enemy Servo can easily be taken down, and fast, as well as reducing the enemy forces to almost nothing. Combining your Servos abilities is almost a must if you want a quick and fast game.\n\nBut getting new parts isn't all a walk in the park, you need to dedicate a few minutes, or hours to get some really good new parts. When you do get them good parts, boy do you feel like a child at Christmas getting getting that toy you really wanted, that you saw in the window of the toy shop when you and your mom when down to the mall to buy the rest of the families presents so you just walk past that window containing that awesomness. The parts can go from weapons, arms, heads, body, legs, shields as long as some other additions on the back and inside the Servo CPU system, kinda like rings in Diablo 3. Much of the customization feel like a good RPG game such as Diablo. You battle, you win, you get stuff, you equip said stuff (if good) and sell the rest for some scrap which can later be used to buy weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe whole base construction isn't all that yet. There's not that many building to chose from, but I figure more will be added later on. Such as missile turrets, walls, better units and more. Or at least this is what I hope for. Walls. And if the creators is reading this, think about this. Walls...on which you can place your turrets. Aaah? Not to shabby ey?\n\nAnyway, I love it, I'll keep on playing it. I'll support it. I'll master this. It's just that worth my time.\n\n\nSo if you love Age of Empires, Diablo and also that one awesome mecha game for pc which is also a RTS game.\nThen, my friend, this is for you.\n\nLET ME REMIND YOU! This is a EA game, EA for Early Access. UNDERSTAND THAT before you buy it. I have a feeling ALOT more will be added in the time to come.\n\nTo sum it all up.\n\nGame good. You play. You smile. You happy. The End.\n\n(With a few setbacks as the lack of maps, factions and a little crappy online play)","May 31, 2015","true","16.6"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","18","24","3","1"

I'd say this game is closer to metal fatigue or air mech then what most compare this game to - its fast in your face no time to debate or pause and make strategy - get in shoot use your mechs special attacks and hope you hold long enough to snag some resources and make some generic units to back up your servos\n\nthe co op hold your own map reminds me more of Dawn of war 2 Last Stand as you get waves of enemies while trying to collect resources and build up - the limited resource types helps keep your mind on fighting over micromanagement is a bonus since attempting to sweep away enemies with limited resources can be tough\n\nSo buy this game if you are looking for\na fast paced RTS with RPG style\nquick in your face matches\na interesting choice of mecha options- arm them with pistols swords grenade launchers brass nuckles rifles and differnt armors and pilots\nthe pvp is fun quick shoot em up style rts\n\nDon't buy it if your looking for\na new supreme commander - or total annilation - these are not the same please stop comparing them I love total annilation far to much for people to keep bashing every game in its name - they are not the same let the game rest in peace\na long in depth campain or story line - these are pretty much just not in the game only 2 campains to get you started I already beat them in first 2 hours of play on all difficultys\na no bugs perfect in all ways game - its early access it has bugs it has some wierdness and balancing needs major work still - does that make it less fun? for some yes so hit follow or wishlist it till you think its worth the cash\n\nso after 2 hours would I buy it again? yes - 7/10 solid early access with tons of potentiol (and I'm talking real diamond in the rough not great ""personality"" )\n\nalso to anyone who attempts to troll me or leave some grammar nazi response I will delete you - if you have a legit response or complaint about my post I'm all for responding so please ask away\n\nbut folks remember - I'm a gamer not a Grammar professor so please please keep that kinda rage for facebook maybe youtube but don't leave it on my door step I won't deal with it","October 17, 2015","true","12.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracohouston/recommended/305510/","Dracohouston","Draco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dracohouston/","377 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nedit: Update for people reading this in early 2016 and considering purchase. Updates to the beta are very slow now. If you are only preordering I can still recommend the game, if the planned price increase happens 20 bux is a deep discount. But, it is not worth buying just to play the beta. Cautious types may want to wait and see despite the prospect of a good price.\n\nThis game is still in beta, but it is in very safe hands. The developers are all industry veterans with a record of shipping good games. Patches are coming regularly about 2 weeks apart with many changes and added content each update.\n\nIf I had to compare it to anything it would be Warcraft III. You have 3 heroes and a base, units and creeps on the map, the objective is blow up the other guy's base. There is also a coop mode offering a variety of challenges against both creeps and dug in AI forces.\n\n2 major things separate it from WC3, heroes do not gather XP from creeps, they gather resources which can be spent on anything. The heroes go up in rank with your base, which is done by buying resources. The other is the hero units are customized giant robots made out of parts you get out of loot crates, bought between matches with ingame currency.\n\nThis is where the game gets really interesting, parts can give your robots stat boosts and abilities. There are many types of items with more on the way. The way your hero team will play depends on these parts. They give you a lot of free parts at the start to let you try this out.\n\nThere are no free to play elements, or additional monetization beyond the box price. It features profile levels, though. Thankfully, this level has a cap and it is reasonable to reach, and being a beta not many people are bothering to get to max level. Grinding is not a requirement to enjoy the beta. Players are a little scarce right now, this is best enjoyed in multiplayer so I recommend having a friend to play it with. The game only has 2 player modes so far though. The solo version of coop can be fun but single player isn't quite as fleshed out as multiplayer.\n\nBeing a beta there are times where things change a lot between updates and items are changed, removed, or your profile completely reset. If you want a complete game, wait a while. If you don't mind beta games Jump In. You can see quite a lot of the content playing multiplayer casually.","June 24, 2015","true","247.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The game reminds me a lot of Warcraft 3 when Blizzard introduced heros into the RTS game play. There is great potential for this game but that doesnt mean it will amount to greatness.

They even asked players for advice on what to do! This doesn't instil much confidence. I applied for a refund, but no luck (have had the game for more than two weeks).\n\nIn any case, my advice is not to buy this game until it has been properly released and you've had the chance to read some reviews about the game. Right now, it doesn't seem like there's going to be much progress and there's no telling at this point what the game will eventually look like. Avoid.\n\nUpdate 3 June 2016: a new patch is incoming. Notice: incoming. It's not released, but in development. And what are they focusing on? Some balance changes, making things faster, and squashing a few bugs.

I couldn't stay away.\n\nThe overall impression is that this game has potential to be a huge amount of fun, even for an Alpha stage game I was actually impressed with several of the mechanics involved.\n\nThe building system for the RTS side of it is simple to pick up and after a few games you will, be putting your roots down quickly and getting on with the fun part of smashing the enemy to bits.\n\nAs for the customisation of your mechs? Well yet again has great potential. Whether you're a gunslinger, boxer or sniper there are loadouts for you. There is as yet no options to customise colour so your look is completely down to what gear you have.\n\nThe basic weapons are complemented by extra things like shields and rockect pacs so the potential for a wide range of fighting styles is in the pipeline and mix that in with each poilet's own powers I feel I will be dreaming up new builds for weeks at least.\n\nA key refreshing element is the servo team idea itself, you with every tech level you get an additional servo to use in game from the stock of already unlocked pilots. By early mid game you can have a whole squad of stompy mechs to deal damage with.\n\nSo the rougher points:\n\nObviously the game isn't finished, so while it's good fun to play a few times right now you will quickly chew through the early access content. Though even this isn't too bad as even though you can't access all the cool things now they are there, especially in with the A.I controlled servos who are armed with some of the shinier things you will be able to get just to make you drool and feel good about yourself as you pound their over geared mechs to scrap ^_^\n\nOn the subject of the A.I, sadly they will not tax you terribly right now, with only basic commands and some almost hilariously stupid actions (Ignoring your entire army/base defences to chase one little drone round and around or just sitting at their own base scratching their heads as you claim the whole map. But as I said before early days.\n\nThere is some balancing issues to be resolved, but yet again that is nothing new to a work in progress game. Some one of the two co-op levels is simply impossible with an A.I ally to complete while the other is hardly taxing at all. Unless you raise it the next difficulty and watch your A.I ally dance in circles.\n\nThe only major gripes I have is the loot drops and lack of other players right now. It is almost sole destroying to earn the in game currency, playing for hours for what feels like terrible small gains. From what I have seen it takes at least four games to earn a reasonable quality loot crate which turns out to be another gun you don't need.\n\nThis is offset somewhat by the 'daily quests' where you have to achieve certain goals like building ten base turrets ect, but in my experience it's not enough.\n\nYes you've crushed your foe in an epic battle, ground his servos to scrap and blasted his base to atoms. You finally catch your breath and find what feels like a couple of loose coat buttons and can of knock off soft drink for your troubles.\n\nThe devs has stated that the early release focuses on multiplayer right now, which is all fine and dandy except the teaming up engine seems to be lacking at the moment. I was lucky to find a fellow player to duke it out with (In co-op or PVP) having only had about five games with other people since I got the game a few days ago, less than one in ten searches resulting in a match.\n\nSo to conclude my review I would say this game will be awesome if they keep up the good work. As for buying it right this second? Not so sure. You will have a few hours fun testing out the basic format and gaming system. If you have a dedicated friend to play it with, to strive and overcome the co-op missions or to beat the snot out of in PVP then the fun will last longer.\n\nI would see it as a long term investment, the more people who support the game now will hopefully encourage the devs and we will see more cool content sooner. The big promise that is given is this game will not be a 'pay to win', everything will be included in the one time payment of the game.\n\nOver all I'd give this a thumbs up, with hope that it lives up to expectations. Buy investing in the game you make it more likely that a real gem will be at the end of the tunnel. If you're not up for that risk then it may be worth waiting to see where it goes.","June 4, 2015","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most the things that it need to function are missing and at times it just would operate. Hearing "beta" makes you cringe because you want instant satisfaction and dont want to wait for something that you paid for to slowly get better. But guess what? dont you twish you tested all those horrible games and told the makes to send that abomination back to spawning pits of cthulu's den. Your job as a beta tester is to break the game, post the problems and talk about what can make it better instead of stomping it out instantly. this game is that "thing", it's at the early months of developement and needs help to make it's way to where it can be that game the helps the rts franchise.\n\nNow to get back on track, the game is ok even for an early access game. they release at least one map a month including new parts and weapons. currently on each map there are different coop missions you can do with a buddy. You can deploy a team of three servos each having a pilot with different skills, and as your dropship level increases you can get more pilots. sadly at the moment you data will be wiped with every monthly update i think, have to put my ear to the ground to know if that will change, but at the same time it is a good thing because old stuff will be switched out with new and better items, as it progresses further i dont think they'll need to wipe as much (heh).\n\nTHIS IS NOT A MOBA! When people see  a "hero" unit with much weaker and small units they think moba, but this is far from that, this a base building rts game with resources and base management. You might be tripped up when you see enemies are called creeps but it's not what you think, it's because the main enemy, the bloomspawn, do not need to build a base as they fall from the sky in meteors, they also play a part in pvp holding down refinery spots and on field resources.\n\nThe Servos are giant mechs piloted by brave men and women with a hunger for destruction. Ever watched that movie Pacific Rim? well, you can think of it similar to that with different mechs of multiple designs and sizes and a large arsonal of weapons. Servo's are the units that you will use most in this game and put in in front when charging a base, there are smaller, faster and weaker units but they are mostly for providing support for the servos, like healing or long range sniping. but your servos are not invincible, they will blow up in a grand explosion thats almost worth the loss, you can bring them back after a long cool down but you have to know when and what to engage the enemy with.\n\nThis game is a ♥♥♥♥ load of fun, no joke. you will spend a long time naming, costumizing and battling with your 60 meter monster. I geek out when ever a new update comes out cause i know its a whole list of new things! You can imagine my excitement when i heard their adding air units! I love seeing my servo duke it out with a massive Juggernaut looking bloomspawn! or launching a salvo of missles on a hoard of little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!! trust me when i say this is a game with a ton of potential.","June 27, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far alot of the things I like, progression, loot, customization and RTS? Graphics are great,\nplays solid, fast load times and an intense and challanging pace. After a couple of losses and refitting, refining strategy I can now hold my own. If this stays on track, has good dev support, matching/pvp etc, could be my fav RTS for a long time.","October 6, 2015","true","57.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's too early to judge this game from bug and everything, but i want to talk in positive and optimism about the future of this game.\n\n","September 28, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's arcadey and a little cartoony but it's fun and even the alpha/EA version runs well and has a variety of game modes even if certain things are placeholder or a little sparse still. You can have up to 3 Servos in battle along with 15-20 or so drones in a typical skirmish. There are several different types of drones, eco and armoury upgrades, turrets, unit producing factories, healing beacons, some neutral roaming monsters and different economy nodes around the map to capture. There's a variety of gear and parts you can earn and swap around on your Servos between games to go for certain playstyles. It will have a campaign/SP side on release and has MP and Co-Op already. I'd like to see it get a bit more depth and character as it develops. It is a little too generic/cartoony for my tastes aesthetically right now but, again, it's an alpha and there's a lot more to be added so I'm curious where they will take it.\nUpdate: Changing my review to a thumbs down. One of my few Early Access regrets. It's been many months since my initial review and there's been zero communication from the devs on what's happening with the game. There was a single small update in the past 6 months. The game stopped working on my new W10 PC and support was not able to find a reason or solution. I've completely lost interest in the game and it seems the devs have as well...","May 30, 2015","false","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like how I can customize my servos with different weapons and upgrades. The downside is that the rts elements are very baseline. Its essentially giant mech combat with a few dozen tanks supporting them. Only a few issues I have with it... I would love to be able to limit how many servos players can have in skirmish mode, for example (3 is too many imo). But otherwise its pretty fun.","December 28, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can be a bit hectic at times and a path finding tool would be good but this is nice. I like the upgade tools. The Ai could use a bit a of tweek or two I have destroyed the enemy base a few times by just sneeking round the back with my guys as a huge group of powered up servos just stood there and didn't seem to mind it happening. ha ha ha\n\nStill it seems slick and it is fun, the flying units are also a little hard to control though.\n7 out 10.
