It was one of the most relaxing experiences I'd ever encountered. The characters each have distinctive and charming personalities; they seem real, more so than many human characters in games. The rainforest is absolutely stunning, even at a lower resolution. The bioluminescence creates a soothing visual that relaxes the mind. The music adds to this soothing effect, with its mystical tone and flowing melody. The only negative point I can think of is its length; the game ends so quickly, while I want to explore more of the world presented in the game. But for this cheap price its really okay and worth it.","October 27, 2013","true","8.3"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serieus1/recommended/49810/","serieus1","Serieus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serieus1/","2327 products in account","CreaVures is a platforming game mixed with simple puzzle solving.  The puzzle part is to choose the correct creature to use in order to pass the level, or in order to grab all of the motes and essence laying around in the game.  The graphics aren't great as far as creatures go, though the background are beautifully done with an Avatar style of night-life irridescence.  Each creature offers a different option like a cat that growls at enemies (i.e. bats, birds, squirrels, monkeys, etc...) or hangs from fruits, a Porcupine that uses its quills to shoot the enemies or uses its quills to climb trees and leaves a ladder for others to use.  There a total of 5 creatures that you will collect during the course of the game.  The game doesn't take very long to beat, but the achievements are there to keep you playing if you're interested in that stuff.  The animation and pace of the game is very slow and tedious.  I felt that if the game allowed you to go at a greater speed that the game would keep your interest more, especially when you die and have to restart at the checkpoint.  It's done well, so if this is your kind of game, go grab it.  Overall a decent game to play with you children.","January 4, 2015","true","8.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

You play as five cute little critters trying to save their forest. Simple story, but very effective in context with the characters. The game is fairly short, which is probably the only drawback.\n\nThe puzzles are nothing overly complicated, but they are pretty fun and very relaxing once you get the hang of the mechanics and the character's special abilities. The pace isnt fast, but I dont see that as a negative. Personally, I loved the boss fights and wish there had been a few more.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, and the music is perfect for each level.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/49810/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Not sure why this game gets such positive reviews, not because it sucks but because it's so mediocre. I'll start with the positives as always. The creatures are cute, the music and art style/atmosphere is nice, and it is fun how each creature has it's own power and you have to use them together to get things done.\nNow the problems. The game is super short, around 2.5 hours. The levels are short and super repeitive, just climbing ropes and branches and trees to get to the end, on basically every level. The levels all look the same and have the same layout. There are little essences to collect but since they don't have any purpose (literally nothing, no extras, art, unlockables, powers, etc.....just so it will show up you got x/x at the end) I just found myself skipping them altogether to beat the level faster. Using those for some point would have extended playtime and made levels more interesting, but since they didn't do anything they shouldn't even be in there. The enemies are the same and super repetitive. As for the creatures, you basically use the same 2 for like 1/2 the game, until you finally unlock the 3rd, and then unlocking more happens more often. Although they are fun to try out when you first get them, they become boring and repetitive to use. Each only has one power, so thats all you will use them for, is that singular thing. Although some levels you can go through with whatever combo you want, most you have to take a singular path and use a specific one, taking out all ability to customize your loadout or improvise at all, its basically just " use this guy for this area, this other guy for the next part, and so on". I would have liked more freedom. Also since they only each have 1 power they can only do 1 specific sort of obstacle. so the thing you use them for when you first get them you will only use them for that thing the entire game, with no variation. There are a few boss levels that change things up and make it a little more varied, which are a nice addition, but theres only like 3 the whole game, so don't get your hopes up. The platforming is ok, if not a little floaty. Also you can get stuck on things a lot. On the flip side, grabbing ledges is very inaccurate and inconsistent, It constantly wouldn't let me when I hit right on, and same for ropes. All in all its just a rather boring and repetitive game (have I stressed the repetition enough?), which not much variety, just doing the same thing on the same looking levels with the same puzzles, for around 15 levels. It does work though and is passable. 6/10. Can't reccomend though as I didn't particularly enjoy it.","March 4, 2015","false","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is a basic platformer with simple controls and not much of a story so to speak. Each creaVure has a different use, one can break things, another can climb, and another can bite things. Its up to you to figure out how to use each creaVure well. The game is only around 2/3 hours long and its worth it. For me it was $5 well spent on a simple game that is perfect to kill a few hours.

The game is more oriented around puzzle solving than direct combat and emphasizes strategic play by switching from one creature to the next in order to solve  mini-puzzles needed to progess.  The Steam Overlay and widescreen are both supported, and the music is appropriate for the overall atmosphere of the game.  The one minor complaint about CreaVures is the less than perfect controller support.    While the onscreen button tutorials and relatively easy control scheme make the game easy to learn, unfortunately the buttons do not seem to work on menus, requiring a switch to keyboard and mouse for that functionality.  Minor gripes aside, CreaVures is a solid action puzzle title and I would recommend it to any player interested in the genre.","April 9, 2012","true","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

What does it mean? I don't know and I honestly don't care.\nMy friend gave me a free key and I thought, hmm looks cool, like something that I have played when I was a child. Not. Same type of genre of games for Sega Mega Drive were better. And here is why.\n\nYes, the game looks appealing, but that's about it. I hated that tail animation. I don't know why behaves like that, was that a bad expression or just a rig. But then, I found that some other objects in the game, for instance vines, behave the same ugly way.\nThe music is nice too, but the other thing that tipped me off straight away was the loading time. What am I loading for so long? My Coutner-Strike or Dota 2 maps load faster than that.\n\nSo in conclusion I must say, If by any chance you are a gamer, than you just going to waste your money ($6 usd) and regret it. I cannot recommend this game to anybody. Frankly I don't even think that my girlfriend would play this game, it's just so bad.","February 18, 2014","false","0.3"," 14 of 33 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","14","33","0","1"

All of the creatures are different, as in their personalities are different. It can easily be seen during the small cutscenes. Just amazing what you can give with so little.\nNow the game itself makes you use the different abilities each of the creatures have to go forward. You can't leave one behind anyways, that's rude. You also collect motes and essence. You can collect all or if you want, just get to the end of the level. In general the game is slow-paced. Oh and looks-wise the game is great I'd say.\nAll in all a neat platformer to play if you have hours to murder and are good with slower paced games.\n\nLil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpkgepD5Igw","October 19, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
