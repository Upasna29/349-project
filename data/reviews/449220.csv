The subtitles don't line up, the controls are unintuitive and flighty, and the graphics are awful. The controls deserve especial mention. I press down when navigating the menu, and find my cursor has jumped 2-3 spaces. It's like the dev hasn't even heard of keyboard ramping. Press Enter to... Return to the level select menu? Huh? I accidentally skipped the horribly-paced tutorial and it won't let me return to it without restarting the game. Waste of 59 cents, waste of 18 minutes of my life. Not even going to bother with the cards unless this goes on sale for some embarrassingly low amount. I was expecting something ironically bad, but this is just bad.","April 5","false","0.3"," 154 of 214 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","154","214","4","5"

Not that it matters much but it's quite random about where they did translate and didn't translate to english. As far as side scrolling shooters go it's go no special features to speak of and seems very unpolished.\n\nOn the bright side it doesn't really do anything horribly wrong besides from the half ♥♥♥♥♥ language translation. The game itself is clearly meant to be silly but it just comes off as lazy to me. Pretty much every other side scrolling shooter game on steam is better than this one.","April 28","false","2.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Some games are so bad that they are fun over all, but in this one's case those bugs overweight the positive aspects thus resulting in a barely playable game with a potential for some cult classic.\n\nWhat I would like to see:\n- removal of the ammo counter\n- fixing control bugs for game pads\n- a bit of optimisation\n\nTo be honest - I would like to finish this game provided all of the weak sides are removed. As for now I need to give a thumb down, with some sadness, as I like such original games.","May 2","false","6.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Being able to understand the original language and the cultural references makes the idea kinda interesting and the humor can be ok in some parts. But a good idea doesn't make the game good.\nIt's a story involving characters that can b esomewhat funny to a few people but most will not get it, and that is a huge fault inmy opinion. Also most of the plot is just nonsense: you're a guy in a flying motorcycle, racing through space and shooting lasers at monsters (often robots and giant crabs and lobsters) and trying to find your girlfriend who was kidnaped? Seriously the mind of whoever wrote this was so messed up I was afraid of what I might find if I played more than 2 stages (and there are a lot of them).\nThe game mechanics are very simple: move bike up and down, avoid obstacles, shoot and colect floating bonus. This gets a bit boring after a very short time and, guess what? If you die you go back to stage one!

Ajudar o desenvolvimento do brasileiro. O setor de jogos do Brasil, onde não existe muito investimento publico/social, esta muito bem representado com a obra prima A Grande Bagunça espacial, devidamente traduzido para o português brasileiro. Como um grande jogo AAA, o jogo tem suporte para inglês e espanhol para os estrangeiros se deleitarem com tamanha obra de arte. Bem minha review começará com o plot básico.\nNo alvorecer da humanidade, a fome e os predadores já ameaçavam de extinção a incipiente espécie humana. Até que a chegada de um objeto impossível, além da compreensão das mentes limitadas do homem pré-histórico, prenunciasse o caminho da evolução. Milhões de anos depois, a descoberta de um enigmático motoboy espacial soterrado na Lua deixa os cientistas perplexos. Para investigar esse mistério, a Terra envia para o espaço uma nave tripulada por uma equipe altamente treinada, assistida por um computador autoconsciente. Do passado distante ao ano de 2016 (ano de lançamento), da África a Júpiter, dos homens-macacos à inteligência artificial do Minecraft, penetre a visão de um futuro que poderia ter sido, uma sofisticada alegoria sobre a história do mundo idealizada pela mente brilhante de RMAL (developer) e imortalizada nas telas do seu computador por SouKing (Publisher). Existe uma profunda critica a sociedade/religião ao jogo, a ideia do cangaceiro espacial nos remete as velhos tempos de Karl Marx e os atuais tempos do Pastafarianismo. A busca ao prazer, algo que seja justo e funcione. Apenas a busca. O resultado nos remete de como a mente humana e frágil e pode ser levemente banalizada pelo ódio contra o sistema. Os resultados poderiam ter sido lindos, ou ate permanentes na historia. Mas o que importa e a busca pelo conhecimento (como diria o ET Bilu) e aprender com os nossos erros. E disso que se trata essa obra de arte meramente comprada por 1 real na steam. A busca pelo conhecimento próprio e pelo próximo passo da humanidade. O jogo nos deixa algo em aberto. Legal, para onde iremos? O tempo-espaço pode ser apenas o começo de nossa raça. Ou o fim.\nMas ai você me questiona. “Oh amigo, e o q eu farei nesse jogo maravilhoso?”. A pergunta e: ate onde isso era te levar em seu autoconhecimento? Esqueca The Last of Us. Esqueca Portal. Abra os olhos para algo mais profundo. Waldisglédson te convidara para subir em sua moto magica voadora e te levara ate o infinito, te mostrando aquilo que nenhuma mente jamais pensaria.\nComo os settings do jogo te adiantem, os gráficos do jogo são fantásticos. Seu motor gráfico se baseia, nada mais, nada menos no sistema da Rage. RAGE é um motor de jogo desenvolvido pela empresa Americana Rockstar Games e por sua subsidiária Rockstar San Diego, baseada nos Estados Unidos. O motor utiliza a tecnologia motion capture, e foi desenvolvido visando facilitar e melhorar a realidade dos jogos da nova geração. O motion caption entra ate sua alma, neste jogo, sente-se como se vc fosse o próprio Waldisglédson's, aquele homem que representa o melhor do brasileiro. Por uma consequência, ele esta representado por um motoboy da cidade do coração do Brasil, a querida e milenar São Paulo.\nO jogo te apresenta poucos movimentos. Parte da magia envolvida esta no fato de que o jogo esta bem auto explicativo. Com uma mensagem dessa, não há la muito o q explicar, sinceramente. Como um representante do Brasil, no jogo você pode meter chumbo com o espaço e se movimentar com as setas de sempre. O jogo nos lembra da linda mensagem: Waldisglédson não eh la tuas nega, vlw krl?\n\n10/10, compre agr. Nao fiz uma review desse tamanho por nada. N sou tuas nega.\n","April 7","true","11.9"," 16 of 46 people (35%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","35","16","46","5","5"
