Having loved the novel from a very early age and adored the Francis Ford Coppola interpretation to screen I am very well versed in the tale of Count Dracula and his abandonment of his faith to become a vampire. Dracula, with all its elements of horror, still to this day remains one of the most enduring love stories of our time and I have lost count the amount of times I have read the original novel or watched the 1993 Oscar winning movie.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=345591197\nThe game doesn't follow the novel to the tee and makes some diversions in plot and characterization which I was honestly fine with since this is an interactive medium. I don't play as many point and click adventures as I would like to these days (It used to be my favorite genre when Sierra and Lucas Arts ruled the gaming roost) so I really enjoyed my time with the game more than I probably would any other adventure game purely because of the Dracula connection. In terms of gameplay it's the standard adventure fare where the player must collect items and use them in conjunction with various other items, characters or places to move the tale along. Also, as with every adventure game known to man, there are some puzzles which simply defy any kind of logic and its a matter of trying various combinations to pass them which can get very tiresome and rather frustrating.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=345592284\nAt just over 10 hours of gameplay, the game doesn't overstay its welcome either. Story and voice acting could have done with a bit of tightening and control. Van Helsing is all over the place tonally often sounding far too excited when he is simply being offered a cup of tea or bored to death when chasing down Dracula for the showdown. The graphics aren't exactly revolutionary but you don't need Nvidia Titans for adventure games so they end up being more than serviceable.\n\nIf you enjoy the Dracula myth and/or puzzle adventure games then give it a try. I can definitely recommend this title.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 12, 2014","true","10.9"," 62 of 74 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","62","74","0","2"

Not the best puzzles and clues in the genre.\n\nMy overall rating: 6/10.

Buy it on sale or in a bundle.  USE SPACE TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN CLICK.  The game nowhere I could find tells you to use space to see what objects are interactive.  Once I figured this out the game got a lot more fun.  Some of the puzzles are fairly easy, some are quite diffiuclt, and one in particular is just insane.  I used a walktrhough for the last puzzle mentioned.  The graphics are decent and the interface is passable yet clunky and confusing at times.  Some of the puzzles use items in ways that nobody in the real world would ever use them.  Using a dead badger carcass as a wine tube for instance.  Sometimes I felt somewhat angry because logic went out the window on a few of the puzzles.  Being made to click through every item in your inventory to find the right one gets old real fast, especially when a more obvious choice is in your inventory.  Hrmmm...should I use the sword to break the lock or the throat lozenge?  Yeah that's right...the throat lozenge.......\n\nOVERALL:  5.5/10","December 13, 2014","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The puzzels presented within Dracula vary in difficulty and complexity and the style of them also changes depending on the location you are in, this is a nice touch and keeps the game moving and engaging for the around 2 - 3 hours you are in a certain area. The story within the game follows a rather cliche plot, and ends abruptly however its enough to keep you going, however for an adventure game where story is usually a mian factor it is a bit of a let down. The sound design is great, with different background music  playing in different areas and ambient noise creating a creepy atmosphere which suits the overall theme of the game.\n\nOverall Dracula Origin is a well designed adventure game and did as a whole keep me interested, I would recommend this game to anyone wanting a casual adventure game that does not last to long but overall tells a short creepy story with clever puzzels. For me $10 is a good price for fun experience you will get, however if you are not that into adventure games I would recommend waiting for a sale.\n\nOverall 8/10.\n","January 3, 2014","true","17.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Puzzles were challenging, the voice acting was decent, the atmosphere was perfect for a gothic vampire theme.  I appreciated how the puzzles reflected the game and weren't stand alone like in many other games; for example, you had to figure out the demons from normal animals or puzzles relating to dark arts.  The music was okay, it got a little repetitive when trying to figure out a puzzle.  My only complaint is I think they took out the see through top of the succubus from this game.  You can find it in a couple of screenshots, but after playing the game recently I think they just zoomed in on her face for that particular scene.  I was waiting to screenshot it myself! Censorship is kind of annoying.   The story was great too adding to the historical lore of Dracula in detail.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chazisop/recommended/11050/","chazisop","chazisop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chazisop/","572 products in account","There is a number of problems with this game.\n\nFirst off, a thing many adventures used to pull in earlier times, the "click every single corner of the map to find a miniscule object". The moody pallete of the game, although good for the feeling of the source material, makes this even worse. A black veil on top of a tomb that could have been an aristic depiction of shadow? A metallic grey pulley in the ceiling with grey cinder blocks in the background. Yeah, not a lot of fun having to resort to a walkthrough to find those.\n\nThe puzzles overall are good and the game's strongest point, although be warned it is old-school. You will find no instructions, hints or a skip button. It is up to you to decide if this is your thing or not. Personally I feel like that some puzzles would need at least some form of hint from the protagonist (e.g. the pentagram puzzle).\n\nThe atmosphere is hit and miss, with the Cairo music being probably the worst. Even worse and probably the worse part of the game excluding "hidden objects" is some of the interactions. Need water that hasn't touched the ground? Just take some from a trough and boil it. Throw a jar of bugs at a bug-eating minion that ignores you completely might sound weird but can be explained to morality, if only you didn't set another minion ablaze later. Make a key out of a strange goo (don't ask) and pretzels in front of the innkeeper you want to trick and he is none the wiser or use a dead beaver as part of a funnel system. And the list of absurd interactions goes on.\n\nUnless it comes heavily discounted or part of a bundle, avoid. If you find it discounted, have patience, a walkthrough for the "hidden items" and want to have a few laughts, buy it, Frogwares has moved on to better games since, so at least you are helping them.","July 7, 2014","false","11.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I played The Testament of Sherlock Holmes first from the same developers before, that was a lot more enjoyable and modern. In this one the player doesn't have a free camera and it was annoying.

I can't say they put any effort in the game aside of the visuals. (One scene that stood out as particularly beautiful is the Viennese library <3) Overall my rating is 2/5, kinda bland, boring game, not engaging, but not overly horrible either.

The graphics of the game are a little bit older than 2008 that the game was launched. They're very tolerable if you consider the company as such I presaid. But as this company also created all the Sherlock Holmes Series I would say that I expected more at this point, even from the older Sherlock Holmes games. Maybe they didn't have the funds because when Focus Home Interactive published the last Sherlock Holmes creations of Frogwares the games in the graphic sector were totally different.\nDon't try any more settings than the given as you'll NOT see any difference. The game is played in 4:3 resolution monitors. Yes, even to that they miscalculated. I played the game in my widescreen 1920x1080 monitor without streching the picture and I would say that I lost a riddle and used a walkthrough because I couldn't make the letters on a notepad to decypher a text. You'll aso laugh at start when you see your character without a shadow.\nThe videos are looking good and fair. You'll not have issues there comparing to the game resolution.\n\nThe sounds are fair too. The voices are fair enough to the overall quality of the game. Though, I would say it has very few music tracks. BUT they all match the scenes very well.\n\nThe story is very interesting. Really Dracula. You'll love it and it will keep you playing till the end. The style as written may be Gothic but what you'll see is sometimes AGAINST Gods Will and humanity. So, please, DON'T gift this game to children and completely FORBID them to buy it. Even teenagers or adults with fragile stomach will be affected by the scenes. We talk about "Rituals", Cannibalism, tortures. That kind of things.\nBack to the story I would say that it unfolds as much as you search. It is the only way to progress. You can NOT avoid it. To solve the riddles the game has to be triggerred that you know the facts. So, keep it in mind. And you'll find it very interesting. You maybe compare it to the book. I started the game as I thought it was a lite one but it took me about 13 hours with solving all puzzles except two. The first reason was about resolution and the second because in a riddle the game was NOT specific enough(picture with wolves). The ONLY GREAT disappointment.. A very short END.\n\nThe riddles are good for an adventure. Like the style of "Big Fish Games" in deeper thinking tricks and Hard tracks. Many puzzles awaited to be solved by the adventurers. BUT they are NOT so Hard anyway. Common logic and many tries to figure out the logic of the puzzle as professor Van Helsing says all the time. I didn't use a walkthrough in any of them except the ones presaid. If you want you can use the SPACE key to reveal the interaction areas, something that is written on manual ONLY. You'll find there your first walkthrough of the game that introduce you to the logic of what kind of puzzles you'll solve. I read it at the end so.. when I faced the first puzzle I said "Yes, what now?" and tried many things to solve it. I did it and I am happy for that as I saw what I explained earlier. RTFM is the piece of advice for me even all those        playing years. I can't say I was very happy of the quality and kind of all riddles. I wanted more of all kind as a Hard Core gamer I am like stronger logic, different kind of riddles of good quality and many more. The riddles are like many Mini games.\n\nThe game is very good as I finish here and the adults who have the stomach should buy it. The story surely will keep them up. They'll travel in many locations and the interest will grow more all the time. I will surely play the sequel.. Dracula Love kills","May 7, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This isn't quite on par with their detective-centric offerings, but it's okay, and unintentionally hilarious at several points.\n\nAs the the title of the game would indicate, Dracula Origin explains how everyone's favorite vampire got into the blood-sucking immortality business, and why. A lot of globetrotting, in part to try and save one of Drac's victims, uncovers a trail of mystical entanglements and less-than-ideal choices made by several parties that unleashed the vampiric curse upon the world.\n\nThere's not that much to say for the game, in fairness. It's a fun if not particularly memorable romp, with decent puzzles and nothing too frustrating. The frequent changes of scenery are a nice touch, and the story reads well enough, despite being a bit cliche. In some ways, I feel the game's core revelation kind of takes the ♥♥♥♥ out of Dracula, and one wonders if he'd be wearing a fedora and making whiny YouTube videos had either been invented in his time. And if he were real. i guess that's a sticking point as well.\n\nBut yeah, it's okay. You could play worse.\n\nHere's what I was talking about re: fedoras, by the way. It's technically a spoiler, but the very description of the game spoils the same thing, so... eh. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty38m8nnyfY","January 8","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
