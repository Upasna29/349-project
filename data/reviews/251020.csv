I'm not alone in this issue, a quick check of the forums shows a thread with several people reporting.\n\nIf I had to say based on the screenshots alone I's aay think about it. It certainly looks good, it looks better than Railworks and Trainz, but those two titles (and a host of others not on Steam) have the massive advantage of being playable.\n\nSo, currently, as of right now it's not worth it. If it gets fixed I'll actually check out the game's content, the furthest I've got is an error screen on launch so far\n\nIf you've read this far, go grab a cookie or a sandwich and thank ya\n\nIf you want the short version, look up at the top. Not recommended.. It should say Not Recommended....YET\n\nBecause when this gets fixed I have a feeling it may well turn out to be a sleeper gem of a simulator...but for now save your money and wait for a fixed version to be uploaded to Steam or find a workaround yourself.","June 9, 2014","false","3.5"," 97 of 137 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","97","137","3","5"

However, this program lets you control cars, trucks, planes and ships... Even if they are on invisible track.\n\nThe track-based "control points" allows for a good range of flexibility, including sequenced control of transferring freight from one vehicle to another using a crane that you can actually drive.\n\nI have to say, that driving a crane and using it to transfer freight between vehicles, is something I have not seen implemented in any simulator, ever.\n\nI have to warn you though, there is no AI in this game so you have to set either contacts or routes for the trains, then they follow the path you set for them via control circuits.\n\nThe Control circuit design is completely up to you, letting them handle the layout for you the way you want to, without the hassle of assigning priorities and such.\n\nSo, I fully recommend this to anyone that's interested in creating routes and automating them for the player to use because honestly, there are features that I haven't seen in any other game / simulator, including trainz and rail works.\n\nIt does have a large learning curve though, so if you're prepared to put up with that, railroad X can be a very rewarding experience.","November 3, 2014","true","224.6"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","22","26","2","0"

It is a simulator for model railway design, building, and then running of your dream layouts, and a very sophisticated one at that. You will need to read the manual and perhaps watch some youtube tutorials ( Ruud Boer's as other reviews have mentioned ), but once you have the basics down you can create some really nice layouts fairly quickly. A huge library of models and rolling stock is included, with many more available ( at a price ) on the eep online shop. If you are a builder or creator as opposed to a driver, I would very highly recommend Railroad X.

This nicely fits in as a train sim which can hold its own. Positives: Significant amount of options regarding content, editing, multi-layered complexity. Animated individuals are the best even better than Railworks. Why? Because they employ collision detection and move nicely around other characters  although they will go through objects. Not like Railworks which go through things and other characters. Also more animation on them like the woman who is using her cellphone. Nice touch! Great range of trains and rolling stock. For example I like the TGV. None of the current Train players have any TGV trains included in the content. And as varied as they are.  So if some of you are whining about some cost issues keep in mind the trains and stock beats hands down the trains and stock in Trainz or Railworks. Both of these latter you'll have to buy separately comparable stock if they exist or buy a ticket (Auran's Trainz) to download the freeware stock.\n\nYou can make large routes and so this is not just limited to a so-called table-top type creation.\n\nLove the choice in  animated animals such as a flock of pigeons flying over your train station, or those fish in the river, or as your train is going in the country animated farm animals and farm equipment.\n\nThere are various animated industries for your train route.\n\nLove the environmental editing features: scales for controlling, wind, rain, fog,  snow, clouds or random. You can  isolate areas of your route for different types of weather. So for example your train may be moving from a warm dry area, climb to higher levels and you can start to experience snow and a driving wind - all zones you are free to create.\n\nLike the choices of rail types and catenaries, gantries, platforms, etc. No shortage.\n\nHuge number of animated grasses. No shortage of various trees.\n\nHuge number of base textures to paint your world with.\n\nWide variety of sounds easily added to the layout or make your own.\n\nYou can use the Omega feature.This is a novel and quite exciting addition to the animated people.  You can make your animated people do certain things like go down stairs as if they are leaving the platform, checking out the  arrivals/departures. They can be constrained in certain areas. Lots to learn and adapt here for your train world. You can also use the animated people  on invisible tracks to walk up and down platforms and in buildings. For example, I have a river going through the city with people walking up and down the  sidewalk by the river enjoying the scenery. All the while a sailboat is sailing by on invisible tracks set in the water and flocks of birds are flying overhead complete with sounds of all sorts.\n\nYou can use invisible tracks for many other things such as helicopters, planes which bring life to your layout.\n\nWide use of cameras. You can hop in a car for example (clicking on it) and all of a sudden you're being taken for a nice ride around your city wherever you've made the road paths or if in a train on your train route.  Cameras can be placed strategically and triggered by events such as a train arriving at a station.\n\nThere are certain train engines you can actually enter and drive. Hope this is improved as time goes on.\n\n\nCan't access the PDF help from within the game. If you have Windows 8.1 will need to right click the pdf file and use the reader. Editor takes some getting used to as there consists of the 2D editor  and 3D editor, Tunnels through mountains is an exercise in huge frustration. Better to make a flat plain, make your tunnels, then raise terrain over. There are excellent english tutorials on You Tube - Ruud Boer. Thanks to his tutorials will make route creation a lot easier.\n\nSearching for content in the game is not easy and seems limited (right clicking a folder for example).\n\nLayers: These appear to be handled by clicking off certain things such as properties for example. The buildings will disappear allowing you to manipulate objects which would have otherwise been impeded by the properties.\n\nContent creation: Where is the facility for this? The content is in the 3DM format which the Rhino 3D program is known for. Every other competitive Train programs lets its members freely make content. For Trainz as an example I'm making a route in Strasbourg, France. I can freely create my own content in custom buildings, stations, etc. by using any number of 3D programs such as Blender or Sketchup. With the plug-in for Sketchup or Blender (or 3DS Max) the content is easily inserted in the route. I don't want to use buildings which have nothing to do with the area I'm creating. If you protect your content like the family jewels than you are inhibiting creativity and interest.\n\nCAUTION: The  Mod  here who appears to be a developer with EEP stated the Norstructor program a plug-in to make your own content would work in Railroad X. Well I bought it, installed it and it won't allow me to run the program. Appears it is searching for the EEP version and not Railroad X and thus wont install. Moreover, I thought I'd purchase the EEP-X Basic so I'd be able to use it. A folder called Trend is created and both the Nostruktor and EEP-X each have a folder inside it. Problem: Still doesn't work! Moreover, you can't operate both the Steam version Railroad X and EEP-X. It's either one but not both. To go back to Railroad X you'll have delete Railroad X and reinstall it - this will concurrently deinstall EEP-X. Wow. I did this just so I could use Nostrucktor only to find it doesn't work anyway. Now I'd be looking for my hard earn money back. This has to be a significant negative. Anyone not making German routes, everywhere outside of Germany, France, Britain, etc. North and South America,  will be severely disappointed because of the issue of personalized content creation. There is very good and high quality content on the pay site but not having personalized content creation is a significant negative. All the major players in RR simulation have an abundance of  content creation because of the ability to personalize your layouts.\n\nNOTE: Good news! Have been advised that Nostrucktor will be made available and compatible with RR X in a few weeks.\n\nSuggest Heights Explorer from the site in route creation. I"ve purchased this. With this program I can take a Google image of a layout and with the height aspect imported for use as the base for the layout. It can also generate numerous images for use. For those wanting to use Google images without messing around with that I'd suggest a neat little converter program from this site: http://www.mm2eep.de/.  Downloading and installing will allow you to use the base objects as a base for the Google images. That way you can overlay your tracks, objects, etc. on top.\n\nThere have been several crashes  and it's wise to have the auto saving feature on while constructing or save often. Specs:  i7-920 9 gbs and ZOTAC GTX 650Ti 2 gb card with 340.52 driver.\n\nConclusion:\nUPDATE: MARCH 6/15. NO NOSTRUCKTOR!!! Are you kidding me! This program is a heaven for content exploitation. If you can't make your own content then this program to me is dead in the water! Get that bloody program on its feet and then this game will deserve a platinum badge. Now, it's time to degrade it.","July 1, 2014","false","221.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","3"

I know the EEP series from the very beginning and Railroad X is another of its development.\nFirst of all, it's a simulation of model railway, not real trains. If you want train simulator, buy Train Simulator or eventually Trainz.\nRailroad X (EEP 10) is for everyone who did not have enough space at home to build their own railroad model. It is more an application than a game. This allows you to build very complex automatically controlled railroad systems, imagination is the only limit. You can control not only trains - also road, water and even air traffic.\nI must admit that the editor is complicated (so many options which you don't know at the beginning) and requires patience but once it is mastered, it works instinctively. The only thing that is awful, is a camera control in free view - never, from the very beginning, it has not been fixed...\nIf you want to become better acquainted with Railroad X, you need to book yourself plenty of time... Building even a simple model takes a long time, if you want it to look really nice. To compare your abilities, there are a few finished models with EEP.\nIf you like to build a railway models and maps, have a lot of free time and patience, Railroad X is created for you.","August 24, 2015","true","6.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I seem to be the only one to occur this problem so that's not why I don't recommend it.\n\nIt's more because a) everything costs money and b) the devs seem to hate Steam. Let me go into detail:\n\na) You want to get modding tools or plugins? Pay! You want to make your modded content available for everyone? You are not allowed to share them unless your content has been approved by the devs to be sold on their store. You need help with the game not running? Call a hotline and pay!\n\nb) A not that small part of Steam's existence is due to the convenience of having everything in one place and most stuff is automated. Not with Railroad X though, as you are greeted by an installer interface once you install, uninstall or verify your content (it even wants to remove the game when you want to verify content). Not a big deal but it adds to my argument.\n\nNext thing is the devs are not very active in the forums. If you have critical problems like I do, you are asked to call a hotline. It may be faster than an email or a forum post but it costs money as stated above.\n\nAbout DLC: the most of them is available only on their store. I don't know if Steam get's their cut or not, but it is not as convenient as it would be here.\n\nFor the prices they ask for everything both here on Steam as well as on their shop, you thought they would have the time, patience and staff available to give a Steam user the experience he feels familiar with - turns out they don't.\n\nThe verdict: The game is probably ok (except I haven't been able to play it for a long time) but the way the devs interact with Steam is not satisfying and their price tags on modding tools and the like is unheard-of.

A bit time consuming to create a good furnished route, but well worth the effort. Don't be put off by the somewhat crude models as in game they appear somewhat better. The level of control of all the vehicles is very good and it's easy to set up multiple trains and road vehicles. For example you can have many trains on the same track controlled as in real life by block signals. You can set some trains to stop at stations while others pass through without stopping. Not much that you cannot do as regards automating a full and complex layout.\nNow for the downside. The EEP shop..... Items purchased are linked to your registration number.
