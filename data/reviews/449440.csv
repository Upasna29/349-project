"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/449440/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5483 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe Big Elk is a casual, fun and rather unique top down shooter where you play as an Elk (it's actually a Moose I think) trying to protect his forest homeland from various invaders.  Some of these invaders include gun totting Christmas trees, penguins, Jello molds and other interesting and humorous enemies.  This isn't your mommy and daddies (as a 35 year old man I feel totally comfortable saying mommy and daddy...) Rocky and Bullwinkle, this is like Rambo and Bullwinkle had a child who slaughters Christmas themed enemies at any time of the year, with impunity.  While I played the game I threw my voice to talk like Sylvester Stallone in some of his more memorable roles..  like "You can take my life, but you can never take my freedom!!",  (I kid, I kid, everyone knows that line comes from Braveheart)  My actual quotes while I played were more along the lines of "Stop or my mom will shoot" and Adrian...   Anyway\n\nBeing that it's a top down shooter (with tower defense elements) you roll around one of three types of weapons, a Blunderbus shooting drumsticks, a rocket spewing rocket launcher and the penultimate carrot chain gun, the gun play and movements are fluid, the sounds are decent enough, and I'd say it would be a pretty safe bet to allow younger kids to play without much fear, as you aren't using bullets, real guns, nor are any of the enemies other humans.  The total and utter lack of blood also doesn't hurt in the young kid playing department.\n\nThe game has 10 game zones, which are broken up into smaller little zones, where you have various task to complete, some are as mundane as going from left to right, others require you to go hog-wild and mow down hordes of enemies, whether they be slimes, meat pies, even some Jello Molds,  while some others may see you dodging various enemies or blasting through piles of ice or rock.\n\nPro's\n\nSilky smooth movements\ngood gun play\ndecent sounds which\nchallenging yet surprisingly casual game-play\ncasual pick up and play type game\n\nCon's\n\nLack of controller support (this can be a positive to some, but I'm a controller fanatic)\nI want some Moose/Elk Trading cards dang it..\n\nRecommendation\n\nThis can be a fun game experience that can be enjoyed by just about everyone.  While not the most overly complex game, The Big Elk has a charm about it, maybe it's the cute looking creatures, or the obvious Christmas themed enemies, after playing the game it will grow on you... (not like a fungus,) and you'll soon find yourself thinking about playing it when you aren't.. Eventually you'll stand to do moose calls in your basement and try to speak with animals like in the movie Brother Bear.  I'd say pick it up if you are a fan of casual games or have a child you want to get into video games without fear of having them turn into a brainless zombie who goes on a murderous rampage later on in life.  (ok in all honesty I don't think playing video games, especially nice family friendly games like this!!)\n\nSo if you have a couple of bucks just wasting away in your steam wallet, and like myself can't find anything to play, give The Big Elk a try, just remember to be gentle, the forest creatures are your friends.  SIKE!!! KILL THEM ALL!!!","April 3","true","5.1"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","19","24","4","4"

In the summer Anatoliy is a sheep herder and during the winter when the weather is too cold to do that job he becomes a game designer. That might sound a little funny to some of you but to me that sounds like a cool life. Although this is his first game on Steam he has created other games in the past. He claims to have a very old computer that doesn’t allow him to make videos for his games and this would explain the simplicity of them.\n\nSimplicity at its best can generate fascinating games that are open to a broad audience. Though it’s still in early access I believe that that is the case with The Big Elk. It’s a top-down shooter with animal themes that suits Anatoliy’s background. It’s a clever take on the genre that contains a number of elements, varied enemy types and a number of different tools that you can utilize to your benefit in taking down the enemy.\n\nEach area has a number of different game zones that you need to successfully complete in order to progress through to the next one. Once you complete one part of the game more areas of the game open up to you to play. I believe that players also have options in which level they play next – some of the time. There is a smart tutorial at the beginning of the game that does a good job of teaching players the basics and once completed starts you on your path by opening up the first non-tutorial level of the game.\n\nI do like the art style in the game. Although it is the telltale sign of how simple the game is at its core it is immaculately presented and is pleasing to the eyes. The music while not quite as good as the graphics is more than suitable for the game. The biggest problem with the game at the moment is that there may be too little ammunition offered in the game – I run through the ammo that I have very quickly and/or things take longer to kill than what you have ammo for, whichever way you choose to look at it). The other issue that I have with the game is that you cannot change any options (e.g. turn volume up or down, etc.) within the game. These are the two areas that I would work on aside from making the game more Steamified by adding trading cards and achievements (which according to the dev himself are on the way).\n\nThis is a game suitable for people of all ages because there is no gore and the action that is in the game is very basic. At its price its a good buy and one that fans of shooters should try.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","true","3.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","1"

Note that my ability to enjoy a game is not influenced by how I recieved it. If you would like to see the TL;DR, go to the summary at the bottom of the review.\nThe Big Elk is a wacky top-down shooter where, as the name suggests, you play as a rather large elk.\n\nAs a story isn't exactly applicable for a game like this, it wouldn't be worth describing a lack of story. What would be worth describing is the complete and utter lack of explaining anything. There's top hat wearing penguins and circling orb-ducks... everything is just complete and utter chaotic moose mayhem. Whilst this randomness does make the game unique in a way, a simple explanation of why an elk is interested in shooting up gun-weilding trees would have been sufficient.\n\nThroughout your time playing, you will fight your way through a collection of levels consisting of a wide variety (and completely random) enemies using a small (slightly too little) variety of weapons. There will be more weapons added to the game throughout the Early Access period. A more major problem with the weapons is the minimal amount of ammunition given. This can prove to be quite a significant hindrance and cause a disruption to the flow of the gameplay.\n\nEven with these weapons, you can decide to access the more unique side of the game by setting up a base and using different strategies to make your eradication of the giant hamburgers more efficient. This side to the gameplay adds some interesting tower-defence elements, keeping the gameplay refreshing. The only problem with this aspect is that you need money to set up your base, and like your ammo there isn't enough of it. Even with these problems, the gameplay still comes out as enjoyable.\n\nThe Big Elk has a simplistic art style as I think you would have managed to figure out from the screenshots. It definitely suits the game and adds a unique charm.\n\nWhilst the in-game music is relatively enjoyable to listen to, there's nothing about it that warrants it a spot on the 'Pros' list down below.\n\nThe game also has a distinct lack of options, with the only two ones being the ability to change to fullscreen and adjust the volume. There is also a lack of controller support which may come as a disappointment to some.\n\n\nSummary:\nPros:\n✔ Enjoyable gameplay\n✔ Variety of enemies\n✔ Interesting tower-defence elements\n✔ Nice, simplistic artstyle\n\nCons:\n✘ No explanation for anything\n✘ Too limited ammo + money\n✘ Lack of options and controller support\n\nConclusion:\nThe Big Elk is an enjoyable and unique little game. It is fairly priced, but I would only really recommend it for those who are fans of the genre.\n\nRating: 6.8/10\n\nDid you enjoy that review?

So the perfect Game for Christmas I would say. Anyways the elk moves around very smooth and also the shooting works very good and also the different weapons make the Game great fun (machine guns, flame throwers and many more). So as far as I figured out, the goal of the Game is to clear different areas from different enemies (penguins, meat blocks and other Christmas related stuff). To get around in the Game the big elk has of course a big helicopter which can rescue whenever you are in danger. But seriously you are a big elk with a machine gun why should you need help while fighting against a few penguins (pfffff).\nAnyways the Game is really fun to play although it has no controller support yet. The controls are very simple and you can immediately start to play the Game. Perfect for Christmas haters or other people that want to have some fun in their spare time killing innocent Christmas trees.\nWhatever I totally suggest you to buy the Game for around 3$. Also a great present for some friends next Christmas!\nRating:\n8.4/10\n\nPros:  Well-made Game\nFunny enemies\nSimple controls\nA lot of different weapons\nWorks also on older devices\nWell-chosen music and sounds\nCons: No Controller Support\nNo Achievements + Trading Cards\n\nHardware Information\n\nHardware   Type     Monitor   BENQ 24 inch 1ms    Headphones   Apple Earpods    Keyboard   Dell Basic Keyboard/ Integrated Alienware Keyboard     Controller   Xbox 360    Mouse   Zelotes T-90    Microphone   Integrated Laptop Micro    OS   Windows 7","March 23","true","3.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

Well your goal mostly at all levels is to kill all enemies and reach a target point. But you will find also some levels with different tasks, for example run between enemies without touching them etc. For all this you have 10 zones and all this zone have different levels with different enemies. Also you can use a enough various strategies to the kill enemies, for example build a base, use a air strike etc. The control in a game is enough good, also a tutorial well explain how to play it. The game graphic is simple, but well represented this world. The sounds and music are well fit to gameplay.\n\n+ various and funny enemies\n+ steam achievements and trading cards\n+ nice retro style music\n+ challenging gameplay\n+ various weapons\n+ some mini games\n\n- no co-op\n-  ammo run out too fast\n\nSo if you just look at a pictures of this game , you can think this is a another silly game, anyway this is not true. This game can be enough deep thanks for a lot of different enemies, various weapons and strategical variation, If you like this sort of game i easily can recommend it for you, especially if this game get a coop mode.","April 23","true","3.7"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/recommended/449440/","metroretrogaming","[ᴸᴼᴳ]Metro Retro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/","1465 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroductionPublished and  developed by Anatoliy Loginovskikh, The Big Elk is a top down shooter that mixes RPG elements within the gameplay. The game soon turns into a hectic shooter, that makes you run around avoid getting hit but trying to kill the enemies at the same time.\n\nGameplayFrom the trailer of the game, it looks like a very fast paced hectic, top down shooter that requires a lot of precision and well timed shots in order to win. There are some tower defence elements that are mixed into this game as well as a few weapon types that you can pick up to kill enemies that are in your way. For a game like this, you would expect there to be unlimited ammunition. But this game takes a different turn, it requires you to be careful with where you shoot and requires you to be careful with your ammo consumption, this does mean that sometimes you will be running around and you might not find any ammunition for a while. There is a decent amount of areas that you can gain access after you have completed a few levels in order to progress through to the next stage.\n\nThe game does a nice job at setting out the tutorial at the beginning of the game. It does well with telling you how each mechanic works in the tutorial, teaching you the basics and once you have completed the tutorial your path is open to the actual levels that you can play. The game seems to be partly nonlinear, the player is given a option to complete the levels in whatever order they want. Obviously, not all the levels are instantly unlocked, but there is some choice in the levels that you can play as you unlock them throughout the game. The enemies that you fight are rather humorous at times and can be rather wild at times, sometimes I was even unsure what these enemies where. For some reason this game reminds me of the classic game on the N64 called Fur Fighters, although I doubt that most of you have heard of that game. It's a little similar to this game but for me it reminded me of that game.\n\nI love the simplistic art style for this game, the game's graphics represent the way that the game is played and is usually the first thing that most players look upon when playing the game. It's simplistic art style and frame animation is well designed, along with the enemies frame animations that are well presented, but the main focus would be upon the player.\n\nThe music and sound of this game seem to be well fairly crisp and well designed for this type of game. Although the music at times did seem a little out of place for the type of gameplay that this game is trying to be.\n\nPros+ Slightly nonlinear gameplay\n+ A well made game\n+ Lots of weapons to use\n+ Steam Achievements & Trading Cards\n\nCons- Sometimes too limited ammunition\n\nResult / Final thoughtsTo summarize, The Big Elk is a fast paced RPG top down shooter with a small amount of tower defence elements mixed into the game at various points in the game. The gameplay has limited ammunition, that can sometimes be a downfall to the game as you may be running around looking for some. Other than that the game is rather fun and addicting to play, I would possibly like to see maybe a local multiplayer co-op option as the game progresses through it's early access stage.\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.","April 10","true","2.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","3"
