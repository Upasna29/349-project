It might not do anything very different iin comparison to other games in this genre, but it does it exceptionally well. The artstyle is clean and fits very well. There is also a lot of variety and manages to keep you entertained all the time by introducing new elements. I would recommend this game for people that loves puzzle games and loves to get a challenge.","August 26, 2015","true","3.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The colorful aesthetics are great, the levels are complex and challenging, and it's clear that the game's development team put serious effort into its design. It's a fairly short game and I recommend picking it up.","September 8, 2015","true","17.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The first world levels, at least, were fun and it's easy to see how complex gameplay is going to emerge over the suceeding levels. The interface is nice and clean. A solid thinking puzzler.","December 23, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But any way if you like puzzle games get this its quite a fun little game and really doesn't cost much.","February 16","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
