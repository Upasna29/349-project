It's not about the gameplay; the gameplay is fine, and always has been. But I found this port to be rife with technical issues.\n\nThis game is buggy. My god, this game is buggy.\n\nYou probably already know what Canabalt is, but if not, it's a very simplistic game where you play as a man running and jumping across rooftops, and the goal is to earn a high score by running as far as possible before inevitably making a mistake and dying. There's only one button used to jump, but you'll have to learn to aim and adjust that jump to hairpin perfection if you want to survive for long. You speed up the longer you run, and you can trip over boxes to slow down. Problem is, if you are running too slow, you won't be able to jump on rising I-beams in time or run across falling buildings, but if you're running too fast, you won't have time to adjust your jump to land on tiny platforms. So it's all about running into boxes when you need to, and maintaining a perfect pace, hoping the game doesn't throw anything too tricky at you. It's a good balance between skill and luck. Otherwise, that's pretty much it; if you're expecting a game with tons of content, this isn't it. But as far as low-investment casual games go, Canabalt is one of the most tried and true.\n\nThe graphics are stylish and gritty, and the whole immersive atmosphere of an alien invasion is probably the best part of the game. The Danny Baranowsky track "RUN!" is awesome and never seems to get old.\n\nThe new PC port adds some slightly better graphics, and extra features that weren't in the original mobile version. There's a new 2-player mode where you try to run alongside a friend, and your scores are added together for your final total. It's fun for a little while, and if your friend abandons you, it's easy enough to play as two players yourself; it's just one extra button, after all. There are also some new challenge modes, most of which are the same game but with some tweaks, like replacing all the random obstacles with one kind of obstacle. And of course, now we have Steamworks features like cloud synch, trading cards, leaderboards, and achievements.\n\nAdmittedly, it's much harder on a keyboard than it is on a touch screen to make the tiny tap-jumps which the game will sometimes require for your survival, unless you have very thin keys. Luckily, you can also use the mouse.\n\nSo what are my complaints? Well, here are just a few of the issues I ran into:\n\n* The game is not alt+tab friendly at all. After returning from an alt+tab, I've had a wide number of glitches ranging from infinitely looping menus, to disappearing game objects, to soft-locked death screens.\n\n* The game seems to hang a lot in the middle of the run, notably when kicking boxes. I assume this is due to the game buffering the different box kicking sound effects the first time they are played, but it has ruined many runs for me, especially during co-op.\n\n* After some extended co-op sessions with two actual people, we have concluded that there is a bug which periodically causes one player's controls to make the other player jump, even if they're already in midair, causing an awkward and impossible midair jump. It's not something I noticed when controlling two players myself, but it became very apparent with an actual second player.\n\n* Sometimes when you kick a box, another box somewhere else on the screen will mysteriously get kicked also. This is very apparent while running at high speeds on the "box tripper" challenge. This, combined with the "wrong player control" issue described above, indicates that there's some kind of pointer / memory corruption happening.\n\n* On more than one occasion, I've restarted a run and all the buildings were gone, and I kept instantly falling to my death. When I tried to quit, the game soft-locked with a white screen.\n\n* The Game Over menu is very lazily implemented. You can't merely press a button to restart the run, but you have to use the arrow keys or the mouse to select the "restart" option. The default option on the Game Over menu depends on where your mouse cursor is at the time you died; so if you make sure your mouse cursor is at the bottom-right corner of the screen while playing, then you can hit "enter" to restart the run when you die. Otherwise you might open the options or something.\n\n* Kicking a box immediately after coming out of a roll from a high jump will sometimes cause the character's running animation to freeze, making him look like he's skating across the rooftops.\n\n* Very wonky physics at high speeds; on at least two occasions I've jumped straight through solid objects at breakneck speeds, like when playing the "Panic" challenge.\n\n* The jump button is the only button you can remap, despite the game menus using several other keys.\n\nOverall, I just don't understand why something so simple as Canabalt can be screwed up and left without so much polish for a proper PC release. I mean, this is not a complex game; would it really have been that hard not to leave in so many bugs?\n\nIf you just want an occasional run across the rooftops in single player on your PC instead of your phone, this port seems to hold up in that regard -- although you can also just Google "Canabalt" and play a web version of it completely for free. I am just disappointed that what was supposed to be a definitive version of a great game is, in the end, just a lazy mobile port.\n\nAchievement hunters: this is not an easy 100%. Not that there's anything wrong with that from a game design perspective (though some might raise objections that the game expects you to survive for 40,000 meters with so many random luck elements involved), but just don't expect to get the last few achievements unless you're very persistent and dedicated.","June 27, 2015","false","20.7"," 45 of 59 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","45","59","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/358960/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Man, I hope you were there when Canabalt first appeared back in 2009. It was such a mystifying experience, playing this intense, engrossing Flash game on some random dude's website. They say it was the first of the endless runner genre, and even if it weren't, it would deserve a place of honor among them.\n\nYou'll never know who your hapless lady or fellow is, or why their city is being annihilated by shadowy engines of destruction, but you won't have much time to wonder, either. Canabalt is a one-button game, and that button is jump. Your character runs to the right at an ever-increasing clip, and you need to jump them from rooftop to rooftop to billboard to girder to whatever else is in your path. Each run is randomized, with obstacles, crumbling buildings, windows, and occasional attacks from the marauding machines.\n\nIt's a simple premise, but the presentation takes it to another level. Set to pulse-pounding tracks, your journey through the chaos is all in silky-smooth, heavily-detailed gray-scale. Flocks of birds take flight as you charge past, the engines of destruction level buildings in the layered background, and stranger things still float past if you make it far enough. And if the presentation wasn't enough, there's a layer of strategy to the game as well. Letting your runner build up too much speed makes them hard to control, so sometimes you need to strategically hit an obstacle or two to slow them down.\n\nA few of the obstacles, like the windows and walker legs, are quite difficult to overcome and can end some runs in frustration, but they hardly ruin the game. This HD version also comes with a 3D mode that stays true to the look and feel of the original, 8 challenge runs with different themes, and a two-player mode that can be played solo as a very interesting test of coordination. The original might be free, but if you have any love for infinite runners this will be a worthy addition to your library.","January 4","true","2.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","19","23","2","1"

It's just a fact. I've started trying to play the games for a bit to get some first impressions, and thus started my "First Impression Review" - just a quick look at the first hour/few hours of a game. If you're looking for something more in-depth, look elsewhere.\n\nCanabalt is, quite obviously, an inifinte running game. From what I've gathered, it was one of the front-runners of the genre. It is a port from mobile devices to the PC, and includes new 3D graphics. 2D graphics are enabled by default, but it's easy to switch back and forth. I found the 2D version easier to play, because the boxes have no shadowing, making it easier to determine exactly where they are located, and when to jump.\n\nThe colour scheme is rather dreary - variations of grey and black and white, all rather monochrome - however it is very clean. The controls, or rather, control, is as simple as could be, and the game is responsive. This is crucial since it is the core aspect of the game. There is enough variation and randomness in the game/level design to make things interesting. You have windows at varying heights you must jump through, buildings which crumble and start to drop as you land on them, and of course boxes to jump over. I was pleased to see that the boxes are not an instant death, but rather slow you down. Going too slow means you will be unable to jump high/far enough to reach the next building, but it can be useful if used correctly to slow down slilghtly.\n\nThere are something like 7-9 levels which feature different themes. On one, the building are invisible, and one must use the birds perched on the roofs to determine where to run and land. There are no boxes in this mode, thankfully; at least, none that I've encountered. Another features aliens randomly drilling into buildings, making it so that you have to (very quickly) alter your course to land on the drill bit, in the middle of the building. Another features a plethora of boxes. The one I found most interesting played with the windows mechanic, and required more estimation based on your speed to determine when to jump to fall enough to break through a window below you.\n\nThe randomised elements obviously make it so that no two runs are the same, but due to this, some runs will be much easier than others. In the end, the ever-increasing speed means the difference will still be based mostly on skill, however it could have some effect on the leaderboards, if that's something for which you're aiming.\n\nIn the end, this remains a port of a mobile game. The devs did well to price it under $5. This is something I'd purchase on a mobile device for $1, if I were interested in such games. I don't doubt that fans of this genre would enjoy this game, however I grew tired of it very quickly. I'll note that I did not venture into the multiplayer aspect of this game.\n\nI received this game as part of a bundle, and wouldn't recommend it at full price. My short time spent with it gave me an impression of a game done well for its genre, but simply not enough to keep me entertained. It's hard to put a dollar-per-hour or dollar-per-unit of entertainment number on any game, as the first would be misleading, and the second... is very difficult to measure and describe.\n\nBased on the price I paid, I would recommend this game at $1.00 or less.","August 14, 2015","false","2.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/358960/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","The "Endless Runner" genre of games owes it's livelihood to Canabalt. Without this humble little flash game taking the internet by storm, we would have never seen the creation of Temple Run and other classics (Jetpack Joyride, Rayman Jungle Run, etc). While some people may not care for that style of gaming, there is a simplicity within that makes the game extremely addicting and furiously challenging.\n\nThe goal is to simply survive as long as you can. The level is always randomized and will get progressively harder as you stay alive. The speed picks up and new obstacles are thrown at you. You have mere split-seconds to react or die. The simple controls give you enough dominion over your character to make every move; the only thing keeping you back is your reaction time.\n\nThat would be about it for a review, but this Steam version includes the updated port that was released on mobile devices a few years back. With that, you get some "3D" graphics and a 2-player mode with challenges. The 3D is pointless as the sprite work in the original is gorgeous. There is no need to even bother with the remixed visuals.\n\nAs for the 2-player mode, it is a nice touch. I can't say the game is preferable with 2 people, but it certainly is a nice addition for the truly addicted. Challenge mode is where the real thought went. I like how each level is basically a set of stipulations that require you to still react to random levels.\n\nThe only problem is that 2-player mode makes a joke of those challenges. As far as completion goes, you just need to reach a set distance and you've finished the challenge. Since 2-player doubles your score (as long as both players are alive), you end up doing each challenge twice as fast.\n\nYou can up the ante and play both players by your lonesome. It does make for some intense situations where one player drifts away faster than the other. Your brain has problems reacting to two different objects and the outcome is often fatal. Still, I feel like challenge mode could have been expanded for 2-player.\n\nEither way, this updated port is great. It may be a bit late to the game, but nothing is truly wrong with this version. I guess it wouldn't hurt to ask for some more content with challenge mode, but the rest is basically as good as it has ever been.\n\nThe price isn't even bad, either. $3 might seem like a lot, but you will definitely get your moneys worth. If nothing else, the Humble Bundle edition from a few years back came with a Steam key, so you may even own this without knowing.\n\n8/10","May 30, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
