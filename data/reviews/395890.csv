It is really festive and colorful. It also lets you restart levels or replay individual hands (something a lot of solitaire games lack)!\n\nI highly recommend this game for some early Christmas fun! Hope they make another one :)\n\nRuns great on super wide screen monitors and current PC's!","October 4, 2015","true","15.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

I honestly believe it is over priced for the lack luster game play and items you earn. If I paid a few dollars I wouldn't mind but for $10. I say it isn't anything special. It can't hold a candle to other solitaire games that I found on steam. I would not recommend it.","December 20, 2015","false","17.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"
