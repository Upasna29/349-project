Who throws a shoe? Honestly!\n\nVulture brings the quintessential Roguelike, Nethack to life with an updated user interface and graphics. Roguelike has been a heavily abused buzzword in the gaming industry for the past few years plus. "Hey, look! Something random happens in this game...it's a Roguelike!"\nNo...no it is not. Knock it off you.\nThat's not to say I don't play many of those games too but this game is more deserving than any other on Steam to be called a true Roguelike.\n\nVulture isn't perfect and still retains Nethack's learning curve for the uninitiated but more improvements are coming, including a massive update to the graphics, interface, music and more. There's also a fine line in Nethack in regards to the "spoilers." I would encourage players to try playing on Wizard Mode before reading the big book of Nethack spoilers.\n\nP.S.

And while Vulture adds much-needed graphics to NetHack, it doesn't do that great of a job with the interface.\n\n1. Not all possible commands are exposed, so you still need to know the keyboard controls to NetHack, or at least have a reference\n2. The interface is cumbersome to use. If I want to shoot a monster it takes multiple mouse clicks. Something as basic as shooting should be a single click, or keystroke\n3. The interface doesn't remind the player of what keystrokes correspond to what commands. That in my opinion is the biggest failure of Vulture. I could tolerate Vulture as a crutch until I learned all the controls. But since Vulture doesn't teach me what the controls are it's not useful for learning purposes.\n\nVulture is kind of lazy, it's a shell over the controls NetHack already has and does the bare minimum to present those controls.

Just a glance at the Nethack Wiki[nethackwiki.com] will show you just how complex this game is. And the random little reactions certain items have, the times you realize some random piece of junk can actually save your life... this is where Nethack really shines. Little things you pick up along the way (and through multiple runs) eventually make you a hardened, if not always successful adventurer. That lizard corpse you carry at all times, that sprig of wolfsbane, the bundle of unidentified wands, it all reminds you of the times you were less cautious, less knowledgeable of this world you are now a part of.\n\nVulture makes the game incredibly accessible for those with a bit of patience. If you have been at all enamored with any of the titles spawned from the recent resurgence of roguelike games, and are looking for something more substantial, I can wholeheartedly recommend this product.\n\n(Of course, if you feel up to it, you can just dive in to the unaltered game for free.

Out for 3 years already, Vulture finally makes it way onto Steam for the same price as the Desura release.\nThis is a tile and graphical interface for the game "Nethack", making it easier on the eyes and on the controls as it can be controlled with the mouse, using keyboard hotkeys for shortcuts.\n\nThe game opens with no main menu and instead asking your characters name. Similarly, when you die or otherwise end the game, the game closes and requires to be started back up through Steam to play again. You are quickly greeted with some rather off-key music, the volume of which cannot be controlled in the game and must be done through volume mixer. It's very possible to start new games and be unable to leave the first room due to the random dungeon layout. The art style is very inconsistent, at one point It spawned me with an anime robot girl sprite that looked like it was ripped from something else, another time I'd spawn as a very poor 3-d model of a Tourist. Came across a Magic Marker, which was actually just a huge .png of a Sharpie someone had taken from Google. Fountains don't seem to work. There's no real way to examine items you've picked up.\n\nDespite all these things I still kept trying it. It's really nice to have some art associated with things so it's easier to tell what things are at a glance, but I find it hard to recommend to someone over other games or tile packs. Has a really nice 90s Freeware feel to it, so there's that. Avoid if you don't like stolen art, bad music and restarting for the 30th time because you can't leave the first room.","February 3, 2015","false","1.6"," 67 of 105 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","67","105","4","25"

Well, previously, there was only one excuse for that; aversion to ASCII-based graphics.\n\nNow there is no excuse. You cannot seriously call yourself a gamer until you have played NetHack.\n\nNetHack is a game where experimenting is both rewarding and punishing. To say there are a million ways to die in NetHack is an understatement; you WILL die. A lot. I encourage liberal experimentation for your first hundred or so games. This will result in them being over very quickly, and, as a result, you'll learn 100 ways to die and 100 things not to do.\n\nNetHack is THE quintessential roguelike. Heck, NetHack is the second choice for the very definition of roguelike (the first choice being Rogue itself). It's filled to the brim (and above) with content. Paired with the permadeath that defines roguelikes, this gives NetHack a legitimately enormous replay value.\n\nNetHack is BLOODY HARD. As stated before, you will die. A lot. A whole lot. You have to go down roughly 50 floors, with each and every one teeming with foes that can and (given half a chance) will kill you. Then you have to go back UP those 50 floors. This 100-floor fact gets really scary when you see just how easy it is to die on the first few floors.\n\nThat being said, NetHack is also fair. It's been postulated that every game generated is winnable, played by a sufficiently experienced player. There are people that can win many games in a row. Given enough time, you can become one of those people.\n\nDo you, for some reason, not have $3 to pay for this? Google NetHack. There are plenty of ways to play the ASCII version (which, besides graphics, is the exact same thing) for completely free.

It's effectively the follow-on to the original ASCII "Rogue" game. It's pretty ancient.  A good number of you probably weren't even born when NetHack came out.\n\nHere's the TL:DR version:If you want a VERY in-depth and brutal dungeon exploration game, where you will die A LOT, then this really is the one you want to play.\n\nHere's the full version:\nThis is an interface update to a game that's been around (and in almost constant development) since about 1987.\n\nIt was, then, a top-view text game, where a wall might have been expressed with a block: █  and your character was an @.  The floors were all full-stops, and there were so many key-commands to do things that you just got lost.\n\nVulture for Nethack is a graphical update to the original game. It turns those ASCII characters into isometric graphics, and takes some of those awkward keypress commands and puts them into menus to make them easier to get at.\n\nIf you want some kind of comparison... this is the great, great, grand-daddy to games like Dungeons of Dredmor. It is far FAR more complex and involved. There are so many more things to do, discover, learn and... frankly, get killed by.\n\nVulture's graphics are certainly an improvement on the original Nethack (unless you're a purist) but they're not even close to as good as Dredmor's. There's no animation to speak of, appalling sound, and the isometric is a bit icky in narrow corridors - but the strength of this one is the game itself, and if you're a fan of the dungeon-exploration style game you'd be doing yourself a great dis-service not to get this one.","March 21, 2015","true","4.9"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

It's just a graphic overlay to Nethack to step beyond the ascii a bit, but it is not it's own game, it is Nethack.\nAnyone who wants to know what it is they are talking about when they use the term rogue-like should for sure either play rogue or better yet play this. I've known plenty of people who've played it, but few who've beaten it. Any game that can be bested  in a single sit, or any regularity by someone is not a very rogue-like game in my eyes. Expect more losses than wins if you choose to delve into these dungeons in seach of the Amulet of Yendor. Games like this are what get the hadrcroe lable from me, and there is a reason they do not make a lot of games like this anymore.

Vulture still has quite a steep learning curve, so patience and a bit of reading will go a long way.\n\nIf you haven't played Nethack before getting Vulture first read the Nethack Guidebook ( http://www.nethack.org/v343/Guidebook.html ) to see if Nethack is something you're interested in.\nVulture replaces the sample screenshots in the Guidebook with static isometric tiles (as shown in the Steam store screenshots).\nAfter you've taken the time to familarize yourself with many Nethack commands and been desensitized by frequent horrible death you'll find a game of surprising depth and challenge.\n\nGraphics\nOkay - The graphics are of Vulture are (as yet) modest (no animations, modest resolution), but still a big step up from the original ASCII nethack or 2D graphical tiles. I started laughing out loud the first time my wizard (Orcdalf) started hallucinating in game - something that's merely annoying when I'm playing the traditional 2D interface with small tiles seems appropriately ridiculous when playing in isometric Vulture.\n\nMy suggestion is to go into the interface options and drop wall opacity down to 0.4 or so, and also switch to "half height" walls. This helps to stop the isometric walls obscuring ground objects.\n\nSound\nPoor - The music seems straight out of 1990s midi, and other token environmental and combat sounds are simple.\n\nUser interface\nPoor - The UI is a work in progress (DarkArts are working on a GUI and graphical overhaul). As is it seems possible to perform most actions in the game with just a mouse - but it's usually much easier using the traditional (esoteric) Nethack keyboard commands.\n\nI did find myself using the mouse menus more than I expected in my test run of Vulture - so they do come in handy (probably as much as the Windows or X versions of 2D Nethack).\n\nDepth\nAbout 50 levels :). Wikis are packed full of spoilers for Nethack or brave (and headstrong) adventurers can persist in discovering new (probably unpleasant) features on every play through..\n\nReplayability\nAwesome.

Be prepared to die - A LOT -, maybe play in exploration mode or Wizard mode and maybe even do some reading at NetHack wiki. The nice thing about NetHack is that no matter how many "spoilers" you read, you won't spoil the game. There's always something new, something unexpected. If you master even the basics (which is itself a feat), Vulture for Nethack is endlessly replayable.

I still love the old ASCII/Tilebased graphics of the original but this is a nice little isometric coat of paint thrown on for the people who absolutely cannot stand ASCII graphics I guess.  Anyone unfamiliar with NetHack should realize this is one of the huge stepping stones that set the foundation for all the roguelikes we see nowadays and often at times the benchmark at what people compare most modern-day roguelikes to. The game is unforgiving, relentless and even in death you will at times find humor in it since there are so many ridiculous ways you can die.  The game just like NetHack closes upon death and the final scoreboard which IS annoying as heck when you want to play it again and you have people messaging you "having problems?  it says you're loading up Vulture for NetHack like once every minute or two".  A minor inconvenience that I'm used to.\n\nIn short, if you want NetHack on Steam with the graphics presented to you in the screenshots then the price is reasonable considering the hundreds if not thousands of hours I've spent on the original game, and in those many hours I never really got very far, yet still pushed onward hoping I could see something new or die a whole new ridiculous way.  If you have absolutely no clue what NetHack is but enjoy dungeon-based roguelikes then I'd say you owe it to yourself to play this or some iteration of NetHack.  Just do yourself a favor first and go over the manual and study all those commands, you'll be glad you did.","February 4, 2015","true","2.8"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

If you've never played Nethack, try it out for free before buying this. I will admit it does make playing Nethack easier and more understandable but i still prefer other options personally.  As for the game itself, Nethack is an absolute beauty of a game. It's the pinnicale of Rouge-likes. It's incredibly fun but has a pretty steep learning curve and could be frustrating.

The game is always different every time you play, and being a roguelike, death is permanent. Each playthrough tells a tale of how horribly your player character dies, (or lives, if you escape the dungeon, or actually BEAT THE GAME) and because of the random nature of the game, you are going to die in many different sadistic and stupid ways. For instance, see that pretty amulet lying on the floor?  Out of curiousity, you pick it up and wear it. The amulet strangles you to death and you die. Overall, I find this game both very fun and challenging. There are free versions of nethack available in the form of ascii and tiled, top-down versions, so if you're not sure about it, I recommend getting either one of those versions first before playing.\n\nYou fall below the bottom of the review!\nYou die...\nDo you want your possessions identified?

The game can be downloaded here. http://www.nethack.org/\n\nThe idea is you need to traverse a dungeon to retrieve The Amulet of Yendor for your deity. Along the way you fight monsters, solve puzzles, and avoid traps.\n\nDoes this sound generic? Well, it is the inspration for countless other games, and is far superior to even most modern games, despite its lack of flashy sounds and graphics.\n\nEvery game is different. The dungeon and its contents are generated at random. It is extremely unforgiving. There are insta-death items, and beasts that want nothing more than to decorate with your innards. You have no lives. There are no restarts. Once you die, you start from square one in a completely new dungeon. Nethack also has an odd sense of humor. You can eat the corpse of a Werejackal, becoming one yourself, and summon up jackal friends to devour you foes. You can rob a shop the Keystone Kops will persue you. You can Blind a Basalisk with a pie.\n\n\nIts a graphical version of one of the greatest games ever concieved. I prefer the original ASCII over this but purchased this mainly to track playtime and see another interpretation of what the dungeon looks like.\n\nAs another reviewer pointed out, you still need to know the keyboard commands. This makes the learning curve to a new player less steep, but honestly if you never played a rogue-like before I would recommend starting with  Crawl  (also freeware)  http://crawl.develz.org/  . It has a version that is completely playable via mouse, and a very friendly UI.","November 7, 2015","true","2.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

For anyone who doesn't know the interface is over 12 years old (I beleave, from the Falcons Eye project) It is how I came to play Nethack. After the project got retired by the original creator it became Vulters Eye when picked up again and work was done on a Slash'em interface Vulters claw...which was greatly broken.....I got this soly so i could play Slash'em (gave up like 5+ years ago) and so far it is working wonderfully! I'm very glad to see this up and running again. If you have never played Nethack be warned it is very unforgiving in it's normal mode (you can change it to adventure for a much more relaxed gameplay, just unscored) Slash'em is even MORE so. But if you take the time to play and experiment their is a HUGE amount of playtime awaiting you and you'll be very suprised what you can do (for instince if you're any magic and you've learnt a scroll for a spell you don't have yet....soak a spellbook for a spell you don't like in water <any fountain will do> and write a new book for said scroll you've read with a magic marker...VOILA you now have said spell in learnable form) this is one tiny example of manipulation you can do. There is a lot of twisted and wonderful ways to build your character up. You can train pets/mounts, theres an alchemy system, ways to make rare weapons from normal ones, wishes ect ect ect ad nausium. If you like dungeon crawlers get this game!

Theres a huge array of object and actions available to make each game different, super rare drops even at the first levels sometimes, weird unknown potions and scrolls. If you find yourself in a sticky, sometimes just read every unknown scroll and quaff every potion in your inventory and hope for the best- sometimes with hillarious results!\nFood needs clocking, permadeath is always On- the game is Hardcore, but not super difficult to begin with.\n\nSometimes theres "not so hillarious results" like when i just kicked down my 47th door, as per usual, then it turns out its the door to The Store and the ultra powerfull Shopkeeper- and without me getting 1 single turn to repsond to this surprising event i get Insta-gibbed by the Shopkeeprs wand- insta death...\nA great grandfather of the Roguelikes, along with good old Moria for the earliest "IBM PCs" - All in al worth a few quid for the isometric graphics- good for wasting an hour or 30 mins for sure!\n\n\n* BTW- Lol at the promo video, at 1:00 mins you can clearly see the dark side of the earth being lit by electric city lights!  dont exactly detract tho","July 17, 2015","true","1.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Some of the things listed in the comments I thought I had tried and had no success, but I can't go back to check as I no longer have the game.  Please take the comments below into account before deciding on purchase. I stand by my "No" recommendation as I still think Nethack is best in it's original form, but take the specific complaints with a grain of salt.\n\n---\n\nAs with all graphical interfaces that have been tacked on the top of Nethack, Vulture suffers from enough flaws to make it unusable for anyone that is familiar with the game.  Several major flaws made this unplayable as a Nethack game:\n1) cannot eat corpses from the floor.  Huge problem as you had to pick them up, and become stressed, in order to eat. This is a huge problem as eating then takes may more turns and makes a hard game even more difficult.\n2) no way to throw a corpse/tripe to your pet.  This is a must for training.\n3) pet is a constant annoyance to what is an otherwise nice mouse-click based movement system.\n4) notifications of items on the floor seem to be suppressed, and with the 3D walls, make it easy to miss things.\n5) graphical icons are never as clear as the original Nethack ASCII characters.  Could eventually learn them, but feel it's not worth the effort at this point.\n\nThese are some of the big annoyances I found in just an hour or so of play.  Having the interface limit my choices was very unworkable.  If you aren't familiar with Nethack, you may not miss the flexibility, but it will still kill you.\n\nI've been playing Nethack off and on for 25ish years.  I've tried a lot of graphical interfaces for it over the years and have been disappointed by all of them.  I was hoping from the positive reviews that this one might work out, but it is still unusable for any serious play.  Not to say it didn't have good points, it does.  The menus are nice, inventory is workable, it made some of the meta commands more accessible and the mouse movement is really nice.  Ultimately, Nethack is such a rich, deeply rewarding game that if Vulture is the ONLY way you will play it, get it and try it out.  But if you really want to experience Nethack, do it in the original ASCII, it will be well worth your time to learn it.","July 15, 2015","false","1.1"," 38 of 75 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","38","75","0","5"

Vulture just adds a 3D isometric view to the existing game, and a horribly ugly one at that. I highly recommend getting the latest version of Nethack which can be downloaded for free at http://www.nethack.org  - It even comes with good 2D tilesets (just launch NetHackW.exe instead of Nethack.exe).\n\nNethack is an amazing game, and I don't want the bugs and shoddy quality of Vulture to drive anyone away from trying the original version of the game.\n\nI only bought Vulture so I could write this review. This is also my first review.\n\n\nPS:  Just in case you didn't get the idea from the previous reviews, Nethack is HARD. That game held my attention for 6 years, not bad for a game that came out in 2003. And yet I have never beaten the game, in fact I've never made it past the first 10%. My Dad is a programmer, so of course he hacked himself infinite wishes and HP and STILL got stuck 50% of the way through the game! (Specifically, he got surrounded by death ray resistant creatures on a no teleport/no dig hell level and couldn't hit with silver weapons since he was a monk trained only in barehanded combat. Though now that I think about it he could have made it if he had wished for a humanoid pet and had given it a silver weapon...)

I also believe that you may play NetHack with Vulture for free legally through the wonders of internets.\n\nFirst of all I used to play a lot of ADOM. I learned all of it's quirky commands and got used to the ASCII interface. That was back in the day when all I got was time. I never tried NetHack though and thought it would be a fun little attraction for my coffee breaks. Apparently it's a matter of taste but I felt that this Vulture interface looks horrible and while you may play it by using mouse only it doesn't feel very accurate. The viewing point is also in such a weird angle that it hurts my brain. Basically NetHack is one of THE original roguelikes and meant to be super hard and unforgiving. There's tons of loot and equipment, skills, pets, monsters and everything you could damand from a roguelike game. The story is somewhat typical for RPG's: There's this item that you need and you also have to bring it back from the dungeon. Take a look of the screenshots for the game, buy it if you are accustomed to NEtHack and love it to death already (even just to support the devs) but I can't recommend this one for any new players since it's a quite overwhelming task to conquer this old beast.","February 4, 2015","false","1.2"," 6 of 24 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","6","24","0","7"
