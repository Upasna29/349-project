Usually, I feel the need to write a long review talking about what I feel is important. This is not such a case.\n\nIn short, it's a lot like Big Rigs, but better.\n\nThis game is... dreadful, but also kind of fun. The main reason its fun is because of how lighthearted it is, and how colourful everything is, along with the pleasent, if repetitive music.\n\nBut it's also completely broken is almost every possible way. The environments are glitchy, the car controls kind of crappily, the controls don't really work sometimes, and there isn't really much of a goal except to collect all the stuff in the level and go to the next...\n\nIt really just that simple. Here's a level, collect the stuff, move on. That's it. No racing. No real need to do stunts at all. It's just... here. Drive around and collect stuff.\n\nJust to give an example of how broken this game is, I came across a bug after 4 mintues of playing where, if I jumped, and then held the backwards key ("s" for me), I instantly started flying up into the air, and as long as I kept the key pressed, I kept going. While this is actually kind of fun, and I would hate to see it removed, it does sort of highlight how broken this game is. Also, every time I died, I couldn't access the first person viewpoint any more. No idea why, it just didn't let me. You can also drive directly up vertical walls, and your car goes faster going backwards than it does forwards. Once again, this is actually kind of awesome, and does have some fun in it, but I doubt they intended it to be like this.\n\nIt's a lot like Big Rigs in that sense. Terrible glitches, but ones that serve to be entertaining. Without them, the game would ironically be a lot worse I feel.\n\nAt the same time, despite all of this, the game doesn't really lie about what it offers. You can do stunts, I guess, though there's no reason too. And you drive a small car. It's sort of enjoyable, so what the hey. A thumbs up for now. Maybe I'll change my mind later, but right now, it's 3:20am here in Australia, and I need to get some sleep.","November 14, 2014","true","1.8"," 44 of 61 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","44","61","4","6"

Within the only 5 minutes of playing the game, I encountered the following:\n\n- The game didn't start on the first attempt - after the intro screen the window stayed black. Had to kill the process and restart.\n- When starting out, there's only one game mode, one car, and one "track" available. You have to collect items on some sort of open-world island to unlock even other race modes. The open-world collect-things game mode was not fun to me, but of course that's completely subjective.\n- The controls are laughably bad. A small change in slope may suddenly jerk the car around. You will do lots of flips and crashes for no reason. It's almost impossible to consistently go where you're aiming.\n- The physics are hilarious or terrible, depending on your point of view. The car will do multiple flips in one jump all the time for no reason. At one point after my car exploded on impact, I respawned like 100 meters in mid-air. Instead of falling down, I "fell" up for probably 200 more meters before falling back down. I was in mid-air for at least 30 seconds total before hitting the ground and exploding again. This happened within the first and only 5 minutes of playing this.\n- I gave up on the game after about 5 minutes.

I recommend this game for everyone because in time i know the few minor bugs will be fixed and it will still be the perfect little game for everyone. Also it's that perfect little game to get all achievements in less than 15 hours. the hardest ones are the 25, 50 & 100x 1440 degree flatspins but they are easy to get with a little grinding. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cwY63uvTSE","December 16, 2014","true","23.8"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","2"

No, it's not an "insane" stunt game. It's just a poorly designed one. The physics are terrible, the smallest bump in the road will send you flying or 180ing. The controls suck, no matter how you tweak them and doing stunts, what few there are, is ridiculously easy. Now to the physically ill part; I can't really understand why this is literally the ONLY game to do it but I suspect it's because when you control the vehicle in 3rd person it appears the terrain, not the car, shifts. It looks ridiculous and it's a bit messed up.\n\nEven if I am the only that perceives the camera as such you're still left with a poorly made game that's too easy, despite itself, and not fun.

If you ever played Re-Volt and liked finding the stars, this is basically that. Or, the parts of Carmageddon 2 where you were doing missions jumping from roof to roof. It's kind of almost like a car platform game. The controls (I used an Xbox 360 controller, which it does support, though doesn't actually tell you the button mapping or allow you to change it, but the default mapping makes sense to my hands) didn't quite feel right to start off with, but after a few minutes I got the hang of it and was able to control my stunt jumps quite nicely. It feels a little unfinished in places and I kind of wanted more than is available in terms of gameplay, but for a few quid, it's definitely worth it.","February 14","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Your goal is to collect coins and other stuff from "track" to achieve new cars and tracks - if I figured it out. It could be fun BUT:\n* The controls aren't rebindable and steering feels very clumsy.\n* It doesn't work with my driving wheel (and hat HUGE con for driving game).\n* It might have 360 controller support but not for PS controller, and well controls can't be rebind\n* It's not pretty and I still have some performance issues. - well my computer isn't top of the notch, but so isn't this game.\n\nFew pros:\n* Open world. You really can't fail while driving. So it could be suitable for kids.\n* Driving could be fun.\n* This definitely isn't worst game in world. It actually could be good. - and some might feel like it already.\n\nGot it from some bundle. Wouldn't buy it separately.

It has native Xbox 360 controller support, although there's nothing in the options or menus telling you what does what... it's not hard to figure out.\n\nThe controls feel a little touchy at first. Okay, a lot touchy. You have to make corrections quickly and there's not much margin for error, but you're controlling what's basically an R/C car that can take a lot of punishment, so it's okay.\n\nThe game starts out with nothing but an open world type map with all these powerups and collectibles scattered around everywhere. You have to build coins out of fragments to unlock more maps, vehicles, and game modes, but starting out you have access to 3-4 different vehicles so it's not bad. As you go through the level you also collect upgrades for your current car - things like nitro, super jump, low gravity, extra health, etc. The challenge is to figure out how to jump or climb up to the hard to reach spots to get your goodies. There's no penalty for dying, you just respawn at a random location, sometimes way up in the air.\n\nLike other reviewers have mentioned, you have full control over your pitch and roll while in the air, so you're basically like a cat in that way. If you're good at being a cat, you'll always land on your feet... err... tires. If not, if you land on your nose or roof, you'll probably go boom if you're high enough.\n\nYou can switch camera angles. I found it's easiest to control spin from the bumper cam, but the disadvantage is it's harder to see where the roads, ramps, and hills lead off to. There's no way to adjust where you're looking, it's always straight ahead, except in third person, then the camera faces whatever direction you're going. There's a button to do a full 180 reverse, and another button to do a quick stop. It's not like a handbrake, it's to stop completely. This is useful for planting yourself on hard to reach ledges after you had to take a running jump to get to it. I keep forgetting that's what it's for but there it is.\n\nSo, this game is cheap, it's goofy, it's fun, and with so many things to unlock and maps to explore, I think it's well worth it for the price. Thumbs up! A solid 7/10 at least. Good fun.","April 16, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'll be disappointed if you expect Mario Cart. Think Spyro's hub worlds in a car, and graphics like the original Spyro.\n\nLong Version: I'm two levels in and I have to say this game is exactly what I wanted. You drive an RC car around a large area collecting hidden things and doing tricks. I have a couple of complaints, however. Doing tricks doesn't seem to do anything but flash some text; It'd be nice if there were more motivation for me to rack up score or soemthing. There doesn't seem to be a functional difference between the cars, and they all cost one coin to unlock (you get a coin by finding three parts in a level.) So after you've found one coin you'll unlock the car you like and after that there's no incentive to unlock more. The graphics are pretty rudimentary, and in places you'll think you're playing a PS1 game.\nDespite these issues, the game is still fun if you like exploring an area and collecting things in a vehicle. It brings back memories of playing Diddy Kong Racing and San Francisco Rush 2049's stunt mode, and is comparable to the drive-around-collect-stuff mode from Joyride Turbo on Xbox 360.

It's very unwinding and a relaxing game involving racing on amazing and awesome jumps and loops and well, stunts. STUNTMANIA Reloaded is a basic free-roaming racer involving several gigantic maps that have all sorts of hidden and secret areas to explore. Each of the ~10 maps feature hundreds of jumps and stunts, complete with large amounts of green, yellow, and red collectables to gather in each level. Also in each stage, there are 3 types of coins that need to be gathered in-order to unlock certain parts of the game. Some coins need to be gathered in 3 pieces, which will be spread around the map. These include the first coin, a "car coin", which is used to unlock different cars. Second, a "level coin", which is used to unlock different levels. And the only coin that comes in whole, the "gamemode coin", which is used to unlock gamemodes. Finally, in each level there will be a set of powerups. These powerups include Super Jump, Nitro, Antigravity, Teleport, and more. These little parts of gameplay make this game a very fun and relaxing racer/explorer, leaving you taking a long breath at the ramps, loops, and obstacles of each map.\n\n"Wait, if this is 'very fun', then why did you rate it badly?" You may be asking.\nThe biggest and most dreaded downfall of all players' experiences is the giant number of glitches and bugs that there are in this game. Let me explain. So, you crash your car into a wall, and you wait around 2 seconds for it to respawn. Around 1/7 of the time your car will respawn being shot up into the air like a cannon and stay airborne for a good 40 seconds, leaving you with nothing to do but wait. Once that car comes crashing down again, unless you've picked up the "Mega Health" powerup, there's a 50/50 chance that you won't survive the fall, with the possibility of respawning shot up into the air once more. However, I have come to a slight realization of the glitch and it is if you've crashed with your car's nose tipped mildly upwards, it seems to bring up the glitch. An easy way to stabilize your car is holding down SPACE, but this is still unconfirmed as far as I know. In the game I guarantee that you'll find your car glitching through the map either fully, or just partially, even if you can make it out with a small hop. And, I've also taken note that you can literally drive up a flat wall, whether it be land, or a building, without any powerups or any help or tricks.\n\nNow, I will say that this game is relaxing, fun, and enjoyable, but the glitches that this game possesses just seem to ruin the fun for most people. The price just doesn't seem like it's worth it's value if it's possessed by such bugs and broken mechanics, even if it's only $5. However, this game demonstrated to me amazing levels, and breathtaking and cool stunts and jumps and loops; This game is its own rollercoaster. But, even all of this doesn't top for the game's value. The only time I would recommend to buy this game is when it's on sale, or in Humble Bundle or other such sorts.","February 15","false","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sure it's got some bugs, camera issues, respawning issues, textures not loading, but for $5 it really isn't a bad game. The music for the game is very interesting and is fun to listen to, and the ideas for the levels are really cool (Mini Golf is probably my favorite). There is a nice small selection of cars to choose from and having to collect coins to unlock them, levels, and game modes let's you search every nook and cranny on the map. Some pieces are difficult to find, but it shouldn't take long to get all the coins on every level. Go Crazy is a neat feature, no time pressure or objective really, you can go nuts and drive to your hearts desire, blowing up your car as many times as you want. One thing I really wish that would have been added were nice backdrops. It gets boring looking out into the gray/black outside of the arena, though this is a smaller issue. All in all, this is a good game for $5, even if it was $10. It's not the game of the year, but the developer clearly had a great idea in their head, and did a great job of making a fun game.","January 13","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will flip and flop for no reason. It's not fun when the car doesn't go where you steer it. It has a jerk from side to side with the whole screen moving as you know in your mind that this isn't the first racing game you've ever played. Until they fix the controls? Don't waste your money or your time. I did use an XBox 360 controller and I tried it with keyboard. Still a no-no.","January 15","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
