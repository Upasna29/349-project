It's a very beautiful walking simulator.\n\nThere's not much more to say, it's art in the form of a game, a walking simulator, it's relaxing, nice to play when you're a bit tired or bored to waste an hour on, it's also an easy target for achievements.\n\nIf you enjoy walking simulators I recommend it, if you liked the first Star Sky I recommend you buy this and vice versa.\n\nThere's absolutelly no reason to buy this game if you do not already enjoy Walking Simulators, you either love them or hate them, don't buy it if you haven't enjoyed previous Walking Simulators.\nI don't enjoy racing games so I don't buy racing games.","April 6","true","3.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/443460/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Mårten Jonsson has a wonderfully creative mind. His games tend to be polarizing as the Steam reviews on the original Star Sky attest. You either love the artistic flair that the games present or you feel as though you’re wasting your time because you simply cannot appreciate his art form for the beauty that it is. I am still developing my taste for art and as such part of the splendor that is Star Sky 2 is lost upon me. I think that it’s unfortunate because I know that it is there. To me a quarter of an hour spent within the game is an achievement fest. Let’s see how many I can unlock in the shortest time possible. The answer  was 7 in about 11 minutes. That’s great for my Steam profile but sadly a lost opportunity to appreciate something beautiful. Ainslie, however, is a big fan of art. She’s also gifted enough to be able to press the left or right arrow key while appreciating the art that is on the screen and deft of hearing enough to listen out for music to tell her to stop a moment while the magic unfolds in front of her very eyes. Therefore because I know that she’ll be able to put into words her appreciation for Jonsson’s beautiful sequel to the original Star Sky I’ll present her another opportunity to share some little pearls.\n\nAINSLIE’S LITTLE PEARLS\n\nLike Warwick said I have a greater appreciation for art than what he does. With that being said I guess I did appreciate Star Sky 2 a little bit more than what he did. I don’t think that games as art generally sticks as being one game genre over another. I think all games can be viewed as art. What I liked about the game was the tranquility of the game. It is the type of game that I could come home and play a few minutes of after a rough day at work – I’m a nurse – and chill out with. That would be the greatest ambition for this game. It’s not really a game as much as it is a meditation simulator. The player doesn’t have to do too much just press one key and try out different sequences than what they have done in prior attempts with each sequence leading to a different achievement. I quite liked the the artwork but I preferred the soothing music that goes along with it.\n\nIf you’re wanting to play something that will help in your relaxation you should get Star Sky 2.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit http://www.steamified.com/\nPlease feel free to join our wonderful community on Steam","March 9","true","120.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","1"

However, for a walking sim, it's not too bad. A bit short (not sure my actual gameplay hours since I had this up and running for a bit). It's a relaxing/easy game. I would definitely recommend buying it if you can catch it on sale or in a bundle!","May 3","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Star Sky 2 is like no other game I've played or seen before. Its concept of the player choosing their own path is wonderful and its story is so vague you can interpret it many different ways or at least that's what I got out of it. During my playthrough, I checked more than once whether it was windy or pouring rain outside my window because the ingame sounds are so well done I couldn't tell the difference. Overall, I had a blast playing Star Sky 2 and highly recommend this to anyone who wants a short relaxing experience. Seriously, it's really relaxing. It only has 3 controls; Up, Right, and Left on the arrow keys so you can lean back in your chair or lie down in bed with a laptop.","April 23","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bechstein/recommended/443460/","Bechstein","Bechstein","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bechstein/","296 products in account","The soothing night-time walking simulator is back, with more places to stroll through, more events to wait around and observe, and now you can play a left-walking lady in addition to Right-walking Reggy. Visual cues and hints have been added (and can be turned off for the hardcore night-walkers who don't need hints of where to stand), it's possible to return to the same place during the same session, and there is even a map which will highlight which paths you've already taken and what's still waiting for you. Some may think it's odd that I was giddy to play Star Sky 2 after the first one, but others will appreciate a very serene walking simulator like this, which is great for relaxing or a change of scenery.","April 22","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
