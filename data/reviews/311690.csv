Puns everywhere!)\n+ Tight controls\n+ Looks fantastic\n+ Neat soundtrack\n+ Secrets!!\n- Drops (especially ammo) are a little bit too scarce [apparently this has been (somewhat) fixed as of May 6th 2016]\n\nFull game review\nAfter being occupied with The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth for a long time, I was looking forward to getting involved in this new rogue-like/rogue-lite. I was hoping for it to be something that could blend elements like randomness, fair challenges, fun and replayability into an enjoyable game. Before release, Enter the Gungeon had been getting a lot of hype, and was it deserved? Is this the ultimate rogue-lite meets bullet hell the fans have been waiting for? Let's find out!\n\n<<<Story>>>\n\nOn a distant planet in a highly secured fortress lies a legendary gun ... A gun that can kill the past! Four characters travel to this planet and enter said fortress. Their aim (...) is to kill their regretful past and change it for the better. This story is very simplistic, which is often the case with rogue-likes. It is mainly there to fill a certain emptyness. However, it does motivate to keep gungeoning and hopefully complete a full run to experience the characters' past.\n\n<<<Gameplay, fun factor and replayability>>>\n\nUpon entering the hub ("The Breach"), one can choose between 4 main characters to play as: the marine, the convict, the pilot or the hunter. Each of them start out with different weapons and passive/active items allowing for a slightly different playstyle. They mainly differentiate the beginnings of each run, as all of those items could possibly be acquired while gungeoning.\n\nOnce descending the gungeon, players will be shooting, flipping tables and dodge rolling their way to the boss of each floor/chamber. The combat is satisfying due to being smooth and thrilling, yet very challenging. The difficulty of enemies and bosses feels just about right, though it takes time and practice to overcome them (at first). There is a lot of room for growth in skill, which in itself can be very satisfying. Besides shooting (and dodge rolling and flipping tables), there is also looting, doing 'business' with shopkeepers, rescuing trapped inhabitants and secrets ... Lots of secrets!\n\nBoss rooms are a real treat for bullet hell fans. Each has their own unique attack pattern and is pretty overwhelming at first. Especially when first playing the game, the difference between the difficulty of the chambers/floors and the boss can be a bit much. Luckily, as with any bullet hell, this problem can be overcome by learning and memorizing the attack pattern and/or being lucky with guns. Speaking about guns ...\n\nAs this game is called "Enter the Gungeon", one would think to discover and use a lot of guns. While this is partially the case, I did find the overall drops for guns and consumables to be a bit low. More than not, I seem to be using useless guns or my starter gun so that I can spare my good gun for the boss fight/difficult rooms. Usually, once I reach floor/chamber 4, most of my weapons seem to be completely empty and I'm bound to use my starter gun again. As certain people may argument, yes "it is possible to beat the whole game with the starter gun", but is it fun? Not really. Maybe I'm just unlucky.\n\n<<<Controls, graphics and sound>>>\n\nIt is not weird for a game like this to have forum threads full of "Which is better/easier: controller or mouse & keyboard?" as it may or may not help you to the finish line. For the most part, whichever you use, depends on personal preference. Controller gives you (semi) auto-aim, whereas mouse & keyboards lets you aim more freely with the crosshair. The most important thing is that they are both reliable ways to win the game as controls are very tight. If you die, it is your fault.\n\nVisually, the game looks gorgeous with its pixel art style. Each floor also has a unique look, which keeps the experience varied and fresh. Also impressive are the animations: dodge rolling, shooting, gun effects ... are all so well done and responsive. There is nothing more satisfying than seeing the room shake with certain weapons effects, explosions etc whilst fighting waves of enemies.\n\nThe OST is - in my honest opinion - the cherry on top of a most delicious cake. Whilst not every track may be stunning, I do find them being stuck in my head once in a while. So even though the full soundtrack may be not as memorable as some others (e.g. The Binding of Isaac, Super Meatboy or Crypt of the Necrodancer), it is still a very well made piece of music overall.\n\n<<<The verdict>>>\n\nThis is certainly not a game for everyone, but I do strongly recommend it to all rogue-lite and/or bullet hell fans and people that like really hard/challenging games. Just keep in mind that this game relies heavily on personal skill rather than an extreme amount of (possible) drops and synergies (though they are certainly present). If you do, you'll be having heaps of fun with smooth and thrilling gameplay, tight controls and a good soundtrack.

This title easily sits at the top with classic roguelites like Crypt of the NecroDancer, Rebirth, and Nuclear Throne. In fact, there are elements of all three of those games in Enter the Gungeon, along with a few quality-of-life upgrades too.\n\nEssentially, the structure of this game plays most similiar to Crypt of the NecroDancer in the sense that the meta-game progression consists of saving characters who later run different versions of shops where you can purchase permanent upgrades. If I was pressed to compare, the combat is similiar to Nuclear Throne, although the controls are much tighter here, and it is slightly less frantic. Its just different, really.\n\nPros:\n+Wickedly addicting. Tons of meta-game upgrades and things to do.\n+The pixel art and animation is butter. Probably the best I've seen in a long, long time.\n+The controls couldn't be tighter. I've only played with the controller, and I have no reason to try keyboard and mouse at this point - thats how happy I am.\n+Menus are perfect. Everything is so efficient and keeps you in the action all the time. Nothing feels clunky with the UI. It couldn't be better IMHO.\n+Co-op is wickedly fun too! Its odd that one player HAS to play the gypsy, but it is really fine at the end of the day.\n\nMeh:\n=I was excited for the soundtrack, but you can barely even hear it at the stock settings. Its nothing great, honestly. I was hoping this was another high point (like other similiar games - especially Crypt of the NecroDancer).\n=Over the eight hours I've played, I go back-and-forth with how I feel about the difficulty curve. The levels are substantially easier than the boss fights. But then you git gud:)\n=The deluxe edition is real 'meh' to me.\n\nCons:\n-The music is almost a 'con' for me, to be honest.\n-While the community is divided on many issues - one thing is almost completely agreed on - balancing needs further refinement.\n-The playable characters (at least the ones available off the bat) don't feel all that different. Not like in games such as Rebirth.\n-Don't expect to be wading through drops and loot such as in other similiar games - its different here. I thought I'd be switching guns every other room, but its not the case. Its still fun, just not what some have expected.\n-There is a little game stuttering no matter what PC specs you have (this is very minor).\n\nThis is a must-have. Its certainly one of the most memorable titles I've played so far this year. You can definately get Isaac hours out of this (at least I can and probably will).","April 6","true","43.3"," 164 of 193 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","164","193","3","13"

The art is amazing, the gameplay is fluent and fast and from all of the roguelikes I've played this game delivered the best experience you'll have in a long time.\n\nA defenitive must buy for anyone who enjoyed The Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne, the game is (in my opinion) a mix of the two games, with it's own unique feel to it.\n\nThe art looks good, the gunplay and movement feels right and the enemies so far have been interesting (though I might see where the bullet type enemies get repetative).\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone new to the roguelike genre, and if you are already well familiar with games such as this I don't know why you haven't bought it yet.\n\n\nEDIT: The only thing that isn't to my taste is the music, it seems kinda offbeat and random at times, but I also didint like the Rebirth OST, so it's probably just me.\n\nEDIT2: The game stutters when theres a lot of explosions or gunshots on screen, messes up your movement and you get hit, when it's not really your fault. Running this on i5 3570k @4.0Ghz, 4Gb gtx 770 windforce, 16 gigs of ram. Not that the game is powerhungry, it's probably just bad coded? Still moments like this occur from time to time so it might put someone off\n\nEDIT 3: Game has a dumb bug when you roll into the next level elevator you get stuck between it, forcing you to restart.\n\n(Score changed due to stuttering and the elevator bug 9/10; Overall still enjoying the game)","April 5","true","15.1"," 150 of 186 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","150","186","9","3"

The sheer amount of different types of guns and enemy variety means that even after hitting the 6-7 hour mark, you're still getting something new out of the gameplay. And it's going to throw the kitchen sink at you while doing it. Those looking for a challenge won't need to look far, because this game is hard, and I love it for that. The boss fights in particular are great, as you dodge roll around for your life. So yeah, great gameplay all around, the controls work nicely, and it's really a solid purchase. It does have flaws: storytelling wise, the game is weak despite some interesting characters and art assets. And level design will start to get annoying after a while, as the game can really screw you in this aspect alone with crowded corridors. Those with low frustration tolerance: stay away from this game, as well, it's going to beat you over the head with some ridculous scenarios. But hey, what's a roguelite without some difficult moments?\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nGun variety is huge, and allows for a lot of different strategy to develop because of it.\nHumor and references. Between the video game/popular culture references and the ridculous guns that you can get, you'll get a laugh or two.\nDifficulty is high, which is what you want in a roguelite.\nBoss fights feel like the challenge that they need to be. Where a lot of the damage that I took\nGood enemy variety, which will force you to react and change up your strategy.\nControls work for both keyboard/mouse and controller, with each of them having their own strengths.\nGreat creatures and character design. The artwork is nice, but the designs in particular are rather well done.\nNegatives:\nTheming can be inconsistent at times, and it misses out on a narrative angle.\nLevel design needs a bit of a tweak. The RNG can really screw you at times, and of the times I find\nA glitch once in a while. And while they can be hilarious at times, wandering around in a dark Gungeon was not fun when I was doing good in that run.","April 20","true","10.7"," 49 of 59 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","49","59","5","1"

You do not know what to do with a girl like this, what were you even thinking? You panic and pass out only to wake up in the morning to realize that it was all just a dream. A dream that you want to have over and over again hoping that one day you will be prepared.","April 5","true","89.6"," 331 of 520 people (64%) found this review helpful 272 people found this review funny","64","331","520","272","21"

I haven't really seen much of a difference in the few runs I tried since, but YMMV, so take this  review with a grain of salt. The devs are listening.\n\nA decent game marred by some poor game balance. With a few fixes it could be really great, but right now it's just frustrating.\n\nLet's just get this part out of the way, because I know I will be attacked mercilessly for this opinion: Do you like bullet hell? Did you think Binding of Isaac was for chumps? You'll probably get a kick out of this game. The pixel art is great, and the style of the game is charming and endearing. The bosses and enemies are diverse, and there are lots of items to find (more on that later). Music is meh, but not really the main draw so I don't mind it either way. I also haven't encountered any sizable bugs, and it's nice that this isn't just another early access indie, which it so easily could have been.\n\nNow, don't misunderstand. This game is really really hard, as a bullet hell game should be. I don't bemoan that I can't finish the game. I'm a total scrub and I accept that.  My problem is that in a game advertised as being all about tons of guns, I die an awful lot with nothing more than my starting pistol and a worthless item. I don't mind failing, and trying over and over to get it right. That seems to be kinda what this game is going for.\n\nHere's the problem. If each attempt at finishing the game is exactly the same, it gets really tiresome. I don't feel like I am making progress at all.\n\nThe first issue, which I originally thought would be something I would enjoy, is the sheer volume of items in this game. There are a ton of guns, passive items, and active items, but instead of filling some sort of gap in the gameplay, it feels more like the developers came up with gun puns first, and then as an afterthought considered what these weapons are actually supposed to do. So many shotguns and pistols that feel interchangable, which are fine in most games, but when you consider that there are some truly original guns in there, it feels like a lot of wasted space.\n\nThe items fair little better. There are active items that take a long time to refill and will barely take off a sliver of a boss's life. Some passives give you more life, or speed or fire rate as in Binding of Isaac, but so many of them do almost nothing, such as an extra effect on table flipping or using blanks, which are like your bombs in this game. Sadly, I cringe whenever I find these items because they are again of absolutely no use against bosses, which are the game's main challenge.\n\nThis is exasperated by how desperately rare keys are in this game. You start the game with one key and can obtain others from drops off enemies or buying them in the shop. However, the drop rate is so low for both keys and money, and sometimes the shop won't have them at all, so even on the very first level you are often limited to a single, probably very useless item.\n\nAnd that's the core problem. So few items define a run. The deaths just blur together. I'll die 30 minutes in and still not have found anything that makes me want to try again, in the hopes of again getting that great combo. Just a few useless passives and identical guns. Again, these items are there, but so rare. I am still finding new guns 25 hours in. And still disappointed when it turns out to function pretty much like most guns.\n\nOther issues that make progressing in this game a total chore? The lack of character options. You get 4 starting characters, each with basically identical stats and starting weapons. The marine is a little easier, the hunter a little harder, but you don't really have different playstyles supported here. There is some progression in unlocking different items to find later, and expanding the number of merchants available, but these don't affect your start in any way. It doesn't need to be Rogue Legacy, but Binding of Isaac, Nuclear Throne, FTL and the like had wildly different starting options depending on your starting character or ship.\n\nPerhaps this is all by design. Perhaps this is what people want. It just isn't what I expected. I expected Binding of Isaac, considering how much was copied from that game. Some people will love this game, but I certainly don't see myself recommending it to anyone I know. This saddens me, bacause there is so much to love about this game. The art style and charm are there, and with just a little tweaking to make it more interesting in the early game, I'd be way more onboard.","April 8","false","25.8"," 656 of 1,050 people (62%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","62","656","1","28","56"

Remember me? Of course you don't, however, let me tell you something: at the game's release I promised I will make an in-depth review of this very game when I will pour a cup of good time and rage quits. And would you guess, I've gotten every hard and skilled achievements apart from some grinding ones that I'll do later. Lead God included. Long live Com4nd0. Anyways, let's get riiiiight into it, shall we?\n\nSo, what is this game exactly? Well, just what it advertises: a rogue-like gun dungeon that is tough as balls, but all for the wrong reasons, and we'll adress that in just a momment.\n\nAs you might imagine, in a game called Enter the Gungeon(EtG) it should have guns, and boy it's got plenty of 'em. 200+ to be exact. However, how many weapons are actually worth your investment into them? The sad answer to this is actually not a lot at all, with an average of ~80 in my eyes. Why is this so important?\nYou need guns for 2 things: mob clearing and bosses.\nMob clearing is self explanatory, go to room to room using said weapon, in boss' case you need something to do good dmg or dps.\nThe problem with all of this that most of the guns have mediocre damage, and those who do have good stats are just really rare and most likely have low ammo capacity/high ammo consumption rate. This is a big issue when it boils down together with the enemies we'll cover in the next point.\nAnd I almost forgot the bright side of this point: lots and lots of unique guns! I don't want to spoil up your possible adventures, but take into account space engines, drills and bananas into it, alright?\n\nThe enemies. Oh GOD the enemies. First of, the bright side of things.\nAll of the enemies encountered in the gungeon are weapon/ammunition related: bullets, shells, you get the idea. These enemies, have gun that fire bullets. So esentially you fire bullets at bullets that fire bullets at you. Feeling Lil' Wayne'd yet, dawg?\nMost of them out there are cute. Cute as in you want to punch the lil sh!t at the end of everything.\nThe whole game is based around lots of these mobs shooting at you, and let me tell you, the bullet hell(s) can be very frustrating, and here's why: THE ENEMIES HAVE TOO MUCH HEALTH.  Not only that, but their health scale with the levels, meaning your starting weapon becomes more and more less viable as floors pass.\n"But this is what guns are for, right? You know, mob clearing, as you said earlier?"\nHehehe... for that boy, we reach the next point.\n\nRooms drops are random and unreliable. Has it ever happened to you that in The Binding Of Isaac to not be able to enter an item room and miss an item because no keys dropped? Now how's about to have 2 chests on the floor, get absolute jack for completing the floor, and be forced to buy a key all the time from the shop? Does that seem like fun to you? A lot of the time you will miss chests, that meaning you'll miss items, that means you are less prepared for what comes next. On the bright side of things, the more you progress through the game, the more ways are of acquiring items. Chests can drop at random, too, but higher tier chests are always locked.\nOh yeah, the chests. Have you ever wanted your run to be even more random than it was? Have your loot not only being classified in poop tier and god like, but let's also mix'n'match the 2 chests you're getting, so you will most likely find 99% of the time brown chests and 1% the rest. Awesome, right? So much talking about chests makes me want to move to the next point...\n\nThe bosses. *le sigh*\nThere are some really well designed bosses in this game, and there is always a way of taking no damage through skill and knowledge(and loot ;) ). Mentioning the no damage, doing a boss flawless(no hits) you will be awarded a master round of the respective floor, which is also a health up. This is your only reliable source of hp ups in the game, so you as you might imagine, the bosses will get repetitive once you get the hang of it, so the floors are going to be your main source of entertainment, which is very bloody weird, but it works in its favor. And if you haven't caught the idea by now, all of the bosses are bullet hell.\nThere is a really stupid balancing issue here, however: the bosses take way too much damage to destroy.\nListen, having high health bosses are alright, but only if there are like two or three. Here, every single one has an unbearable amount of hp, here's what I mean:\n-In The Binding Of Isaac, your first floor boss is let's say Monstro. It takes about 30 seconds to fight him and win.\n-Here let's say you get Bullet King. With the base weapon, he takes about two minutes to beat. And this is where it works against itself, since it takes ages to beat him, in the process you might get hit, losing the potential hp up you could have achieved, and overall it just prolongs the fight unnecesarilly, for what? To make a point? It's plain stupid, and it really should be redesigned all-together.\nAt least, the boss drops are actually quite nice, giving you lost health, armor, keys, and the item can be of any rarity, so OP weapons can be dropped here, which at least makes these worthile to go through. Some times, anyway.\nOne last thing on this is that bosses drop currency that can be used in...\n\nThe breach! A.k.a. the hub where you spend your munies at. While you explore the gungeon, you will find every now and then a locked NPC. These guys are the ways of gaining items I mentioned previously: do this I reward you that, map the area I give this, I'm a merchant etc. Some of them you will encounter right in the chambers, others in the breach, and they take the boss currency and unlock new items for your playthrough. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.\n\nThe replayabilty is a bit mixed. Sure, you get lotsa cool guns every playthrough, but you're not gonna use them pretty much until floor 4 and onwards, because ammo drops, and I don't want to talk about this again. Another thing is that rooms are feeling repetitive, a lot of them you encounter before, you will encounter after quite frequently, and that is a bad sign for a rogue like yo'. Seeing how in the future the devs will add new content(and possibly that god damn Save and quit option), more room variety is pretty much necessary.\nAlso, on this topic too, to get the game up to 100%, you have to do a lot of grinding, which that, ladies and gents, is where the true replayability stands on. I'm just tired of commenting on all of this, so I'll just get to the final point.\n\n\ntl;dr Enter the Gungeon is a deeply flawed game. If you made it through my review this far, you've seen I made a lot of negative points on every segment, but does that mean this game is bad and I should not recommend it? Hell no!\nSure, its balancing on... EVERYTHING is utter sh!t. But this is the first game in a really long while to prove so challenging that I want to beat it just for the sake of beating it.\nAs casual and family friendly EtG might look like, this is way too hard for anyone in this category, however the competionists and bullet hell fans will enjoy this a lot I say.\nOverall, the game is worth a 7.4/10. It does not win a rounded 8 just for how bad some of the stats can be.\nIf you are new to the bullet hell genre or you just want a challenge, I suggest picking this up at a discount.\n\nThis was your random stranger keeping his word and giving you a review by the book, over and out.\nHave a nice day!","April 27","true","72.3"," 121 of 180 people (67%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","67","121","180","28","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cloudk1ll/recommended/311690/","cloudk1ll","cloudk1ll","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cloudk1ll/","281 products in account","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuX98H9zeuE\nIt's the fast paced, dungeon crawling, crazy bullet hell that you might just grow to love.  It's published by Devolver Digital known for independent style games that some how find a way to make every theme and setting seem like a bad ♥♥♥ action movie.  Let's take a look at Enter The Gungeon and see if it's any good.\n\nStory\nEnter The Gungeon is a dungeon crawler where you choose from a band of misfits to fight your way to the Gungeon's Ultimate treasure.  That treasure is a gun that can kill the past.  The game isn't heavy on a narrative.  It's about killing, looting, dying, and repeating.  There are some mysterious characters you'll meet along the way.  Despite not being story driven, these characters will make you curious about their role in the gungeon.\n\nGameplay\nEnter The Gungeon is a roguelike meaning procedurally generated levels, loot, and enemies.  This creates a mix of challenge and repetition that go hand in hand.  Know this going in, the game is tough as nails.  And that's a good thing.  The controls and the enemy arrangement is really tight.  If you die or get hit, chances are it's your fault and you've learned a good lesson for the next time you choose to enter the gungeon.\n\nThe game's difficulty kind of jumps from 1 to 10 in an instant.  The tutorial holds your hand and breaks down the mechanics into the simplest way possible.  But once you start playing you'll still get stomped quite a bit if you're new to a roguelike.  But if you get the itch to keep replaying the first chamber you'll eventually get really good and build a strategy to finding the right items and conserving what you need.\n\nThere's a reason why they put the word gun in the title.  Dodge Roll games seems to love everything about guns in its art style and setting.  There's more guns than you can count in this game.  There's normal guns like shotguns, pistols, and submachine, guns but then you get everything your imagination can make.  There's guns that pay homage to movies and other games.  Like the gun that looks just like an NES Zapper and shoots birds from duck hunt.  There's bizarre guns like the T-Shirt Cannon that cover your enemies in purple shirts.  It's ridiculous and fun.  Some guns are better than others and the only way to find out which ones work best for you is to repeat the dungeon crawling over and over.  The hunt to discover more guns is one of the main proverbial carrots on a stick in this game.\n\nControlling and handling in Enter The Gungeon is extremely tightly woven.  And the dodge roll is your best friend.  The name of the developer is Dodge Roll Games and it's also the name of your most important move.  Dodge rolling gives you a moment of invulnerability which means you want to roll right through enemy fire.  But dodge rolling isn't a magic fix.  A bad dodge roll could have you land face up right into a bullet.  You need to time and plan your rolls carefully to weave through the enemy bullets.  There's strategy when it comes to the movement.\n\nThere's also tables in the environment that you can knock over and use for cover.  You can even push them as you move forward, but they'll get destroyed after a few shots.  Funny enough, enemies can also use these same tables for cover.\n\nEvery enemy is nuanced.  They have very specific ways of moving and firing at you.  Then when you get 2 to 3 different enemy types in one room, stuff hits the fan and gets crazy.  Patterns start to resemble a shoot 'em up with alternating medium and fast paced bullets heading towards you in a very systematic pattern.  That's the part that really tests your skills.  There aren't really any filler enemies, all of them provide a challenge even the basic bullet guys.\n\nThe game actually moves really fast because there's teleports to get around the map, quick restarts if you die, and you can easily skip boss cutscenes.  Those are small touches but they keep you in the gameplay loop and that's how you get addicted to restarting even after you die repeatedly.\n\nThere's little bits of progression by beating bosses and attaining unlocks.  Every time you kill a boss you get currency which you can use to unlock more weapons and items that you will find in the gungeon.  There's also a few characters you meet that help you get around the gungeon better, but you'll have to find those for yourself.\n\nBest of all there's local co-op, so you can take a buddy with you for the challenge and scream each other's heads off when you get killed.\n\nThe real accomplishment in the game is to find every weapon, item, and boss.  There's a codex that let's you see everything you've found so far.\n\nGraphics\nEnter The Gungeon has the same pixel art style we see in the majority of Devolver Digital published titles.  It's simple, but it's stylized and there's a lot of little details that make it seem like a polished title.  There's a lot of destructibles in the environment that are purely cosmetic, but they let you know that some mayhem took place in the room that you just cleaned out.\n\nThere's also that cool factor that Devolver's design style has.  You can tell that a lot of thought was put into the characters.\n\nBosses are unique both in art style and presentation.  They get their own hyped up splash screens just like we've seen with characters from Broforce.\n\nThere's also a lot of gun and bullet motifs.  The most basic enemies are like character sized bullets.  Your health aka your heart containers are two bullets stacked together.\n\nSound\nThe sound effects remind you of just how crazy the game is.  Whether it's from surprise explosions or firing a bizarre weapon, the right effects stand out.  If you're firing a gun that shoots giant laser beams, it definitely sound like you are zapping the hell out of whatever is standing in your way.\n\nMusic alternates between empty and mysterious dungeon ambience to fast paced intense boss battle music.  When you're in the heat of a big fight, running out of hearts the music keeps you in the zone.\n\nThere's no dialogue, but it's also not really needed in run and gun game like this.\n\nNegatives\nThe challenge is the biggest draw, but also the biggest deterrent.  It's hard to work towards a sense of progression if you can' get through the first couple of levels.  It's not necessarily a bad feature of the game, but it's something you should know going in.  Consider it the rules of engagement.\n\nLastly, could we ask for online co-op?  It has local co-op which is awesome, but not everyone has their buddy in the same room with them.  Online co-op would be a great way to dilute the challenge and extend the replayability.\n\nFinal Verdict\nKeep in mind this game was made by a 4 person studio and they did their best to capture what they wanted from their most inspiring games.  It's only $15 on Steam and Playstation Network so it's a good pickup if it fits your playstyle.  Enter The Gungeon gets an 8 for it's stylized and challenging gameplay.  If the game fits your playing style, it's highly addictive and will keep you coming back for more.  Do you play roguelike games?  What are your thoughts on Enter The Gungeon?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blye/recommended/311690/","Blye","Jakethybro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blye/","139 products in account","A rouge-like twin stick shooter bullet hell game, relying on skill, not luck.As of patch 1.08 hotfix\n\nEnter the Gungeon is an amazing quirky game that has lots of variety in all aspects; items, weapons, floors, bosses, etc. It allows flexibility, while at some points being an intense bullet hell twin stick shooter, and at other points a hilarious pun machine with thousands of refrences included. The game requires more skill than luck, and is extremely balanced.\n\n\nThe Gameplay GunplayThe Gameplay of Enter the Gungeon mainly consists of dodge rolling and shooting, it is a bullet hell after all. The controls of Enter the Gungeon are extremely easy to learn and use, yet with KB+M you may accidentally dodge roll into a place you don''t want to, that place being a bullet. The Gungeon can however been a rage inducing place due to this.\n\nWhile the base gameplay of enter the gungeon may seem rather basic, it gets much more so later into the game. You'll have to, in a split second, plan where your dodge roll is going to land, and to make sure there won't be a bullet there within a second. The difficulty of the game is extremely high, probably one of the most challenging games I've ever played. On your first run, you probably won't get past the first or second floor, but by the time you learn the bosses and enemies, you could be beating the game every run.\n\n90 hours into the game (as of now) I still haven't reached that point.\n\nThe StorylineThe story of Enter the Gungeon is mainly: You want to advance through all five floors of the Gungeon to get the Gun that can kill the past and change your characters past.\nThere is more than just that, and the plot expands with the various secrets you find. At first glance of the story, I thought it was very interesting and appealing.\n\nThe GraphicsThere's not much to say about these pixel graphics, but two words: They're amazing. These graphics are great graphics, with literally no graphical glitches and amazing detail, I love it. The ammonomicon art for the enemies have all unique looks, and in my opinion, are great. The resolution of the game can be set to "Pixel Perfect" and when it is, it's truly pixel perfect.\n\nThe Soundtrack/SoundEnter the Gungeon's soundtrack is good, nothing special. It was very overhyped by the developers, like they were worshipping doseone (the musician). Most of the beats in the game aren't great, but the Gungeon rap you hear when you beat the game is really good and extremely catchy. I actually constantly listen to the soundtrack on Local Files - Spotify so I can play it over and over again in a random order. Truly is much better when not repeated.\n\nThe base sounds of the game are great, gun noises and top notch, bullet kin deaths and everything like that are great. There's not much to say about the sounds, but they're good.\n\n\nPros:\n190 diverse guns/weapons.\n190+ diverse active and passive items\n21 diverse bosses with their own attacks and AI, which rewards greatly if mastering.\n80+ diverse enemies, with variations of them.\n4 unique gungoneers with their own looks, starting weapons, and alternate skins\n2 secret gungeoneers that are very unique and difficult to use in their own ways.\nA wide variety of unique npcs with distinct personalities.\nStrange and hilarious encounters within the gungeon.\nPUNS AND REFRENCES ARE APLENTY!\nEvery floor in The Gungeon is extremely well designed with it's own special enemies.\nThe Ammonomicon, seriously, it's amazing.\nA unique story "The gun that can kill the past."\nDifferent endings for each character.\nThe game is incredibly balanced... maybe a little too balanced?\nThe game's soundtrack is good, but nothing special.\nNeutral:\nMost enemies are varieties of other enemies, such as the 9 types of bullet kin. I feel that this adds variety to the game though, it would be boring to have only one type and that it to be the most plentiful of enemies.\nDifficulty. The difficulty of this games lures me to it though.\nRequires more skill then luck. There is no such thing as a game breaking run in this game. Except for an unlockable item called the "Seven Leaf Clover" OP!\nAll the media of the gungeon except videos are old! The screenshots of the game don't look much alike what the game looks like now!\nNo special steam support -  trading cards, workshop, badges, emoticons, none of that. I've personally asked the devs and they say it's a high chance of it coming though! YAY! (there are achievements although) - They've added all of this now! YEEAAH!\nCons:\nThe game is a little buggy, none but one bug broke the game for me. Entering the final secret floor, black screen. Ruined an AMAZING run... ugh!\nThere are a few "cheap" situations. Sometimes you can be walking into a trap room and you don't know it, and with the right amount of speed you'll instantly take damage. Not cool.\nThis is just for deluxe edition: Deluxe edition is not worth it, it seems like it was made last second and the gun (Microtransaction Gun) was actually a stolen idea from a user on the discord server. I mean it's fine, I hope they got that users consent :) (The devs themselves said this)\nThe number of pros highly outweigh the number of cons and neutrals. This game is an extremely well made game, and for the asking price ($14.99) it's well worth it.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n9/10 - "A Must Buy"\n\nThanks for reading my review!","April 26","true","125.9"," 47 of 64 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","47","64","6","6"

(Brazilian Portuguese)\nReview of enter the Gungeon.(English one - A bit below)\n\nVersão Brasileira\nEnter the gungeon é um jogo indie no estilo roguelike (ou seja perde tudo quando morre), possui um grafico 2d bastante agradavel e uma jogabilidade bem legal.A historia é bem original e interessante, pra ser honesto, eu nunca ouvi nada parecido. A historia conta que de acordo com uma lenda conhecida em toda a galaxia, uma fortaleza sombria em um planeta distante foi destruida por uma força desconhecida que veio como um meteoro gigante em forma de uma bala ^^, é dito que dentro desse "meteoro" existe um artefato poderoso, a saber, uma arma capaz de matar o passado O 0 O(woaaahhhhhow).Então você ira percorrer todas as dungeons na esperança de encontrar essa arma e matar o passado.\n\nGraficos: Os graficos do ETG são muito bonitos e bem feitos , é um belo exemplo de como os jogos/graficos 2d deveriam ser , os niveis de cores e efeitos graficos são agradaveis aos olhos , são balanceados e belos.\n\nTrilha sonora: Outro ponto positivo do ETG é a trilha sonora, original e combina bastante com cada tipo de fase , adicionando medo e adrenalina ao mesmo tempo , principalmente para aqueles com pouca vida^^.\n\nGameplay: Aqui é onde esta o segredo do sucesso de ETG, o jogo possui varios mistérios a serem explorados, um diversidade incrivel de armas,personagens,chefões e acessorios, além de gerar dungeons , armas e baus aleatorios cada vez que você morre, o que aumenta e muito o fator de re-jogabilidade. O jogo é desafiador e vai te dar um pouco de trabalho para finalizalo^^.\n\nEnter the Gungeon é realmente um presente concedido pela Dodge Roll, é divertido, colorido, bonito, desafiante, engraçado, diversificado e varias outras coisas boas. Ele trouxe de volta aquela sensação boa que os antigos jogos  costumavam causar na gente.\n\n\nEnglish Review\nEnter the gungeon is a indie/roguelike game (that means you lost everything upon death), it has a great and pleasant  2d graphic style and a very cool playability. The story is very original and interesting, to be honest,  i never heard anything like that : The story tells that according a legend kown in the whole galaxy , a dark fortress in a distant planet was destroyed by a unkown force that came like  a meteor in the form of a bullet ^^, it's said that this bullet contains a powerful artefact, said to be a gun able to kill the past O 0 O (woaaahhhhhow). So you'll run all dungeons looking for this gun in hope to kill the past.\n\nGraphics: The graphics of ETG are very beautiful and well done, it's a very good exemple of how games/graphics 2d should be, the color levels and graphics effect  are very warm and balanced.\n\nSoundtrack: another positive point of ETG is the soundtrack, original and combine with each type of stage, which add fear and adrenaline at the same time , mainly to the ones with low health ^^.\n\nGameplay: Here is the secret of  ETG's success, the game has many mysteries to be discovered and explored, an amazing diversity of guns, characters, bosses and accessories, plus the generation of random dungeons,gun and chests each time you die, which increases a lot the replayability. The game is challenging and will give you a lot of work and effort to be beaten^^.\n\nEnter the Gungeon is really a gift given to us by Dodge Roll, it's funny, colored, beautiful, challenging, diversified, and a lot of other good things. It brought back that good feeling that the retro games used to cause on us.\n\nGame: 9/10.\n\nDodge Roll team support : 10/10.","April 14","true","61.8"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjamurai/recommended/311690/","ninjamurai","Ninjamurai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjamurai/","570 products in account","I somewhat painfully say 'Yes' to reccomending this game because I do not entirely enjoy it, but I see that it has a lot of content and that it is a good and unique shooty-bullet hell-dungeon-roguelite game.\n\nPros:\n\n-The art style, sound design, and snippets of story the game gives you are great. It's all fairly similar to games like Nuclear Throne from Vlambeer, but with lots of its own charm and polish.\n\n-There are tons of unique items, enemies, and characters to collect, defeat, and rescue in this game. Each run through of the Gungeon gives you more things to unlock and more characters to meet. There is even a "Ammonomicon" that records every item you've picked up and every enemy you've killed, and tells you what they do as well as giving you some backstory about them and the gun-loving universe the game takes place in.\n\n-The gameplay is good, with fairly unique mechanics like dodge-rolling to avoid seemingly unavoidable amounts of projectiles and fun shooting.\n\nCons:\n\n-This game is very unforgiving in very many ways. I have so many 'nitpicks' with things in this game that I guess I'll make a list:\n\nMany rooms have lots of decorative scenery in the way, stopping bullets from hitting enemies and wasting precious ammo.\nIt can take a long time to find a weapon besides your starter pistol, but odds are you'll get something worse or not much better.\nAmmo, health, key, and money drops are fairly sparce. You'll go through many rooms getting barely enough money to buy one more half-a-heart, let alone a new weapon. Same goes for keys, ammo, and health.\nGungeon levels take a long time to complete, and are very hard. If you die, you have to start again from the beginning of all the floors.\nYou can eventually unlock shortcuts to start-off on later floors, but the requirements to unlock the shortcuts are very difficult to obtain, and if you choose to start a run on a later floor you won't have any weapons/powerups you could have if you started from the bottom & you will have to deal with an already more difficult floor with just starting items.\nEach character you can play as has buffs that help counteract some of the problems you face in the Gungeon, but the trade-offs (Ex. Better loot & store prices / weaker and innacurate shooting) make it such a challenge that I almost feel like it would have been better to just have one main character.\nI feel that the 6 hits you can take to begin with weren't a great choice with this style of gameplay. So many enemies and bosses are just so challenging and intensive that if you aren't on edge at all times, you will lose all of your health to simple enemies, let alone bosses. A good run can go downhill in just one room. Maybe a healthbar similar to the bosses for the player could have been more forgiving? (Seiously, ♥♥♥♥ the lead maidens)\nThere is just too much challenge and not enough reward. The odds almost always seem stacked against you, whether you get a good gun but never get ammo drops, a bad gun with too many ammo drops, great everything but no health drops, the game just keeps punishing you to keep grinding for better RNG with hopefully a little improvement of player skill as well.\nThere are instances of the word "clip" being used to describe weapons that would either have magazines, or something else entirely. Heh heh.\nOverall:\n\nIt is a good game, with good polish, and decent overall design, but I feel so conflicted because I feel like there are many things in the game itself that are conflicting. The game seems to want you to go fast but going fast gets you dead, it wants you to explore but exploring makes un-looted items dissappear, it just has a lot of smaller things that I'm not fond of. In a game like Binding of Isaac you know when you've got a good or bad run, and on either you can mess it up or get saved by a magical combination of awesome powerful items. You can feel like a badass god in a lot of runs in Binding of Isaac.\n\nFor me, it doesn't feel like that with Enter The Gungeon. Every run feels like taking a beating, with only occasional reprieve from a decent item drop. At the time of this review, I've only played around 14 hours, but it felt like I played 40. Having such constant and unwavering challenge really drains the energy out of me, and makes me have to quit earlier than I really want to due to being so damn stressed out and tired.\n\nYou'll probably like it if you liked Nuclear Throne, Binding of Isaac, and other similar rogue-y dungeon-y games, just be prepared to have to get very good and very lucky to get far into it. There is no easy mode.\n\n\n\nSuggestions?:\n(I know it isn't early access and I know I suck at the game)\n\nTo just have more loot/items drop randomly without needing a damn key to open them. Binding of Isaac had plenty of free items you would get in special rooms and throughout the environment, but in this game it just seems too limited to having to buy them or use keys to get them.\nItems in the shop to maybe be slightly cheaper in general, at least based on quality of the items for sale. Too many times I've ended up just one casing short of an item, and had to go through three more rooms of smaller enemies just to get another casing to get that half-heart I wanted. By then I usually lose more health anyway lol.\nMaybe just a bit more balancing on guns and item pools? Too many times I spend two mediocre weapons just to get the pea-shooter, which is worse than the starter pistols. I just feel like it needs an 'easy' mode, where maybe enemies and bosse don't take as many hits at least. Having bad luck with key and money drops only to end up getting the pea-shooter is a slap in the face.","May 2","true","25.1"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","29","38","2","5"

Now Gungeon wins by a long-shot, needing about 200+ hits to kill the very first boss with no upgrades, and the HP just gets continuously higher. This, coupled with the larger amount of enemy bullets on the screen, the large size of rooms and the miniscule chance to actually get an upgrade that'll speed up the fight, the first boss fight will often end up being longer than 2 minutes, and to have a fighting chance to actually win the game Gungeon asks the most of the player and expects it to be beaten without taking any damage, this is possible and can even be done reliably, but makes fighting bosses not fun and impossible for people who aren't really, really good at bullet hells.\n\n-Enemy Hp:\nThe most common enemy in gungeon will take 3 hits to kill, this isn't much more difficult than any other roguelikes, but every single floor health scales to require about another hit on average, this becomes increasingly ridiculous on the later floors and if you don't have one of the 20 best and rarest guns in the game it will almost certainly end your run. On top of the difficulty it also represents a little bit of laziness on the developer's end since they decided to scale up enemy hp and keep the same enemies with the same patterns, rather than increase the variation in enemies to the point that it wasn't necessary.\n\n-Items:\nIf i'm not mistaken there are roughly 190 guns and 400 items total, out of these about 80 will give you a benefit that will make any observable difference in your run, and the ranking system that the game uses makes those 80 out of 400 items even more rare. Good items being rare isn't a bad thing, but most of those 80 items that are the best in the game, are also nearly useless if they're not guns, and the good items that aren't straight upgrades are extremely conditional. nearly any passive that gives you a bonus is so miniscule that if you're not paying attention you can forget you picked it up at all, picking up nearly any one damage up will still leave you killing most enemies in the same amount of hits as you were before.\n\n-Characters:\nThere are a few aspects of Character variation that are very interesting and creative, but I won't mention them due to spoilers, other than that 4 characters is very measly, and the actual difference in between them is very small, you may change your playstyle a bit, but it just ends up being you playing either the Marine if you're not that good because he starts with the best gun and has the highest HP, or the Pilot if you are, because he has the best utility items. Adding more unlockable characters (and making the unlocking not so impossible) and more difference in between characters would add a lot to replayability and variation.\n\nThere's a lot that can and should be patched into the game to make it more accessible to people who prefer an experience that's challenging to a more moderate degree, even if it was in the form of an Easy Mode I wouldn't be disappointed, but as it stands now I regret buying the game and every time I play it all I want to do is stop before I get too frustrated.\n\nDisclaimer: This review was written by my brother, Egg, and does not necessarily reflect my own personal views.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/311690/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","Ver. 1.0.6\nA gun-pun riddled dungeon-crawling rogue-lite shooty-shoot "bullet-hell" that's more reliant on the player's ability to play the game and less on the items found whilst playing.\nAside from the opening and credits, the OST doesn't seem all that superb to me. At the very least they're fitting for the game.\n\nAfter playing with a controller and KB+M through multiple runs each, I think it all just comes down to a personal preference since the game is very much playable with both. There's even an option to change the Xbox button layout images to a PS4 layout. When playing with KB+M on windowed mode though the mouse doesn't stay in the screen so you can accidentally click outside and pause the game.\n\nThere's a tutorial right from the get-go so long as you walk up to it yourself. It teaches you most of the very basic mechanics & features of the game but for the rest of everything you'd either have to figure it out for yourself or search online on what anything does with what.\nThe game likes to shove the table flipping and dodge rolling to your face as if they're the most useful things ever in the game. The table flipping is barely helpful in the long run since they break pretty fast and bullets will start coming from more than one side. The dodge rolling, while is actually crucial, seems to be advertised as if it's the only way to dodge anything. If anything it's just for projectiles you can't move away from without taking damage. Like in an actual bullet-hell you can just take a few taps of movement keys each time to avoid bullets without having to rely on i-frames since most projectiles that come at you in this game are spread out. In case you're not feeling confident in dodging anything you've got a limited number of these bullet-clearing items, Blanks, that can wipe a room (or your surroundings) clean of enemy projectiles for a couple of seconds.\n\nThe game starts you off with four characters available to choose from with two secret ones you can unlock. The only real difference about them are their looks, names, and starting items with their different effects. The four starters' standard guns are short-to-mid-range, low-damaging, peashooters with infinite ammo.\nResources such as health, keys, & ammo are generally scarce so you're highly encouraged to be conserving whether that means to play it smart & better manage the usage of items or getting better at the game & making full use of what you've been given with little to no hitches. Or maybe a good mix of both. All that said there are loads of weapons and passive/active items to pick up and unlock.\nThe game likes to boast about having loads of guns since it does. Unfortunately while these overly pop-culture-referenced guns can be useful when used properly they're hardly different from one another. For example the AK-47 just feels like a more accurate MAC-10; the RPG rockets just feel like a slower-reloading Stinger missile, except the Stinger missiles also have literal bees in 'em just because; the Mega Man gun thing and Metroid gun thing are practically one and the same as they're both semi-automatic, are both chargeable & are fully charged at about the same rate, and although I couldn't compare but I'd think they do the same damage too.\nAll these guns have their uses in some form or another but plenty of 'em don't seem special from one another at times aside from their looks and their modern-audience-pandering information.\nThe further you go down the Gungeon the spongier the enemies get somewhat, even the ones you've already encountered in previous levels, so it's almost encouraging you to use the stronger guns with limited ammo. You can try to keep using the infinity-peashooter for conservation purposes but the health scaling on enemies seems like it would more prolong enemy encounters than make them more difficult, especially for the later boss fights who begin to take far too long to kill when the standard infinity peashooter is used on 'em. All that said though I've found that you can get through practically more than half a run with more guns & items than you'd probably need with proper management and gameplay skill, but that's something the player has to learn on their own for the game is by no means easy and neither is there a difficulty setting for lowering it.\nA completed first run can take almost an hour to complete and right now there's no way to save a run in progress.\n\nThroughout playthroughs you'll come across cells and cell keys to unlock them, freeing NPCs who'll have their use outside and during runs. When a cell or a cell key is found there seems to always be the other from my experience, at least so long as the entire floor is cleared so the opportunity for more NPCs is at least more than often available. These NPCs consist of things like ones that give side quests, vendors outside of playthroughs that can add items to the RNG'd item pool, and extra stores during those playthroughs. Money is relatively scarce in the game unfortunately so the extra stores during a run will very often not find their use at all. The vendors outside of runs can add new items to the item pool in exchange for Hegemony Credits, a different kind of currency that are typically found after a boss fight.\nSome of the side quests given outside of runs take far too long. For one of the NPCs they give a "hunt a number of these enemies for a reward". The reward is a new item that's to be added to the item pool and some Hegemony Credits but the enemies required to be hunted down are usually far too little in number for just one run, meaning that you'd have to go through multiple runs just to complete one hunting quest.\nOne of the NPCs provides shortcuts to the last 4 out of 5 chambers in exchange for various loads of gathered resources from multiple runs such as money, keys, and other various items that need to be on hand for the turn-in. Once the currently needed items is given and/or a shortcut is unlocked they stay that way at least.\nWhen going through the shortcut to the third chamber you're allowed one free gun from a choice of three. The choices given are randomly changed after the boss for that chamber has been defeated. For the fourth chamber you get a choice of two guns out of three and the same rule applies with the randomizing and the boss clearing thing. For the fifth chamber you can take all guns and the same rule thing applies. When going through these shortcuts though the bosses you defeat will never give Hegemony Credits.\n\nThere's a difficulty increasing mechanic of sorts in the game called "Curse". Aside from the skull that appears on the top of the character each time a point of Curse is gained from doing anything related, there's no visible counter to look at to see how many exactly you have. That anything can consist of stealing from vendors to carrying around "cursed" items that add one Curse point so long as they're held. The more points you have on hand the more chances you'll have of encountering "Jammed" enemies (bosses included) which are basically harder versions of an enemy who have far more health, move & attack faster, have faster bullet velocities, and always deal a full heart's worth of damage (practically anything else does half  a heart against you) unless you have armor, in which case one piece of the armor goes first no matter what. The limit of points you can get is 10 and once it reaches that, an immortal enemy that will constantly follow and attack you will stick around for the rest of that run even if you somehow decrease the points you have on.\n\nGame's tough & requires actual need of a player's ability to get through it. I do think though a bit of balancing should be applied in this game not for difficulty's sake, but for enjoyment's.\nI found it overall fun nonetheless.\n\nSide-note: I think this should be marketed towards Asians more. Much of that playerbase has more fun with this than the casual "Isaac" crowd.","April 20","true","157.5"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","2"

The boss fights are challenging and it is really important to get good at fighting the bosses.  Even the first floor bosses are legitimately difficult and after almost 100 hours i still sometimes get hit if i don't get a decent gun before the first boss fight. However when you beat a boss without getting hit you get an Hp upgrade, hp upgrades are really rare and if you want to beat the real final boss of the game you usually need some extra hp.\n\n2. Backtracking is super fast because the game has teleporters in every other room.\n\n3. One overpowered gun doesn't immediatly win you the game. There is no single item or gun that is so strong that you can't lose anymore when you get it.\n\n4. Gun management adds a layer of strategy.  In a normal run of gungeon you will get at least 10 guns. You often have to make a decision how to use your guns, you could use your strongest gun to clear rooms or you could save it for the boss.\n\n5. The Ammonomicon is great. I hate it if i don't know what items do in rogue-likes, not in this game because every item you pick up is listed in the Ammonomicon and you can look up what it does.\n\n6. The Gunplay and the variety of guns is excellent. It is very satisfying to use the guns in this game, if you get a shotgun it feels like shotgun. If you get the megaman hand it feels like you are playing as megaman. Also most of the "joke" guns are at least functional.\n\n7. Hazards are unambiguous.  In Enter the Gungeon enemy bullets are always bright/red if they deal half a heart and always dark/red if they deal a full heart of damage. Your character never shoots red bullets, your followers never shoot red bullets it is always obvious if something will do damage to you.\n\n8. Tons of content  The game has tons of content, not only does it have an absurd amount of npcs that you can unlock there are like 15? On top of that it offers 5 regular floors, 2 secret floors, pasts that you can kill for all of the main characters, 2 secret characters and a 6th super difficult floor if you have killed all the pasts. I have played almost 100 hours and i still have stuff to do.\n\n9. The art and music in this game are superb  Not only does the game look gorgeous but the amount of details is insane - little trails of dust behind running characters, your dog can dodgeroll over pits to keep up with you, tons of destructible objects like books or barrels that leave behind debris. Also let's not forget about the soundtrack, even after almost 100 hours i still enjoy listening to the soundtrack.\n\nThings i don't like:\n\nThe frifle challenges are too grindy, it often takes more than 15 runs to complete 1 hunt. You can specifically farm for the challenge with elevators and speed the process up a little but it still takes forever.\n\nBossrush is unlocked way too late, i consider bossrush a learning tool to get better at killing bosses, however in gungeon you unlock it so late in the game that by the time it is unlocked you probably can already defeat most of the bosses efficiently.\n","April 24","true","130.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

The hype was really, really real.\n\nEnter the Gungeon is colourful, vibrant and the pixel particle effects and animations are really something special.  Some of the guns are really cool too, like the Gungeon Ant that fires puddles of flammable oil, then, when reloaded, shoots fireballs to ignite your insanely cute and equally lovable Bullet Kin enemies, and the Gun Bow, you can probably guess on this one. The pop-culture references are really interesting also, like the Proton Pack from Ghostbusters and the Cobalt Hammer, an endorsement to CobaltStreak and Richard Hammer, two great Twitch streamers. Contrary to popular opinion, this game really isn't too much like The Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne, having put 250*+ hours into Rebirth/Afterbirth and 140*+ hours into Nuclear Throne, I can't really feel it. I hate to say it, but I'm not as big of a fan of this game as I wanted to be, hell, what I was expecting to be. There's 4 playable characters, with 2 extra unlockable characters that are seriously tough to unlock, which cuts the amount of replayability this game offers. Gungeon is fun, don't get me wrong, it's a blast, but it's just too difficult. I consider myself at least half-decent at games of its caliber, such as the previously mentioned pieces, but this game seriously puts me in my place. It's a repetitive, somewhat annoying, linear system of finding a great weapon to carry you through the insanely progressively difficult floors and if you don't, you can put money on your demise. The synergies are lackluster too, they're no-where near as fun or exciting as something like a homing, quadshot brimstone (TBOIR) or a nuke launcher with boiling veins (NT), they are shamefully infrequent too. The music found is this game is cool and catchy, and I love the main theme and could sit in the menu listening to it forever.\n\nI struggled with wether to reccomend this game or not, not on it's cheerful soundtrack, stunning visuals, sometimes interesting and definately plentiful weaponry or it's cool lore, but on the idea of it being just too hard, on a run-to-run basis, resources are very rare, items in the game's shops are very expensive and the majority of the 'Gungeons' guns suck. Some of the bosses are fun to fight, and some are a frustrating nightmare of difficulty, and after trawling through the strenuous floors, you can die in seconds of entering a boss room if low on ammo or health (especially one you haven't faced before and you're unfamiliar to it's attacks and whatnot)\n\nOverall, I like Gungeon, and this review, as you can see, is a positive that recommends the game. But I'm not quite sure yet if Gungeon is on a similar level to the games it's so often compared to, or even other, fun, Rogue-likes, I feel it sits alone, crying, in the corner over it's uncanny differences and punishing nature begging for some form of training option in the Breach where players can hone their skills and become a more competent Gungeoneer that enjoys the game a whole lot more, a rather severe balancing alteration to just about everything in the game, or a difficulty slider.\n\n\nI hope this review hasn't made me come across as a naysayer of Enter the Gungeon, because I'm not, I'm a huge fan, that's why I've emphasised it's strong points and left this as a recommended review to sink into the statistics. But this game could be a lot better, offering just as much replayability as well-cemented gods of the Rogue-like genre. Gungeon has potential, the things I like about this game definately out-weigh the negatives, but this review is to aid those questioning Gungeons difficulty, and yeah it's real tough.","April 12","true","11.9"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","0"

The guns you can get are very creative at times and the bosses are also likewise pretty wacky and creative.\n\nMy main issue with this game though is how it has certain flaws that tarnish the whole experience.\n\nFirst and foremost, this game relies on RNG way too much. In fact it can at times be so extreme that it makes the game much harder than it already is. As an example, you can potentially go floors without getting those "oh so vital keys" that without, your not going to win unless your already an expert at the game.\n\nHowever, it goes even further than this as to access much of the game, including secret floors, you need to have lady luck smiling on you, little to no skill involved. That isn't to say that this game is just mindless luck with no skill involved. Its just that these little aspects can potentially ruin the experience.\n\nTo cut a long story short, if your looking for something to fill that binding of isaac hole in your life then this game will most likely provide.

The soundtrack: it's not bad but it's also not as good as it ould have been.\n2. The starter guns: when you start a new run your character (there are multiple you can choose from with diffrent items and guns) has one or two guns (always the same) until you find another gun (on the first floor I've found 0-2) you are stuck on this basic gun. Since these guns just fire generic bullets, have no cool theme, small magazines and quite a slow fireing speed the start is boring if not even ennoying.\n\nWhile these two points could be improved the game is still super fun and I would recommend it.

I see what the developers had hoped to make and while their influences are obvious (Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne are the most obvious), they failed to understand some of the mechanics of those games.\n\nBasic enemies, the same enemies that you see in the first level, will appear in later ones with increased health. This hampers the feel of progress and also makes guns lose their effectiveness as the game goes on. Why not just have more low-level enemies but increase the number of them in each encounter as you progress?\n\nI know these games can get real crappy if your RNG isn't right, but in Gungeon it's worse since each floor takes some time to complete. There are a massive amount of upgrades in this game - guns, stat increases, extra HP, items that enhance your Blanks (instead of bombs, blanks are pick-ups that open hidden walls AND destroy enemy bullets), even items that add an effect to flipping tables for cover. Yet due to all this variation you can wind up with a very weak start by getting a slew of joke/gimmicky guns, receiving niche upgrades such as table-flipping ones, or just not getting enough keys to open chests while the Shop has 4 pairs of hearts and a joke gun for sale.\n\nI understand that this game's focus is on it's large collection of guns and yet I find myself hoping for a basic no-frills AK-47 or shotgun instead of something wacky that does low damage just because of how much HP-scaling enemies and bosses hamper this game. Ammo can be an issue as it's not guarenteed to drop at all and MIGHT be sold in the shop. I found myself carrying 3 empty guns by level 4 when I first got there; I had 4 by the time I reached level 5.\n\nThere are some nice quality-of-life improvements over it's contemporaries, but as a whole Enter the Gungeon left me feeling dissapointed after each run regardless of how well I did just because of how poorly equipped my loadout was - something that prior "rogue-lite" games did not do.","April 18","false","35.3"," 99 of 185 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","99","185","2","9"

I will start off by saying this game is HARD. But so are all rogue-lites, you are supposed to get good at them by playing it over and over again and eventually the patterns are muscle memory and you can dodge without thinking. But being the noob I am, this game has given me a lot of frustration along with the fun. I think this frustration comes from the really boring early game this game provides. Your starting weapons and passives aren't anything super fancy and sometimes you don't even get a secondary weapon on the first floor. But that' RNG for ya. The problem though is not that the first floors are hard, it's that they are boring. You need to get through the starting floors with a bad arsenal to access the glory that awaits in the later floors. Comparing it to isaac, It's like starting as Maggy and getting stuff like mom's lipstick and sister maggy but then getting brimstone once you reach the late game. Despite my awfulness at this game I won't say it isn't fun, once you DO get good at it, the weapon vareity in this game is insane, there is a gun that shoots bees for ♥♥♥♥s sake (it carried my first run real hard).

This game is incredibly fun and addicting, and here's how I'd put it:\n\n\nPros:\n------\n\n-Unique Experience. Every level is procedurally generated, and filled with an assortment of different rooms with which to fight your enemies. You can flip tables for cover, dodge out of the way of enemy bullets, and even use traps to your advantage. I have yet to see everything in this game myself, but from the looks of it already, it's already a blast!\n\n\n-Destructible Environment. You flip that table up for cover? I got bad news, they can shoot that crap down! There's also an assortment of cool (yet rather pointless) amenities on the ground, such as crates, armor stands and barrels! You can of course break these down too. It may not have a purpose but it is OHHH so satisfying!\n\n\n-Fast-paced combat. You ever wanted to play a game like The Binding of Isaac, but it had 1000% more bullet hell added to it? Well this is what you get. Right off in the beginning of the game, I was thrown into a room with an enemy that shot a giant diamond-patterned bullet barrage at me, and completely caught me off guard. There are also standard shooters, shotgunners, and of course the insanity that follows every boss fight o_o. This game is definitely not made for the people that take their time, if you are caught in a barrage, you'd better be ready to roll effectively!\n\n\n-Comical Relief. This game is absolutely FULL of comical references, and references to other video games. Pretty much every boss name is a pun on something, and almost every enemy is themed on some form of weapon. Be it a literal, walking bullet, or a rolling bomb.\n\n\n-Character Selection. Every available character to you from the start of this game each has their own unique weapon or item attached to them. You can of course obtain these weapons normally through the game, or you can start with one! Be it a character with the ability to lockpick chests if you have no keys, or a character with a crossbow and a pet dog! The choices are yours, and they're 100% awesome.\n\n\n\nCons:\n------\n\n-Variety. After you do a couple dozen runthroughs of this game, you quickly begin to realize that procedural generation has a limit on how interesting it can get. Albeit it's nothing that would stray you too far from this game, but I feel as though perhaps there should be a few more changes to this. Character Selection could do with a bit of variety as well, in the way of weapons and active items.\n\n\n-Balancing. Some bosses in this game are downright crazy hard. Hard to the point where you want to rip your hair out and never play it again. I feel as though some guns in this game as well as bosses could do with a bit of tweaking. Of course, this is a bullet hell-style game, so naturally for me this is already an issue. That being said, I have no intention of quitting on this game, due to how fun bullet hell actually is. Seriously though, Treadnaught should be nerfed.\n\n\n-Rarity. Now this doesn't mean what you think it means. I'm perfectly fine with the rarity of certain guns amongst others, as well as shop items, but the consumables in this game are where my real weakness is. Finding a key for any one of the chests you'll come across in this game is not as easy as you might think. Every floor I've done in this game has had at least 2 chests, and there are times where I don't get any keys whatsoever. Hearts to replenish your health with are even rarer. Perhaps this is not actually a flaw on the game but rather an intended game design, I'll have to look into it more. This game certainly isn't for the weak of heart.\n\n\n\n\nWith that all out of the way, I can safely say I highly recommend this game. It may have it's gripes, as do other games, but this one in particular holds a special place in my heart. The comical relief, the bullet hell, the RPG elements. I can't see this getting old anytime soon, and I certainly hope you find the same appeal I did.\n\n8.5/10","April 21","true","28.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Simple.Rich.Long Lasting.\n\nThis game is heavily influenced by Binding of isaac (Being the biggest inspiration) as well as games like "Nuclear Throne" "Dark Souls" and some other games.\n\n*Simple* - Story is easy to understand, controls are familiar, isn't very original.\n*Rich* - Lot's of guns and items each being different, intresting enemies and challenging bosses.\n*Long Lasting* - Game has enough content and a great Co-Op for You to have atleast 30+ hours spent on it.\n\nSound/Audio in this game is great and that short 5 second "Chi Ching" after you defeat a hard enemy or a boss doesn't lack a great feeling of "Booyah!"\n\nPixely Art Style matches perfectly with audio and doesn't "Scratch Your eyes". Infact, it feels very well done.\n\nBad Things\n*Hard to find secret rooms* - Unlike in Binding Of Isaac where there was a method of doing so, in Enter The Gungeon there is no "Right" or "Accurate" way of finding a secret room.\n\n*Needs some balancing there and there* - This might not be a problem for everyone, but I feel like some boss fights are a bit unfair and seem impossible to not get hit by it once, making it harder to gain masteries later during the game.\n\nConclusion: Is a great game and is worth a shot. 9/10\n\n\n\n","April 19","true","29.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheezy_squeezy/recommended/311690/","cheezy_squeezy","cheezy squeezy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheezy_squeezy/","107 products in account","To the very broad question 'do I recommend this game' my short answer is yes. It's been said to death that this is a Binding of Isaac + Nuclear Throne hybrid and to some extent it is, so if that sounds like something you'd be interested in it probably is. It is pretty fun and I'm probably going to be playing it for a while, just like I have done with the two previously mentioned games of the same 'action rogue-lite shooty shooty boom boom 'tough as nails'' genre.\n\nHowever, the long answer is that it could have been much more.\n\nThis game is a cake, but not any cake. The bakers of this cake thought of a perfect combination, an ice cream cake and an oozing chocolate fudge brownie cake. What it ended up having was the worst of both worlds. There was not enough ice cream and there was not enough oozing chocolate to fit in one cake, so you only got to enjoy a little bit of each. However, the bakers had their own homemade ice cream and chocolate ooze put into the cake to differentiate it from its inspirations.\n\nThe game's biggest problem is that you can't be overpowered. In fact, you're going to be underpowered except for maybe the first two chambers (stages, floors, whatever you want to call them).\nIn many Rogue-lites like Binding of Isaac and Risk of Rain, if you're good/lucky enough to make it to the point where you have the perfect item combination to make yourself overpowered, it's so satisfying. In minutes you will be progressing the stages and killing the final boss in a couple of hits.\nIn Gungeon you can't. Damage ups barely exist as you will never see them, and the most common way of upgrading damage is by using a shrine that lets your sacrifice one heart container for a barely noticeable damage boost.\n\nWhere in Nuclear Throne where everything is overpowered, you can kill the most common enemy in two hits with the starting pistol and kill several weaklings at once with a shotgun, which is much more satisfying than in Gungeon. But it's not easier, as you also die in three hits to the most common bullets and without the any HP enhancements you can die in one hit to the very late game enemies.\n\nIt is much more easy to go through this game without getting hit a single time than in the other games, with the enemy bullets being very slow and you having an invincible dodge roll. But when you can survive, so can the enemies. You can sit there for a good 10 seconds on the most basic yellow bullet enemy in the late game with the starting pistol shooting it for it to die.\n\nBasically every gun in this game is what I like to call a 'LOLOLOL XDDDD I'M SHOOTING T-SHIRTS LOLOLOLOLOL' gun. Instead of opting for incredibly powerful and satisfying guns like in Nuclear Throne with the Incinerator for example, a quad machine gun that shoots fire, they would go for a Water Gun or a T-Shirt cannon.\n\nNot to mention that enemy health scales with each level. In level 1 and 2 you can kill the most basic yellow bullet enemy in 1 hit (which is perfect! Crossbows are meant to be slow, precise and powerful) in level 3 it will take 2 and 4 it will take 3 (I'm pretty sure, anyway). This would be fine if you were guaranteed to get more and more powerful guns as the run progresses, but for some reason I'm getting the T-Shirt cannon and water gun. Seriously?\n\nIn a game where some people are going to be playing for hundreds of hours like they would this game's inspirations, they're going to stop think getting the 'LOLOLOL XDDDD' guns are funny after they first get them and will groan instead.\n\nIt sucks because there are good guns in this game that are satisfying, but because of the over saturation of terrible 'LOL XDDD' guns you're unlikely to get them. I personally think a more 'LOLOLOL XDDD' experience would be in Binding of Isaac when you get so overpowered and are killing every enemy in two hits, including the final boss, or in Nuclear Throne where the have a Crossbow that shoots five bolts at a time and all home on enemies instead of shooting T-Shirts like in Gungeon.\n\nI also appreciate the reference guns, like the Super Meat Gun to Super Meat Boy and the Mega Buster from Mega Man but they suffer the same fate of being underpowered.\n\nThere ARE cool, unique guns that are good, too! Like the glacier gun, that shoots like a powerful slug of ice and slows enemies, but they are definitely in the minority.\n\nWhere you can feel like a complete badass in Nuclear Throne, slashing away at enemies in 1 hit with an energy sword and blasting them with a double minigun, you can only hope to get a much, much more weak minigun in Gungeon for example.\n\nThere are few interesting passive items that aren't like anything you've seen in Isaac and you don't get many. I also have only found maybe 4 good active items; an invincibility potion, a jetpack that lets you fly and move faster and the expense of no dodge rolling, a potion that lets you shoot double of the bullets from your gun and various different throwing bombs/molotovs/etc.\n\nPlease do not get the wrong impression, though. If you like this genre at all then you'll love it for sure, for a short time at least. You might not have the same gripes as me, and that's completely fine. Just know this is not like Nuclear Throne or Binding of Isaac. When you get the dungeon crawling of Binding of Isaac you missout on the fast paced-action of Nuclear Throne, and when you get the guns from Nuclear Throne you don't get nearly as many passive and active items as in Binding of Isaac. You're getting the best and worst of both worlds at the same time, so if you're leaning toward one type of game more than the other just go for Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne.","April 20","true","36.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","2"

I haven't played many roguelikes before, but one really needs some skill and knowlege to play this game. Every run makes you learn something new and improve your skill.\n\nA lot of weapons, characters and other secrets to discover. The cool thing about the guns, is that they aren't randomized like for example in borderlands, where every gun is made out of a couple of assets (like barrel, stock, grip, element, maker, etc.) and put together, where you'll mostly find the same guns that perform and look slightly different. In the gungeon however, they are all handcrated, and not randomized, meaning a lot of them are unique (not that borderlands didn't have any unique weapons... but still). If they make a steam workshop for this game and say, add new guns from the comunity every month or so, this game will be amazing, with thousands of weapons and guns.\n\nCons:\n\nI have a glitch where when I'm in the breach (starting area) All my characters look normal. However, as I go into the dungeon, the whole character sprite just turns black, with the exception of the gun. Not that it's game breaking, just please fix.\n\nThey missed a great oportunity of music choice here. The music is OK, but they should have put in something similiar to hotline maimi 2's electro music. I really want a mod to change the music (If one can mod this game of course)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 5","true","21.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The story is that there's a dungeon with a gun that can kill the past. This makes people with a past they want to change look far and wide to find that gun. You play as one of four "gungeoneers" that are out for the gun to change his/her past. Although the story is a rather good idea, it doesn't really have a big impact until far into the game. The game has co op, although it's limited to playing on the same device.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay in Enter the Gungeon is much more fast paced than other rogue lite like the binding of isaac. The reason for this is the teleporter system they have, which makes you able to backtrack really fast so you get to combat a lot faster. The different weapons have a lot of variety to them and different mechanics so the game does'nt get repetetive.  The way you unlock new weapons and items are mostly with hegemony credits. You get the credits as drops from killing bosses in the game. This makes even a run that you lost feel okay as you still made some progress with the unlocks.\n\nOne of the biggest problems the gameplay have is the early game, as it can take quite a while to get a decent weapon and before you do that clearing rooms and bosses can take a really long time. Another problem is the cost of the late game unlocks. It can take you around 6-7 runs to just unlock ONE new item, and as every run takes around 40 minutes to an hour it makes it really time consuming to just unlock one new item. This doesn't fit in with the rest of this fast paced game.\n\nPros\nFast paced\nPretty artstyle and music\nA cheap price for a good game\n\nCons\nEarly game is slow\nCan be RNG based\nNo online multiplayer (Without using workarounds)\nSlow late game unlocks\n\nConclusion\nEnter the Gungeon is a really good game that even people that normally don't enjoy rogue lights can enjoy. If you have the money for the game its worthwhile to get it, especially if it's on sale.","May 17","true","48.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I've played a few hours so I'm more or less just going to look over the basics.\n\nStory You play as one of the four character looking to clear your past. The story tells of an ancient gun with the power to kill your  past... this is what you seek. This game really takes the whole gun theme to the extreme, so much that it becomes obnoxious at times. And because of this I couldn't care one bit about the story. I don't really feel like this game has it's own identity like Isaac or Nuclear Throne. It doesn't have the same charm or feeling as Isaac and it doesn't have the interesting atmosphere or story of Nuclear Throne... it just has guns and pop-culture references. It makes it hard for me to care about these character's story when the characters themselves are just references to characters in other media.\n\nGameplay This is where the meat of the game is. In short, it's good. Feels smooth and responsive. (This game actually works well with a controller!) The main gimick with the gameplay seems to be rolling. Rolling allows you to completely dodge bullets and takes some time getting used too and is necessary, but once you get the hang of it, rolling becomes satisfying and rewarding. New guns and items are fun to find. But sadly RNG can be a real pain.  Ever play the Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth?  This game also really hard. But most of that difficulty can be seen as artificial difficulty due to RNG. In Nuclear Throne regardless of what guns I get I never feel like I'm having a "bad run" (unless I get a bad spawn) But in Gungeon I feel like that often. It doesn't seem as often as The Binding of Isaac though.\n\nAudio and Visual The art is really nice, however nothing new. The animations can be real pretty! The soundtrack is ok. I wouldn't listen to it outside of the game and none of the tracks are very memorable.\n\nSummary  PROS\nTight and responsive controls (Even with a controller)\nPretty art and animations\nInteresting items\n\nCONS\nThe overall gun theme and constant references can be VERY obnoxious after awhile\nRNG can be a pain\n\nVerdict Overall this is an enjoyable game. Is it enough to replace Isaac or Nuclear Throne? Maybe, that's for you to decide. Personally I'd say no. It lacks the charm and style that make me love Nuclear Throne and Binding of Isaac\nIf you enjoy either of those games and you're looking for something new, I'd recommend it, but keep in mind this isn't really anything new or groundbreaking it's simply taking the formula we all know and love and spicing it up a bit.\n\nThanks for reading!","April 17","true","4.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

You'll just be wasting your money if you're the kind of person that doesn't like working hard in games for your victory.\n\nAnyway, on to the actual review:\n\nPros\n+Good music (although it isn't particularly memorable, and unlike, say, nuclear throne, each level doesn't feel like its music has a specific 'theme' or mood to it.)\n+Tight controls\n+Lots of weapon (and item) variety.\n+Really, really good pixel art. Compared to this game, Binding of Isaac's art looks like a project made by a uni student.\n+As well as good art, the game has a great overall polish to its art and details.\n+♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of charm. The enemies, the bosses, the pun-filled item names - You can tell they put loads of love and care into every inch of this game.\nNeutrals\n~Lots of references to things that'll make you go 'ha i get it' a lot. Neutral because some people hate having every second item be a reference to something, and prefer having the fourth wall unbroken.\n~Punishing, punishing, punishing difficulty. Really, if you're not a huge fan of roguelites already, and you find BoI unplayable because of difficulty, don't buy this game. I, and a lot of other people, love a good challenge in a game, but challenge just really isn't everybodies cup of tea.\nNegatives\n-Enemies feel way too tanky. Scaling health really doesn't help this either. It should really take a few notes from nuclear throne.which maintains difficulty throughout without adding unnessecary health that just drags the game on and on. The tankiness causes each floor to take way longer than it should, and to be honest, the game could be made 20x better if they removed (or at least lessened) health scaling, and taking some health off of unnecessarily tanky enemies (i'm looking at you, blue shotgun kin).\n-RNG's stupid artificial difficulty. If I get no new gun on the first floor, thus making me take 10 more minutes to beat the first boss and thus taking damage because the fight lasts too long, denying me from a health up (which, I might add, is very hard to beat the game without), who's fault is it? I'll tell you: the ♥♥♥♥ing game's. The dumb RNG also unhelpfully syngergises with my previous point, where I've been in situations where you have no ammo for other guns and are forced to use the starting gun on the last floor, and let me tell you: that alone is dumb as ♥♥♥♥, because it took me 5 minutes to beat 1 room, while taking tonnes of damage because of the fact alone that the starting gun does no damage to the enemies which take 50x as many hits to kill as the first floor. RNG is just utter bull in this game, and I could probably list 50 more examples of why.\n-In a game about guns, finding cool new guns, and using said guns, there just isn't enough ammo. If you want a chance at surviving at the latter floors, you basically have to use ONLY your starting gun(s) on the first two floors. This drags the game on pointlessly. As well as this, a lot of guns get given a 'too good to use' mentality, meaning that you're only gonna  use them on bosses, then go back to using your weak-♥♥♥ guns on the actual floors, which, I'll remind you, is 99% of the game. Really, the game could be made way more fun by scrapping the current ammo system entirely, and giving it more of a nuclear throne approach, with ammo drops that only give you a small amount of bullets randomly dropping from enemies.\n\nAll in all, it's still a fun game, despite its flaws. It could use work in the game's pacing and RNG though, which is why I'm giving it:\n\n8/10\n\nGreat fun, if a little infuriating at times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bbblitz/recommended/311690/","bbblitz","Big Bang Blitz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bbblitz/","391 products in account","Some games are easy. Some are unfair. Sometimes you have trouble until you find a quirk or an exploit that carries you through it. Sometimes you unlock things over time that make the game a cinch. Sometimes havings someone play with you makes the game a push-over. Sometimes you can get so good it just doesn't matter what the game can do to you. Often times you can adjust the difficulty up or down if you feel overwhelmed. Sometimes there is just nothing you can do at all to make any progress and other times grinding is a definite requirement.\n\nThis is not that type of game. You will die. You will die a lot. It will always be your fault and you always will know exactly why. You'll constantly get better.. you'll have good runs with great luck and bad runs where your skill carries you through and eventually you will get further and further in and more and more powerful over time.. but this game will notice. It will notice you and it will fight back tooth and nail. It will evolve with you. It learns. It never hints at it yet you can feel it grow as you do always offering a steeper challenge each time. Subtley it will start adding tougher and more enemies with faster bullets in tighter more dangerous spaces. Enemies will begin to fire away from where you are and instead where you will be and bosses get a lot meaner. This is a game where almost everything about it changes constantly. Game rules get broken, things are added and subtracted without warning and i've still not found any solid strategy that works 100% every time.\n\nIt's one hell of a challenge and dangerously addictive. This game does not hold your hand and does not care if you die, but it sure has a huge bag of carrots it holds out in front of you while it rides on your back. I've never seen a game so full of interesting weapons and items that drastically and fundamentally change almost everything about the game, forcing you to evolve constantly with what you're given or what you're lacking at the time. Truly no two plays are anything alike.\n\nThe graphics are great. Pixel art is an easy thing to take for granted as a developer you can just kinda toss it out there and say "Look it's retro!", but this game has pixel art that is actually just really good art. Masterful work. Everything is well defined and well animated.\n\nThe sound design is also great. You can actually pinpoint the locations of off screen enemies just from the sound they make spawning in. Each type of projectile has it's own satisfying sound it makes as it lands on your targets.\n\nThe game has a really excellent soundtrack too. It's one of those organic ones that change in intensity based on the action and does a great job conveying atmosphere.\n\nThe game has loads of options for gameplay and controls including full gamepad/keyboard remapping and color blind modes plus camera options and fun stuff.\n\nThis game runs on Unity. It is also my favorite game that runs on Unity. It is well made; engaging and has a fantastic feedback loop that gives you all sorts of reasons to come back for just one more run.  Yes it is punishingly difficult I can't overstate that, but you will have fun playing this and I could recommend it to anyone especially at how low the cost is. It's silly good.","April 22","true","66.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Enter the Gungeon offers tons of replayability to the player, with just about 17 hours I had my first clear of the game, not to mention, one of many, and not even scraped the surface of whats beneath this amazing title!\n\nThe gameplay is fresh, clearly inspired by Nuclear Throne / Binding of Isaac BUT with a twist! The dodgeroll allows you to completely ignore any incoming Attack for the remainder of it, a'la Dark Souls.\nThis allows for a reasonably high Skill Ceiling when trying to achieve perfect runs.\nThe way the game is executed, every step you take in the game is calculated towards the outcome of your run.\nI found that, losing health early can snowball the run into oblivion if I end up with bad luck and don't get enough health back, while certainly possible to beat the game without getting hit, it gets increasingly difficult as you progress in the game. REALLY difficult.\n\n"How difficult is it in comparison to Binding of Isaac?"\nIsaac is a piece of cake in comparison to Enter the Gungeon - you don't nearly get enough health or items during your gameplay, which effectively makes you play much more careful and punishes bad decisions heavily.\n\nRemember, how in Binding of Isaac, a certain combination of Items could catapult you through the entire Game and essentially make it trivial? While in Enter The Gungeon powerful items sure do exist, they don't have as massive of an impact on your success.\nBosses will still barrage you with seemingly endless amounts of bullets and what not. They definitely want you to ROLL! If you think you can simply faceROLL (heh..) a boss and ignore most of its mechanics, you will be gunned down.\n\nPros:\nFantastic, Fresh and Unique Gameplay\nAmazing Pixelart & Animations\nGreat & Creative variety of Weapons / Items\nInteresting Minigames & Secret Mechanics\nBaller Soundtrack\nGun Puns\n\nCons:\nLackluster Character selection (Only 4 Characters and they aren't unique enough)\nExtremely punishing for beginners (subjective, this differes from player to player, I personally like the challenge)\nPoor Controller Controls (KB&M definitely rock here)\nEnemy variety is based on Floors - you won't see more advanced enemies on Floor 1 - essentially making every run feel the same.\nSome Weapons need rebalancing. There are too many similar functioning ones that are just useless.\n\nOverall, Enter The Gungeon gets a 8/10 from me.\n\nI had fun so far and I will continue to have fun with this game, give it a SHOT.

You'll find yourself wondering why you just aren't playing The Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne, who handle their respective niches much better.\n\nGungeon appears to have taken the slow, strategic, and stingy rooms of Isaac and mashed them up with Nuclear Throne -- without tuning them for faster-paced combat requiring intense concentration. Each room feels like a slog to get through, and chances are, they won't reward you with anything for your efforts. The same is true for bosses: Encounters that should inspire the player to get better end up discouraging them, because the fights take far too long for the amount of concentration the player needs.\n\nThe lack of meaningful rewards, the difficulty of trash rooms, and the length and intensity of boss fights would each be fine on their own. However, Gungeon combines the three, as though that combination is how you make a game challenging. If one of these aspects were changed, Gungeon would be a great game. As it stands, though, it suffers from a startling lack of balance, and I find myself regretting the $15 more often than not.","April 25","false","12.6"," 50 of 95 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","50","95","0","15"

There are many items and guns, with lots of fun synergies akin to Risk of Rain or Isaac.\n\nMost importantly, Gungeon doesn't hold your hand.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/healyk/recommended/311690/","healyk","Postage Stamp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/healyk/","508 products in account","Do I recommend Enter the Gungeon? It feels like there is a very good game sitting in front of me that's just a bit off.  I really want to recommend it to people.  But I'm very hesistant.\n\nFirst let's talk about what the game does right.  It's got beautiful pixel art.  The soundtrack is amazing.  Bulletkin are adorable enemies to kill.  The game itself takes the idea of Guns + Dungeon and runs with to the end.  I can really appreciate a game that has a consistent theme and doesn't open a DnD monster manual to figure out what enemies to add.\n\nThere are a couple parts where Gungeon fails as a game.\n\nAccuracy is a stat.  It's pretty bad when you try and make a skill based game that smudges the players aim simply to pad the stat list.  This means all your shots won't hit their targets with all guns.  I don't want to make a lot of Binding of Isaac comparisons, but this is one thing BoI does right: shots go where you shoot them.\n\nMany enemies look the same.  This is a problem when you're trying to make a snap decision about how to deal with a room.  Too many of the bulletkin look exactly the same but function differently.  The shopkeeper will tell you that "Rubber bullets don't hurt" (they don't cause damage).  At one point I believed the game was lying to me when they were causing damage.  Turns out there are two enemies that are different shades a purple, attack in the same way, but one causes damage and the other doesn't.  This isn't an isolated occurance -- a lot of enemies look similar and function differently.\n\nIt's about dodging patterns except when it isn't.  Most Dungeon Shumps depend on easily memorizable patterns for enemy fire.  The game increases it's difficulty by throwing enemies that spam bullets in unmemorizable patterns at you.  Sometimes this is fine because you can use the dodge roll mechanic to get out of it.  Sometimes this leads to unavoidable damage because the spam cloud is so large dodge rolling will just land you in more bullets.\n\nUnavoidable Damage  One of my runs ended when I opened a chest.  This chest was a mimic and caused unavoidable damage when I opened it.  Being on half a heart (and hoping the chest might contain health) this ended the run.  I've had quite a few runs where I've set the controller down gently and thought to myself "There was nothing I could do there".  They weren't rage inducing moments where you fling the controller across the room.  They were moments accepting that it was just unfair RNG and the only thing to do was to move on.\n\nIt's not a Dungeon full of Guns.  This is the worst offender for me.  I bought the game expecting a Dungeon overflowing with fun firearms to use.  There are definitely some awesome guns.  But for every "I could kill everything with this thing" gun there are 10 limp noodles.  Most guns turn out to be highly situtational.  Sadly many guns don't fall into the 'boss killer' category meaning they're not a power upgrade.  The real difficulty spikes happen when you face bosses, and your ability to progress is more dependent on if you can kill a boss than if you can clear a room.  Fighting the second floor boss with the starting weapons just isn't fun after doing it so many times.\nSome things that are more personal opinion about why I do not like the game.  Others may not care about these points, or find them to be positives:\n\nElimitation of most of the Meta Game.  Passives are highly situtational and usually useless.  If you leave anything lying in a room without using it there is a good chance an NPC will come along a 'steal' it.  They leave a note thanking you for the item.  It feels like they're trying to actively encourage you to not play levels as resource provides and only offering items the moment they drop.  Many times you'll realize that an item dropped after leaving the room but come back to only find a note.  This aspect to me is just Not Fun as a long time Binding of Isaac player.\n\nOffscreen enemy firing  Most enemies can see you when you can't see them.  You'll occassionally walk into enemy fire without seeing the enemy.\n\nHitboxes I could drive a Haul Truck through.  This isn't Ikaruga with a small hitbox.  Many times a bullet will graze your head and you'll take damage.  The problem is the visual representation differs from the way the game functions.  I expect some bullets to travel behind me (because of the semi-isometric view) but they still end up hitting me because of how large my hitbox is.  This cuts both ways in the end -- enemy hitboxes are huge as well.  You can often shoot the top tip of an enemies head and cause damage when they're coming aroudn a corner.\nUltimately, to most gamers, I would not recommend Enter the Gungeon.  If someone was a long time fan of Isaac/Nuclear Throne/Our Darker Purpose and wanted something new I might recommend it.  If you're interested since it bleeds an amazing look you may want to pick it up (or wait for a sale).  If you're looking for a skill based game in the genre I'd look at something else.\n\nAlso, if a 13 year old came to me and asked for a game they could spew "Git Gud" at anyone who disagreed with their opinion about it, I would recommend this game.

I've heard people say it is easy and they have beaten it in 8 hours. Good for them. I've played Dark Souls 1 and 2 and they are both easier than this game because they aren't based on complete randomness. 18 hours in and I am making zero progress. And to all the "get gud" kids, it's not about that. I've beaten harder games than this because they are consistent and not so constantly random in health and weapon drops. For example I beat Risk of Rain in 3 hours and it is for sure harder than this game. One main problem with this game is that playing with keyboard you have no chance of not taking dmg because using wasd to move your fingers can't keep up with how fast you need to move to avoid constant bullet streams/walls, but with a gamepad I found it much easier, but the problem is that you move too fast using a gamepad joystick so you careen into bullets like crazy. I've made it to lvl 4 out of 5 in this dog turd but I got there with 1 heart and lasted maybe 3 rooms. I can be doing perfect, but when I get to the bosses, they spray too many bullet walls and their bullets travel too fast. It is random too. For instance you can be fighting the bird boss in a random room meaning that you might have walls to hide behind or you might have to fight him in the open which is a nightmare because his chaingun fires bullets faster than you can dodge so you have to get lucky some. Bosses also have way too much health so they are just endurance matches based on how long you can stand dodging nearly undodge-able bullets and it isn't fun. There are also BS enemies like the iron maiden who shoot bullets in random directions, they stick into the wall, then re-fire at you in even more random directions, making fighting them in cramped quarters cheap and unfair. The game is also too random to be fair. Some guns are worthless so you just have to hope you don't get them from chests or you are going to have a weak run and end up restarting when you inevitably die because you have such garbage guns. Some runs you might find a good gun, some not. If you don't have a good gun by floor 3 just restart your game. If you have taken a bunch of dmg and have a ton of coins and no hearts are dropping, which are random too, and the shopkeeper doesn't have any for sale, and you are ready for the floor 3 boss, just restart your game. Oh and sometimes you can open a blue chest with a key and there is no reward, it turns into a enemy and fires a ton of bullets at you. Like the game isn't hard enough already without cheap sht like that. Ammo drops also get stolen if you leave the room they are in. So if you aren't low on ammo or don't even have a gun yet that uses ammo then it's just a wasted drop when you could've had something actually useful spawn in like oh I don't know, a ♥♥♥♥ing heart?\n\nEverything in the game is random and it's one of those types of games where even if you only take a couple of hits in each floor you are screwed because you need full life always because it can all be drained in just a couple of ridiculous rooms.\n\n5/10 WAY TOO RNG HUR DUR!\nDevelopers are completely inept as to what makes a great game. Was fun for ten hours but I gladly accept that I will never beat this and I don't care because it is too cheap. One of the most random and cheap games I have ever seen. It's a shame too since it has great production value. Such great graphics, sounds, and gameplay wasted on such a cheap, unfair, random RNG game where you can have a good run or a bad run based on what gun drops you get which most are garbage.","April 20","false","18.9"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","18","33","6","52"

Im sure this wont bother a lot of the hardcore guys out there but in this game, at least to me, there are no victorys, you finally make a little bit farther then you did the last time just to get stomped back down and have to slog back through everything youve already seen.\n\nwhat would fix the game for me.\n-A. increase key drops\n-B. start with a random gun ( since they are the best part of the game and some runs you dont even find one)\n-C. some type of permenit upgrade system or a bank. anything so it feels like your not wasteing time on the runs that you dont make it a little bit deeper.\n-D. reduce the cost of short cuts. (3 keys and 120 shells is way to high for the first one)\n\nagin, i still recomend this game, its a ton of fun but its not a game you can play or hours on end. games like rouge legacy have a high bar of difficulty but the constant unlocks and permenant upgrades keep you hooked. this game is something you play for an hour and every session ends with you saying ♥♥♥♥ it.","May 5","true","28.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

FTL, Darkest Dungeon, and now Gungeon, I recommend ALL of them, but NOTHING can make me insta-salt like dying in one of these games.  That said, even the rage-iest of quits from games like this don't last very long, and I never want to completely give up and stop playing.\n\nGungeon gives you four players to start with, with unique starting weapons, a basic gun with infinite ammo, a half-god-mode dodge roll, and multiple levels of bullet Hell, er, pur...ga...tory...?  Everything is gun and bullet-themed, and the sheer VOLUME of shout-outs in this game is pants-on-head insanity (I swear to God, if the Marine isn't a direct reference to Doomguy, then life is a lie and the government is lame).  As I understand it, there are about six levels to the gungeon itself, but the difficulty, dynamicism, and random generation of it all will keep you entertained for a VERY long time.

Im sure this wont bother a lot of the hardcore guys out there but in this game, at least to me, there are no victorys, you finally make a little bit farther then you did the last time just to get stomped back down and have to slog back through everything youve already seen.\n\nwhat would fix the game for me.\n-A. increase key drops\n-B. start with a random gun ( since they are the best part of the game and some runs you dont even find one)\n-C. some type of permenit upgrade system or a bank. anything so it feels like your not wasteing time on the runs that you dont make it a little bit deeper.\n-D. reduce the cost of short cuts. (3 keys and 120 shells is way to high for the first one)\n\nagin, i still recomend this game, its a ton of fun but its not a game you can play or hours on end. games like rouge legacy have a high bar of difficulty but the constant unlocks and permenant upgrades keep you hooked. this game is something you play for an hour and every session ends with you saying ♥♥♥♥ it.","May 5","true","28.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

FTL, Darkest Dungeon, and now Gungeon, I recommend ALL of them, but NOTHING can make me insta-salt like dying in one of these games.  That said, even the rage-iest of quits from games like this don't last very long, and I never want to completely give up and stop playing.\n\nGungeon gives you four players to start with, with unique starting weapons, a basic gun with infinite ammo, a half-god-mode dodge roll, and multiple levels of bullet Hell, er, pur...ga...tory...?  Everything is gun and bullet-themed, and the sheer VOLUME of shout-outs in this game is pants-on-head insanity (I swear to God, if the Marine isn't a direct reference to Doomguy, then life is a lie and the government is lame).

The combat feels very fresh and exciting each and every playthrough, and the combat has the perfect difficulty level imho.  Also the music and artstyle are both so very spot on.

Put that thought out of your head. Isaac and Gungeon are two entirely different beasts. Isaac's game is structured and fractal, asking you to play the game many, many times in different forms and with different characters to reach 'the true ending'. Gungeon's game is more straightforward - you have a dude, and that dude wants to get the gun to kill his past, and there's a giant pit between you and that gun that is filled with adorable bullets that use guns to shoot bullets at you. There's also shotgun shells that use shotguns to shoot shotgun pellets for you. There's also a knight with a sword, but he uses the sword to shoot bullets at you. There's also a skeleton made out of bullet casings, but he shoots you with lasers. Basically, this game is incredibly adorable, but you must not drop your gun and hug the smiling bullets or you will get shot by the bullets shooting bullets at you. It's complicated, but less so, because it's all about getting to the end game (there is a sub-quest where you have to construct a bullet for the gun that kills your past, but that's about it).\n\nIn both games, you can coast if you manage to put together a good loadout! In Gungeon, getting a good loadout requires a bit of luck and knowing which guns are best for which situations. Some guns are best for crowds of enemies, some guns are best for bosses, some guns are just jokes in gun form, and some guns will go through all of your ammo before you know it. You'll eventually know which ones are best through usage and experience. There's also the issue of Mastery - in Gungeon, you start out with three hearts, like a Zelda. But unlike Zelda, if you are fortunate enough to defeat a boss without taking a hit, you earn an extra heart container. You take one bullet, and you can kiss that heart container goodbye. You will lose a lot (like you would in a proper Roguelike) before you manage to win one time, but oh man, if you make it, you can shoot a dragon in the face! Medieval people never got the opportunity to do that. You are blessed. You were born in the right generation.\n\nThe soundtrack and the graphics are aces. Doseone's soundtrack is at the same time incredibly energetic and subliminally hypnotic, fitting the weird gun dungeon to a T. The graphics are pixel graphics, but they're the really neat, detailed kind. That won't stop sad nerds and millenials from crying about how pixel graphics are the bane of their existence inbetween emailing developers and publishers about how they should "get a graphics department".\n\nIf I had to suggest something for the game to knock off and stop doing: The referential humor gets a bit much at times. I appreciate a good reference to other video games and I definitely know that if you don't have the AK-47 in a game that's all about how many guns it has, you're not doing your job right. But some of the video game guns are just plain references and that's kind of lazy. Plus, a universe where there's bullets that use guns to shoot bullets is kind of the bonkers universe that needs to be expanded upon!\n\nGungeon's great. There's a gun that is called a Microtransaction gun and it just shoots items from collector's editions of video games into the faces of your enemies. So if you've ever wanted to kill someone by throwing your overpriced figurine from that video game you like so much, now's your chance, weirdo.","May 19","true","60.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In the beginning you will die. A Lot. You will die to bosses many times and think it's impossible to win. And then you will learn the ways of the dodge roll. You need to dodge roll. Eventually you will start flawlessing the first boss and then die immediately to the second. Rinse repeat getting good, then die to a normal bullet kin. It's a very fun game but it has a steep-ish learning curve. It isn't very fair to compare it to The Binding of Isaac in any way because it is much faster and doesn't focus as much on synergies, only skill. However it isn't always fair. Many of the guns in this gun game are worse than your starting gun and some which are fun run out of ammo to fast. The drops are still being balanced and they have fixed a key dropping issue where you would get almost no keys, but many times you will get a useless trinket or useless gun. Don't be fooled it can be very difficult at first. Sometimes it can be very grindy so maybe play it in bursts. I have only been playing for around 80 hours and it is easy to get caught up it, but just know you probably aren't going to get good items most of the time. This game requires more skill compared to other games like Isaac that require good items and some skill. The bosses are the real bullet hell though. It is worth noting that you may have bad luck and will spend up to 2 minutes on the first boss since you need good guns and that bosses are bullet sponges. The first floor will always have a chest with a weapon and a chest with a passive item.   May RNJesus be on your side. Just watch out for dirty rats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL:DR  It's still being balanced but is a fun and grindy bullet-hell game where you need RNG and skill\n\nTl:DR;DR  Don't be a scrub and git gud","May 27","true","92.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would most likely describe it, in a nutshell, as a fusion between The Binding of Isaac, and Nuclear Throne, two pretty neat games. It's a bullet hell, rogue-like, shooter, with a very heavy emphasis on the whole "shooting" deal. Pick from one of  six  four characters, including the Pilot (essentially Han Solo), Marine (Doomguy), Hunter (no reference here) and Convict (no reference, too busy murdering). Delve into the Gungeon in search of the most powerful artifact in the universe -  The Gun that can Kill the Past . "Kill your past, you've already damned your future." And then, do it again. And again. And again. The Gungeon is an eternal lodging. Kill your past, or you'll have nothing but pain in the future.\n\nWhat a Pun Time The reason the rest of the review is about jokes is because this game, has so. Many. PUNS. They're everywhere. The game title is a pun. The characters are called "Gungeoneers". Bosses are puns. Enemies are puns. For instance, one of the first bosses is a giant bird with a minigun. Name? "Gatling Gull". One enemy is a ghost, with a Thompson submachine gun. Hollowpoint. Wizards who manipulate bullets? Gunjurers. Buffer and summoner mages? Gunsingers and Ammomancers. The tutorial ghost? Ser Manuel.\n\nGuns are puns too. There's a barrel gun that fires live fish. Gun that turns enemies into chickens: Hexagun. Half-gun, half-key, that unlocks anything you shoot. AKEY-47. Assault rifle made of bones. VertebrAK-47. A pillow gun called the Silencer that you can also smack things with to stun. References everywhere. Cog of Battle, a passive that gives you the active reload from Gears of War. Super Meat Gun, fires spikes. Prototype Railgun, looks like something from Halo. They added a gun that fires  poisonous PAX t-shirts.\n\nNot just puns. The main enemies in the game, Bullet Kin, are literal bullet people who love guns. The ones with shotguns are shotgun shells. The ones with sniper rifles are shaped like a high calibre bullet. Empty casings that are like ghouls. Already fired bullets that are zombies. Previously-mentioned Hollowpoints, which are ghost bullets. One of the biggest bosses in the game is a dragon crossed with a gun, the High Dragun. Knights with swords. They're not gun related, right?  WRONG.  Their swords are forged from pure bullets, and so fire massive waves of them with each swing.\n\nThe jokes are great. Mechanics are interesting (look at some other reviews). It's very charming but also a bit dark at times. Pixel art is wonderful. The developers are supporting it very well, with 7 updates this month and more to come, fixing bugs and soon adding content. Buy it.","April 29","true","83.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Coming to this game from Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne I still had some trouble early into it but as I learned more about the game I started to progress and it felt amazing getting farther and farther into the gungeon.\n\nCurrently at 44 hours and I have definitely gotten my $15 dollars worth and I know I'm going to keep enjoying it.\n\n88 hour and 100% update: This game is really great, I definitely recommend EtG if you're a fan of rogue-likes and/or bullet hells. Please do not get discouraged by how difficult it may seem at the start.\n\nI have some slight gripes with the game.\nWeapons have a weird fire rate, where most of them will shoot faster if you manually spam fire rather than hold it down. Which ends up with having to mash constantly with most guns instead of just being able to autofire.\nThere are no stats shown at all. You merely have to guess when it comes to what gun is actually going to be good or not unless you look it up on a wiki.\nWorld generation can be very dumb some times and can make entire rooms that are just obstacles without any reward, and even ontop of that make a giant hallway near the start that makes it so even if you wanted to check the other side you can walk all the way around it.\nThere doesn't seem to be a theme with secret rooms it's just spray on walls until you see a crack, accidentally get one from armor breaking/using a blank or get an item that tells you where they are and they're very under rewarding for the effort spent to find them.\nAnd personally being unable to play as the cultist unless I get someone to play local with me when I just want to run around as purple robe guy popping people with my dart gun.\n\nStill happily awaiting trading cards so I can fan over this game even more though.","April 21","true","97.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Arguably, I am pretty terrible at games like that. But I do enjoy most of the runs.\nThere's not much to say about mechanics aside from that - all of them are well done, it's fun to shoot, guns handle really well, enemies have distinct patterns you need to learn and all that kind of stuff.\n\nI will say a couple of things about issues this game has though.\nFirst and the biggest issue is RNG (random number generator). Developers use it "as is", so what you get is pure RNG runs.\nAnd here's a huge problem - sometimes runs are amazing. You get awesome guns that synergise with each other, enemies drop tons of money and keys, merchants are in every room and sell cool stuff.\nWhile other times you clean out a room of 20 mobs just to get 2 coins and nothing more. This makes the rewards feel so damn unfair at a time.\nI feel like making the game a little bit less random would make it waaay more fun.\n\nThe next two issues are somewhat minor and are related to local co-op.\nFirst one here is the fact that other player cannot pick anyone but Cultist. Why? I have no idea. I'd go as hunter without respawn item any time of day.\nSecond one is the fact that screen doesn't split when players get too far. And you can't go outside of the viewport.\nWhich means if you and your buddy are running to different sides and suddenly hit the viewport end - you won't be able to dodge towards that direction. That can results in some infuriatingly stupid deaths. Keeping an eye on your partner is a must here.\nAlso, for some reason when one of the players use mouse - cursor moves together with the screen. Which makes aiming horribly suck. Using two gamepads works just fine.\n\nIf those issues (not game breaking by any stretch) do not scare you away - go for it.\nThis game's pretty great and I loved my time with it.\n\nYou can watch more detailed look at the gameplay and aforementioned issues in the video below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxjSCV-FBHU","April 13","true","12.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

It is, simply put, boring. Let me elaborate:\n\nThe core gameplay is to travel around a dungeon, clearing rooms. Each floor will have 15+ procedurally generated rooms full of enemies. So, in order for the game to be enjoyable, naturally, this clearing rooms should be fun, or at least rewarding. But it isn't.\n\nThere are a limited amount of enemy types, and their AI is simplistic to say the least - as a result, clearing these rooms quickly becomes a chore. The ridiculous scarcity of guns in the game means you'll probably do most of this room-clearing using your worst guns (to save ammo with your good guns, which you'll need for the boss fights). It's tedious as hell, but you still have to take meticulous care so you don't lose any of your very limited health - there's precious few ways to get it back.\n\nWhat's more, the game itself is built around the concept of unlocking most of the cool weapons and powerups through a currency you get by beating bosses. In other words, it's designed to be less fun the first dozen (or hundred) times you play it! It's artificial nonsense that forces you to play the same battles over and over again.\n\nEven the premise is a let down. You're supposed to be slinging all sorts of crazy weapons! But I've played a few dozen runs and found maybe 4 guns that I actually enjoyed using. Many of them are run-of-the-mill pistols and machine guns with little gimmicks attached, and precious few of them feel at all powerful.\n\nDon't get me wrong. The core gameplay is solid and exciting - the boss fights are a testament to that! If this game were just a series of exciting fights like those then it would be amazing! But that would require getting rid of the touted "rogue-like" and "dungeon-crawl" elements so I doubt it will happen.\n\nAs it is now, this game is 20% fun, 80% a chore. If you like methodical gameplay and slow progression then maybe it's for you, but it you wanted an exciting action game you should just play Nuclear Throne.\n\nEdit: The game picks up around the 3rd or 4th floor. This takes about 20 minutes to reach floor three if you start at floor one - I am strongly opposed to games that waste your time like this. However you can eventually unlock an elevator to the 3rd floor that provides you with a choice of weapon, which makes the game much more enjoyable, and individual runs less of a time sink.\n\nThe problem is that it takes a very high level of skill and/or ridiculous rng luck to get what you need to unlock the elevator. For someone who is really dedicated and/or obsessive (yours truly) this is doable over the course of many tedious hours. Again, everything about this game just feels like work, I don't know what the developers were thinking. A game does not have to be artificially frustrating for it to be hard!","April 7","false","21.8"," 125 of 244 people (51%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","51","125","244","5","13"

It is decieving at first but this is a hard game, a lot of positioning required and when out of position you have 2 options, roll and blanks. Blanks will clear the screen of enemy fire and delay theiir next shot, but are limited so emergy only. Rolling however is your main evade, and since health is so scarce in this you need it. The roll doesn;t add loads of manuverability, instead it gives you invincibility frames, so if you time your dodge right you can jup through enemy fire while the i frames are active, like Dark Souls.\n\nProgresses like Isaac where you have multiple rooms per floor, a boss of the floor, a shop and some secrets, defeat the boss and then you can go to the next floor.\nBut there is also a permanent progression as well, actions in side the runs can unlock new items for subsequent runs, and defeating bosses earns you a type of currence spent in the game hub which can be used to purchase new weapons and items to be added to the pool of items in game.\n\nThe games items vary from weapons, to actives and also passives, this allows for some interesting synergies to emerge and makes the run feel unique in its own way.\n\nMultiple characters to choose from at the start, each with their own unique starting items, so you can find your favourite or vary things up.\n\nThe thing that surprised me the most about this game are the sound effects, extremly detailed and high quality, whioch makes the guns a lot more satisfying to use.\n\nThe games soundtrack is also really good, techno music that fits nicely into the backgorund of the game,\n\n","April 5","true","25.4"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

Because if I did, I'd be crippling my own actual opinion of this game, which again is a very rare thing to hit with.\n\nLook to sum it up this game does music, gameplay, and ideas well. But the problem lies within how nearly all the items, 96% are worthless because everyone wants a gun or a health upgrade. Or an invulnerability status, there is an underlying deal in the story where anyone who enters the gungeon, feels worse and more hopeless each failed attempt to reach the end. And boy, I sure felt similar. I would have great runs ruined by bosses who took ridiculous chains of hits, and say if your RNG is a bag of jerks, and dropped no ammo and you had minimal going in there and are forced to your handgun, the second that happens, you may as well give up. This game does need skill, but nowhere near as much as you need luck. It's gotten to the point where I can't go any run without getting the trigger twins with my standard handgun on the first chamber, and one boss has a ton of HP unless you got a great gun to widdle them down fast, two of them that summon goons does not help.\n\nI like the game, but out of my maybe 50 hours of the game or over that by now, I've won twice. And neither have murdered the past. It took me another thousand runs to get the bullet assembled, becuase once again you need the RNG to give you either an item of flight, or the grappling hook, and PRAY to get a weapon to carry you to not only the 4th chamber but through it and part of the 5th chamber.\n\nCall me salty whatever, I try my hardest constantly. But the biggest threat in this game to me, is the 4th chamber bosses, or the 3rd chamber common room with auto turrets in it. Because those auto turrets make it impossible to not get hit, and guess what, there is a hidden stat where the longer you go without getting hit, the more likely you are to get drops.\n\nEither way to shorten it, this game has no mercy, it is good, and when you do something grand of a scale and get through, it does feel like you accomplished that, but 1 feeling of accomplishment between every 50 stomps is not really that much of a reassurance to keep going. Especially if you lose a run where you did godly until the end because of the game deciding to not give you any slack.  It is a bit pessimistic and the word is thrown around too carelessly, but the best way I can say you go into this game, expecting to lose. And expecting it a lot. Because if you just lose and go right around saying "I'll get it the next time!" Then you're just kind of setting yourself up to get more angry, honestly if you lose 3 times in a row that is a good place to stop for a short break.\n\nThe games great, and fun and challenging, but you can't put an RNG in a game that is known for being high in skill requirement! Unless y'know you're northernlion, that guy pretty much has a lucky clover scarred into his soul. I'd say wait for a sale before buying the game, it isn't worth the price, or at least the price isn't right for the anger given.","May 23","false","68.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","11","20","2","0"

It's a must have for fans of the genre!\n\nCheck out my Quick Review here: https://youtu.be/h5z2xhkkW-g\nEnter the Gungeon has a solo mode and a 2 player local co-op mode. There are 4 different main characters you can play in solo mode. Each character has its own set of weapons, abilities, and passives. The base health for all characters is 3, every time you take damage, you lose half a health. You can roll dodge to jump over bullets, and other things, and avoid damage completely. You can also flip tables that will block bullets until they get destroyed.\n\nAfter the tutorial, you head into the first chamber of the Gungeon, all chambers are randomly generated, but each chamber will have a store with randomly stocked supplies, and a random boss. Each time you enter a new room, the doors close behind you, and they won’t reopen until you kill all the enemies. You have to dodge, and avoid all the incoming bullets, while making use of cover, until you finish clearing the room to move on.\n\nThere will sometimes be treasure chests containing guns, or other items, but you will need keys to open them. You also have a shoot blanks ability that you start off each chamber with 2 charges of, but you can often find and buy more. Activating the blank with destroy all bullets on screen and prevent the enemies from shooting for a short period of time - these blanks are a huge life saver!\n\nOnce you find and defeat the boss in the chamber, you can descend to the next chamber. If you die, you lose, and you have to completely restart the Gungeon chambers. However, there is an elevator that you can unlock to teleport to other chambers by providing the required items AND mastering the previous chamber’s boss. It is really hard to master the previous chamber’s boss. You have to beat the boss without taking a single hit of damage, that means no hits to your health OR to your armor. When you use the elevator to skip to a certain chamber, you start with the same default starting items as if you were starting in the first chamber.\n\nEach character has 1 default weapon that has infinite ammo, but all of the other weapons have limited ammo, and will need to have ammo replenished. There are also items that each have their own passive or activated abilities. Passive abilities can stack, but you can only have one activated ability at a time, and the abilities seem like they recharged as you deal damage to enemies. You can find these items randomly in chests, or sometimes in the store. In the store, there is sometimes a vendor to sell items, that spawn is also random. You can buy things from the store with the currency you obtain from killing enemies, and clearing rooms.\n\nPros:controls are fully customizable and full controller support (except some issues with Steam controller)\nreally nice quality pixel graphics\naudio sounded good and was fitting for the gameplay, I never felt the need to lower the music or sound effects volume\nyou can teleport from anywhere to teleporters within the chambers - these are very helpful, and save a lot of time by not having to backtrack\nlots of secret rooms to find, and NPCs to rescue, as well as tons of different weapons you can discover, with different abilities suited to different play styles\nTONS of replay value (It’s extremely addicting to play, and there is so much you can find and collect if you want.)\nCons:issues with using the Steam controller - it doesn’t work by default and you have to set up configs for it to work properly\nplayer 2 in local co-op mode is forced to play the special co-op only character\nthe Gungeon has 5 chambers, but most players probably won't get to experience the later chambers without committing a significant amount of time to playing the game (I’ve played for over 19 hours, and STILL haven’t beat the third chamber yet.)\nthe vendor to sell items in the store isn't always there\nI enjoy dungeon crawlers, but normally, I don’t play many bullet hell games, but Enter the Gungeon has been so awesome. I was immediately impressed with the game, and found myself completely hooked. I couldn’t believe how addicting it was. Even though I usually died in the 2nd chamber, I never found myself getting frustrated with the game. I never felt like my deaths were unfair, but it was usually me being stupid and walking into bullets, or forgetting to use my blanks that killed me. I would just quick start again, only to realize hours had passed, and I forgot to eat. It’s a really enjoyable game, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good dungeon crawler/bullet hell game.","April 8","true","19.3"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/v487457/recommended/311690/","v487457","The Merovingian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/v487457/","138 products in account","Enter the Gungeon is one of those dungeon-crawly top-down twin-stick shooters that will remind people heavily of Nuclear Throne, but, unlike Nuclear Throne this is actually a little more tame in its presentation and handling. Along with its lighthearted animation and fun and entertaining dialogue, Enter the Gungeon offers a large variety of unlocks and unique guns, many of which are strong, and a far larger number feel ultimately trolly.\n\nWhat would a Gungeon be without... The levels? There are I think 5 total Gungeons to fight through, each one ending in a boss, and in each of these levels there are stores, chests, hidden rooms, shrines and other such things you can gamble your hard earned bullets or health on. After each boss is defeated you get some sort of item, hegemony credits (For buying new items to find in the gungeon), health/armor on occasion and, if completed without getting hit, extra health.\n\nWhat would a Gungeon be without... The guns? Some examples range from a fast firing mac 10 to a gun that shoots eggs which explode into chics that do damage over time. A simple sawed off shotgun to a proton pack. Each gun has a strength and even a purpose which I won't spoil since half the fun of these games is figuring stuff out on your own.\n\nWhat would a Gungeon be without... The enemies? Someone once said a hero is only as good as his nemesis, and in the Gungeon your enemies are without mercy, and in most cases common sense. I'm not saying the AI is bad. In fact, it was almost too good, as recent patches have dumbed down some of the enemy behaviors because it was too difficult. As it stands now the enemies are scaled to offer varying degrees of difficulty. There are still some enemies that are just a pain in the ♥♥♥ (Iron Maiden thing I'm looking at you, you'll find out what those are soon enough). The more basic enemies don't seem like they do enough to threaten you early on sometimes but they scale with the level you're on and the rooms generally spawn with randomized combinations which make each fight unique, however, only having played 8 hours so far I've seen the same rooms and combos too many times. I hope down the road they find a way to increase the diversity otherwise the game becomes dry.\n\nWhat would a Gungeon be without... The bosses? From the Trigger Twins to the abysmally difficult Beholster, doesn't really matter who it is but each boss is a true bullet-hell the likes of which you've never seen. I exaggerate but not by much. Every boss has a pattern in their movement and shot types but most usually wind up being a burst, a spray, and a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t move. Only one boss so far seems to be easily beaten and that's Gatling Gull because you can sort of trick it, which I'm sure will be patched soon, and this makes for some really clutch uses of your Blanks (Blanks knock back enemies and wipe out all bullets on screen). I'm not saying they are unbeatable, but some of them really test your patience and your ability to get yourself into good positioning for extended periods of time depending on what gun you have going into the fight. My only beef is that the gungeon sometimes doesn't really prepare you for what you will be fighting as you never encounter the kind of bullet hell you do during boss fights. Bosses are definitely bosses.\n\nOverall for a game of this caliber it offers a solid challenge with a mediocre replayability as of now but since the release the devs have been shaping the game around the user reviews.\n\nI definitely have a lot of respect for the folks at Dodge Roll for making this fantastic little game and hope they keep making it better and better.","April 16","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it is. Sometimes I don't make it past the first floor. But I've really enjoyed it anyway. Though there are times that the screen is covered in bullets, almost every time I take damage, I see how I could have avoided it.\n\nBasically there are games that you enjoy for the power fantasy, becoming a super powerful mage/warrior who can take apart armies or whatever. And then there are games that are frustratingly challenging, where you enjoy watching yourself become better at the game rather than your character get stronger. If you, like me, are a fan of the latter, then you'll probably enjoy Gungeon.","April 19","true","27.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A very close second to The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. It's got the feel of Nuclear Throne but has the deep item pool and synergy depth as Binding of Isaac. It can be frustratingly hard but at the same time it's also extremely replayable. Just like every other rogue-lite, no 2 runs are ever the same and you'll constantly find yourself saying "ok, one last game" and before you know it, hours and hours and several "last games" have passed.\n\nThe graphics are a throwback to the 16-bit era but it totally works for this game (and this genre especially). The soundtrack is wonderful and is worth buying on it's own to listen to when you can't play. The controls are tight and every last key is re-bindable if you feel uncomfortable with the default settings, although after only 10 minutes, I had all of the basics memorized and feeling right.\n\nIf you're into this genre, $15 is a steal, especially considering the amount of gameplay you'll get out of it. I've currently got 20 hours in and I've barely scraped the surface yet. I can absolutely see me spending more time with this game than many of the triple A titles I've played (and spent $60+ dollars on).","May 2","true","29.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Top down run and gun gameplay, with bullet hell mechanics. I also love bullet hell shmups in general.\n\nThe roguelike genre goes counter to the mainstream game design by providing a really difficult game experience, which resets your level progress. The upside is that when you DO achieve something in a game like this it feels really well earned, a great feeling compared to unlocking some trivial item in a trivially easy way, which happens in most other game types.\n\nModern rogue-likes take this idea futher by providing a long term progression tree where you can see progress after many playthroughs of the difficult, but fun game.\n\nThis game does have a fun gameplay mechanic, inventive in that it combines top down shooting with a bullet hell aesthetic.\n\nBUT.\n\nThe long-term progression system is really strange - you add more items to a random pool of future drops. There are a ton of guns, yes. But they are all very similar to each other in how they function. Very little difference, for example, between the watergun and the alphabet gun.\n\nThat's not saying it's not neat to get a new drop - the feeling is nice. But you instantly realize it's just more of the same.\n\nYou also get hegemony currency when you kill bosses (one on each floor). But you cannot spend it until you rescue a shopkeeper in the dungeon. Get ready to wait  a while before you actually rescue the shopkeeper. All the while the currency is just sitting there in your screen. Once you get the shop keeper rescued, wow there's that great feeling, you made progress! You go and you... unlock future random drops? Ouch. This means the pool of items you randomly get from chests increases, which DECREASES your chance to get an item you may particularly want. Huge downer!\n\nFeel free to disagree, but for a much better roguelike experience, I recommend Dungeon of Dredmore or Rogue Legacy.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI am changing my recommendation to YES, out of respect for the amount of work the devs put in. I still stand by what I wrote, above.","April 9","true","46.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Early launch issues (that I was experiencing) were quickly corrected by devs.  Updates now have high visibility (derp).  Soundtrack is cheesy like the rest of the game.  One of my favorites.\n\n\nLaunch (Not Recommended):\n\nGame content is immensely enjoyable, but unfortunately riddled with bugs.  Can't comment on the difficulty, because the game crashes on elevator before floor 4 or 5.  Would consider revising recommendation when audio consistently works and game stops crashing.  Numerous other bugs are being reported by other players and I haven't seen any update history or work log, so I don't know what issues are actually being addressed.  Developers are scrambling on the forums, which is a good sign.\n\nEdit:  Dev pointed me to a patch notes thread in the forum discussions. :)\n\nWin 7 32-bit\nIntel Core i3-2125 3.3GHz\n8GB Ram (Limited)\nAMD Radeon HD 7700 1GB","April 9","true","77.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just want to talk about some specific bits and pieces though.\n\n- First off, the game play. It's fluent, it's responsive, it's perfect. I never had a problem with it at all.\n\n- Second, the many many guns. Love the variety and I still have plenty to unlock. And even though some are far more useful than others, it's still down to your own skills.\n\n- Third, the bosses. To me, they are the best part of the game. However, some of their names just seem lame.\n\nOne of my favourite boss fights is with the Kill Pillars, but the name is annoying and I just call them Killer Pillars instead since it rolls off the tongue easier. Even then, it seems really basic.\n\nI have a pun you can use Dodge Roll. You could call them the 'Stone Cold Pillars'. You can have that for free :-)\n\n- Fourth, I wish I could save. I've been spoiled by Rebirth, I know, but it's just such a great feature. I don't have to make sure I have enough time for this or that because I can just jump in and out without hassle.\n\nI'm not demanding it of course (I have no idea how difficult it is to implement saves), but it would make this the perfect game to fill in any time if it did have it.\n\nAnyway, great game.

Top down run and gun gameplay, with bullet hell mechanics. I also love bullet hell shmups in general.\n\nThe roguelike genre goes counter to the mainstream game design by providing a really difficult game experience, which resets your level progress. The upside is that when you DO achieve something in a game like this it feels really well earned, a great feeling compared to unlocking some trivial item in a trivially easy way, which happens in most other game types.\n\nModern rogue-likes take this idea futher by providing a long term progression tree where you can see progress after many playthroughs of the difficult, but fun game.\n\nThis game does have a fun gameplay mechanic, inventive in that it combines top down shooting with a bullet hell aesthetic.\n\nBUT.\n\nThe long-term progression system is really strange - you add more items to a random pool of future drops. There are a ton of guns, yes. But they are all very similar to each other in how they function. Very little difference, for example, between the watergun and the alphabet gun.\n\nThat's not saying it's not neat to get a new drop - the feeling is nice. But you instantly realize it's just more of the same.\n\nYou also get hegemony currency when you kill bosses (one on each floor). But you cannot spend it until you rescue a shopkeeper in the dungeon. Get ready to wait  a while before you actually rescue the shopkeeper. All the while the currency is just sitting there in your screen. Once you get the shop keeper rescued, wow there's that great feeling, you made progress! You go and you... unlock future random drops? Ouch. This means the pool of items you randomly get from chests increases, which DECREASES your chance to get an item you may particularly want. Huge downer!\n\nFeel free to disagree, but for a much better roguelike experience, I recommend Dungeon of Dredmore or Rogue Legacy.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI am changing my recommendation to YES, out of respect for the amount of work the devs put in. I still stand by what I wrote, above.","April 9","true","46.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Along with its lighthearted animation and fun and entertaining dialogue, Enter the Gungeon offers a large variety of unlocks and unique guns, many of which are strong, and a far larger number feel ultimately trolly.\n\nWhat would a Gungeon be without... The levels? There are I think 5 total Gungeons to fight through, each one ending in a boss, and in each of these levels there are stores, chests, hidden rooms, shrines and other such things you can gamble your hard earned bullets or health on. After each boss is defeated you get some sort of item, hegemony credits (For buying new items to find in the gungeon), health/armor on occasion and, if completed without getting hit, extra health.\n\nWhat would a Gungeon be without... The guns? Some examples range from a fast firing mac 10 to a gun that shoots eggs which explode into chics that do damage over time. A simple sawed off shotgun to a proton pack. Each gun has a strength and even a purpose which I won't spoil since half the fun of these games is figuring stuff out on your own.\n\nWhat would a Gungeon be without... The enemies? Someone once said a hero is only as good as his nemesis, and in the Gungeon your enemies are without mercy, and in most cases common sense. I'm not saying the AI is bad. In fact, it was almost too good, as recent patches have dumbed down some of the enemy behaviors because it was too difficult. As it stands now the enemies are scaled to offer varying degrees of difficulty. There are still some enemies that are just a pain in the ♥♥♥ (Iron Maiden thing I'm looking at you, you'll find out what those are soon enough). The more basic enemies don't seem like they do enough to threaten you early on sometimes but they scale with the level you're on and the rooms generally spawn with randomized combinations which make each fight unique, however, only having played 8 hours so far I've seen the same rooms and combos too many times. I hope down the road they find a way to increase the diversity otherwise the game becomes dry.\n\nWhat would a Gungeon be without... The bosses? From the Trigger Twins to the abysmally difficult Beholster, doesn't really matter who it is but each boss is a true bullet-hell the likes of which you've never seen. I exaggerate but not by much. Every boss has a pattern in their movement and shot types but most usually wind up being a burst, a spray, and a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t move. Only one boss so far seems to be easily beaten and that's Gatling Gull because you can sort of trick it, which I'm sure will be patched soon, and this makes for some really clutch uses of your Blanks (Blanks knock back enemies and wipe out all bullets on screen). I'm not saying they are unbeatable, but some of them really test your patience and your ability to get yourself into good positioning for extended periods of time depending on what gun you have going into the fight. My only beef is that the gungeon sometimes doesn't really prepare you for what you will be fighting as you never encounter the kind of bullet hell you do during boss fights. Bosses are definitely bosses.\n\nOverall for a game of this caliber it offers a solid challenge with a mediocre replayability as of now but since the release the devs have been shaping the game around the user reviews.\n\nI definitely have a lot of respect for the folks at Dodge Roll for making this fantastic little game and hope they keep making it better and better.","April 16","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To the point where you have to restart a specific run due to not enough necessary drops. Or you get screwed because of no good weapons or no ammo drops. Even the randomly generated rooms can put you at a disadvantage. I really don't like this aspect of the game.\n\nBesides that it's a great rouge-like bullet hell game. It feels and looks great, the music is catchy and the boss designs are hilarious. It really is fun to play and there even is local coop if you plug in a controller to your PC. The coop feature is thought out well and a whole lot of fun while still being as challenging as playing solo.\n\nJust keep in mind the random nature and permadeath when buying this game.","May 24","true","25.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes to all who would call themselves gamer.\n\nWhy?  This most certainly won't be everyones cup of tea Steam reviewer.  True.  This will allow a younger generation to experience a style of game that is genuwinely difficult.  This might not be your style of game but I highly recommend you give it a shot.  If it's not for you, Steam has a fantastic refund policy, just be warned you may re-purchase to prove to yourself you've 'got the what it takes'.\n\nI'd like to address several of the games various complaints that I've seen:\n1. Success is determined by the random items you aquire during your run.  I'd like to debunk this, while I have not experienced all of the content yet (I have not beaten the game in any of it's multiple sense) I believe that with enough knowledge and practice you can consistantly beat this game regardless of the items you acquire.\n2. RNG!  Yep, it is what it is.  Sometimes chests/items will spawn as a reward only to instantly be nuked.  Sometimes the spacing/placement/additional spawns of enemies will be ROUGH.  Sometimes you'll be low on money or items, or both.  Again, still beatable.\n3. Bosses!  Of course they're hard but like many bosses of old you have to grind them.  You have to learn their patterns then apply that knowledge.  You have to focus when you're in the moment of finally beating that boss that's had you down for XX runs.  Yes, they're utter bullet hell.  Yes, they have a boat-ton of HP.  Yes, you can do it.\n\nThe pros:\n\nThis game is fun as hell, bullet hell.  I'd liken it to Dark Souls.  If that game is 'too hard' for you, you may still like this.  Not to say this game is less hard that Dark Souls, I'd wager both will take you 20+ hours regardless of skill level if it's your first exposure to the series and I haven't achieved the simplest completion of simply staying alive.\n\nVery clever design, In addition to the take on the denizens you've got a load of massive references from popular culture.  You will be both older and vastly exposed to all geek culture if you get them all.\n\nWeapons.  You've got lots of different 'guns' that can be mostly lumped into fully auto, semi-auto, channeling, and the rare melee.  Of these 100+ weapons each one plays a little differently from the other.  Sometimes you've got a whacky weapon that you've had before but still don't understand because it's doing crazy stuff with each round.  Sometimes you've got guns that reflect bullets on reload...honestly the world is your osyter here.\n\nHow this game can make you better at gaming:\nIt'll combat the tunnel vision.  You'll soon attempt to focus down the enemies that you deem most threatening.  This, while wise, isn't always an option.\nLearning the best offense is a good defense.  Tie in to the previous statement.  You cannot crush your enemies, see them driven before you, nor hear the lamentation of their women if you're dead.\nSpacing.\nSituational awareness.\nReflexes.  Dear God reflexes.\n\nSuccess in this game is rewarding.  Failure, is failures get, sucks.  You will fail, over and over.  Will you stay on the ground or get back up?","May 18","true","53.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Way harder than Isaac, for example.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Amazing gameplay.\n+ Dynamic atmosphere to which the game is set.\n+ Great soundtrack. Not amazing but very good.\n+ Randomly generated chambers with varied enemies and bosses.\n+ Different playable characters.\n+ Great amount of guns and passive items.\n+ Ammonomicon, where gather everything you find.\n+ Tons of unlockable content and secret characters/chambers.\n+ Puns everywhere.\n\nNeutral:\n\n* Harder gameplay. Not recommended for casual gamers.\n* Bosses with a lot of health. They takes minutes to be defeated with decent weapons.\n* Secret rooms are not worth investing time looking for them generally.\n* Third Chamber has only two bosses compared to chamber one, two and four.\n* Shops may require key to enter.\n* Witches, Old man and Brother Albern npcs are ridiculously rare. It would be better if they were unlockables like the others npcs and appear sometimes replacing The Lost Adventurer/Patches and Mendy, instead of secret rooms.\n\nCons:\n\n- Enemies scales HP. This is the biggest problem in my view. Not only you would be facing the same enemy from the first chamber to the last, but it'll take longer to defeat him. It would be better to have more variaton and/or increasing the amount of weak enemies to the point that system be unnecessary.\n- Little room variation. They're repeating often. Also the third chamber has normal rooms that almost always appears, like the room with only minecart and no enemy or the room with two Dets, Bullet Kins and Gunzookie.\n\nAnd now, will you Enter the Gungeon?\n","May 28","true","91.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

It's a good game, and it runs well. But on the other side you'll never get lucky in a Gungeon. Other than the fact that its going to take you atleast a week before you can finish even the first Gungeon, I think that in all honesty this game is incredibly fun, but it's going to be very challenging to finish a Gungeon without another player. ( Its LAN only ;-; ) If you're running into this game expecting a Gungeon to take 5 minutes, you'd be wrong. I haven't finished the first Gungeon yet, but I can promise you it'll take alot of time to complete any of them. So I'm giving it a 7/10, It's sad to say, but as prementioned its only LAN. So if you want to play a Rogue game with a friend who isn't connected to your internet, look for another game.

What a gem in an age of gaming where there seems to be a flood of unoriginal, crude, too easy, or other wise uninteresting content. It's getting better, though, and Enter the Gungeon is one of the pioneers which prides itself on bringing back the golden age of gaming for all us hardcore gamers.\n\n\nThe game never feels unfair in anything it does, but it isn't afraid to kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of you and swiftly discard you outside of its dungeon steps. If Enter the Gungeon could talk to you one-on-one, I'm sure it would say something like this: "Oh, you want to explore further? Sorry, but only skilled players get to delve deeper."\n\n\nEnter the Gungeon is an bullet-hell rogue-lite dungeon crawler that takes elements from popular titles in the same genre, blending them together in an amalgamation of every hardcore rogue-lite gamer's wet dream. The biggest factor in this masterpiece is your skill level - not your luck or your ability to cheese rooms and fights. It's just you, your gaming skills, and your character of choice. Sure, better drops help make your life easier, but if you were to get good enough you could undoubtedly beat the game with the starting kit for any of the characters. That same goes for the flip-side - getting an amazing gun that literally auto-locks onto enemies isn't going to do ♥♥♥♥ if you can't avoid and predict enemy fire and behaviours. Like I said - sure, it certainly helps alleviate the difficulty, but it isn't going to carry you to victory.\n\n\nWith a huge amount of randomization and replayability, 'Enter the Gungeon' is by far and large one of the top contenders for my top 10 games of 2016 list. It's likely to be one of the games I play the most this year and onwards, and that in and of itself speaks volumes for it's success.\n\n\nTL:DR - With an awesome game balance focused around player skill and a huge amount of replayability, 'Enter the Gungeon' is a must have for any hardcore gamer or rogue-lite enthuiast alike.\n\n\n\n","April 17","true","63.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It takes the randomly generated, roguelike goodness that made Binding of Isaac famous, mixes it with a gun catalogue that Borderlands would be proud of, and then adds a strong dose of whimsey in the form of literally every single gun-based pun that the developer could think of, and believe me, they got pretty creative.\n\nIn the Gungeon, everything is gun themed. The main lobby is the Breach. Each floor is a different Chamber. Bullets serve as your elevators. Your enemies are bullets that hold guns that shoot bullets, in a visually engaging and informative manner. The 9mm enemies hold one shot pistols, the different colors of shotgun shells hold different kinds of shotguns, and the 7mm magnum rounds hold snipers. There's no shortage of enemy variation, not all enemies are bullets, but all of them have puns for names. There are a lot of gun puns.\n\nThe variation in firearms is massive as well; I think it took me 5 lives to find the same gun twice, and there's some hundred+ different weapons, -almost- all of which are functionally unique. I say almost, because there are multiple low-ranking pistols that all seem about the same, but they make up for that by getting truly creative with skirting the lines of what can be called a "gun." Apparantly, the letter r looks like a gun, so you can shoot letter-bullets from it. Then there's the EU gun, which happens to be made of solid gold. Then there are the Gunboots.\n\nSpeaking of James Bond and Downwell, there are numerous pop culture jokes hidden in some of the item descriptions, in all the best places, like the Cloranthy ring and Megaman's blaster hand. This game thrives on its frivilousness; its just fun to look at, and fun to watch.\n\nGameplay wise, this game plays it very safe. If you've played binding of Isaac, crypt of the Necrodancer, or pretty much any other roguelike dungeon crawler, you know what to expect. Keys for chests, the occasional secret puzzle, a shopkeeper whose wares are just expensive enough that you have to be picky with your money, ETC. There are various trapped NPC's who provide services when you free them; some have out of game shops using currency obtained from beating bosses, where you can unlock new guns and items for the Gungeon. Some provide in-game shops, selling special items, or (rarely) items at discount. One even creates a minigame, and for a reasonable price, lets you test your skill in a shooting range for big potential prizes.\nYou get a dodge roll that gives you invincibility frames, and two "Blanks" per floor that wipe the screen of enemy bullets, and prevent enemies from firing for a crucial half a second. The controls are tight, responsive, and easy to use, which is good because you need to be damn good at this game to make progress.\n\nI'm going to say that again, because its a very important fact. I've sunk 21 hours into this game, and I've yet to actually beat it. I've never even beaten the 4th floor, only got to the boss chamber 3 times, and each time was a different boss. Its incredibly difficult, but that difficulty needs to be divided into two parts to be properly explained; enemy strength VS player strength. I'm going to define enemy strength as "how long can you be in a room/encounter/boss fight without taking a single point of damage." Each floor has 2-3 different bosses, and there's a certain threshold of artificial difficulty until you learn a boss's patterns and attacks. After you've mastered a boss, its difficulty shrinks from godlike down to "manageable," but the biggest problem I've seen is in the RNG; that is, Player strength. This is a weakness intrinsic to the game; there are countless different passive and active items, as well as a large arsenal's worth of weapons, so the actual difficulty of the game depends completely on what items drop, and how often amunition drops. One run, I got a hat that MASSIVELY increased the chance to find keys on the second floor. Then I found a merchant who traded his POWERFUL items for keys. Through that run, I opened all the chests, bought out half the store every floor, and kicked righteous ♥♥♥... then, lost the boss fight on the 4th floor, because it was a boss I'd never seen, and I didn't know what his attacks were.\n\nThis roguelike is not like FTL, or binding of isaac, in that you can expect to complete a run every so often. I'd liken it more to Crypt of the Necrodancer; you're striving, working, and growing stronger with the sole intent of beating the game -once.- You can play more after that, but beating the final boss is a crowning achievement you need to WORK for.  That said, this monumental struggle is made better by the fact that the ten seconds of story provide a canonical reason for you to come back to life every time you die. Its a nice touch, since you die so very often.\n\nThere are a few bugs in this game, and some of the mechanics need a little tweaking, but so far the devs have been awesome about bug stomping and patching, so the minor problems will probably have been solved by the time you finish reading this. Speaking of which, I only wrote this review to stall for time while it patched, and that's finished, so, back into the gungeon I go! Buy this game, we need to see more development of this quality.\n\nOh, and if its something that you do, go watch Markiplier play this game, he makes a good showing of the first floor, though he misses the secret room and bonus side quest in the tutorial level.","April 19","true","40.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Learning patterns, when to dodge, when to blank and what weapons to use are apart of the learning curve.\n-If you suck at this game you'll get so salty you will complain to your friends who never told you about the game and demand Valve for a refund because you are edgy and impatient.\n-At times the game does seem unfair, but for every bad run theres a good run waiting for you, over time you will learn all the patterns and become genuinely good, or alternativly you will get a good weapon and rain hell on the bulletkin.\n\nTL:DR If youre looking for a fun challenge, if youre looking a game with good humor or references, if you're looking for a game thats different at the start and offers new weapons and items to rain hell-- then this is the game for you.","April 27","true","92.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Yet, I still haven't found even half of the guns and items available in this game, and there are still a tonne of things I haven't discovered and unlocked. Would definitely recommend.\n\n\n+++ Variety and content: this game is all about variety. Through sheer variety, the game simply refuses to get repeatetive or boring. Each run, you will be forced to try and survive with a completely different gun. There's a lot of different things to shoot at, too: 86 regular enemy varieties (still haven't seen 8 of them even once), and 22 bosses to fight.\n\n+++ Difficulty: the game is what games are supposed to be; a challenge. You learn as you play, and, eventually, you get better -- not because of grinding or a progression system. but because you understand the game better and learn to make better decisions.\n\n++ Mechanics and secrets: Gungeon is pleasantly different from other games of the same type in a very important (at least, to me) way: it doesn't make you want to check the game wiki to read about mechanics you feel like the game should have told you about itself. The in-game gun/item/monster encyclopedia gives you just enough info to have a general idea about what something does once you find it, but still leaves plenty of interesting things for the player to discover on their own. There are some secrets to discover, and players have plenty of opportunity to discover them themselves.\n\n+ Action: the game is pretty fast-paced. Once you get into a room, you cannot leave until you kill everyone in the room. This makes the game a largely uninterruptable series of small bullet hell challenges. Very fun.\n\n+ Theme: everything is somehow related to guns. There's like a million puns about guns and references to gun-related things. They really went all out on this.\n\n\nI'm going to keep playing until I do everything with every character and unlock everything to the very last item.","April 12","true","151.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Putting both Bullet and Hell in Bullet Hell. A good game to pick up if you are an avid fan of the Rogue-Like/Dungeon Crawler/Bullet Hell genre\n\nMany people will make the comparison of Binding of isaac and Nuclear Throne off the bat, it isn't hard to see the inspiration of those two games in this one but it is not either of those games. Enter the Gungeon (or EtG) is a nice combonation of the two with elements purely of it's own design. The mechanics such as dodge rolling are an interesting twist in the bullet hell genre allowing you a short window of immunity to carefully dodge over a stream of pain. The game also has reloading which is different from Nuclear thrones weapons and Isaacs tears The enemies and enviroment are all wonderfully whimsical as if Pendleton Ward-esc at some times. The soundtrack is amazing making me regret I didn't buy the soundtrack. The game has it fair amount of challenge locked in throughout the levels and areas.\n\nHowever The games challenge feels much more luck based than many other rogue-likes of this genre (to use Nuclear Throne and The Binding of Isaac as examples). The game is really dependant on you getting a good gun early on (and with only 5 floors (plus secrets) you aren't left with much room to explore. If you are given a trash gun (or none) on the first and second floor you might as well kiss the ending goodbye. A large amount of the guns are underwhelming and may have fun references and gimmics held within each one but are lacking. The enemies have a fair AI along with stratagies built into all of them. The areas are moderatly bland in relative to the long journeys of Isaac and Nuclear Throne, the 5 areas are pretty bland. The game is a wonderful rogue-like with some flaws.\n\nI can forsee me spending many hours in this game despite it's faults. Devolver and Dodge Roll did a very good job with this game.","April 11","true","32.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bv900/recommended/311690/","Bv900","Bv900","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bv900/","33 products in account","Consider this a review in progress.\n\nEnter the Gungeon comes across at first glance as a cute, adorable, fun bullet hell game but rapidly devolves a few hours in into an exhausting RNG based slog.\n\nNow, lemme talk a bit about RNG in regards to Roguelikes in general. I'm of the opinion that some of it is nearly always a good thing, but games in which extremely basic things are left up to chance tend to be poor. An example of RNG done right would be FTL; everything from your crew to weapons to ship enhancements you can get are random, but there's a wide enough variety of stores and events that give you them so you never almost never feel like your run is ruined because you weren't able to upgrade basic equipment.\n\nEnter the Gungeon is the opposite.\n\nThe main driving force behind the game and progression isn't really the Gun That Can Kill The Past, it's the guns you pick up and fight enemies with. It's here that the RNG gets ugly. You can get guns in two ways: By purchasing them from the vendor that appears on each level, or more often than not from chests. These chests give different tiers of items depending on their quality, and each requires a key to open. You start the game with only one key, and further ones are EXTREMELY rare. There are many times where in the first stage you will be forced into fighting the area boss with nothing but your starting pistol, because the one key you have either gave you a useless passive/active item and the vendor isn't selling any more.\n\nEven worse, many of the guns feel... meh. The other items you can pick up are even worse, with the powerful ones almost never being seen because of the massive amount of trash items that swamp them out.\n\nThis is compounded even further by the increasing health of enemies on each floor. Every level you go down increases the bullets enemies can take by one. If you luck out and get some obscenely powerful weapon on the first level, this doesn't matter, but if you got unlucky and are dealing with lower floors with nothing more than your starting pistol and one or two mediocre guns, things quickly spiral out of control leading to death.\n\nFinally, lets talk a bit about the bosses. Put bluntly, they're too tanky. Unless RNG favored you and you managed to get one of the extremely powerful weapons, you're looking at a fight that can take around two (!) minutes. Two minutes for a boss. In a bullet hell game. That just doesn't sit right with me and feels extremely out of place.\n\nNow that the problems are out of the way, how can they be fixed? The main problems revolve around the guns and RNG, so I see a few ways. Maybe the developers could increase the drop rate of keys or the currency in the game. Maybe they can implement a system that targets loot drops.\n\nI hope the developers fix it. There's a great game hiding under the problems here.\n\nEdit: So, apparently there is a fast travel system of sorts in the game. On the surface it seems like an excellent idea, and while it wouldn't lessen the problems I listed, it would make them more bearable. Unfortunately, some of the steps are absurd and highlight the problems I listed. The first stage of unlocking the elevator, giving the NPC 3 Blanks is bearable, but the next requires you to give him both 120 currency (!) AND 3 keys (!!!). This is RNG based as hell, because like I said, there will be many times where you can go through two entire floors and only find a single key as a random drop. Even worse, currency is extremely stingy in how it's awarded, so by the time you've completed the first floor you'll usually only have 30-40, and by the time you finish the second floor 100 at most. This also all assumes you buy nothing from the store. No keys (which you'll need for the 3 keys requirement), no weapons (which you'll need because your not unlocking chests and only have the mediocre starting pistol), no anything.","June 2","false","12.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Make no mistake, while there are RPG elements just like any rogue-like game such as Binding of Isaac, FTL, or Rogue Legacy, this is NOT an RPG.  There is no progression in the sense that you start at a higher level or with better gear.  The player progresses by unlocking shortcuts to start at deeper levels, freeing characters, or unlocking more items to broaden the available item pool.  None of these actions affect starting loadout, ever.\n\nThat said, this is beautiful shoot'em up (sh'mup) and bullet-hell choreography mixed with on-your feet logistics.  Do you spend your shells now to get that amulet which goes well with your build?  Do you wait to see if you need an emergency health or ammo boost outside of random drops?  Do you gamble on getting something better from the higher tier loot pools of deeper dungeon chests and stores?  Do you blow your hard cash on that cool upgrade?  It also helps that almost every weapon, item, and character is a reference or lampoonish parody of existing video game, cultural, or societal icons in a tongue-in-cheek, wry manner.\n\nThe aesthetic is cute and consistent in the same way as Castle Crashers and Scott Pilgrim.  It's definitely distinct and striking enough to stand out on sight.  I rather like the audio, especially the intro and outro themes and some of the boss fight music.  Some find the music rather meh, but to each their own.\n\nThe whole thing blends into a feedback loop of death and improvement that becomes a meticulous dance of efficiency and skill.  Learning to flawless a floor or a hard enemy is a joy, and the wariness an unknown enemy or boss imparts before conflict is a rush.\n\nI'd recommend.\n\nEnter the Gungeon","April 11","true","42.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Also every other room drops health just to taunt you.\nThen the next game... you find FREAKING RAIL GUN... and finish the floor within 2 minutes and get a floor master reward...\n\nEssentially, the game is AWESOME. Well worth the money if this is your "kind of game". But your success, even if you are the most skilled player, is hugely based on your RNG.\n","April 7","true","16.8"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

Especially if you like Rogue Lite games. This feels like a cross betweemn Hotline Miami, Binding of Isaac meets some of the best aspects of you're favorite Rogue Lite/Rogue Like. Tons of guns to find, some will have you laughing, while others will have you saying "F*ck yes! this game rules!".\n\nI was not sure how I would like this game, with the faster paced combat, but I have really enjoyed this so far. It is a very hard game but I feel the difficulty is just right for a game like this. Don't be scared to die, learn and put what you learned into ya next run! Just be patient, don't get angry when you die, learn why you died and come back even stronger! Some runs you can get bad luck when it comes to RNG, but keep at it! Sometimes you get some good luck!\n\nDid i mention this game has a ton of awesome guns? Some of the best selection of creative guns around! The audio is also very well done, as are the controls and gameplay. If you feel like a challenge, like Rogue lites or enjoy indie style games, pick this up today! For me it is the best rogue lite game in awhile.\n\nI have spent around 3 hours on the game so far and it is already well worth the price tag, I expect to play a good amount of hours on this game. I will comeback at a later time and add to this review, Now back to playing!","April 9","true","7.1"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","10","19","2","0"

It definitely has been growing on me!  Combat is fast, the reloads - while annoying at times - make for some strategic decision making for many of the guns, and dodge rolls have very high skill ceilings for optimal play.  So much potential!\n\nAt its current state I still wouldn't recommend it though.  There are so many amazing guns, and even moreso SO many fun passives!  You'll just never see them.  The number of runs you will do where you don't get decent items from chests - if you have keys to open chests at all - seem to far outweigh the number of runs where items make the game interesting.  Sadly, I'm still having terrible luck with Ammo drops so I can't use non-default guns most of the time.\n\nOn top of that the store is INCREDIBLY trolly.  What's that?  You have three chests unopened in this level?  Well, how about I offer you nothing but health and Blanks in the shop?  If I had one suggestion it would be a way to exchange health for keys because I routinely end up leaving health drops and unopened chests on many floors.  Anyways, that's enough griping.  Tons of potential here, but there's still a fair bit of work to be done to strike that perfect balance of power vs. challenge.","May 19","false","39.5"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spinduk/recommended/311690/","spinduk","spineDuke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spinduk/","328 products in account","A decent game marred by poor pacing and balancing.\n\nThere's a lot to like about Gungeon, from it's beautiful art, varied selection of weapons and diverse characters. Tons of secrets, additional objectives and lots of varied enemies. There's a good set of different bosses each with their own set of varied attacks the "post-game" content a bit reminiscent of Isaac. You'll find yourself learning the game's systems and enemies. If you've played Isaac or any other roguelite along those lines you'll feel right at home.\n\nUnfortunately, there's an equal number of things to complain about, and most of it falls down to the design decisions. The RNG issues which crop up time and time again which impact how often you get ammo drops or keys (although the keys is much less of an issue now after the patches).\n\nFor every effective weapon in the game, there's an equally ineffective one. With such a glut of weapons, it's no wonder how inconsistent the game experience is. Across my many hours, I've had plenty dedicated to games with little to no ammo drops, ♥♥♥♥ weapons and ♥♥♥♥ items. "It's part of the roguelike charm" they say. However, with each game taking between 45mins to an hour of YOUR time, its a fair question to ask, if time on this game is worth giving when other games do a much better job of respecting your time as a player.\n\nAlso v. important to know, that the game progression is structured similarly to Rogue Legacy, where a lot of unlocking with ingame credit is needed to allow yourself access to the higher tier weapons. That's fine, except you're going to be doing this across dozens of hours. Isaac has this, but what's interesting about Isaac is how it scales the experience depending on where you are in terms of meta game progression. The game at the beginning is short and easy, and as you gain access to newer abilities and powers, it'll unleash more powerful enemies and a longer campaign. With Gungeon, you'll bear the brunt of the campaign flatly with no change, while unlocking a 6th area eventually. This is fine, but you'll notice that the game becomes more balanced and enjoyable the longer you play it - I cannot tell you how dull and prolonged levels one and two become very shortly into the game. They're dreadfully paced. You're often underpowered, and enemy encounters often go unnecessarily long with little rewards. Sometimes you'll clear a 3 wave encounter in a room and end up with..10 paltry shells? As much as this part of the roguelike charm, it happens as often as it doesn't, and your overall gaming hours can be divided into half. Played 30 hours? Maybe 15 of those were devoted to actually playing a game you enjoyed.\n\nI like the game, I really do, but it clearly has become expensive in terms of my gaming time. If you find yourself with the luxury of time, go for it, but if not might i suggest trying the excellent Nuclear Throne? Instant - gratuitous and most importantly fun. You can thank me later for it.","May 24","false","34.0"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whyisnobodyusingthis/recommended/311690/","whyisnobodyusingthis","Swanky Toast","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whyisnobodyusingthis/","35 products in account","Ok, so I have previously written a different review to the one that I am about to write and if you are wondering why I am changing it, well that's because I wrote that review with about 10 hours in EtG, whereas now I have about 50. I feel like my opinion then is not even close to my opinion now. I have just died to the Dragun when he had no visible health left, so the sodium levels in my body are extremely high, so this review may seem like a rant.\n\nSo with that out the way, I have more background info to cover. I would like to say this before the real review starts: I actually cannot decide wether I recommend this title or not, but I'll say that I do because I feel like the game isn't completely trash.\n\nNow with the real review.\n\nI'll start withy the good things. The game is incredibly addictive, like really addictive, like Candy Crush levels of addictive. It also feel really good doing big things in this game, as it's actually very hard. Some items are really good and make the game more fun to play, but they aren't all that common. That's pretty much it. That's all the good things I can think of.\n\nNow with the bad. 80% of a run is really mundane once you start getting to the forge most of the time. In a 50 minute run, 40 of those minutes are spent fighting the same old enemies and bosses in the same old level with the same old items. Key and ammo drops are not common enough and heart drops aren't common enough later on. The key drops are fixed when you have the Master of Unlocking, but I've only had it twice. Some bosses also have too much stuff happening at once, such as Cannonbalrog. The 4th floor is also really hit or miss. If you fight the High Priest, then it's pretty much GG because he's too hard compared to the Kill Pillars and the Wallmonger. Well actually, the Kill Pillars are way too easy, the Wallmonger is the right difficulty and the High Priest is too hard.\n\nThis next part needs a paragraph to itself because I will need to do a lot of explaining. The High Dragun is, in practise, one the simplest bosses in the game, but that's only if you exlude 2 attacks which the make him one of the hardest. The attack where he shoots out some skull that chase you and the other one where he make fireballs go horizontally across the screen make him really hard if you have to deal with them both at the same time. When the skulls come out, you need to switch to a fast firing, high clip size weapon so you can easily destroy them. That's all well and good, but it's highly impracticle to switch weapons in a heated (pun intended) fight. You need to switch because most guns that are good at killing bosses have 1 shot in the clip. It could be argued that it forces you to adapt to enemies attacks so you can learn the game better, but I don't know if I need to be learning the game IN ONE OF THE LAST MAJOR FIGHTS. It's actually just stupid.\n\nI cannot be bothered to say anything elses about this game, so I'll just end this review in the same way that I ended the last one.\n\nIngredients\n\n250g butter\n, plus extra for greasing\n200g dark chocolate, broken into chunks\n500g plain flour\n500g golden caster sugar\n2 tbsp cocoa powder\n1 tsp bicarbonate of soda\n½ tsp salt\n2 large egg\n200g natural yogurt\n400g cooked beetroot\nin natural juices (not vinegar)\n4 tbsp or 2 x 28ml bottle red food colouring (optional- a natural liquid colouring will not work; we used Scarlett Langdale)\n\nMethod\n\nHeat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Make the first batch of sponges by greasing and lining 2 x 20cm round tins. Gently melt half the butter and chocolate together in a saucepan. Mix half the flour, sugar, cocoa, bicarb and ¼ tsp salt in a large mixing bowl. Whizz one egg and half the yogurt and beetroot in a food processor or blender until fairly smooth. Put the kettle on.\nTip the beetroot mix into the dry ingredients along with the melted chocolate mixture and 150ml boiling water, then stir to combine. Stir in half the food colouring, if using, and divide the mixture between the tins. Bake for 25 mins until a skewer poked into the centre comes out clean. Leave the cakes on a wire rack to cool completely.\nRepeat Steps 1 and 2 to make 2 more sponges or if you're lucky enough to have 4 x 20cm sandwich tins you can bake in a big batch all at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd my suffering.","April 15","true","87.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

Very fun. Scratches the roguelike itch while making you look in the mirror and ask yourself, "What is wrong with me?" when you lose on the second floor, 10 hours into playing. The game is very well made. It looks great. The environment, the guns, the animations, all well done.\nWhen you play Enter the Gungeon, you constantly compare what this game has done to what similar titles have, such as TBOI and Nuclear Throne. Then, you see how this game did it better. Lots of mechanics to prevent exploitation: Items disappear if you leave them on the ground, meaning you can't just save your armor to pick up right before the next floor like you do with Eternal&Soul Hearts in TBOI. The Gun ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ will only give you so much before "falling asleep".\nThe story and secrets are also a treat to simply discover as you play the game. It is interesting and engaging, driving you to do better on your next run.\nWith TBOI I just looked up everything there was to know.

Well its good, its not hard tho, its actually pretty ♥♥♥♥in easy to begin with Since ive made like 3 runs already and havn't died at all, nor have been hit by the bosses nor bulletkin. But its an really fun game, and reminds me of nuclear throne and binding of isaac (RIP nuclear throne and binding of isaac to one of my accounts getting stolen :P) Also, its dialouge, seriously its dialouge "Ill compensate you :) :) :) :) :)" WHAT IN THE LITERAL HELL. But its dialouge is really funny, aswell as "secret hidden" dialouge like shooting manny when he's on the ground, aswell as shooting the shop keepers shop. So its dialouge is pretty good and funny, Also its variety of weapons and items is massive 0.o you'd have to create over 10 runs just to get all items and weapons. So its variety is really good, its graphics well honestly graphics dont even matter since its an pixel game :P. Though its a bit buggy at some parts like the peashooter part that doesnt allow me to shoot the pea shooter. But that is just an minor glitch. Also it has plenty of funny guns like the lower case R that shoots out the letters spelling "Bullet" But in reality that weapon is ♥♥♥♥, aswell as the T shirt cannon, but its just fun to use them and satisifying when you beat the dragon with the lower case r and t shirt cannon aswell as the pilots sidearm, But one part is the most annoying sticking out, which is acquiring the planar lead and arcane gunpowder, the rest is easy but for arcane gunpowder its annoying to have to use carts to travel from the abyss when you dont have wings, its also frustrating to make an bullet trail to get to the planar lead if you dont have wings. So I give this game an rating of\n\n\n\n9/10 ( SPOLIER: Just becuase of that acquiring the ingreidents to craft the bullet that kills the past I gave it an -1)\n\n\n(If you thought this was an serious review, then RIP, since I had no intention of trying to make this an serious review since im bad at making reviews :P)\n\n\n\n\n","May 3","true","9.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is a  challenge and very difficult. Each floor has a big learning curve from the last. There are plentiful of guns, passive items, and usables. Enter the Dungeon also has an "in-game wiki" in which you can learn what a specific item does most of the time once you find or unlock it. There are also plenty of synergies and combos with passive items and guns to keep the game more alive and different each time. It starts with four playable characters, but you can unlock two more later on (though I haven't gotten that far yet). Plus one more character used for local co-op. It offers a tutorial that explains all the basic movements and abilities.

Yes please!\n\nI've always found bullet hells to be daunting as it looks completely overwhelming, BUT Enter the Gungeon has a few gameplay mechanics like dodge rolling to help give you a crutch. However, when that moment comes when you can see the pattern of bullets and intricately weave your way around the chaos, you feel like you suddenly understand Matrix level coding. It's incredibly rewarding through difficulty and there's a sense of progression. You can gain currency that allows you to unlock items (to be found in the gungeon). There's over 200 guns that range from standard pistols and shotguns to alien blasters and a literal barrel gun that shoots out fish.\n\nThe only downside is there's no  mid-gungeon save.

It is also one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. If you like games that are set up for binding of isaac, then you'll be off to a good start of liking this game. Now, do you like games witht the difficulty of DarK Souls or harder? Well great you are 2/2 and should enjoy this game.\n\nFirst we will get into the art and music of this game. The art style of this game is fresh and easy on the eyes to say the least. The music is also very fresh and goes smoothly with the game. As these two factors werent extremely important to me when buying this game i like them both.\n\nNow on to game play. This game is by no means easy. When i first started playing this game i didnt make it past level one very often. It's got a learning curve to say the least. The more you play the more you will understand how to roll through enemy fire and to know just how far you can go. The bosses are pretty hard with each level increasing in difficulty for the most part. I have probably docked almost 8 hours into this game and have not beat a level 4 boss yet.  This game can be very dependant on RNG as well. Because say you get two treasure chests you have to hope you find a second key or the shop sells one or you can't even get them both. Even more so if the RNG really wants to screw you and give you crappy guns out of both chests well lets just say you prob aren't going to make it very far.\n\nThat all being said i still really enjoy this game and would reccomend it for this low price of $15.

To be clear, it just doesn't work.  Unless you don't mind aiming clearly left/right/up and mostly moving your character around to hit the enemies AND dodge all the insane bullets.  This doesn't work for me tho.  I need it to be more like how the Steam Controller works with Geometry Wars 3; there you get very well tuned responsiveness where I can just rock my thumb ever so slightly to change the degree of my aim just as slight.  I use the Steam Controller a lot and I dislike that it just doesn't work well in this game.\n\nUse a regular twin stick controller and you're fine.\n\n\nThe game is good and you'll like it if you love bullet hell\nSo of course I must still recommend that you pick this title up.

How? Allow me to explain.\n\nEnter the Gungeon is a randomly-generating, gun-shooting, loot-taking, boss-slaying dungeon crawler/roguelike or something. At first I thought it seemed a little... silly. The place is called the GUNgeon, the main enemies are living bullets with cute faces that squeak when they die, the characters are after a 'gun that can kill the past', the bosses looked absolutely idiotic, but then I did what I do best: I threw caution to the wind.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nIt's probably my second favorite game now.\nI quickly got over how silly everything was and soon embraced it all. I mean, the shotgun-toting enemies are shotgun shells. That's awesome. The sniper enemies are rifle rounds. That's hella awesome.\nThe gunplay is lots of fun. Think Nuclear Throne meets The Binding of Isaac, but you have limited ammo and you need to reload. You have more than enough bullets to take you a long way before you need to resupply, and ammo drops are quite scarce. The amount of weapo- *ahem* GUNS you amass can easily circumvent this. Lots of guns to shoot, baddies to slay, bosses to challenge, secrets to learn, and pasts to kill. That's just scratching the surface.\n\nReally, what are you waiting for?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabidmexican/recommended/311690/","rabidmexican","Rabid Mexican","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabidmexican/","198 products in account","Enter The Gungeon\nCheck out my series on the game if you want to see how the game plays -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-FX-yjzpkg&list=PLp4LoO1eXIyZAiH-YnfhEP6M-0iOTw1uI\n\nGraphics\nWith a pixel art style and amazing animations this game is AAA in the 2D graphics arena. Seriously this game just oozes style and absolutely nails it. It looks better than Isaac, it looks better than Nuclear Throne and headshots both of them with the shear array of fluid and beautiful animations for the characters, enemies and guns.\n\nWhat is most surprising is the amount of love they have put into the guns and how they look. There are so many guns, each with their own shot types, firing animation and reloading animation. Its the little things. I had a Witch pistol that fired magic charged bullets, when reloading a steaming pile of glowing casings pops out and lies steaming on the floor. How cool is that!? Very. That is just a basic example. Some guns are so interesting, they transform, have special shots at the end of their clip. They gave these guns some graphical love for sure.\n\nOne negative is that this game is also a bullet hell. That means a whole load of shots and enemies on the screen at once. Some times with my own shots and the screen load of undodgable mess that the enemies make it can become very difficult to see what is going on. But hey, it´s a bullet hell right? A very minor and infrequent complaint!\n\n9/10\n\n\nGameplay\nHow does it compare to games like Isaac? I will sum that up fairly briefly - it is fast, fluid and intense. With games like Isaac the combat is fairly slow paced, while still being intense because of the danger in every room. Gungeon offers the same panicky, intense situations with fast paced gunplay with stylish execution.\n\nThere are many gameplay elements that break away from simply point and click shooting. You can use the walls to take cover, flip tables that act as temporary cover (the enemies can do this too, it´s super annoying haha) and use traps like falling chandeliers, rocks and explosives. It´s all great stuff, activated quickly on the fly and keeps the game fluid. Another great addition is the teleporters which allow you to teleport around the map, diminishing back-tracking (but not completely) which keeps you in the games flow. Great.\n\nThe guns. This is the games biggest draw. There are 190 guns in the game. ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY. That is insane considering there are no re-skins, similar guns or slightly modified versions, each gun has been given love and time. While one of my complaints is that some guns are pretty bad, as in worse than your starting weapon, I think it adds a nice layer to the game (like in Isaac and most roguelikes) where you have to learn what´s good and bad. I also found that whilst I hate some weapons (the sawn-off especially) some people love them and do very well with them. Devolver Digital did a great job making all guns viable, you just have to alter your play style.\n\nThe passive items improve your character permanently, I have no idea how many there are but there seems to be a LOT. They are generally fairly modest improvements, such as standards like some bullets poison enemies, larger shots, speed ups etc. However, one thing I will say is that they are generally not very powerful. I have only one or two times picked something passive up that is a game changer, but a couple of synergies have been incredible - fire-rate up, large bullets and exploding shots for example!\n\nDifficulty. Oh boy. This game is HARD. Not like Isaac hard, more like Nuclear Throne hard. It will take a lot of deaths to get anywhere near the end of the game. Personally for me it´s perfect, a fantastic balance between gating progress by having to learn boss and mob patterns and not being unfair. The thing that stands out for me is that EVERY hit I feel like could have been avoided. Not an easy feat with a bullet hell because some of the time it is, well, hell. The game gives you a great "get out of jail free card" with the blank system (it kills all enemy shots on screen and knocks back enemies) so you should never feel like the game is unfair.\n\n9/10\n\nSound\nI don´t have much to say about the games sound (or any games sound for that matter!) but what I will say is it´s excellent. The opening song has vocals and most of the music is not irritating.\n\nWhere the game does shine in this department is the sounds of the guns. Each gun sounds incredible, better than many big budget shooters (albeit sans 3D environmental effects). It really adds to the game in my opinion, even though the music tracks (apart from the opening theme) seem a little easy to forget.\n\n7/10\n\n\nReplay Value\nIf you can stomach the roguelite/like formula then it´s great. If not, well just hope you enjoy the first floor a lot. The way this works is that as you find people in the Gungeon they return to the Breach, a sort-of hub world you enter just before your adventure begins. You collect various vendors that will show up in the Gungeon and sell you items, however the draw is that you must unlock these items by spending special credits you only collect from bosses. This works really well because as you improve the arsenal of weaponry at your disposal does too, always giving you new guns and passives to try out and experiment with.\n\nNot to spoil too much but the game is crammed with secret floors, bosses, endings, characters and generally a whole load of content that will keep you busy for around 100 hours at least to 100% it (as an estimate, I am no where near 100%).\n\n8/10\n\nAnything Else?\nYes, since you are asking. Mouse vs. controller. This one is annoying. The game play fantastically on both, but can you guess the problem? The aim-assist is so powerful with a controller that when I first played and couln´t kill the 2nd boss, I tried with a controller and got to the 4th boss. With the aim assist it gives you a lot of breathing space to dodge because you don´t have to focus on hitting the enemies, it can be a little annoying but generally it is a little ridiculous. I do think it is necessary though, because there is no way a pad is keeping up with the speed of a mouse, and this game is pretty intense. Rant over haha.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThe game is great. If you like Isaac, buy it. If you like Nuclear Throne, buy it. If you like roguelites in general, buy it. However, if you do NOT like hard game, do NOT buy it. It will test you. It will break you.\n\nFast paced, loads of content, great mechanics, looks great, stylish as bullethell. Highly Recommended.\n\n8.5/10","April 15","true","81.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I have played this game very casually, often in a window as I'm watching videos or whatever. Usually I end up dying at the 3rd floor boss. I have gotten to floor 5 once.\n\nIn order to unlock new items to find during a playthrough you need to kill bosses to acquire a currency to buy them. On average you need to kill like 3 of them for a single item. That means beating floor 3 which is gonna take at least 30 minutes on average.\n\nThat is way too much time investment for something that is barely going to alter your overall experience.\n\nThe game could really benefit for some more variation other than the possibility of finding an amusing weapon and fighting a few different bosses.","April 28","true","19.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It usually takes me a couple of hours - or even a few days - to warm up to a game, but Enter the Gungeon just felt perfect to me right from the start. It has a great sense of humor, for one thing, and the pop culture references and the gun theme are easy to laugh at (seriously, the enemies are bullets with guns that fire smaller bullets, and one boss is a tank containing a bullet holding a gun that fires more bullets). It is also very easy to pick up and play, and the controls are buttery smooth.\n\nThe first thing you should know, though, is that this game is hard. Like, really hard. Even if you have played bullet hell games before, this is the hell BENEATH hell. I am not a badass at this game ( I can reliably make it to the Forge, just to give you an idea of my skill level), but I think that I have seen enough to have a pretty good idea of how challenging this game is. I personally think that it is a good sort of challenge that tests your skills. Bosses are especially nasty, though, and can feel out of hand at first (it is totally possible to beat them without being hit once though).\n\nIt does feel kind of weird that there are so many guns in the game, but you feel like you are not supposed to use them except for bosses. The game is balanced so that you are pretty much forced to use your default gun(s) against enemies to save the limited ammo of special guns for use against the ruthless bosses. It seems to be the way the game is meant to be played. You can decide if it really bugs you or not, but I do not think that it is a big deal.\n\nSome people have commented that the different guns are not very interesting/unique. All I can say about this is that I disagree, I think that there are a lot of really cool and interesting guns that are fun to use. So far, I have found rocket launchers, a gun that shoots eggs that launch homing chicks (as in chickens, not girls), a laser rifle, and many more.\n\nThe music is just kind of okay. It is not very memorable, but it fits the game pretty well. You can just turn it down and use your own music, if you prefer (it's what I do).\n\nI really like the way that the game looks. The devs put a lot of detail into the rooms and the different enemies. Each floor has its own theme (none of which are revolutionary, but they are interesting). The enemies have some really cool looks, in my opinion, and funny gun twists on stereotypical enemies. It is all very retro, of course, but it appeals to me.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that Enter the Gungeon is totally worth your money if you believe that you have the patience to withstand its difficulty. There are lots of challenges, secrets, and strange characters to be found in the Gungeon. The combat is amazing and just feels right. Devs are involved and making changes (changes that the players actually want). Highly Recommended!","April 24","true","22.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Despite most of them knowing it was a game considered to have a steep learning curve when they bought it, they're out downvoting reviews and making negative ones. You'll want to note, though, that almost all of them say it's an attractive and well designed game if they mention anything other than the difficulty at all.\n\n===Spoiler Free Review===\n\nThis is probably the most detailed game I've ever played. By that I mean, there are dozens and dozens of guns, hundreds of items, lots and lots of enemy diversity, boss diversity. I've been looking for a dungeon crawler for a very long time, and everything I've tried just wasn't doing it for me. Odd, perhaps, that I found what I was looking for in a sort of bullet hell game. But this really does it for me, and I feel very committed to seeing this one through to the end. For that, it's quite hard, but I don't recall being so confident with my ability to play a game in a long time. It's also quite good for a short pop-in play, with short runs taking about 20 minutes, and longer runs taking about an hour.\n\nKnowing a little about Enter the Gungeon, I chose it over nuclear throne because it seemed like it had more replayability with item design. Nuclear Throne's playability comes in at the character level, but I was a bit turned off by that game's enemy horde mechanics and its singular and repetitive boss fight. But that's just from someone who's seen a good player play several hours of it.\n\nThere's a bit of lag or stutter on my pre-SP1 Windows 7 machine, but that's sort of to be expected.\n\n==Mechanics==\n\nBesides being a so-called 'rogue-lite', meaning you lose your immediate progression when your character dies, there's a long-term loot unlock system which puts new items of your choice into play the more you kill bosses, and also some unlocks for completing certain feats and achievements. It's a randomly generated game, but also has a certain linear element, where you know what sort of enemies you'll be fighting on a map, or what sort of skills a boss might use (but they don't always use skills how you think they will).\n\nIt's a bit of a bullet hell game with light evasion mechanics, but also a bit RNG loot fest - there's also a bit of a cover system, but that's RNG relevant. Your skill ceiling will depend on what items you get, how often you get ammo for your guns, and what sort of bullet patterns you come up against (blanks, your bailout mechanic, has a limited use with extra RNG pickups, which might be neccisary to use in certain situations). It really makes me feel like a gun slinger sometimes, which is odd for a topdown game. And, I mean, even moreso than Red Dead Redemption with aim assist off (which is how I play it) - mostly because the mouse controls are so intuitive and responsive.\n\nThere are definently overpowered guns and items, but I think it really depends on how you handle the items you get. There are some that make clearing rooms faster, some that are better at downing bosses, and some that are very situational to enemy types.\n\nI haven't played co-op, but it;s certainly an interesting prospect I plan to try in the future.\n\n==Story==\n\nThere is a story here (which is by no means intrusive), and there are lots of secrets to figure out. It's choc-o-bloc full of references for popular culture, and it's very funny, and quite a cute game. So beware spoilers, not only for boss fight mechanics, but all the secrets and story bits and unique guns/items. It'll be a lot more fun to figure this one out on your own.\n\n==Conclusion==\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game, at least for the ammount of time I've put into it. If you think you'd not be very good at it, it does seem like a good title to learn bullet hell games (as I'm not very experienced with them and I've seen myself get better and better at it). But you can encounter most of the game's items in the first area over time, and a lot of them are incredibly fun and will put a smile on your face.","April 28","true","114.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Well its good, its not hard tho, its actually pretty ♥♥♥♥in easy to begin with Since ive made like 3 runs already and havn't died at all, nor have been hit by the bosses nor bulletkin.

Probably more. Now, first, I want to talk about the negative reviews.\n\nI noticed 10% of the reviews for Enter the Gungeon were negative. I decided to see how this was possible. I noticed 2 general trends.\n\n1. People weren't very good at it and felt like it was too hard.\n2. People who had played similar games (like Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne) thought it would be like those and it wasn't what they expected.\n\nThis is a rogue-lite bullet hell game. It's not supposed to be a cake walk. Did the graphics throw them off? I don't know, and I don't care. It's supposed to be challenging.\n\nSome people also said that they didnt think they'd ever get past a certain floor. Not with an attitude like that, and not without practice. I bet a large majority of people die their first time fighting any boss in this game. You have to learn those bosses patterns so you CAN beat them, and rise VICTORIOUS.\n\nOh and god forbid that it's not exactly like those other games. Enter the Gungeon would probably have more negative reviews if it was, because these same people, and MORE, would complain about it being a bad copy (even if it's actually better. SHOTS FIRED.)\n\nNow on to what I think of it.\n\nCONS\n\nI'd give the gameplay/controls a 9/10. It's practically perfect. The only complaints I have are that, sometimes, the dodge roll is a LIIITTLE unresponsive. I also dont like how when you're using a charge gun, if you take a hit while charged, it loses its charge. I'm fine with it if that's how they intended these things to work, but these are things that could be changed with an update, which, by the way, is entirely possible. They update this game ALL THE TIME (and don't worry, you shouldn't lose your save when they do.)\n\nAs far as finding weapons, items, keys, etc, I think it's fine...except for ONE thing. So, the easiest way to get keys is to buy them from the store. Now, the thing is, sometimes on the harder levels, you have to use a key to get to the store. It's a bit of a problem that I actually do think should be changed.\n\nPROS\n\nThis game is FANTASTIC. It's one of the best "fresh" games I've played. I haven't played a game I enjoyed as much as this since Terraria (by the way, i have almost 1000 hours on Terraria. #nolife.)\n\nI'm a loot man, so the fact that there are tons of weapons and items is a HUGE plus for me.\n\nThe bosses are all very challenging and unique. There's a pretty large variety of enemies too for that matter.\n\nTheres more to do in it than just try to make it through every floor. There are MULTIPLE NPC's that you can save. While most of them are shop keepers, they all have their own unique inventory, and the NPC's that aren't shop keepers are what keep the game interesting.\n\nThere are lots of steam achievements and in game challenges.\n\nThe music...there's a reason this game's sound track is purchasable. It's great. Absolutely great. I still havent gotten tired of it.\n\nI would recommend this game to just about anyone. It's got A LOT of play time value and a lot more than you would expect from such a straight forward concept. I personally love this game, and i give it 9/10 bullets. Would shoot again.","April 19","true","69.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is a  challenge and very difficult. Each floor has a big learning curve from the last. There are plentiful of guns, passive items, and usables. Enter the Dungeon also has an "in-game wiki" in which you can learn what a specific item does most of the time once you find or unlock it. There are also plenty of synergies and combos with passive items and guns to keep the game more alive and different each time. It starts with four playable characters, but you can unlock two more later on (though I haven't gotten that far yet). Plus one more character used for local co-op. It offers a tutorial that explains all the basic movements and abilities. Finally, I got to kill a shirtless muscular bird with an exploding banana.\n\nPros:\n200+ guns\n100+ enemies and/or bosses\nlocal co-op\nmultiple playable characters\nsecrets to be discovered\n144 fps\n\nCons:\nDifficult (I find this good and fun, but some may find it bad)\nNo saving (the devs claim to be working on a save feature)\nNo online co-op\n","April 9","true","9.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Let's hop right into the positive here. It's fast. It's got amazing art. It's got amazing music. It has that one more run mentality. You dive down into a randomly generated dungeon with one of several characters, and see what happens. The bosses are great, and anyone who plays other bullet hell games (Touhou being my poison of choice) will immediately recognize patterns and pick it up. It even has some really clever boss patterns that I won't talk about because you've got to see them yourself.\n\nI normally love a game like this, HOWEVER, it has a few issues right now. Holding down the trigger doesn't auto reload. This is like playing isaac and picking up chocolate milk. Or any charge attack weapon in any game. Except this game HAS charge attack weapons. On a semi-auto like a rifle, this doesn't matter. But when you get one of the weaker damage but automatic weapons, you're unloading and now have to depress, and click again, then click again when it's loading. You can hit R, but it doesn't feel right during combat.\n\nAlso, while the characters look great and feel like they've got some neat flavour, they all feel very similar. A large part of this is because the default guns do very similar damage and don't really have any unique effects. Which leads me to my final complaint. There just isn't enough pickups. What makes isaac fun, nuclear throne fun, etc etc, is picking up new items that change your game. Here, the majority of items you find are active items (whose effects range from great but one use to mostly useless). You also find a few passive items that effect an ability you have that will likely only be used once or twice on the boss (who are immune to the effects). Having more items that add variety to your shots, stats, or something else would really make this game something special.\n\nRight now I have to rate it a 7. I enjoy the game, but it's just missing a few key features for me. Please note i rate games with a 5 being average so this is by no means a bad score. I think it's a solid game with potential.","April 12","true","4.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have played this game very casually, often in a window as I'm watching videos or whatever. Usually I end up dying at the 3rd floor boss. I have gotten to floor 5 once.\n\nIn order to unlock new items to find during a playthrough you need to kill bosses to acquire a currency to buy them. On average you need to kill like 3 of them for a single item. That means beating floor 3 which is gonna take at least 30 minutes on average.\n\nThat is way too much time investment for something that is barely going to alter your overall experience.\n\nThe game could really benefit for some more variation other than the possibility of finding an amusing weapon and fighting a few different bosses.","April 28","true","19.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's very well rounded, the mechanics are solid, and it's very VERY hard. But it's not hard in an unfair way, it's a dark souls kind of hard, it expects you to get better, or... you know, die.\n\nUnlike other roguelikes/roguelites, for example, the binding of isaac, or logue legacy, the "git gud" element is in it's raw form, as you don't really unlock items that help you out a lot in the game (not a lot at least). What I'm saying is that playing the game with 0% unlocks is just as hard as playing it with 100% unlocks, except you will get to see a lot more fun and wacky ♥♥♥♥ with 100% unlocks.\n\nYou can very rarely break the game, as the resource maganing aspect of the game can catch up to you in any point of the game and f you over, even if you have your opinion of the best weapon in the game.\n\nIt has a ♥♥♥♥ ton of secrets, and the more you play and progress you make, the more you find.\n\nI can't really talk about end game stuff considering I only played this for around 20 hours as of this review, but from what I've seen and heard, there is a lot of content to go on for a long time.\n\n\nTLDR: Solid game, a must buy if you are into bullet hells and/or roguelikes.

It usually takes me a couple of hours - or even a few days - to warm up to a game, but Enter the Gungeon just felt perfect to me right from the start. It has a great sense of humor, for one thing, and the pop culture references and the gun theme are easy to laugh at (seriously, the enemies are bullets with guns that fire smaller bullets, and one boss is a tank containing a bullet holding a gun that fires more bullets). It is also very easy to pick up and play, and the controls are buttery smooth.\n\nThe first thing you should know, though, is that this game is hard. Like, really hard. Even if you have played bullet hell games before, this is the hell BENEATH hell. I am not a badass at this game ( I can reliably make it to the Forge, just to give you an idea of my skill level), but I think that I have seen enough to have a pretty good idea of how challenging this game is. I personally think that it is a good sort of challenge that tests your skills. Bosses are especially nasty, though, and can feel out of hand at first (it is totally possible to beat them without being hit once though).\n\nIt does feel kind of weird that there are so many guns in the game, but you feel like you are not supposed to use them except for bosses. The game is balanced so that you are pretty much forced to use your default gun(s) against enemies to save the limited ammo of special guns for use against the ruthless bosses. It seems to be the way the game is meant to be played. You can decide if it really bugs you or not, but I do not think that it is a big deal.\n\nSome people have commented that the different guns are not very interesting/unique. All I can say about this is that I disagree, I think that there are a lot of really cool and interesting guns that are fun to use. So far, I have found rocket launchers, a gun that shoots eggs that launch homing chicks (as in chickens, not girls), a laser rifle, and many more.\n\nThe music is just kind of okay. It is not very memorable, but it fits the game pretty well. You can just turn it down and use your own music, if you prefer (it's what I do).\n\nI really like the way that the game looks. The devs put a lot of detail into the rooms and the different enemies. Each floor has its own theme (none of which are revolutionary, but they are interesting). The enemies have some really cool looks, in my opinion, and funny gun twists on stereotypical enemies. It is all very retro, of course, but it appeals to me.\n\nSo, yeah, I think that Enter the Gungeon is totally worth your money if you believe that you have the patience to withstand its difficulty. There are lots of challenges, secrets, and strange characters to be found in the Gungeon. The combat is amazing and just feels right. Devs are involved and making changes (changes that the players actually want). Highly Recommended!","April 24","true","22.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gativrek/recommended/311690/","gativrek","Gativrek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gativrek/","183 products in account","Enter the Gungeon is a rogue-like based around guns made by Dodge Roll. It seems very inspired by the games Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne, since you're running on a randomly generated dungeon and you have a bird's eye perspective. The game's lore is simple and basic, and I'd rather not go deep into it, since it's and interesting story that should have your own mindset into it.\n\nThe controls are simple - for a bullet hell, that is -, with the aim being the simple mouse movement and dodge roll being your right mouse button. Like a game of the likes of Dark Souls, dodge roll is extremely important, giving you the oportunity of having quick invicibility frames, which are near necessary to beat the game. Another ability that your "Gungeoneer" has is using a "Blank" which can clear the bullets in a room, and can be upgraded to have knockbacks, ignite enemies of fire, and others upgrades alike.\n\nThe enemies are deadly and bloodthirsty and some designs are just hilarious. They're all bullet themed, just like everything else; the whole game is centered around guns and bullets, even your pickups such as keys and money are bullets. Some of the bosses have amazing designs, specially with the graphics of the game being simplistic.\n\nAll around it's a great game to play around with, and it really helps you to get better reflexes. Also, the achievements are pretty hard to get, so that's a 1-up for someone that enjoys achievements such as myself.\n\n9/10","April 21","true","35.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

How? Allow me to explain.\n\nEnter the Gungeon is a randomly-generating, gun-shooting, loot-taking, boss-slaying dungeon crawler/roguelike or something. At first I thought it seemed a little... silly. The place is called the GUNgeon, the main enemies are living bullets with cute faces that squeak when they die, the characters are after a 'gun that can kill the past', the bosses looked absolutely idiotic, but then I did what I do best: I threw caution to the wind.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nIt's probably my second favorite game now.\nI quickly got over how silly everything was and soon embraced it all. I mean, the shotgun-toting enemies are shotgun shells. That's awesome. The sniper enemies are rifle rounds. That's hella awesome.\nThe gunplay is lots of fun. Think Nuclear Throne meets The Binding of Isaac, but you have limited ammo and you need to reload. You have more than enough bullets to take you a long way before you need to resupply, and ammo drops are quite scarce. The amount of weapo- *ahem* GUNS you amass can easily circumvent this. Lots of guns to shoot, baddies to slay, bosses to challenge, secrets to learn, and pasts to kill. That's just scratching the surface.\n\nReally, what are you waiting for?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabidmexican/recommended/311690/","rabidmexican","Rabid Mexican","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabidmexican/","198 products in account","Enter The Gungeon\nCheck out my series on the game if you want to see how the game plays -\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-FX-yjzpkg&list=PLp4LoO1eXIyZAiH-YnfhEP6M-0iOTw1uI\n\nGraphics\nWith a pixel art style and amazing animations this game is AAA in the 2D graphics arena. Seriously this game just oozes style and absolutely nails it. It looks better than Isaac, it looks better than Nuclear Throne and headshots both of them with the shear array of fluid and beautiful animations for the characters, enemies and guns.\n\nWhat is most surprising is the amount of love they have put into the guns and how they look. There are so many guns, each with their own shot types, firing animation and reloading animation. Its the little things. I had a Witch pistol that fired magic charged bullets, when reloading a steaming pile of glowing casings pops out and lies steaming on the floor. How cool is that!? Very. That is just a basic example. Some guns are so interesting, they transform, have special shots at the end of their clip. They gave these guns some graphical love for sure.\n\nOne negative is that this game is also a bullet hell. That means a whole load of shots and enemies on the screen at once. Some times with my own shots and the screen load of undodgable mess that the enemies make it can become very difficult to see what is going on. But hey, it´s a bullet hell right? A very minor and infrequent complaint!\n\n9/10\n\n\nGameplay\nHow does it compare to games like Isaac? I will sum that up fairly briefly - it is fast, fluid and intense. With games like Isaac the combat is fairly slow paced, while still being intense because of the danger in every room. Gungeon offers the same panicky, intense situations with fast paced gunplay with stylish execution.\n\nThere are many gameplay elements that break away from simply point and click shooting. You can use the walls to take cover, flip tables that act as temporary cover (the enemies can do this too, it´s super annoying haha) and use traps like falling chandeliers, rocks and explosives. It´s all great stuff, activated quickly on the fly and keeps the game fluid. Another great addition is the teleporters which allow you to teleport around the map, diminishing back-tracking (but not completely) which keeps you in the games flow. Great.\n\nThe guns. This is the games biggest draw. There are 190 guns in the game. ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY. That is insane considering there are no re-skins, similar guns or slightly modified versions, each gun has been given love and time. While one of my complaints is that some guns are pretty bad, as in worse than your starting weapon, I think it adds a nice layer to the game (like in Isaac and most roguelikes) where you have to learn what´s good and bad. I also found that whilst I hate some weapons (the sawn-off especially) some people love them and do very well with them. Devolver Digital did a great job making all guns viable, you just have to alter your play style.\n\nThe passive items improve your character permanently, I have no idea how many there are but there seems to be a LOT. They are generally fairly modest improvements, such as standards like some bullets poison enemies, larger shots, speed ups etc. However, one thing I will say is that they are generally not very powerful. I have only one or two times picked something passive up that is a game changer, but a couple of synergies have been incredible - fire-rate up, large bullets and exploding shots for example!\n\nDifficulty. Oh boy. This game is HARD. Not like Isaac hard, more like Nuclear Throne hard. It will take a lot of deaths to get anywhere near the end of the game. Personally for me it´s perfect, a fantastic balance between gating progress by having to learn boss and mob patterns and not being unfair. The thing that stands out for me is that EVERY hit I feel like could have been avoided. Not an easy feat with a bullet hell because some of the time it is, well, hell. The game gives you a great "get out of jail free card" with the blank system (it kills all enemy shots on screen and knocks back enemies) so you should never feel like the game is unfair.\n\n9/10\n\nSound\nI don´t have much to say about the games sound (or any games sound for that matter!) but what I will say is it´s excellent. The opening song has vocals and most of the music is not irritating.\n\nWhere the game does shine in this department is the sounds of the guns. Each gun sounds incredible, better than many big budget shooters (albeit sans 3D environmental effects). It really adds to the game in my opinion, even though the music tracks (apart from the opening theme) seem a little easy to forget.\n\n7/10\n\n\nReplay Value\nIf you can stomach the roguelite/like formula then it´s great. If not, well just hope you enjoy the first floor a lot. The way this works is that as you find people in the Gungeon they return to the Breach, a sort-of hub world you enter just before your adventure begins. You collect various vendors that will show up in the Gungeon and sell you items, however the draw is that you must unlock these items by spending special credits you only collect from bosses. This works really well because as you improve the arsenal of weaponry at your disposal does too, always giving you new guns and passives to try out and experiment with.\n\nNot to spoil too much but the game is crammed with secret floors, bosses, endings, characters and generally a whole load of content that will keep you busy for around 100 hours at least to 100% it (as an estimate, I am no where near 100%).\n\n8/10\n\nAnything Else?\nYes, since you are asking. Mouse vs. controller. This one is annoying. The game play fantastically on both, but can you guess the problem? The aim-assist is so powerful with a controller that when I first played and couln´t kill the 2nd boss, I tried with a controller and got to the 4th boss. With the aim assist it gives you a lot of breathing space to dodge because you don´t have to focus on hitting the enemies, it can be a little annoying but generally it is a little ridiculous. I do think it is necessary though, because there is no way a pad is keeping up with the speed of a mouse, and this game is pretty intense. Rant over haha.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThe game is great. If you like Isaac, buy it. If you like Nuclear Throne, buy it. If you like roguelites in general, buy it. However, if you do NOT like hard game, do NOT buy it. It will test you. It will break you.\n\nFast paced, loads of content, great mechanics, looks great, stylish as bullethell. Highly Recommended.\n\n8.5/10","April 15","true","81.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

You are mostly limited to what you find in chests, and you can absolutely get RNG'd by bad chests or insufficient ammo drops.\n\nUnlocks are mostly based on currency and not accomplishment, so wiping on the first 3 floors still "rewards" you with a stream of spacebucks and new pickups. Ultimately these reduce the difficulty, and you can end up feeling like you're making progress simply because you're grinding out unlocks.

I hardly believe this is the case with roguelikes, since most of the gameplay elements are there from the start and  I believe that you need to spend less time on it so you can make your decision. Coming from Binding of Isaac fatigue (while waiting for Afterbirth+) I saw Enter the Gungeon previews and gameplay footage and I was immediately in love.\n\nMade by the same guys who made the Hotline Miami games, the art is unique and stylish , adorable at times and conveys the spirit of the game beautifully. The combat is easy to get into and difficult to master, so expect to try and try again till your brain automates all the moves. The roguelike elements of randomly generated dungeons/enemies/loot/bosses mean that the replayability factor of the game is sky high.\n\nEnter the Gungeon is a mix of Nuclear Throne, Binding of Isaac and Spelunky and if you were a fan of any of those games  you don't want to miss on this one.\nYou have a choice of different characters to play as (I'm guessing/hoping there's a couple of more secret ones as well!) each one with a slightly different loadout of weapon and a usable items/passives.\nYou proceed through a randomly generated dungeon, killing anyone standing in your way, rolling and dodging out the bullet hell created by your enemies and hope to get good guns and items.\nYou can unlock new weapons/items by progressing through the game's story, there's several secrets to be found and the fun never stops. You'll die and die again, pushing yourself to become better. It's frustrating at times, but the good kind, the kind that motivates you to become better and play the game some more.\n\nDefinitely recommended to anyone who enjoys bullet hell and/or roguelike games, and the sheer amount of hours you can and will spend on this game compared to its price, I'd say that's a steal!\n\nGet it while it's hot people and enjoy.","April 6","true","142.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

With its current balance, I can hardly recommend it even as dungeon crawler fan myself.\n\nPro:\n- Combining bullet hell and dungeon crawler offers a refreshing experience\n- Tons of guns each designed with unique ability\n- Just the right amount of lore and secret to explore\n\nCon:\n- Extremely unbalanced guns, most of which can hardly take down a boss even with full ammo. In the meantime, the very few guns that are actually effective against bosses are so effective that they take down the boss with only a few shots\n- Unbalanced levels where the difficulty scales poorly. Enemy's health scales up in each higher level, yet player's weapon damage and loot pool on each level stays the same. Players could either get very OP weapon in the begining or useless **** in late game.\n- Hitboxes that are too aweful for a bullet hell game, especially the hitbox of a flipped table.\n\nRant: I never expected that I would come to hate Enter the Gungeon. I've played Binding of Issac, Risk of Rain, Crypt of Necrodancer Rogue's Legacy, Darkest Dungeon and all Touhou games. As a fan of both dungeon crawler and bullet hell I generally get into this type of game quickly. However for Enter the Gungeon the whole experience feels like boarding a pain train. Enter the Gungeon is supposed to be hard and rewarding, but it just ends up being unfair and frustrating. At this point I just wish that the devs will fix the balance some time. Because IMO, with a better balance Enter the Dungeon might actually do better than Binding of Issac.","June 5","false","24.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hellcake/recommended/311690/","Hellcake","Supernatural Cookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hellcake/","379 products in account","Gorgous game. Great music. Terrible balance.\n\nEnter the Gungeon is a bit of a mash up of Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne, however while it incorporates many elements from both, it seems to miss the mark on the bits that make each truely enjoyable. Part of this comes from the fact that enemy health scales per floor and bosses take far too long to kill. But part also comes from the pacing and frankly, terrible randomness the game provides. Like Isaac, the game has numerous passive and active item drops, and like in Nuclear Throne, guns are also part of that pool. However, unlike both, it offers far less. You gain items and weapons from locked chests of varying quality. Think Isaac's treasure rooms, cept the quality of chest draws from a pool of items, making it a little easier to decide if you should open a chest or not. The problem however, is that there is seemingly a much larger pool of rubbish items and guns you can obtain regardless of quality. Many items even don't have a proper explaination on what they do, making it tough to even discern if they're helping at all and even things that increase the damage you do are negated by the increasing HP of even common enemies. Making matters worse is that the general shop doesn't always sell a weapon or even items, and the other shops you can unlock have a rather low chance of appearing as well. This isn't even mentioning the rarity of keys runs can have, making it very possible you can say get stuck with no gun but your default loadout until after the first boss.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, as mentioned earlier each one has an absurd amount of HP. Which is only made worse on those runs when you get no weapon drops at all, or are stuck with a gimmicky weapon that does next to no damage. The bosses themselves can range from ridiculously easy to rather tough for their stage as well, making for an overall uneven experience when playing. This can be noted especially due to the fact that several bosses spawn in additional enemies to deal with while you're fighting them, making already chaotic fights more diffuclt.\n\nOn the note of enemies, every stage causes even common enemies to take more damage. Its not terribly bad, however it becomes quickly noticeable. A good example is the basic bulletkin can be taken out by the Huntress's crossbow in one hit on the first level, and then requires two on the next floor. This doesn't mean the enemy changed, or got more difficult. Just a pointless change in health for no discernable reason beyond to make it so your guns will do seemingly less damage the further you go.\n\nFinally when it comes down to variety, Enter the Gungeon just simply doesn't offer as much as other games of its ilk. Every character plays the same, just with a few very minor feeling passives. Only the secret characters seem to change that up in any kind of meaningful fashion. An example of this is.. One character starts with armor and increased aim, but another has a secondary weapon and a dog that has a small chance to find things. Or a character that has a side arm, a space bar item and an ability to do more damage temporarily if damaged, which the game penalizes you for by the way with less money drops and bosses giving you worse rewards. Overall, the characters all feel fairly samey which can make playing multiple times, especially with poor drops, really boring.\n\nI wish Steam had a middling option for recommending it or not, since the game is still fairly decent despite all of its issues. If you wanna try something new and have already played Isaac and Nuclear Throne, this might tide you over a bit. But if you haven't, I'd recommend trying the other two first. They'd offer a better and more even challenge towards introducing new players.","April 27","false","31.8"," 19 of 39 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","19","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justgravy/recommended/311690/","justgravy","Gravy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justgravy/","418 products in account","I can only recommend Enter The Gungeon for the most 'git gud' obsessed players. While the gameplay is satisfying, many of the mechanics with the way the game operates are not. The gunplay and controls feel good, but you constantly feel as though you are punished for having fun. You just picked up some amazing new weapon? Better make sure you don't use it on regular enemies and save it for the boss because the chances you'll get any ammo is minimal. Tried to play smart against weaker enemies by using your regular gun? Then prepare yourself for long arduous rooms, not to mention that basic enemies gain more health the deeper you go, making them take even longer to kill.\n\nWhen clearing a floor you have a few priorities: Find the chests, find the boss room, find the shop. Anything past that is secondary and the only reason to clear additional rooms is for money and the rare chance of a drop (ammo/key/health). This leads to a loop which is not rewarding and means a lot of restarts on floor 1 trying to get a good gun. The reason for this? A lot of the guns are hot garbage. I commonly restart after not getting a good gun, or killing the boss with my starter weapon, then realizing the boss has dropped a bad gun. This falls into the category of min-maxing, as killing the boss before acquiring the gun ensures the boss gives you a gun, so in practice you would THINK you're going to get a good gun either from the boss, or one of the chests on the floor, and sadly you would be wrong a good percentage of the time. On top of this many of the items you pick up in the Gungeon are clones of other items, or are flat out worthless. You also have issues with how large the floors and rooms are, why does a room need FOUR waves of enemies? Why are there so many rooms to slog through? It shouldn't take 10+ minutes to beat a floor, nor should it take more than a minute to kill the first boss in the game. With cautious play we're talking upwards of 50-60 minutes PER run, maybe more if you hit the first secret floor to min-max even more.\n\nI find Enter the Gungeon to be extremely frustrating, I spend more time trying to get good items on the first and second level than anything else, because if you can't perfect at least the first boss (which provides you with another heart), or get good guns there's no reason to play past floor 2 because you NEED good guns and more health on floor 3, 4, and 5. This means I use the quick restart functionality a lot, and I don't want to do that but know that if I don't my chances of getting to the deeper floors is miniscule. You feel as though you're being punished for trying to do your best. Picked up a shotgun? Just restart it is worthless on the boss, didn't perfect the first boss? Restart. The boss dropped a low tier weapon? Restart. The chests on floor one were brown and blue? Restart. The shopkeeper doesn't have a key or stupid items like ammo on the first floor? Restart. The game is so punishing at later levels, and so stingy with health, ammo, and keys that you can't reasonably have a good time without trying to min-max, and it's so dependent on having at least an okay gun that you actively punish yourself if you don't restart to try and get something better.\n\nOverall I just can't recommend the game in its current state. I waited for several weeks after the release to rate this in hopes the developers would improve things, but all they've done in that time is make a boss or two easier, and make key drops more frequently on the first floor. They've shown no interest in improving the flaws that make the game feel like slow drudge work and that's a bummer to me. I want to feel like I'm in a Max Payne game, killing enemies, flying through rooms, I don't want to unload an entire clip of my starter weapon into the most basic of enemies just because I'm on floor 3. Right now the issue is the game just isn't fun, I dread starting it up because I know I'll have to slog through floor 1 again, slowly, methodically, and then will I have to restart? Will I get a gun that isn't complete garbage? I don't know. Right now though I'm not willing to play to check it out, and that makes me sad. The game has a lot of things going for it, but when you can't even use the guns you've gotten because you're scared you won't find ammo and need that gun for a boss, that's where I call it quits.","April 22","false","19.3"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

Here is a roguelite that plays like The Binding of Isaac but replaces a grim and off-putting atmosphere with action movie references and a welcoming sense of dread. Every enemy bullet has an insane grin, seemingly happy to do nothing more than shoot its shotgun and huddle behind a flipped table. Looking at their faces, I can’t help but share in that unbridled joy. Gungeon is fast paced, explosive, unforgiving, and a hell of a great time.\n\nWant to know more?

Pixel animation is admirable and rendering is rock solid with no FPS gaps. I honestly expected Enter the Gungeon to be my personal pick over Nuclear Throne but it falls short when it comes to the actual core of the game: the shooting.\n\nYou see, the shooting is so weak. Any gun is either a puny potato shooter or slow reloading half-decent damager. My char feels slowed and underwhelmingly feeble. The rooms are at plenty but there is no reward in cleaning them—just another tedious killing of adversaries with peas, a lot of peas. Being so underpowered I could’ve used any decent gun to my advantage (or so I thought) but instead I'm saving its ammo for the bosses. Meaning I have to clear rooms with whatever pitiful spitter I have and hate. The bullet type guns are of poor accuracy, usually, which makes a weak gun even weaker. Hit-to-kill ratio is just laughable for somebody who came from the Nuclear Throne.\n\nThe number of the potential passive upgrades is so big that the game designers had to make their bonuses very weak; or else you could become OP by the end of run. This means that if you need any specific bonus for the run, like the accuracy upgrade, you can't get it reliably since it has like 2/150 chance to drop. The result—you can't even plan your builds, it is out of your control. Just like any other thing: ammo drop, health drop, a key drop... you can't get them if you need them. Don't get hit, they say.\n\nOverall—for me, mind you—Enter the Gungeon is a game with a hundred bad guns (plus 2 decent ones, maybe), big unrewarding floors of no joy, tedious bosses with huge piles of health—but all that comes with excellent presentation. You could make good screenshots, yey!","April 25","false","30.8"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

Yes, the drop rates are horrible, but that's only tip of the iceberg. Through the course of the game you can rescue characters from prison for them to appear on later runs through the game. There are also NPCs you don't have to rescue, and some power-up shrines to spice up the gameplay.\nProblem is that these things hardly never appear. And many of the NPCs have quests tied to game progression, so you hope that they'll show up in run, only for nothing to happen. This results in most of the runs feeling very samey after a while.\nContinuing with the trend of stingyness, let's talk about guns which are big part of the game. There are good ones, but they are in the rarity. Most of the guns you can get are either generic, or poor performing joke guns. Which are fun when you first encounter them, but after a while you notice that they are taking spots from something you'd actually like to use. For every Serious Sam Cannon there are too many generic handguns and rifles. Granted, this does make it great when you actually get something good, but also means that most of the time you're stuck with rubbish.\nAlso most of the guns feel horrible to shoot. Too much of "pew pew pew", which is why less standard ones like explosives or beams are more amusing here. Too bad those are minority.\n\nGoing back to quests, after you complete them, they are removed from the gameplay. Sure, things do change at the character hub and you unlock item, but actual variety of doing things is removed from gameplay. For example, one quest requires you to kill an option bonus boss during a run, which nets you standard rewards for beating a boss in addition to intended boss of the floor. After doing this you'll never get the bonus encounter again.\nSo unlocking things and doing quests actually makes the game less variable in the end unless you really want some more guns into rotation.\n\nThere are good things about the game too, like excellent presentation and soundtrack, but in the end this just isn't very fun.","April 22","false","32.5"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

My Steam list is full of games like this. I love a lot of the graphical touches, and the clever weapons and references.\n\nBut ... it's just not fun. The game quickly becomes repetitive, and part of this is down to the fact that for a "roguelike", it's almost wearyingly predictable. Rooms are prefab, weapons are always the same, map layouts follow strict rules about how many rooms and chests and keys you'll find, monster AI is almost entirely limited to "walk forward towards the player, firing every X seconds," and there's no real progression in or out of the dungeon.\n\nCombine this with sluggish controls and rather high difficulty, and the result is that you'll basically see the same enemies over and over again. Even the weapons repeat themselves, especially early on, as some weapons have to be unlocked in order to spawn.\n\nPlus, for all that many of the guns are "clever," many of them just aren't actually any fun, or even at all useful or effective. Yes it's a fun joke to have the Mooninite's gun, but as an actual weapon it's basically useless in the context of an action game like this.\n\nThere is, almost, a fun game in this. More progression mechanics, a la Rogue Legacy, less sluggish action and movement, and more unpredictability, could turn this into a properly good entry in the genre.

ETG is a DIFFICULT game. Please understand this before you buy it. At the time of this review I have 6.3 hrs (all from one sitting) in game. I feel like I've just scratched the surface of what ETG has to offer.\n\nThis game is a JOY to look at it. The trailers don't do it justice even in HD. Character, enemy, environmental, & weapon animations are absolutely gorgeous. Attention to detail is an understatement here. Sound effects are really satisfying & the soundtrack does a good job of keeping things feeling urgent. I really enjoy when sound design comes together with impressive visuals like this. Explosions feature the proper amount of LOUD concussion noise (screen-shake is adjustable in the options). The guns sound and feel POWERFUL. By the way, there are a TON of hilarious & unique guns in this game. I picked up a banana gun from a chest and was overjoyed to learn it was a throwback to the WORMS games. Banana cluster bomb from hell!\n\nETG has an extensive list of unique enemies. Prioritizing which targets to hit first is what makes this game challenging. You never know what to expect before you enter a room. You must instantly identify enemy type, their proximity to you, damage output/type etc. the second you enter an area. Using the environment to your advantage is an awesome feeling, nothing like using grenade enemies to take out their homies before they can react. Explosive barrels can be kicked into enemies if you're quick, resulting in satisfying multi-kills when they accidentally shoot the barrel instead of you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaeto/recommended/311690/","kaeto","Hideous Kojima","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaeto/","177 products in account","I loved Isaac, so I really want to like this game, but I just don't. It's loaded to the gills with bad RNG, to the point where the game encourages you to play a character who is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and boring to start to avoid being ♥♥♥♥ed by RNG later on. Ammo in particular is so bad that to avoid your run getting ♥♥♥♥ed you want to spend a decent chunk of the game NOT using any guns you pick up since you might need the ammo later.\n\nThere are a lot of mechanics that just aren't as well thought out as Isaac, and the gun system is really a lot less fun than Isaac's tear upgrades. Even the game's two core gimmicks (dodge rolling and table flipping) are both overall detractions, if the game was designed without them it would have definitely been more fun.\n\nThere are also a lot of annoying delays in the game. Isaac does have backtracking if you ♥♥♥♥ up, but in this game I find the delays way more annoying because they're just arbitrarily unskippable animations, and you have to spend about ten seconds walking to start the game for no reason, and there is a lot of time you spend just traversing rooms.\n\nThe game also actively punishes you for taking damage, which is a fundamentally stupid concept. If you're good enough to avoid getting hit, you get more stuff, and the game becomes even less challenging. If you're new and bad, you get hit, and get less fun stuff to play with. It also encourages players to play the most boring, safe way possible, where Isaac had a lot more options for how a run could go. It also means that if you're trying to progress further in the game and you take any damage early, you're just wasting your time if you don't restart.\n\nOne of the biggest downsides is movement. Every enemy in Isaac has carefully designed movement, and a huge aspect of the game is learning how to manipulate the movement of multiple types of enemies at once so you can be aggressive but safe. In this game, that's pretty much entirely replaced by just running in circles, using dodge iframes to go through waves of crap and pressing a miracle button if you ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\nThere are some nice things (you can teleport to cleared rooms, although stupidly only certain ones), but on the whole where Isaac was a game that made me want to get better at it, this is a game that makes me just want to get it over with and never play it again.","April 23","false","31.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

A hyped game, smart developers, big youtuber coverage, a very promising concept, a fantastic artstyle, extremely varied and skill-based gameplay, roguelite permadeath with long-time unlocks... this could've been my dream game. This SHOULD'VE been my dream game. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver.\n\nSo, you might as yourself, why is it, that this game got a negative review from someone who clearly loves everything about it? Well, as i said, this game has\n\nA fantastic Artstyle\npinpoint-perfect music\nAwesome boss designs\nPuns out the wazzoo\nCute little bullet enemies who shoot bullets from guns that match their own bullet's design\nFast-paced, skill-based combat\nAn insane amount of weapons\nActual story branches, in a roguelite game\nMulti-run Objectives, a sense of progression.\n\nWell then, why do i dislike it? Is it resource-crunching RNG fueling the salty player? Not exactly. Unfortunately you pretty much only get resources for clearing rooms if you don't get hit whatsoever. Streaking multiple rooms without being hit will give you better and better drops, primarily in the form of currency, but eventually even rare picksups like Health, Armor, Blanks, Keys and Ammo. If you get hit a lot, you can become resource-starved rather quickly. But it's not the unforgiving nature of the game that i'm disappointed in.\n\nIt's the glitches. This game has an inexplicably high number of ways for you to get locked down or killed by glitching enemy bullets to stick to you until your health has completely ticked down, freezeing your character until you've died, respawning you over a falling pit repeatedly until you're dead, and numerous other ways to instantly kill your run that you've been building for 40+ minutes. Compared to a game like Isaac, the successfull runs in this game can take quite a while to get through. And at some point almost every successfull run seems to get smashed by a glitch, or at least severely hindered.\n\nIn my 47 runs of Gungeon i've managed to get rather deep into the game 11 times, and 10 of those runs were ended by a deadlock glitch or bug causing me to take 4+ hits worth of damage. That's an UNACCEPTABLE ratio. Of the runs that made it past the third level, a breathtaking 80% (8/10) ended by my character freezing up or dieing from endless respawning over a bottomless pit (falling into one only does half a heart of damage´by the way).\n\nI'm sorry, but if i spend 40+ minutes on building a successfull run, taking on bosses, beating them perfectly (which is the ONLY reliable way to unlock the equivalent of health-ups in this game) i can't accept my runs being ended by me freezing up in a corner until a lowly shotgun enemy has painfully slowly finished me off while im screaming at my monitor and punching holes in my door (yes, there's now a hole in my door because of a glitched run)\n\nDo yourself a favor, and come back to this game after it's fixed. For now, while it looks great, it will frustrate the hell out of you by ending your best runs not on the account of you making mistakes, but simply the game messing up.\n\nAgain, without these consistent glitches, this would be an amazing game, and a definite MUST OWN for anyone who has the faintest interest in the roguelite genre. But in it's current state, i can only urge you to stay away for the sake of your hardware and patience.","May 7","false","13.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","2"

Building up to a good run is a matter of 5-6 minutes in nuclear throne, building up a good run in THIS game is a very slow\tedious process of reloading\room clearing.  I'll say it again - not a bad game, but not a particularily rewarding game - the guns are more or\nless all "samey" and often they are too weak to really make a big difference a lot of the time.  That's not to say there isn't good guns, it's just that I can't stand the reloading\fighting thru the early stages to see if you can get a good run going only to realize that the shops are overpriced, you never have enough keys, the guys you get are ♥♥♥♥, and it takes too long to die only to have to start over and do it all again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 7","false","8.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","1"

If i don't see the enemy, he better not see me either. I hate Dodge Rolling a lot for this reason. Every time there is an enemy off screen, I'm gonna roll into his shots.\n\nalso RNG is a bit wonky. I can be fighting hoards of enemies and not find a single new gun before the boss, and the next attempt i'm barely even fighting 1 or 2 enemies per room and i find several weapons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aegeri/recommended/311690/","aegeri","Aegeri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aegeri/","110 products in account","Enter the Gungeon is a really good roguelite game, which combines some of the best elements of Binding of Isaac but with a more appealing overall wrapper - for those who didn't like the gross out humor/theme of Isaac especially. Each floor is generated procedurally, filled with various enemies and there are an absolute tons of secrets to find in this game. Even after 30+ hours now, I'm still finding all kinds of fascinating and interesting things just about every time I've played the game. Additionally, the developers have proven especially considerate of players requests and complaints, having already patched the game in only a handful of days since it was released.\n\nAside from the appealing aesthetic and active developers, Gungeon is just an excellent game rewarding skill and playing well, most notably by avoiding the copious amounts of projectiles bosses' produce to gain more HP. Lower floors equally become covered in enemy firepower and surviving them becomes a significant challenge, but all of this is nicely balanced with a huge arsenal of often extremely fun to use guns. Gungeon is filled with plenty of unique and some overall incredibly silly guns to pick up, like the lightgun from duckhunt (complete with homing duck) and many items have entertaining lore entries to boot (but the only real way to determine how they work is to shoot with them). Everything in the game, as the name would suggest, is also a variant of a gun-pun in some way, like "Beholster" or my favourite "Ammoconda".\n\nAnother thing to mention is that the game does have a co-op mode but it's implemented in a counter intuitive way. Firstly, there's no actual online co-op available and instead it's all couch/same computer coop. The coop partner is also a specific character, who you sadly are unable to play with solo in the main game without particular effort. The camera in coop, because it's the same screen, can cause quite a number of issues as well. Otherwise the coop works fairly well and if that's something you want (and you have two controllers or a controller/keyboard set up) it's worth trying.\n\nOverall this is a highly playable, fun and engaging roguelite with finely tuned combat mechanics. If I had a complaint, it was that the drop rates for things like keys and initial guns felt somewhat stingy, but this has already been addressed by the developers as of this review. One flaw I do find in this game and it's disappointing that it's not in the game, is that there is no Daily Gungeon or similar concept. If there is one thing I'd like to see added it's that Binding of Isaac, Spelunky and similar game competitive daily with friends.Hopefully that's something the developers are planning down the line, but I have absolutely no problem recommending this game right now.","April 11","true","59.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raguuuuuuuuu/recommended/311690/","raguuuuuuuuu","Charmuro Zey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raguuuuuuuuu/","467 products in account","I'd like to start by saying that I really like Enter the Gungeon. I like games that take dungeon-crawling cues from Rogue/Nethack/Crawl. I like wonderful pattern shooters. I like games that try to blend two distinct and separate genres together. I adore Enter the Gungeon's conceit that everything is a gun. The art and soundtrack are pixel-perfect.\n\nEverything should add up for me to unhesitatingly reccomend this game, right? Well, I can't reccomend it. Not without caveats, exceptions, and a whole bunch of footnotes. Fundamentally, Enter the Gungeon just . . . doesn't come together.\n\nIt doesn't really understand roguelikes, because it's stingy as hell with its random loot. To head off a particularly imbicilic strain of "shut up don't complain about this game I like" that I've seen, it's not about "resource management"—the notion that Enter the Gungeon has resource management as an important part of the game, given the very limited number of resource pools is hysterical to a veteran of actual dungeon crawlers like myself—it's about rolling the loot die. It's about making informed decisions based on chance to survive an otherwise unwinnable encounter. It's about girding your loins until you hit 20+ AC and acquiring all the parts of your ascension kit—or in non-Nethack terms, setting yourself up for a win.\n\nIt doesn't really understand bullet hell games either. Well, it seems like it takes cues from Cave shooters at times, but the bosses—the meat and potatoes of any real curtain fire game—are the exact opposite of what curtain fire bosses are. You better pray that despite the game's hatred of giving you items you found some good guns, or you're in for a supremely tedious fight because bosses have—maybe—five different attack patterns per boss. That they mostly randomly select from at the end of a pattern.\n\nBoss fights consist of the following: you circlestrafe/kite/dodge around a dude for five (or more) minutes while he does the same series of attacks over and over and over because the developer appears to have mistaken tedium for difficulty. Which is really strange given the preponderance of teleporters, to the point where I can't help but wonder why the developer didn't just add in the ability to teleport to any cleared room when out of combat. I mean sure, there are some dangeorus trap rooms but making players do it more than once is just padding.\n\nPlus it does the whole "metagame unlocks" thing. Yeugh.\n\nUltimately, it all adds up to similar problems I have with The Binding of Issac: The game isn't crawl-y enough, danmaku-y enough and a strong showing from the aesthetic and audio design isn't really enough to salvage the gameplay.\n\n\nSummary: Enter the Gungeon blends an utterly fantastic concept, wonderful visual and audio design, and a complete inability to commit to and develop a consistently fun gameplay formula.\n\nReccomended for: People who really liked The Binding of Issac, Fans of dive rolls (dive rolls rule), Individuals who think Painkiller should have done a better job hiding its secrets\n\nNot Reccomended for: Hardcore dungeon crawlers, Touhou lunatics, People who think the word "Gundead" isn't a reason to insta-buy a game (it totally is you squares)\n\n\naddn: The game doesn't have quicksaves at the time of this review. The developer has promised that they're working on it, but for now you can't leave a current run except through either quitting, dying, or winning. This omission was a massive oversight!","May 12","false","6.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","5"

More specifically, it has too much RNG that the player can do nothing to compensate for. I am not a RNG-o-phobe - I think some amount of randomness is good, even essential, to a Roguelike - but the player should be able to react to the random roll of dice in a way to mitigate the randomness. Success relies too much on getting good rolls on stuff you can't influence. For instance, to get a good gun, you must\n- get a key\n- find a chest room\n- hope a good quality chest spawns\n- hope that it spawns a gun (rather than an active or passive item)\n- hope that it spawns a good quality gun out of the bajillions that can spawn\nOut of all those steps, only one can be influenced by the player i.e. you can buy a key from a shopkeeper that appears every level. Even that, though, is RNGy; sometimes you will kill 15 enemies in a room and get a paltry amount of money because money drops are influenced by RNG. Health and ammo drops are also wildly variable. I have had runs where three ammo boxes dropped on the first level and zero for the rest of the game. Bosses, too, are extremely variable in difficulty - the second level bosses range in difficulty from "easier than any of the first level bosses" i.e. the Gorgun to "harder than many of the third level bosses" i.e. the Ammoconda.\n\nAll the variance pushes you to try to subsist on as little as possible, relying on the inifinite ammo starter pistol and the dodge roll to survive. This feels contrary to the concept of the game. It's a GUNgeon, there's literally hundreds of guns in the game, almost every enemy is gun or bullet themed... why is this game so damn stingy with the guns?! It feels like someone intentionally sucked the fun out like it was a Free to Play game.\n\nThe game is also too long, or rather, it's too long for a game that's this heavily influenced by RNG. At about 10 minutes per level and the basic game being five levels long, it takes generally 20 to 30 minutes to really be sure whether you've actually got a shot at winning or you're just circling the drain. I ain't got time for that.\n\nThe game plenty of charm, but even that wears thin after a while. Enter the Gungeon is filled with references to other games and fiction which is initially entertaining but it starts to feel like they couldn't come up with original characters.

I knew it was going to be a rogue-like game and hey, it was fun for the first couple runs...\nBut after I played as all the characters I realized that all of them literally are the same character... What I mean by this is that they all play the same, have the same health (Except for the Soldier) same speed, almost the same frikking starting weapon, and the only difference is that they hold a certain amount of ammo before you have to reload, so to me, if you really want a great start... Just pick the soldier, hes the best.\nAnyways, This game's dodge roll mechanic is frikking buggy as heck, I dodge into a bullet which the game wants you to do, and you just take the stupid damage.\nI also don't like that it's a bullet hell game... I mean I thought I could handle it because of Undertale, but nope, this game is like the Omega Flowey fight x100.\nIt's unforgiving, red bullets (Hearts) rarely drop, keys rarely drop...

Small details like the reloading animations and scenery show that this game was made with alot of heart. If you enjoy bullet hell, rogue-lite, difficult shoooting games with a variety of enemies and weapons, then pick this game up as it will probably be for you.\n\nPros\nVariety of weapons\nVariety of enemies\nDifficulty Based on skill\nFilled with small details\nWell designed floors\nGood set of characters\n\nCons\nMost runs can be completely based on RNG (Luck)\nThe inability to drop your starting gun gets annoying fast\nIn some rooms enemies can combo thier attacks in sync making them impossible to dodge\nButton mapping is a little annoying but can be changed and is mostly personal preference\n\nConsidering this game? Honestly I have sunk 100+ hours into Nuclear Throne and Binding Of Isaac so I have alot of experience with this type of game. You can tell the devs had passion, this game is very well made and looks amazing whilst in a pixel form and the guns are something that really defines this game which should tell you enough. So yea, you should pick this game up for defonate.\n\nAnd I will always roll through doors...\n","April 5","true","22.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

What i dislike the most is the fact that every little thing you can get is random: the amount of coins to buy stuff from the shop, the things sold in the shop etc. This would not be a problem if every weapon or perk would be good but a lot of them are just "fun" and don't actually help you complete the gungeon.\n\nIn the end the game is not that big of an investment in money so I guess for some hours to lose in it is alright.

Overall I agree with every other review in terms of positive aspects for the game.\nSo why am I rating bad? Because at the moment in which I'm writing this review, the game is heavily unbalanced:\n\n-The amount of useless items is really too high (there are also useless weapons, but at least you can concretely see them, while most of the items are just boring, unnoticeable and useless), a solution could be if every of this useless items would at least increases a noticeble stat of the player, that would be really better.\n\n-Items drop occurs too rarely. Keys and money drop rate is kind of fine while hearth and ammos drop rate is too rare, random and heavily unbalanced in many runs (I often have runs where in second floor I recieve an ammo box every room, and then I just won't have ammo for the remaining of the run). I'm not saying that every room cleared should drop a hearth, I'm just saying that atm the game punishes you too hard if u just got hit once (expecially on 4th-5th floor). The same reasoning is applied for ammos; Jesus Christ, is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons game, I don't want to be forced to use my primary gun for 3 floors in order to not waste ammos of powerful weapons, I want to use those weapons and to have fun.\n\n- Boss fghts are too long. I'm not complaining about the difficult of boss's patterns, which are fine and really cool, with a perfectly shaped challenge curve. What I mean is that bosses have too many HPs. This forces you to undertake a long and often boring boss fight in which you see the same bullet's patterns too many times to be funny and not frustrating. A simple solution would be reducing the amount of boss's HP of a 15-20%.\n\n- The chances of having an OP run are too low. I'm not saying that every run, you have to be a god that enters a room and annihilates every living form in it, I'm just saying that having an OP run once in a while, is a really funny thing that can stimulates you in playing another time with the hope of: "Maybe I will have an OP run this time!". I'm not a pro player, after 60 hours of game I beat the High Dragun 3 times and I killed only a past, but in 90 runs I had only 3 OP runs (those with whom I beat the Dragon tho :3 ), and I think that 3/90 is not a funny score for this.","April 27","false","100.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Bosses are somewhat better, but rooms are incredibly boring and you are forced to go through all of those to collect chests.\n\nAnd taking shortcuts currently locks you out of item progression meaning that everyone who wants to have full potential has to start from lvl 1.\n\nThis is my main complaint. Ammo requirements and game being incredibly stingy with ammo drops make first levels a bore and those first levels are a necessity for a successful run.","May 2","false","54.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I'm glad you asked, mommy's favorite little disappointment. It's quite simple: The Guns, The Stage Variety, The Bosses, The Lore, The Enemies...Well yeah that's most of it I guess so let's get a little in depth.\n\nThe Guns: Well you start with a decent little pistol with infinite ammo. When you're in the chambers (The Gungeon) You'll come across chests that require keys. Some of said chests contain guns. A TON of guns that all work very differently and have special little charm to them where you'll either love the gun to death or you'll hate it. It's up to you. Now I've got an OK amount of hours (I mean I think I do I dunno...) put in and I've yet to find even half of the guns. And mind you you'll actually be adding guns into the Gungeon from "special" shopkeepers by ordering them.\nThe Guns TL;DR: You get a good pistol, and you'll find a lot of guns in chests.\n\nThe Stage Variety: Oh boy where to begin...so basically the game is always randomly generated so every run you do will different from the last. Each chamber is pretty big so there's always plenty to explore. You're given a radar so if you think you've missed anything don't worry you're covered it'll tell you pretty much everything (which rooms you've been in and haven't been in) and such). There's also parts that require some platforming...nothing to write home about, but hey it's there I guess.\nThe Stage Variety TL;DR: Randomly generated levels, you get a cool radar and there's basic platforming.\n\nThe Bosses: Ah yes...the bosses...they're hard if you've got poop-tier guns (and yeah you'll get a few poo poo-tier guns). The bosses themselves have lots of charm to them, You'll be fighting a bird that has a musclear human's body that's carrying a gattling gun to fighting two giant bullet twins. They're all very difficult and have some sort of special move aside from well y'know shooting.\nThe Bosses TL;DR: They're all 10/10\n\nThe Lore: Okay this game has some really fun lore. All those tons and tons of guns you find in the game? They all have a story. Some a little deeper than others, but lore is lore at the end of the day. It's nothing crazy, but they might give you a light chuckle or two or intrigue you. Even the enemies have some affiliation with why the Gungeon is the way it is so you'll learn more as you face different enemies.\nThe Lore TL;DR: The guns and bad guys got stories.\n\nThe Enemies: Okay there are a lot of enemies ranging from cute little bullets to slime monsters, to giant knights. Each enemy needing to be taken on a certain way and will attack you in a unique way. Learning every enemy is HIGHLY essential in this game if you want to progress.\nThe Enemies TL;DR: There's a lot of them and they will most definitely ♥♥♥♥ you up.\n\nWell there you have it it's a great game and I highly recommend this to any dungeon crawler...or anyone that just likes guns really.","April 5","true","78.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It doesn't feel perfected or balanced the same way Isaac or Nuclear Throne does. It will take you a few minutes to finally open a chest and then you get an unfinished gun. Or something that causes enemies to freeze when you use your blanks. If you actually find a good weapon, you will run out of ammo in a few minutes because of the lack of ammo drops. Then, you will resort to your infinite ammo pistol which is useless against enemies, the easiest enemy (bullet-kin) takes almost half a clip to kill on the first level with the marine pistol. The next level, a half clip. Then 5 bullets. 6. 7. It gets to a point where you find yourself wasting multiple clips on swarm enemies.\n\nDon't buy this game.","April 19","false","26.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That said let me get into the real review.\n\nPros:\n\nI've never really played a bullet hell game like this, it's like a mixture of the Binding of Issac, and eXceed. That is a good thing.\n\nThe items are there to help lift some stress from the player, but ultimately it comes down to personal skill and a little bit of luck to win.\n\nGuns are varied and offer each new playthrough the variety you want to keep it interesting.\n\nActive and passive items are useful, but not to the point they carry a run. One in particular, a ring that makes you intangible, is as close to overpowered as it will really get. It makes you immune to damage for several seconds but, has a cooldown.\n\nThe games is comically fun despite its difficulty, enemies are very silly (a shotgun shell with a shotgun, and pistol round with a pistol/SMG) and quite amusing.\n\nProgress is very satisfying, you always feel like you're going somewhere, even when you're just exploring the floor after killing a boss.\n\nCons:\n\nThis. Game. Is. HARD. Bosses after floor 2 spike in difficulty to a staggering level, and for someone who has been playing Bullet Hell games since 2003 this is saying something. The only thing that comes CLOSE in difficulty is Ikaruga. Even still, I think this game is harder.\n\nI have noticed the room variations are somewhat limited, I've run into one room configuration in particular about 4 times now, and each time the enemy spawns were exactly the same.\n\nUnlocking the extras in this game is comically hard. There are two unlockable characters, to get them you need to preform such ultra specific (most of them tied to RNG) tasks it's kind of infuriating. And that's just what I know of, there are actually MORE things to unlock I've yet to learn about.\n\nHealth and money drops are inconsistent beyond belief. I had a run where I got upwards of 5 health drops on the first floor, but less then 10 bullets to spend in the shop. The very next run I had nearly 40 bullets, but got no health. It's somewhat frustrating.\n\nThe shopkeeper is incredibly easy to make angry, shooting in his store makes him angry, and he will warn you, Angering him will lead to your death. This is not a joke.  He will kill you.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nI quite like this game, but this is not a game for everyone. The difficulty past floor 2 is staggering, and will turn away many people looking to play casually. I'm only really giving the game a recommendation because I love it so much. If you're quick to anger and become frustrated by losing, this game is not for you. You will die, and you will lose. A lot.","April 11","true","27.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm glad you asked, mommy's favorite little disappointment. It's quite simple: The Guns, The Stage Variety, The Bosses, The Lore, The Enemies...Well yeah that's most of it I guess so let's get a little in depth.\n\nThe Guns: Well you start with a decent little pistol with infinite ammo. When you're in the chambers (The Gungeon) You'll come across chests that require keys. Some of said chests contain guns. A TON of guns that all work very differently and have special little charm to them where you'll either love the gun to death or you'll hate it. It's up to you. Now I've got an OK amount of hours (I mean I think I do I dunno...) put in and I've yet to find even half of the guns. And mind you you'll actually be adding guns into the Gungeon from "special" shopkeepers by ordering them.\nThe Guns TL;DR: You get a good pistol, and you'll find a lot of guns in chests.\n\nThe Stage Variety: Oh boy where to begin...so basically the game is always randomly generated so every run you do will different from the last. Each chamber is pretty big so there's always plenty to explore. You're given a radar so if you think you've missed anything don't worry you're covered it'll tell you pretty much everything (which rooms you've been in and haven't been in) and such). There's also parts that require some platforming...nothing to write home about, but hey it's there I guess.\nThe Stage Variety TL;DR: Randomly generated levels, you get a cool radar and there's basic platforming.\n\nThe Bosses: Ah yes...the bosses...they're hard if you've got poop-tier guns (and yeah you'll get a few poo poo-tier guns). The bosses themselves have lots of charm to them, You'll be fighting a bird that has a musclear human's body that's carrying a gattling gun to fighting two giant bullet twins. They're all very difficult and have some sort of special move aside from well y'know shooting.\nThe Bosses TL;DR: They're all 10/10\n\nThe Lore: Okay this game has some really fun lore. All those tons and tons of guns you find in the game? They all have a story. Some a little deeper than others, but lore is lore at the end of the day. It's nothing crazy, but they might give you a light chuckle or two or intrigue you. Even the enemies have some affiliation with why the Gungeon is the way it is so you'll learn more as you face different enemies.\nThe Lore TL;DR: The guns and bad guys got stories.\n\nThe Enemies: Okay there are a lot of enemies ranging from cute little bullets to slime monsters, to giant knights. Each enemy needing to be taken on a certain way and will attack you in a unique way. Learning every enemy is HIGHLY essential in this game if you want to progress.\nThe Enemies TL;DR: There's a lot of them and they will most definitely ♥♥♥♥ you up.\n\nWell there you have it it's a great game and I highly recommend this to any dungeon crawler...or anyone that just likes guns really.","April 5","true","78.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Enter the Gungeon is basically Nuclear Throne with binding of isaac-like dungeons. It is by far the most beautiful rogue-like I have encountered to date, with good design seen throughout every element of the game. ETD alo has the most interactive environment of any RL Ive seen, however for all the destructable objects and enemies you kill, there is very little reward. Objects render nothing ever that I have seen, and enemies only drop coin/bullets. This and a somewhat narrow spectrum of upgrades modifiers (outside of weapons/health/shield etc) make the game feel like it just needs a little bit more love and it could be possibly my favorite RL to date. The game is definitely worthy of your library if you're a RL fan, but I hope to see a little more upgrade and interaction expansion in the future so I can give the game a 5/5.","April 5","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nothing that you have to go literally turn off, but it often doesn't add a lot to the game like great music can (Necrodancer comes to mind, though that game literally revolves around its music so that's a bit of an unfair comparison).\n\nOverall amazing.

Quite challenging, it demands quick reflexes and on-the-fly strategic thinking. It gives you plenty of tools to deal with all of the challenges it throws at you though, so you never feel like taking damage or losing was unfair. A standard modern roguelike system lets you spend currency collected during each attempt at beating the Gungeon to unlock equipment and give a sense of progression. An easy recommendation for such a low price.\n\nPros:\nFast-paced, smooth gameplay\nQuite challenging/rewarding\nGreat soundtrack and effects\nLovable, effective art style\nTons of guns and items\nVery inexpensive; worth $20 easy!\nLots of replayability\nCo-op!

The odds of getting synergistic passives is extremely low.  You don't get as many passive item chances in this game as you would in something like Isaac.\n\nThe main reason for this is due to the sheer amount of gun variety there is.  You need to not only get a good passive (which is rare), but you need to have a weapon that can actually make decent use out of it.  I am sure if you play for days on end, you will occasionally get that run that makes you feel overpowered, but in the end this game is 90% skill.  Do not waste your time restarting runs if you don't get anything good, because you will find yourself restarting for hours.. Just play the game and enjoy the challenge.\n\nIn short;  This game is very hard, has a unique style, feels very high quality with animations for virtually everything, and has a massive amount of gun variety.  Only real down side would be the lack of passives per average run.\n\n","April 6","true","41.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It features tons of guns, passive, and active items. Has a great soundtrack. It is a very difficult game which unlike other hard games it doesn't make me frusterated.

I personaly love the feel of it. Be warned IT IS DIFFICULT you will die a lot.  The guns are plentyful and it feels great when you pick up a new one. Some are pretty terrible and some are amazing. There seem to be lots of secrets to unlock and challanges to do. The bosses can be insane but with practice mastery is attainable. My only sadness with the game is the lack of unlockable characters as there are only 2. I was hoping there were many more like in the Binding Of Issac. I hope they add new characters and chambers in an update or DLC. The co-op mode is fun but still super hard. If you enjoy games like the Binding Of Issac and want something new to master this is the game for you. As I said before the game has a dark souls level of difficulty, know this and get gud.","April 7","true","28.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its only local co-op!!! ... you give us a myriad of characters to use, and only give you the ability to play locally with one other person. This means they are stuck with the one character that you can use for the local co-op. Meaning the other characters are more or less unused in the game unless you select another. That to me hits a brick wall. This bullet hell game is a great game, even in the small amount of time I played it so far, which is less than an hour and a half, I can thourally say I already enjoy the game immensely. I am disappointed at the lack of online co-op. A game like this shouldn't be that hard to implement online co-op, especially since you already have the ability to play local co-op.

The balancing, the different types of weapons, the interesting and diverse bosses and enemies, the quirky humor, the excellent style and art; this game glows with personality. It has a progressive unlock system, store keepers to rescue for your hub (called the Breach), and interesting, unique and hilarious weapons. I've been playing local co-op with my brother and we've been entranced up to this point.\n\nI will say that it's not perfect: the controls are a bit wonky at first and the co-op system forces the second player to play as the "wizard" character, preventing him or her from trying one of the other characters that player one can choose from. That decision is completely bewildering, as is the requirement to talk to the wizard to even initiate co-op, instead of just having the second player press a button on the keyboard or controller (or even having an option for co-op on the main menu). But those are pretty much my only gripes.\n\nIf you like Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, Nuclear Throne or pretty much any casual rogue-lite, or intense action game, you'll likely have a good time playing Enter the Gungeon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/argotto/recommended/311690/","argotto","Bob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/argotto/","145 products in account","Game is great and worth the money they are asking for it, but if you are looking something that gives you a good chance to feel powerful over time (like most other games of the genre), then you will be a bit disappointed.  The odds of getting synergistic passives is extremely low.  You don't get as many passive item chances in this game as you would in something like Isaac.\n\nThe main reason for this is due to the sheer amount of gun variety there is.  You need to not only get a good passive (which is rare), but you need to have a weapon that can actually make decent use out of it.  I am sure if you play for days on end, you will occasionally get that run that makes you feel overpowered, but in the end this game is 90% skill.  Do not waste your time restarting runs if you don't get anything good, because you will find yourself restarting for hours.. Just play the game and enjoy the challenge.\n\nIn short;  This game is very hard, has a unique style, feels very high quality with animations for virtually everything, and has a massive amount of gun variety.  Only real down side would be the lack of passives per average run.\n\n","April 6","true","41.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The balancing, the different types of weapons, the interesting and diverse bosses and enemies, the quirky humor, the excellent style and art; this game glows with personality. It has a progressive unlock system, store keepers to rescue for your hub (called the Breach), and interesting, unique and hilarious weapons. I've been playing local co-op with my brother and we've been entranced up to this point.\n\nI will say that it's not perfect: the controls are a bit wonky at first and the co-op system forces the second player to play as the "wizard" character, preventing him or her from trying one of the other characters that player one can choose from. That decision is completely bewildering, as is the requirement to talk to the wizard to even initiate co-op, instead of just having the second player press a button on the keyboard or controller (or even having an option for co-op on the main menu). But those are pretty much my only gripes.\n\nIf you like Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, Nuclear Throne or pretty much any casual rogue-lite, or intense action game, you'll likely have a good time playing Enter the Gungeon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/argotto/recommended/311690/","argotto","Bob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/argotto/","145 products in account","Game is great and worth the money they are asking for it, but if you are looking something that gives you a good chance to feel powerful over time (like most other games of the genre), then you will be a bit disappointed.  The odds of getting synergistic passives is extremely low.  You don't get as many passive item chances in this game as you would in something like Isaac.\n\nThe main reason for this is due to the sheer amount of gun variety there is.  You need to not only get a good passive (which is rare), but you need to have a weapon that can actually make decent use out of it.  I am sure if you play for days on end, you will occasionally get that run that makes you feel overpowered, but in the end this game is 90% skill.  Do not waste your time restarting runs if you don't get anything good, because you will find yourself restarting for hours.. Just play the game and enjoy the challenge.\n\nIn short;  This game is very hard, has a unique style, feels very high quality with animations for virtually everything, and has a massive amount of gun variety.  Only real down side would be the lack of passives per average run.\n\n","April 6","true","41.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This baby has all the makings of a great game. If you like Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne it seems silly to not give this a try. It also improves on the formula of those games with better graphics and, in my opinion, better design. Plus, it's got tons of replay value, considering the huge amount of guns and collectibles waiting to be found in the Gungeon.\n\nIt's also quite difficult which will please those who like that sort of thing. There is no form of health regeneration between floors or after boss fights. The only way to replenish health is from rare health drops or buy paying large sums of money for hearts/half hearts at the shop. It's also permadeath, obviously, which adds to the tension, forcing you to be very careful with your health.\n\nAnother feature that spices up the game is the inclusion of four characters to play as (as well as 2 "secret" characters). Each character has a unique "active" item and "passive" item. Active items being ones that you can use at any time to directly influence battle, and passive items being ones that influence battle in the background (like stat boosts). This further adds to the replay value and also allows you to pick a character that suits your playstyle the best.\n\nThe attention to detail is also quite impressive. Every enemy, when defeated has their own death animation, the simpler ones falling to the ground and fading into the background, and the more difficult/interesting ones having spectacular finishing attacks or animations to accompany their deaths. You can also interact with most objects lying around the rooms of each floor. Plus, some objects can even be used in battle. For example, as I'm sure most people have already seen from the trailer, you can flip over tables as cover. This technique is actually more useful than it looks and you may just need it when you find yourself in an empty room with no barriers to hide behind. There are also explosive barrels that you can push into enemies as well as shoot. The detail is outstanding and really adds to the atmosphere.\n\nWith all that said, bear in mind that the game is not without it's flaws. On an average laptop, the sheer amount of bullets in some of the bossfights and enemy-filled rooms will cause lag. This is to be expected but I feel that it's an important thing to note for any laptop-only players. Also, at times it does feel like the controls can be a bit unresponsive which, in the thick of battle can cause major trouble. However, the biggest issue, in my opinion, is the lack of online co-op. This definitely limits overall replayability and is feature that I feel most games of this sort should have. While local multiplayer is included, unless you have a bunch of friends within driving distance who have the time to come over to your house (or you to theirs) every time you want to play the game, I doubt you will get much use out of it. I find it an unfortunate issue with the game that I really hope they fix in the future.\n\nOverall, however, this game is amazingly fun and is worth the $15.00 for sure!\n\nPros:\n\n- Great graphics\n- Amazing attention to detail\n- Tons of replay value\n- Inuitive design\n- Serious challenge\n- A good amount of characters\n\nCons:\n\n- Mild lag on the average laptop in certain bossfights\n- Sometimes controls can be slightly unresponsive\n- Lack of online co-op","April 5","true","32.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The difficulty is just right and not overbearingly annoying like some rogue-like titles.\n\nI'm a huge fan of well-done pixel art, and this game nails down it's own style very well. The music is aptly chaotic and up-beat, and the sound design of the game in general is top-notch.\n\nMechanic-wise, the game functions like other bullet hell games but with the added depth of rogue-like RPG progression as you find new equipment through the levels of the 'Gungeon'. The added ability of a dodge roll is extremely helpful, making certain situations that are undodgeable through other means easier to navigate through.\n\nThere seems to be a myriad of weapons to discover and I'm not very far in at this point, but so far the weapons I haave found seem very intersting and diverse. This is probably one of the best parts of this game, finding ways to strategize your weapons and character as you find passive upgrades and new guns through the lower levels of the Gungeon.\n\nIf you are a fan of rogue-likes in general, I suggest this game for you. Even if you haven't ever been interested in rogue-likes, but enjoy top-down shooters, ARPGS, or other bullet hell games, then I suggest this game for you.\n","April 5","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are loads of passive and active items, and many many fun and unique great guns and great puns about said guns. EVERYTHING IS ABOUT GUNS.\n\nI played alot of The Binding of Isaac, and Im liking this game more so. Think of it as a step up for more experienced players. It feels alot smoother and less repetitive, which is a huge deal for a top-view dungeon game.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this game is that you can jump between areas already explored very quickly, so the gameplay is almost always action-packed. Ive heard complaints about the dodge roll. Why? It's a great mechanic that adds a twist to develop your skill. But now that I've explained why I recommend this game, here are the reasons why people don't:\n\n***BAD***\n\nThese are the cons of Enter the Gungeon, excluding the difficulty level that I already covered. There are passive and active upgrades to improve your damage, mobility, etc in very creative and enjoyable ways, but they aren't going to carry you. You have to rely on the third type of item, the guns. The problem is, they won't stack and keep improving on each other. They will just all be available for you to use if you have picked them up in the current run, assuming you have ammo to spare. The ammo isn't nearly as scarce as it was in the past, but you will still find yourself having to use your starter gun from time to time. This con, combined with the fact that the bosses have a huge HP pool, makes for a noteworthy flaw.\n\nIf you aren't willing to be patient in developing skill and learning enemies' and bosses' attack patterns, this game isn't for you. And even if you are, you will still find boss fights to be tedious at times. But when you develop skill to gain a flawless victory against bosses, it is quite satisfying.\n\n***In conclusion, buy this game. It's absolutely worth the price***","May 21","true","56.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

With The Binding of Isaac being on top for so long, one has to wonder: will it ever be dethroned? If you're expecting Enter the Gungeon (EtG) to do that, you're going to be disappointed. That doesn't mean EtG is a bad game, however.\n\nHaving spent a decent amount of time, lets get into the meat of this title.\n\nQuick look\n\nPros        Cons                Art design        Significantly difficult for the uninitiated                Soundtrack        Unbalanced where item drops are concerned                Gameplay mechanics        Too many useless items\nEtG fully embraces the bullet-hell school of gameplay. Enemies, bosses more so, fill the screen with projectiles in an attempt to murder you, and it's delightfully fun. It's also significantly difficult if you have little or no experience with bullet-hell games. The learning curve is steep, far more difficult than The Binding of Isaac, and many players (citing the steam forum for the game) are having a difficult time processing that.\n\nEtG is hardly the game for casual players. That being said, if you do enjoy bullet-hell games, and rogue-lites, this is a solid mix of the two. Mechanically, the game is very responsive. Firing and dodging are as fluid as it's going to get for a top down twin stick shooter. Weapon and Item variety is high, however, this is one area where the game also manages to fall somewhat flat: majority of the items in the game are outright awful.\n\nVery few of the weapons truly feel rewarding, and while it is possible to accumulate a decent quantity of weaponry, many of them are pitiful at best and offer the game's easiest discernible weakness. There are few, if any, item synergies. Passive items generally fall into the useless stack, minus a few. In this type of game, the mixture of good and bad items is key.\n\nThat being said, the items that are good leave a solid footprint on your run. The good items feel fantastic to use, and definitely ease new players into the game. Level design is also a bonus: environments are destructible, have a lot of variety, and aren't overly convoluted. Secret chambers (and how they are dealt with) are also enjoyable. The soundtrack works well with the visual design and the effects are easy to discern from enemy fire.\n\nUnfortunately, the glaring issues (balance, inconsistency with items, buggy features) keep this game from being a homerun. Buyer beware: if you are looking for an casual game, this is not it.\n\nReviewer statistics:\n\nCompletely beat the game\nMost of the achievments\nBeat all of the secret content\nFinal score:\n\n7        10","April 10","true","42.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
