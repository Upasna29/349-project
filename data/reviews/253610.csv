Takes all the good stuff from the classics of the mid 90s and adds a few things; some good, some bad.\n\nGOOD\nFast paced movement. This is not a console FPS made for controllers.\nNice music and sfx, very reminiscent of Doom.\nMap design (while not perfect) is good, levels are fun to explore with tons of secrets to find.\nLots of bosses, almost one per level. Each boss has different attack patterns.\nInteresting graphics. You wouldn't get the feel of the old classics with a realistic style, so the cell shaded graphics are a nice solution.\nHigh replayability thanks to speedrun and score attack modes. Also there's a map editor and workshop tools.\nChain combos. This is what makes the score attack mode very interesting. I was a bit skeptical when I heard Wrack had a combo system, but it actually works. Basically by chaining each kill fast after the previous kill we will get a combo bar to boost our points and if we get it high enough it allows for a finisher: a more powerful attack for whatever weapon we are using.\nBAD\nNeeds more weapon variety. It has the core stuff every game should have (mele, pistol, shotgun, machine gun and rocket launcher) but other classics are missing, like the grenade launcher or the railgun... and where are the crazy weapons? where's the BFG?\nWAY TOO MANY instant death hazards. In Doom lava pools didn't kill you instantly, most of the times you could get out alive, and walls crushing you was a rare occurrence. In Wrack there are a lot of instant death lava/elecricity pits, crushing walls and the worst offender: spiked balls around some corridors and rooms. In a game were you want to move fast all over the place, that ISN'T FUN.\nLoading levels is very slow (20-25 seconds) and I had to disable some graphic options for the game to run as smoothly as it should. Game could use some extra optimization.\nMinor stability problems. Maybe it's just me, but when loading a save on the last two levels of the game (7 and 8) some times the game crashed. Always happened while loading a game so in the end it's just a minor inconvenience.\nSingle slot save system. Is this PC gaming or what? Come on....\nShort. Official content is just 1 episode (8+1 levels) and the user generated content in the workshop is not a lot. I get this is not a big studio, but in my opinion the game should have more content (levels, weapons, enemies...).\nWould I recommend it? Yes, totally. It may have some flaws but most of them are minor stuff. Game is very enjoyable and worth every cent.","January 24, 2015","true","7.6"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","39","43","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/devonshiremasterrace/recommended/253610/","devonshiremasterrace","Devon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/devonshiremasterrace/","266 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is well on its way to becoming huge.\n\nThe map design so far (on 8 completed official levels) is by no means simplistic - high attention to detail and layout is clearly shown in increasingly large labyrinth-like levels, with expertly placed enemies and items.\nThe graphics are of a cartoony-like nature, and work really well with the rest of the game. Personally, I much prefer the Wrack-style textures to that of Borderlands (and we all know how successful that was!)\nThe AI, pretty average in intelligence, are well animated and immersive to play against. There are a few bugs here and there, but remember, this game is not finished! Don't be fooled how some enemies are easily killed near the beginning, or even how the hyperblade can one-hit most non-boss enemies, the game is NOT a walk in the park on the harder difficulties and will satisfy your gameplay desires!\nBobby Prince, who has made the soundtrack to Wrack (as far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong), has done a particularly marvellous job on the music for the game, that really compliments the overall enjoyment of Wrack. It's really easy to get into the swing of the game when high quality instrumentals accompany your race to The Hyperion Generator!\nWrack comes with a level editor as well. If you're like me, you may attempt making a map for five minutes and get confused. We could do with some more video tutorials, Brad! :)\nThe fact that Wrack has a level editor creates potential for a very close-knit community, which could produce many fantastic map packs, mods and god knows what else! There have already been a few releases, and I'm excited to say the least!\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone with the current price tag, as the game is being worked on by reliable developers and can only get better. Carnevil made the right decision leaving SkullTag to produce this masterpiece!\n\n(Apologies for the excessive use of exclamation marks)\n9.5/10","June 18, 2014","true","7.3"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","0"

It has a very classic FPS feel to it.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, it looks really pretty, and due to the engine being very well optimized, it will run on almost any machine. Although the graphics look cartoony, it really matches the gameplay and story, so don't automatically dismiss it purely for this reason.\n\nLevel design is again very similar to DOOM, you will find yourself running backwards and forwards through corridors which will all eventually look the same, the only way you'll be able to tell that you have already been in that one corridor is by the bloody remains of your enemies. There is a small aspect of jumping puzzles, which is one of my worst pet-peeves in video games, but they are few and far between in Wrack.  The pickup system, again, mirrors another classic FPS game, Quake - shields, health, bullets, random power-ups and plenty of different weapons.\n\nThere is a number of different difficulty settings you can choose from when you start the single player, ranging from brutally hard right the way down to easy mode. Easy mode is basically just for people who want to play the game for the story, you will not die, enemies die in one shot (as well as bosses), and you have unlimited ammo, it also enables in game cheats, allowing you to set "fly mode" on for instance. It was a bit of a strange addition to see these sort of cheats built into the game, but I suppose developers would rather people cheat using the in game built ones, than result to trainers to edit game files.\n\nI have spent roughly four hours playing the single player missions on normal mode; I feel that this is a decent length as I think any more and it would start to feel stale. Although the story mode took me little time, there is plenty of replay-ability due to the level editor, and you can replay the story mode to try better your scores on each stage, which is something which is seen a lot in the earlier FPS games again.\n\nIf you don't really like the modern type FPS games we have today, like COD or Battlefield, and would rather play the classics, Wreck is certainly the game for you, it gives those classic games a new face. It's not perfect, but it is in my opinion better than any of the recent CODs.\n\nI think £10,99 is a fair price, but if you can pick it up any cheaper, don't hesitate, you won't be disappointed.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Wrack remembers, and boy does it deliver!  Whether racking up kill streaks for massive points or exploring the beautiful architecture, this game never stops being fun.  It stays true to classic FPS sensibilities while adding new layers with platforming and arcade-style action and never stops being fun.  Not only that, but the fully functional level editor is user friendly and easy to work with for mappers both old and new.  With new content being released every other week and an already active and friendly modding community, this is sure to be an instant classic with many years of replayability.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KUBA18i/recommended/253610/","KUBA18i","KUBA18i","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KUBA18i/","280 products in account","Brad "Carnevil" Carney, having developed a source port named Skulltag which revolutionized Doom's multiplayer community, decided to make his very own first person shooter. Now here it is, the cartoonish, oldschool, arcade and fresh FPS called "Wrack". But, did it turn out well?\n\nThe first thing you need to know that it's a fast paced, skill based shooter with a bigger emphasis on the gameplay rather than story. If you except this to be a military(like Call of Duty, Battlefield, Medal of Honor or Titanfal), tactical(Counter Strike, Arma, Rainbow Six), story driven(Bioshock, Half Life) or puzzle based(Prey) shooter, then be informed that it's nothing like that. This is definitely closer to shooters like Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein 3D, Rise of the Triad, Serious Sam, Heretic and other oldschool, fast paced and with the only story being told is "Kill all that moves!!!" shooters. However, it's not exactly the same thing as them. Wrack aspires to be an arcade shooter, so it takes inspiration from games like Mega Man and Contra. Console platformers and PC shooters of the 90s are loved by rather different communites, so Wrack attempts to fuse both into one game that will hopefully find fans in any community.\n\nThis game has the following characteristics:\n-You move very quickly and never get tired.\n-There's five weapons, which are quite similar to Doom's and other shooters' ones. They don't have recoil or iron sights, here they are:\n*The meele is a huge and strong sword which can kill almost every common enemy in one hit, simirarly to Shadow Warrior '97.\n*The pistol is a simple weapon that fires fast and can do the job of killing things well if you run out of ammo for other weapons.\n*The shotgun is a quite effective weapon useful for racking up chains(to be explained later). Its ammo is very plentiful, so this one might be your favourite.\n*The 4th weapon is a Pulsar: a fast shooting energy ball gun affected by gravity. Very useful for bosses and enemy swarms.\n*The last weapon in your arsenal is the Bazooka. It's a slowly firing rocket launcher, but it still is very essential. Useful for combos!  If you get a certain item you can even do rocket jumps!\n- Skulltag powerups are included. Doomsphere multiplies damage done by 4. Guardsphere does the opposite. Speedsphere makes you superfast.\n- If you grab the Blast Guard you get the ability to do rocket jumps! Permament effect!\n- Each enemy requies different strategy against it. Use your gray matter effectively!\n- Theme changes every two levels.\n- Music is composed by (our lord and savior!!!)Bobby Prince, and it's AWESOME!\n- There's a Boss fight on every odd numbered level(other than the final one). But let me tell you that they are definitely Mega Man inspired, so if you only played FPSes before, you'll poop your diaper. The bosses are NOT some lame-♥♥♥ circle strafing(Cyberdemon, ROTT95 bosses, Kukulkan), hiding behing walls and shooting(Spider Mastermind, Wolfenstein 3D bosses, Exotech Larvae), endless enemy swarms and no actual attacks(Icon of Sin, Shub Niggurath, Mordekai), quick-time-events(MMS bosses), keep running away and shooting(Blood and Daikatana bosses) or swarming the player with projectiles ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Hell no! This time you MAY NOT quicksave after each attack or any BS like that, no! You will need to learn their attack patterns and then learn how to evade them, just like in Mega Man. ROTT13 tried to do a similar thing, but the failed at it with having too many damn projectiles than you can't even ♥♥♥♥ing evade. Wrack does this job very well and is one of the very few to do so.\n-There's a chain\combo system. If you kill enemies in a certain time period, you'll rack up your chain. If you kill multiple enemies at the same time, you get a combo. Racking up chain's fills your finisher bar, which let's you do strong attacks.\n- There's 8 levels+ a secret one. That may not be many, but there is a lot of replay value! You can always struggle to get a high score in the online leaderboards, or get those annoying achievemnts, or try to find these freaking secrets.\n- Quicksaves disappear when loaded on higher difficulties. It's an arcade shooter, so you are supposed to fight your way to survive and get extra lives to reach the end, not save everytime you clear an area. You are supposed to sweat and breathe densily when you have little lives left and trying to find out the way to kill the boss or get through a tricky part on a level. This is how NES owners often felt like. FPS veterans mat not like it, but screw them! Quicksaving scums! Play Wrack if you are manly! No offense of course =).\n- Workshop support for mods and new levels! That can bring endless life to this title!\n- The plot and characters are good and supposed to make you feel like watching a Saturday morning cartoon.\n- IT'S NOT A ♥♥♥♥ING DOOM CLONE!\n- THE GRAPHICS ARE NOT RIPPED OFF BORDERLANDS! lol bl doesn't even have celshading\n\n\nIn other words, Carn did a great job with making this game, so I defenitely recommend it. It's a fun, retrotastic and challenging experience. I urge YOU and everyone of your friends to play it!","October 24, 2014","true","25.8"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","31","39","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/253610/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Wrack is an awesome single-player arcade FPS, developed by small indie. It was first released in Early Access and been there for a year. One of those Early Access games that didn't fail with some drama and actually delivered.\n\nWrack is a old-school FPS game on the first glance. Yet when you get more in-depth you will notice that it's actually  more like a mix between Arcade style gaming and FPS genre, than a blind tribute to Doom. This game doesn't make itself look oldschool on purpose either, it has quite a modern look and controls too.\nIt also got Time Attack and Score Attack where you compete for score/time with world and friends. Would have loved scoreboard for main campaing too. You also can play any beaten levels, and earn better medals, the reqiurements are a bit confusing though.\n\nPresentation of the game is quite on the good level as well. It's all you need for arcade title, colorful graphics. And spot-on-sounds, great music by the Bobby Prince, who also made music for Doom, because we know, we should compare everything to Doom and mention it everywhere. He still didn't lose his talent and you can go and get soundtrack right away.\n\nThe story of the game follows... somewhere in 21XX when humanity lives happily and forgot what "military" forces is, only one man remains fitting for action is you, Kain. And the action came, as the robots invaded Earth and are planning to take the amazing generator for their own use and you have to stop them. Oh wait, it's ugly alien lizard that can be blown into many gibbity gibs. Also comes with a cool villian Exo who builds robots and doesn't have "Dr." in the name.\nCue all the fun in story cutscenes, enjoying characters talk. Shame the artwork is a bit of lacking. It doesn't have satisfying ending either, but that's OK, we play for gameplay, not ending.\n\nWhile graphics doesn't have much going technical-wise, the design is a stylish and colorful, quite pleasent for the eyes. It has character to it. Weapon animations are great and lively, perhaps too much for some people. But you can disable the camera movement in options, so not a big deal. And yes, when you blow or kill enemies, they leave their blood all over walls and floor, happily blowing into gibs as well. Robots have oil that works like a blood, gibs leaving it everywhere, and it makes killing robots as fun as aliens.\nCorpses of enemies don't really use ragdoll, but there is a gameplay design to it, as you can blow corpses into gibs, resetting chain combo.\n\nYes, chains and combos. This game is arcade game all around. There is usual affair of exploring mazes, finding switches and dominating your enemies, running at the speed of fast-paced game. It got classic non-regenerating health, your usual armor (cuts damage taken by half), supply pickups and hazards to avoid like spikeballs. And best part is that the game is Arcadey-fair, you don't feel like you died cheaply. Every enemy uses projectile attack, there are absolutely no hitscan attack, excluding railgunners! It's all about maneuvering and buttkicking, not about camping and headshotting carefully. It's one of those FPS who doesn't make you quicksave every few seconds because you may get hit into head by random bullet anytime. And this alone makes it one of better FPS games around.\n\nNot only it's properly done for once, but it has great Arcade elements to it. There is even a bit of platforming involved when it comes to secrets. It only has one physics trick, "straferunning", where running diagonally is faster. It also uses lives system, like any good arcade title, allowing you to start fresh from checkpoint upon death instead of making you wait loading same quicksave all time. Higher difficulties, the hardest one you have to unlock by beating game, don't even allow quicksaves. You can lose all lives, but you got infinitive continues, just gotta start level from beggining. Having truly arcade-like style where you get complete game over after losing lifes would have been interesting, but hardcore PC FPS gamers who use saving all time wouldn't be able to stomach that.\n\nSurvival is nice, but what will keep your replaying got to be score system. You got the usual treasures to pick up during there, but it's no much to chain combos system, where you have to kill enemies one after another in short amount of time between each kill. It's made to be addictive, as the hit sound pitch will go higher and higher, the score upon ending the chain increases pretty much geometrically. Not only that, but you can end the chain by releasing a powerful weapon's finisher, the strenght of which depends on the level of kill chain.\nNo, it's not some gore-full melee fatality. These Finishers take inspirations from fighting games instead, a more damaging shot that can clear out a room if positioned correctly.\nThey are different for each weapon, all of them getting their job done for various situations:\n-Hyperblade: Melee weapon that doesn't suck but isn't quick-knife either. Gibs most enemies and just feels great to whack with. Finisher is vertical slash, sending projectiles out.\n-Pistol: Gets stuff done for long range until bazooka. More ammo than you will ever need. Finisher is railgun-like shot.\n-Shotgun: Main weapon for short and even medium ranges. Main weapon actually. You do most combo chaining with it. Finisher is just strong WIDE shot.\n-Pulsar: Your superweapon, like in usual Arcade game, which you would want to keep for bosses and dangrous situations. Shoots fast, ammo is rare. Finisher is a slow powerful flying plasma. Huge one.\n-Bazooka: Blow anything into gibs. Good for long-range and packs of baddies. Finisher is just having more powder in rocket.\n\nAll used through the levels to fend off the various enemies. That are common weak melee robot-crawlers, kamikaze variety, usual projectile-shooting weak and tough alien soldiers, including railgunner variery too, flying patrolling robots and big melee crushers who act like walls. You should ignore crushers during big fights, unless it's the last difficulty where they are "poke me for gibs". Could use more of variety but it goes nice with chain system.\n\nYou also may notice that damage is never randomized. There is no gamble if that rocket will kill you or not. It goes good and bad with bazooka, as damage is always same no matter the distance from radius of explosion. It helps and makes sense when blowing enemies up, but you are likely to get self-instakilled just because you was a little too close.\n\nAnd then the levels. There aren't tons of them, but they are nicely packed, changing theme every two levels or so. They are abstract and got not many interesting details or interactivity, but damn good mazes and have different color palletes and textures. Each levels has a few secrets, with only around 2 in whole game being hidden behind usable wall, which means that it's not about tedius wallhumping like in "proper oldschool FPS".\nAnd best? Many bosses! And they aren't lame! Like proper arcade, they have tactics to learn and you can't just outdamage them. Wrack outdoes many FPSes here. Aside from Oculus, he becomes lame-easy once you learn tactic.\n\nAnd the game got Workshop support! It comes with face-based level editor and you can make mods with just a notepad, quite inspired by ZDoom. Easy to use, can do many stuff. Try it.\n\nThe game is not perfect though. Technical problems pop-up for many users, requring more PC power than one expects (the only modern FPS that doesn't remove gibs). Could use more enemy variety. 4-5 more levels with two more themes could be great. More.\nBut you know what? It still is one of the only arcade FPS around, it being felt in core gameplay up to bones, making you care of score. It may not be much for those who just want to beat game once with no care. But if you pick up any level after beating game and try the best, then you will not be able to put the game down until you finished it again.\nHighly recommended.","February 20, 2015","true","397.0"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","0"

The action gets repetitive. Basically you walk into an open room and shoot enemies as quickly as possible to "wrack" up combos. This would be fun if the level design was good. Unfortunatly, the levels are uninteresting and repetitive in which you can get lost easily because rooms look like other rooms. This game needs an in-game map like DOOM, but more importatnly this game needs more refined levels with unique geometry and design. Take a look at DOOM. There are no rooms in each level of DOOM that look alike. Each room had it's own personality and architecture that helped you know where you are. In addition, I wish there were more weapons other than the 5 weapons in the game; which are a sword, pistol, shotgun, plasma rifle, and rocket launcher.\n\nOverall, with limited weapons, repetitive action, and uninspired level design, I cannot recommend this game. It is fun for maybe an hour, but, afterwards, it gets repetitive and becomes a chore to play.","October 2, 2015","false","1.3"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","31","42","0","2"

( ALSO LOOK AT OTHER OPINIONS! )\n\nWrack is a cel-shaded first person shooter. The gameplay feels like the old shooters Doom and Quake. While playing, I felt like I was traveling back in time to those games, The game really is oldschool fun. The gameplay is clearing rooms of enemies, turning on buttons and encountering endbosses. While playing you learn the rhythm of the enemies, which adds to the fun because you know how to react to every enemy. By killing enemies in a short amount of time, you start filling your combometer.When the meter is very high you can perform a special attack, which does a lot of damage and gives you a lot of score. This is really addicting because you want to get your combo as high as you can. The game levels are well designed with a lot of secrets. I mostly like how the levels look, the graphical style of the walls are really colourful, thanks to the lighting. The only thing that give me mixed feelings are the endbosses, because many weren't well designed. Some endbosses are blood pumping exciting, while others were easily done with one finger in the nose. I mostly hated the final endboss, because I played the game on the hardest difficulty on my first playthrough. Due to that I couldn't quicksave and if I lost all my lives I had to start the level all over again. This really irritated me, because after retrying the final level over and over again, I didn't want to continue playing the game. It felt like a waste of time. The story of the game is pretty entertaining, because of the cliches. But it is more for the background because gameplay is king. But that still doesn't make up for the fact that the cutscenes in the game are really badly done. They look like they are unfinished. After the singleplayer you can play the speedrun and scoreattack modes. I will not be playing those as I will probably go insane! You also unlock a secret level which adds for around 1 hour extra gameplay! As final thing I want to say that I think this game is really well polished, with (almost) no bugs and still gets well supported by the devs.\n\nWorkshop:\nFor the workshop I can say it gets good support from a small community. Their levels can add for many extra hours of fun. The dev themselves have uploaded video tutorials to help people who are interested to making some mods for Wrack.\n\nIn short:\nReal oldschool fps fun.","November 15, 2014","true","18.1"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","2"

(I believe it was just hard and there's no higher difficulty if I recall correctly) and I had just come off Hotline Miami 2 at the time so I wasn't really unfamiliar with difficulty, in fact, I welcome it in most of my games.\n\nThe game is outright boring, the weapons feel almost as bad as Skyrim, being either peashooters, or cardboard guns.\nI felt like my weapons were too weak and that I'd have to pick them off one by one with the sword. I really hated the chain system as the levels aren't really filled with enemies and when they are, enjoy running about hoping you can squeeze enemies into your killstreak rather than trying to just kill them without taking damage as you would in Doom.\n\nThe soundtrack is god awful, the ''story'' is cringy. the enemies do not feel threatening. I feel as one would easily have a better experience with Doom, any version of it that's on Steam is fine.\n\nSo I decided to add some mods from the Workshop and keep in mind, I had bought this game in March, I literally only found a good few visual mods, and a mod that recreates Knee Deep in the Dead. So I played it, and the gameplay issues of walking TOO fast, guns sucking ♥♥♥♥, enemy types being reused over and over again wasn't fixed at all.\n\nJust go get Doom, if you're bored of Doom, install level mods, unless this game is priced at less than a euro/dollar/pound/Indonesian Dong, avoid like the plague.\n\n","September 28, 2015","false","1.7"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","22","31","2","0"

Usually I will really enjoy this kind of game but sadly Wrack is kind of average in all areas.\n\nStory\n\nThe story starts off quite interesting. Its set on a future version of Earth where the invention of a Star Trek style replicator has eliminated shortages of food and other resources, resulting in world peace. However, because there is no more military, Earth is vulnerable to alien invasion and your character is the only person who can stop them. Its clear from the character design that the developers intend this to be more of a comedy, and I did find some of the text only dialogue to be amusing.\n\nSadly none of this really has chance to go anywhere, because the game is only around 4 hours long. It turns out this is only "episode 1" and it ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nGameplay\n\nI already said its old school, and that means you regain health by collecting health packs, you can carry all the weapons you find, there is no cover system, and you can quicksave anywhere (there are checkpoints as well). This all matches my preferences.\n\nHowever, the weapons aren't particularly exciting. The biggest disappointment is the plasma rifle - it has some very severe bullet drop, which makes trying to aim at long distance a waste of time and ammo. I spent most of the game using a shotgun with a slow rate of fire, and a pistol that does low damage (but at least it is accurate at long distance). I found a rocket launcher on one of the later levels that is actually quite useful. There's also a sword, but I don't tend to use melee weapons in a shooter unless they have Shadow Warrior style special abilities, which Wrack's doesn't.\n\nThere are a few different types of enemies, but they don't really do much different tactically outside of "this one will shoot you from range" and "this one will melee you" - no special abilities. The AI isn't fantastic either, on several occasions one of them would just stand there and let me shoot them 10 times with the pistol without firing back. The bosses are more challenging, but they are the "learn the repeated attack pattern" variety, which I'm not a fan of.\n\nLevel design has some nice use of environmental hazards - crushing walls, lava/acid pits, spike balls - this is probably my favourite part of the game. Other than that its mostly narrow corridors and small rooms. Its not completely linear, but it seems like every objective is "find the button to lower the forcefield that was blocking your progress".\n\nTechnical\n\nThe cartoonish graphics give Wrack a unique visual style and the music is quite good. I didn't suffer any crashes. Controls are fully rebindable and work fine with mouse and keyboard.\n\nOverall recommendation\n\nI know this review sounds very negative, but its not a bad game. I've played many that are worse, but it just doesn't live up to the high expectations that I have for the FPS genre. My advice would be to wait and see if the developers release more episodes (at the time of writing, nothing is confirmed), or wait for a sale.","October 20, 2014","true","4.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Running around like a madman and racking up the longest kill chains you can imagine. That urge of finding an enemy to shoot so your chain won't reset makes for some fast paced game-play! Somewhat good variety of enemies and weapons, but maybe future episodes will introduce more, alongside new stage gimmicks.\n\nThe current stages are fine for the most part, Although, I wish they weren't in pairs, it could had brought up more level variety, gimmicks and bosses for each levels instead of every two levels. Some bosses are perhaps to easy, however, the rest are hard as all hell, but learning their attack patterns, tied with good timing, make any hard boss fight even more satisfying upon victory!\n\nThe soundtrack still tries to find its identity, but does make a good variety of music overall. But, because of that, some music will come, other will vanish, hopefully temporarily! Bobby Prince is the one behind the soundtrack and sound for the game; and my gosh he delivers! The music for the finale, Wrukus, is absolutely epic, my favorite track so far! Followed by 'Whom The Bells Toll For', used in the secret level!\n\nI do wish the best to the developers. I really want to see future episodes for this! For one that would mean even more track by Bobby Prince and who wouldn't want that? Therefore, I would give this game a "8.5/10" Great game play, ideas, style, music and sound, but it could use a bit more level variety, new enemies wouldn't hurt and make some of the weaker boss much harder and react faster also.

Even while it is in Early Access, the gameplay feels solid and compelling. Most of the Early Access games I have encountered in the past have been clunky conglomerations of concepts that never seem to collect themselves into a properly focused game. That is not the case with Wrack. Wrack knows where it wants to go and what it wants to accomplish.\n\nI recall one moment in Wrack where I turned a corner in a narrow hallway that opened up into a room that had multiple enemies on elevated platforms trying to blast my face off while I negotiated a way across a precarious lattice of narrow steel catwalks that were surrounded by threateningly open pits of radioactive sludge.

The developers and community are very nice people as well, giving constructive feedback on your maps and helping you to hone your skills on mapping.\n\nCalling it a DOOM clone, huh? I'd say, it's got the feel of DOOM, but some things are compared to DOOM and compared to other clasic FPSes, the character is at blistering speeds like the Doomguy, It's a bit like Duke Nukem in terms of story, but the reason is actually different and I will get into that the next paragraph. Scoring and lives in the game were in Wolfenstein 3D. The Pulsar is somewhat unique to the game, for me at least, despite being it like the plasma gun from DOOM, but you must shoot upwards for a greater distance. Yes, I know all this because I've played all these games throughout my gaming life. So let's say it's a game mixed together with many of the 90s FPS games taken into the modern 3D world.\n\nThe story is a... Well, expecting from a FPS, a alien invasion. But those are cool, no bad sayings. They do have a reason on invading Earth, they want the machine that now keeps humanity alive. Kind of like a life support machine since by that timeline of the game, since before the events, the machine made Earth a peaceful planet.\n\nThis game is so great that I suggest you guys get it!","December 3, 2013","true","5.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Does everything right, great level design, the weapons feel magnificant. It's based in a futuristic world where peace has ensued for a very long time, but then someone decides to disturb the peace by attacking with robots and aliens (not gonna detail it a whole lot with names, locations and whatnot). I could say it is Quake in the future but there are quite a lot of differences to actually officially name it that. The graphics style has been seen before with the bold outline and all but the artstyle is quite interesting and will keep you surprised. Many people are claiming the movement feels too fast but in my own opinion, the level is designed with fast-paced movement in mind and it compliments each other respectively. Something that really shines in this game is the boss battles, which thus far has been superb.\nThe only thing I need to really point out is the fact that on the episode select screen, the second and third episodes are greyed out and after both of them is the horrific words we all hate -- "DLC". The team has explained that they are very small and require the money but if anything, let us hope that these episodes would be reasonably cheap and/or have a great amount of quality content in them.\nAll in all, this is a very interesting game and reminds me of Quake and Doom greatly. Glad to have bought it and I would recommend this to anyone who loved Quake.","December 19, 2013","true","11.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Sprinting around levels at ridiculous speeds, dodging projectiles, avoiding melee attacks, mowing down hordes of enemies with guns that look and sound great - Wrack does some things that many first person shooters have done in the past, but it does it with a stylish flair that few can match. Beyond that, though, I can't think of any other FPS that does boss battles like this one does, and while there are probably other games in the genre with similar mechanics to the "kill chain/combo finisher" feature of Wrack, I don't know of any that have done it nearly as well.\n\nThere's a pure joy in taking down foes with blast after blast of your shotgun, hearing the audio counter for your kill chain getting louder and louder, then charging up a final, massive shot that clears out an entire room. Getting long combos and high scores in Wrack isn't easy, but it's rewarding and really damn fun. Speaking of shotguns, I would assert that this game has one of the best in the genre, ranking up with the others from Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, FEAR, and Halo. It also features a backup melee weapon that is available at all times but is (shockingly) useful, and a rocket launcher that's a stupid amount of fun to use. The difficulty levels are also noteworthy in that harder ones do not turn enemies into bullet sponges by giving them more health; it's a matter of how deadly they are to you, not the other way around.\n\nSpecial shout-out also goes to Bobby Prince for the music and sound effects. The soundtrack gets rather quirky at times, but it's definitely memorable, and everything in the game sounds excellent. That's not to say that the modellers, texture artists, and animators aren't worth mentioning either; Wrack looks damn good.\n\nI kinda wish the pistol was easier to get kill chains with and had a more effective Finisher move, but beyond that, about the only non-nitpick complaint I have is that there isn't more of this game. It's got a solid amount of content for its price, with high replayability; I just want to see the addition of more levels, enemies, bosses, weapons, etc. in either more Episodes (free or otherwise) or a full sequel. I can only hope this game ends up being the success I feel it deserves to be.","September 22, 2014","true","21.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The creators loves their game, to this day play their game ( I see on of the creators in Wrack all the time on steam!), and still patches the game. Maybe you should try the darn game! No honestly, it's quite good.\n\nThe game is steeped in old school glory, but is not confined to emulating other games. Wrack is not Doom, it's Wrack, and that's awesome. The game play is in the vein of old school FPS, what we get here is FAST, smooooth, and intense. The enemies often litter the screen, with different types of monsters intermingling into veritable swarms of deadly goodness that you will circle strafe and juke around at a constant 60fps. There's also an interesting score mechanic that revolves around kiting enemies into situations where you can kill lots of them quickly, keeping the combo timer going means minimizing the time in between kills. The timer seems a bit harsh, but it's all doable and you can check the leader boards top player's game play videos within the game to give you an idea of how you might increase your score. The old school vibes extend to the level design which are huge, filled with keys and switches, and of course, secrets! TONS of secrets you'll be struggling to find for a long long time. For my personal preferences I felt the levels to be a little tough to navigate but when you hit a switch that powers a far away door they at least show you where that door was cutting out some of the monotonous guess work of older games. Setting wrack apart from games of our generation and past is the exquisite polish you'll find in every aspect of the game.\n\nThe art direction is insane, from menu to in game everything looks amazing, and fits within this new Wrack universe. The music also, is some of the more memorable music I've heard in a game in a long long time. I'm a huge fan of video game music, and this material really stood out to me. The melodies are sometimes reminiscent of old school tunes, but in a way that like the game, is fresh and unique. I can't stress enough that the game plays smoothly, I tried hard to find glitches and areas with frame drop and it just doesn't. Solid 60 fps everywhere no matter what you're doing.\n\nThe leaderboards are a cool feature, the ability to watch the game play of leaderboard top scores is even cooler, but the built in workshop content is what'll keep most players coming back after they beat the hell out of the main campaign. There is the obligatory doom level recreations on the workshop but I'm more excited for what the modding community brings in terms of original wrack levels. Anyways, if you like old school, if you like polish, you should check out wrack. Especially while it's on sale in a humble bundle.\n\nEven AAA games aren't coming out as complete as Wrack is, and you gotta respect that a small team can deliver such high quality content.

Its visual style is interesting and unique, and you can clearly see enemies. The guns, for the most part, feel good. The Pulse is somewhat laking of any oomph, but that is certainly made up for with the shotgun. However, there are some negatives. If you aren't used to the fast-paced style of gameplay, then you will initially suffer from some nausea. I did when I began playing. The gameplay itself is well polished, especially for an early access game. Know that this certainly is a game that is built to appeal to those that grew up on retro fps', so if those kinds of games aren't your style, then you will most likely dislike this game. But if you do, then it will not disappoint. I am interested to see what more they will do with their product.

It moves quickly. There isn't any clutter littering the levels to get caught on. There are no Iron Sights or Reloading. The game has secrets! There are so many details about what makes those old games great that it really feels like the developers get it.\n\nAside from nailing the old, the new that it brings is in the way you score points and build chains. Killing multiple enemies in quick succession builds your finisher meter. Using a finisher gives you an attack and points that scale with the amount of enemy kills you managed to chain together, up to a level 4 finisher.\n\nFinishers encourage you to replay levels and learn how to chain kills more effectively to achieve a better score, but even if you don't care about score, you can use them to kill a tough enemy in 1 hit or take off a large chunk of a boss' health bar.\n\nLearning the levels in and out doesn't work if the levels aren't well designed, but Wrack's levels have been designed very carefully with high-level play in mind. Unfortunately, while designed well for gameplay, none of the levels are especially interesting or memorable. There aren't very many landmarks and a lot of levels blur together. It's my biggest criticism of Wrack.\n\nAesthetically, it's not my favorite art style and I think a lot of things look too similar, but the whole package feels cohesive. The music fits well and was made by the same composer of Doom.\n\nWrack includes a level editor and the developers seem very interactive with their community so a great game only looks to improve.","October 8, 2014","true","9.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Yay health packs!\n\nYou’re not going to be sitting in cover waiting for the enemy to rear its (admittedly ugly) head, you’re there in the thick of the action, and if you by chance run out of ammo, you can always still sword them in the face.\n\nThe cell-shaded cartoony graphics, silly humour, and cartoonish style really set the game’s tone, and the execution of the action is absolutely great, to the point that after this review, our intrepid reviewer didn’t want to stop playing. Seriously, he just kept going. And going.\n\nAll in all, hugely recommendable if you’re looking for some classic style FPS fun!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=339871435","November 10, 2014","true","3.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I've known Brad Carney through the online DooM community for years and years, and when I heard he was making a game, I called him names and said I would pirate it. But that's our relationship.\n\nAs far as shooters go, this definitely is one. You run, jump, shoot, pick things up, push buttons, and shoot more. It's got some platforming elements, some puzzles, and of course, lots of shooting.\n\nAs far as design goes, it's simply OK. It looks good, with the cel-shaded stuff happening, the models are pretty solid, and the textures are cool. But the level layout is kind of bland and repetetive, and it honestly gets kind of tedious. The weapons are pretty much your standard shooter fare: Pistol, shotgun, rapid fire shooty gun, rockets, etc. Ammo placement is a hit or miss. When I wanted to use the pistol, I had no ammo, and couldn't find enough.\n\nI skipped all the cutscenes. I wasn't interested at all. Didn't care about the story, I just wanted to shoot things.\n\nAll in all, for what the game was supposed to be (from my understanding), a throwback shooter, it's not bad. You get to run around really fast ala DooMguy, shoot things, fight bosses, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, have a good time, all that noise. I'd recommend it to anybody who wants to play something akin to the old days of shooter games, but I can't recommend it to anyone who's more into the modern stuff like CoD, Battlefield, Halo, or that kind of stuff. I wouldn't have gotten the game if I didn't know the guy making it.\n\nLooks: 8/10\nSounds: 7/10 (not too impressed by Bobby Prince this time around)\nGameplay: 6/10 (tedious, repetetive)\nOverall: 6.9(heh)/10\n\n","November 18, 2014","true","6.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","1"

I was hoping that this would be a fun, fast-paced FPS... Yes, this game is fast-passed and certainly feels like a throwback, but it's the few things that they add in the hopes of differentiaiting themselves that end up being a big disappointment. Frankly, I don't want a scoring mecahnism in an FPS... I don't know what this has become the common trend for FPS games to add an 'arcade mode' to their game but I just don't care about 'chaining' kills or killing as many enemies at one time.. I am not going to revisit the game later to try to better my score and I could care less about any leaderboards... I just want the game to be interesting while I'm playing it. Add some variety to the level design, maybe throw in some new enemies-- both of which this game seems to neglect. Honestly, I just want them to remake Doom with the cell-shaded visuals, i think it would have been a whole lot more interesting and fun than this one.","January 31","false","3.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Very creative and bright which makes the game even more intricate. The gameplay itself is simple and easy enough that combines streaks and leaderboards.\n\nThe only complaint I have about this game is the fact that there is no multiplayer, which is a shame because it looks like a good game to run such a component. And another thing is the speed of the game. I don't mean the speed of the gameplay but the speed of how fast your character runs. I've played a lot of video games in my life and this is the fastest character I have ever played in my life. Like holy smokes! Sonic you got competition.

Hopefully the developers can further develop and create more content in order to complete the single-player experience in the coming months.

There's no carnage in this game, no brutality, no massacre, no cool bosses. Power-ups are too damn scarce to affect the gameplay and bosses actually just suck.\nBorderlands? No, just 4 guns and a sword and only shotgun and sword are satisfying. Pulsar(supposedly plasmagun) shots just hit the floor in front of you - what a bloody lame arc trajectory. The rocket launcher is slow, sometimes it can hit the nearby spider you were shooting over leaving your wonder wtf just happened or why you just died as spider crawled nearby out of sight but it's hit box somehow got in the way. The only long range is pistol which sux as you can't combo with it. So what you're left with is 3 close combat weapons and an explosive long range that hits random targets.\n\nSorry, no Doom, no Borderlands. Only cell shading is there.\n\nGameplay relays combos, that you have to get by killing monsters until the cool down after kill runs out. To get big combos that lead to decent output of damage as finishing move, you have to know the levels as your five fingers and be bloody perfect at moving and shooting. The combo cool down timer goes down too fast, missed a shot, took a millisecond too long to get behind the corner, switched a weapon - combo's ♥♥♥♥ed.\nWell, it might've been possible to wank all over it and get perfect scores, combos and speedruns, if the game was satisfying, but it's not. It demands too much from you without offering anything in return. Simplistic enemy design, silly stars and nearly invisible rockets fired at you, stupid instant death spiked balls, bad animation, bad music that gets annoyingly muted down when you shoot or try to activate wall to find a secret. Game screams at every corner that it's cool, while it's completely not.\n\nNot recommended.","May 27, 2015","false","26.9"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","21","40","2","0"

Its speed is high, there are sometimes hordes of monsters, it has the same composer (Bobby Prince; nice music) and features references in its loading screens. Unlike Doom, it uses checkpoints and has only one quick save slot. And it has a (rudimentary) story which sometimes interrupts the game.\n\nThe boss monsters are a chore. In Doom, the bosses were much like ordinary enemies, only deadlier and tougher. You were usually in an arena that was large enough to evade them and gave plenty of cover from their attacks. In Wrack, the bosses usually trap you in a very tight spot. They have attack patterns and sometimes use shields. And homing missiles!\n\nThe user interface is another issue I have. Doom managed to have most of the relevant information on screen at all time (in 320x200 resolution!). Wrack does not show how much ammo each weapon has, only the current one. It clutters information all over the screen. On colorful backgrounds, with fancy symbols; but the actual text is comparatively small. Instead of striving for symmetry, I would have preferred the information to be closer together, in one spot and more easily discernible.\n\nWrack has a prominent score system, but if you care about reaching a high score, you'll have to either learn the levels by heart or focus on one aspect: speed, finding secrets and/or treasure (which will often be in hard to reach places, resulting in deaths) or killing all monsters. These stats are tallied once a level is complete. Kill chains (kill enemies in quick succession, then use a finisher to get a bonus) give an additional score.\n\nI really wish there were options to focus on either story or a high score. So that you could first play to survive and see the story (which is weak in writing and presentation), then come back and try for a harder difficulty and/or better scores without being bothered by the conversations.\n\nWhy do I still recommend the game despite all the negative points? Because it works well enough. Running and gunning have no issues. It looks and sounds nice.","January 6","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything from the fantastic art style to the gibbing of your foes makes this game a fun ride - even if it is a short one. I finished the first episode in less than 3 hours, but don't let that turn you away from the game. With time and score attack modes and a decent amount of Workshop support, this game can keep you entertained for quite a while. And I do believe that more 'episodes' are coming at some point in the future...\n\nNow whilst I loved the classic feel of the game, there are a few drawbacks. There's not a large amount of weapon variety, but gladly the pickups and chaining of kills to create combos makes the gunplay feel good. However, the enemy variety doesn't change much if you compare the first few levels with the final one. Sure, a few of the enemies get better weapons and look cooler, but it didn't really help the fact that you were killing the same ones over and over again... The level design was nice, and the colours made them feel unique, although I couldn't help but feel like some outdoors areas would've added a bit more depth to the locations.\n\nBut overall, I would recommend this game to fans of the classic arcade FPS games. Hopefully in the future we will see even more Workshop content and more variety and depth in the episodes to come.\n\nEnjoy! :)","May 23, 2015","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are only about 5 different types of common enemies.\n*There are way too many instadeath hazards. The lack of checkpoints compounds this issue further.\n*Level 3-4 combo chains are neigh-impossible to attain with some weapons due to their damage and/or fire rate.\n*Kain runs too fast for his own good, this WILL lead to unwarranted deaths.\n\nIf you like the old school first-person shooters, you will love this game, no questions asked.

Wrack has only four weapons: a Pistol, Shotgun, Pulse Rifle and Rocket Launcher, but they are enough for the task at hand. The game makes use of a unique combo system that allows each to to fire a powerful "finisher" if you get 3 or more kills in quick succession. Wrack rewards the twitchy shooter in much the same way as its predecessors, and has an eye-catching color palette and cel-shading, setting it apart from say, Quake and Hard Reset. It is regrettably short, comprising only the first "episode" of what seems to be a planned series, ending on a glaring cliffhanger, but the game does feature a level editor and Steam Workshop support, which has resulted in such gems as the entire first episode of Doom recreated.

Arsenal is your standart fps starter pack (It's kinda even shorter than many early FPSs ) and it's also booring to use. The Finisher system is only and kinda original gimmick but is also feels underpowered and never shines through the game.  Level design is uninspiring too, and the problem is not art and it's primitivity, but the lack of any interesting ideas, tricks and other engaging moments that made DOOM\Quake (Just basic example because you can clearly see where author was inspired) level design interesting. Even if that game was good in all it's elements it's will be just ok doom clone, but wont be great FPS. There is not much to tell about art, music  and story too. It's holds on pair with other elements, bland and cringy.

(Played on Hardcore, Only partway through the game).\n\nSo, I've played what I need to play. I've seen all I need to see. My honest thoughts are that this game is not worth it at all.\n\nI came into this game with a lot of hype. A LOT. I was convinced that this was going to be the next Doom, or something like that. What I got was something far off from that. A few complaints I had before (head bob, etc.) have been smoothed out now, but I just can't recommend it.\n\nThe shotting in the game is fine, but some weapons truly ♥♥♥♥ me off. The bazooka's explosions are very underwhelming and small, but if you're even close to the blast, it'll basically kill you. Rocket jumping is basically out of the question.\n\nThe level design is all so similar. Same kinds of levels, all homogenized into one blur that seems just like one 3 hour level. There is almost no variation in the nine levels. The game is still short; playing for an hour has gotten me over half the game.\n\nThe quicksaving is still an issue, because the only time the quicksaving properly works, is when you play on Casual or easier, which doesn't really make sense because you will never need quicksaving on those lower difficulties anyway. The game is also too easy. Playing on Hardcore is almost like a cakewalk. Other than cheap deaths and floor hazards, expect not to die at all. The soundtrack is easily forgettable. I remember most of the music in Doom. Not this. Last, but definitely not least, the game is not even finished in 1.0. The cutscenes aren't done for the barely relevant story.\n\nI don't see why people are ♥♥♥-kissing this game so much. While I can enjoy this game for a solid 5 minutes or so, this isn't the next great game.\n\n(I have not finished the game, will try to finish and polish up review.)","September 30, 2014","false","2.9"," 24 of 48 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","24","48","0","7"

It's not a fun game though imo. The movement is different, it feels like it has some acceleration / deceleration that doesn't feel natural. It's trying too hard to feel like quake type movement, only by coming off far far worse.\n\nI hate to say this because I have respect for the guy's previous work on blake stone/planet strike, doom games and wolfenstein 3d. Bobby Prince's tunes in this game just doesn't come off very nice to me. I haven't played many levels in the game so maybe some other levels might have better music, but I from early levels the sound/tone of guitar sounds very VST-ish, and not very authentic. I'm sure it doesn't help the case much when the game itself feels bad, but regardless I feel it could've been better maybe.\n\nThe gun play / damaging of enemy doesn't feel significant, maybe the graphical response doesn't cut it.. I shoot enemy and unless he takes a killing blow / dies there's really not much reaction from enemy. You can tear enemy to gibs yes, but when they are alive they feel like brick walls, it doesn't feel like you're shooting another being of flesh (even if they're surrounded by layer of armor), it just is very bad.\n\nThe reason I'm coming down on this game is because it reminded me of some old good games. Unreal 2 and Quake 2, both games which I think have far greater singleplayer campaign and experience than this game. The story telling in this game is bad, the mechanics/feel of gunplay is bad, the movement is bad, the music could be somewhat better. The platforming was the last nail on the coffin for me. I have 2d platformer games I can play if I want to play platforming games, but why should I do that sort of stuff on a 3d game, where platforming is not as nearly as rewarding or satisfying for me? There 2 mentioned games unreal and quake, they don't have the ammount of platforming this game has. They don't encourage the player to save scumming in-case of failed jump and fall to lava pit. Not even doom 1 and 2 had that many places where you could not get out with a secret or teleport, not many places where you would die without escape if you fell.\n\nIt did remind me of unreal 2 and quake 2, mainly because I really rather play those two games instead of this. Begs to question, maybe this game could've been better if it didn't try to do everything at once (score system from wolf3d/bstone, movement from quake, platforming, metroidvania room clearing, sidescrolling bosses). It just isn't a very good game.","May 12","false","2.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

When compared to pretty much any FPS to have happened since then, it wilts.\n\nMaybe that's not fair...Wrack adds a few extra ideas to the Doom wheelhouse of shoddy AI, exploding barrels, and protracted games of Hunt the Button—mainly in the guise of kill combos and fiddly-but-not-terribly-effective finishing moves. I guess the idea is you're meant to dispense with the tactical play and just charge in willy-nilly, but that as a strategy is so much less effective than the time-honored corner-cover/dodge two-step that those mechanics won't see much use. Movement is loose and floaty, which makes the relatively frequent platforming sections over lava or toxic waste a real hoot and yes I was being sarcastic just there.\n\nLike Doom, enemies and environments are pretty samey. Through the first three levels I encountered your basic spider-bot things, two or three varieties of anthropomorphic lizard with guns, and a smattering of boss robots. Maybe it gets more interesting later on. Maybe the between-level cut scenes' text provides some layer of story or flavor I missed out on by frantically mashing Esc as soon as it came up, but I can only cringe so much before my face starts to cramp.\n\nI can't help but feel like Wrack is trying to do the Borderlands thing, where the game's too busy telling you how awesome you are to ever get around to giving you anything to do that is actually awesome. Or even all that interesting. Pretty much every activity you undertake in Wrack results in a vaguely comic-styled bit of text pops up on the screen telling you how amazing you were for doing it (GOOD! NICE! AWESOME!). Maybe they're trying to pump you up or something, but a game that won't let you kill an enemy without praising you effusively reads less like "rollicking good time" than "desperate sycophant".\n\nIt's not bad; it's just not all that good, either. If you're super into the Id/3D Realms era of FPS, you'll probably love it.

Yes, well so does Wrack, but can the game stand up to the legend? In short no, but here are the reasons.\n\nThe good:\n+Movement is super fast and it feels great.\n+The levels feature little secrets in the form of jumping puzzles.\n+The scoring/combo system is a nice way of pushing yourself to stay inside the thick of the action.\n\nThe bad:\n-The story is way to wordy for this type of game.\n-The soundtrack is boring and sounds like  a rehash of DOOM.\n\n-The game lacks polish and here are some examples: Missiles clip through walls, sometimes the teleportation effect doesn't play on enemies, lava is an insta-kill obstacles rather than a DOT like in DOOM (like why would they not steal this from DOOM), the golem/robot enemies don't have any visual particle effect when they ground slam so you'll just take damage instantly if you don't jump in time and you can skip door opening cutscenes but not boss-fight intro cutscenes.\n\n-The weapons need a good tweaking and here's what I think could improve them: The pistol is useless and should have had a slower firing rate but done way more damage, the plasma rifle should not have bullet drop, the sword should not have a 2.5 second wind up because it doesn't fit with the fast gameplay and finally all ammo caps should have been doubled. The only two weapons that don't suck are the shotgun and the rocket launcher.\n\n-The game needed to double down on guns and get creative, because you'll only recieve 4 bland weapons throughout the entire ordeal.\n\n-Some boss-fights limit your movement speed and of course the boss has huge AOE attacks. Other bosses feature big arenas but the boss doesn't attack, seriously in one boss-fight I was only attacked once.\n\n-Enemies will sometimes get stuck on corners and other times they simply forget to attack because they are stuck in an animation loop.\n\nSo just to reiterate Wrack is not worth your time or your money. It's so close to be good, but as of right now it's just a game with too many rough edges to be truly appreciated.","October 28, 2015","false","3.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The first open window I came to I tried to jump out of it to my death but unfortunately couldn't. I stuck it out for another 1.5 hours or so and of course it never got any better. It has zero in common with Doom and Quake like other reviews try to fool you into thinking besides its game speed and the fact that it also is in first person. Other than that, nothing.\n\nFor future reference to people reviewing games on steam: don't compare games to Doom and Quake unless they are pretty damn good. "Oh look it has a shotgun and you can move fast and shoot things so it must be like Doom and Quake!" Nothing about it made me want to keep playing. Everything is really generic and the weapons and enemies suck balls. The weapons are janky, the whole game is too. The skinny enemies and their bad gib animations remind me exactly of Daikatana's enemies. Through the entirety of the first 3 levels there were three enemy types: boring robot spiders, boring Daikatana-esque blue alien guys, and a generic ground slamming robot, and two different bosses. Every other different enemy in the game is just the same model I mentioned in a different color. Doom wasn't a one-trick pony. It is famous for being phenomenal in every possible area. This game isn't even a one trick pony because nothing about it stood out. Just run of the mill, standard generic gameplay with boring weapons and boring enemies and a boring environment.\n\nYou want something that will knock your socks off? Play Doom with the Brutal Doom mod, one of the most awesome things of all time. This game made me look forward to my trip to the dentist tomorrow. Maybe in addition to extracting a wisdom tooth he can extract the memory of this game because I really don't see why a lot of people are giving it rave reviews because it doesn't deserve them.

First of all, if you're a big fan of Doom, and you're looking for a game in a new generation of shooters with a 90's playstyle, this will not be the game for you; Try Rise of the Triad or Serious Sam.\nI know that all these people are boasting that this game will statisfy the nostalgic memories of fragging demons on Mars that you probably have, and I supose I can see where they're coming from with the games core gameplay , but the fast paced run 'n gun action that's somewjhat present in the game does not make up for the overall poor design of every other aspect.\nIf you're curious about how this game plays, look up raw gameplay footage, and you will notice these main issues:\nThe enemies lack variety, and are seemingly lifeless; all of them move in an uninspiring robotic fashion. This leaves very little satisfaction when clearing a room, even with a seemingly badass looking gun.\nLevels lack creativity, as resources such as ammo and health are plopped on the sides of most levels in a repetitive fashion, while "secrets " hardly reward players for their exploration, as they provide more of the previously metioned repetitive resources. On top of that, enemies tend to cluster in the rooms that you come across, and little suspence can come from entering a doorway, clearing a room, and leaving, because every room cleared feels the same.\nNo multiplayer. Nothing much more to elaborate on. A total lack of multiplayer kills more than half of the 90's shooter feel in itself.\nBosses are a joke. Look up the first three and you'll see what I mean. "Big guy enters room. Learn his fire pattern. Shoot him."\nIt seems like I'm nitpicking here, but honestly, this is the whole game; just the same few enemies and the same few rooms over and over, with a big, easy boss at the end. It seems like there was a very clear idea that started with this game that never lead to a fully finisehd product. What's present here is a lack of depth in the overall design; a lot of little mistakes that made a mediocre game. It's not terrible, but it sure as hell isn't worth what they're charging for it.","June 28, 2015","false","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I spent much of my time in the Steam Group Chat with him and some other users who, some, became my friends. I don't like him, I don't hate him, I'm quite neutral towards him.\n\nWrack is Maze-Based First Person Shooter, obviously, trying to hit that nostalgia weak spot of the Doom fanatics with a very clean and attractive cell-shaded look. I love first person shooters and if your game description included "Doom" in it, then it better be as good as "Brutal Doom"!\n\nLets get the story part done with quickly, you're Kain, who is... some guy that needs to stop Earth from being invaded by the Aliens. He does this by, surprisingly, shooting a lot of stuff and preventing them from stealing the great Hyperion Generator! He's preety much the only character that gets any characterization, but even then, it's minimal as hell. Starlyn, which seems to be his girlfriend, doesn't have much to do during the whole story, only a convenient romantic plot device. She even gets kidnapped and the game forgets about her. The there's Fabian who has luscious long hair brown hair and is also a funny ponce, so basically John Romero. Finally there is the main villain, Exo, who just comes by as your average quirky bad guy. So nothing much on the story side but 10 euros isn't gonna get you an epic greek odyssey.\n\nSo what would make this a Doom-Like FPS? Well, during the glorious decade of 1990's, FPS concentrated on offering a labyrinth of nasty monster that you had to shoot. This was before Halo and CoDs came in and astonishingly enough, made an already simple formula, even more basic. Back then you had to work for your survival, traverse through some complicated well-thought out level design and use a good variation of weaponry to blast away your enemies! So does Wrack achieve these objectives?\n\nFor me, the most important part of any shooter is the actual shooting! Level design is great and all, but if I'm not seeing limbs of corpses flying, weapons shouting god's fury, skill-dependent guns, screen shaking (not too much though), walls being painted with visceral red fluids and better gunplay feedback than early access fanboy reports, then you're gunplay has, as Jim Sterling would say: "all the impact of the limpest willy of America". Wrack comes about halfway with this portion. Cartoon gibs explode to the air like a leprechaun pub vomit and most weapons sound preety good. The sword is as good as Serious Sam 3's sledgehammer (quick and snappy kills, although it is a bit risky), the pistol is ♥♥♥♥ weak, shotgun is competent (kills nearly everything in one shot and the fire rate lets you decide which body falls next), plasma pulse rifle is ok (requires some good aiming since the shots fall off) and the rocket launcher has nothing wrong with it to be honest. Each rocket is a precise mini nuke that'll make a room full of enemies, a quick sludge of organs. Not an amazing list of weapons, so I'd say it's competent, but combined with the speed of your character, then it's near to an adrenal fueled experience like that of Shadow Warrior (2013).\n\nWrack's gimmick includes a combo meter that can power your weapons with powerful secondaries. I do think it's a nice little idea, however, it doesn't work perfectly. The secondary shots aren't all that imaginative. The shotgun and the rocket launcher just make a bigger bang, the pistol shoots thing railgun-like laser, the sword gives also a bigger bang firing three plasma shots and the pulse plasma rifle fires a slow gigantic projectile that eats everything on its way. The combo meter decreases quickly and most enemies require at least 2 shots to kill them, so you better keep up. And once you clear a room with a combo meter prepared then you'll have to hold down the secondary fire button for a good while until you find a suitable target. Honestly, I wish you could fire these special shots any time you wanted as long as you had the special ammo for it. This would probably work better in an FPS arena-based shooter.\n\nAs for the level design, it's alright, for moments you'll get some nice imaginative sections, but they're a handful. This issue comes along with the enemy variation. Now if the enemy variation was low but dynamic, then I wouldn't mind, unfortunately you'll only face robot spiders, kamikaze robot spiders, kid aliens, adult aliens that change shirts from time to time, flying turrets and a giant damage sponge robot. Most of them fire a small colourful projectile which aren't too hard to dodge. The real challenge is when the game combines a group of enemies and one closed room, this happens quite often ambushes. It's not bad, it's actually what these kind of games and I love it, but it can be sometimes quite cheap. The WORST enemy would be the railgun laser alien. He charges up his laser and no matter where you are, how fast you are, you're gonna get hit unless you hide behind a wall, preferably one of the size of a chest. They're specially annoying when they're placed real far away from you, behind a bunch of of enemies and you can't hear them charge their laser rifle!\n\nNow I don't like boss fight, however, most of the ones in this game are tolerable. Except for three of them: the last one (annoying, but hard as expected), the penultimate and the second one. All because of black missiles! They're heat seeking missiles and they track you so well that not a even a speedhacks can save you!\n\nNow, what I've been saying during the rest of the review might make Wrack seem like an average game, but I don't think I should demand immensely from a game with a 15 euro price tag. Even then, I would recommend other games like Brutal Doom for it's gore and Rise of the Triad (2013) for its expansive levels over this one. But you know what, a simple (by that I don't mean one that shoves you into a gritty and grey line), fast-paced, short (5 hours) and well constructed first person shooter in the middle of time where you don't get much Doom-like games like this one is more than welcome. So I recommend it!","July 14, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There's a cool melee weapon but that only gets you so far. There's a sort of combo system where if you kill enough enemies within a subsequent amount of time you're able to do a strong unique finisher attack with the current weapon you're holding. The higher the kill combo the stronger your finisher can get until the indicated gauge hits the limit. However the enemies are so limited in number you don't get many chances to do them unless you know a level enough to find out where the next nearest enemy is supposed to be. The finishers themselves aren't all that cool to use or look at either unless used in an actual crowd which, again, there aren't much of.\n\nWith all that it's also kind of hard to call it a finished product when only one episode is present here.","November 19, 2015","false","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game shows so much potential with the idea of the "addivtive kill chain system" but the reality is that the gameplay just doesnt play towards the concept. Enemies are always in small groups so the killchain rarely gets too high and you never really feel like you get to use a the 'finishers' on anything or at any point that really matters. Couple this with the very limited amount of enemy types and the arguably too high HP which slows down the gameplay of most of the enemies, and you've got a pretty underwhelming game.\n\nI enjoy the concept, not huge fan of the visual but I see where it has its merits. Overall though unless you're really looking for a game that attempts (but fails) to capture the greatness set by DOOM, Quake, Painkiller, Serious Sam, then it's not really worth your time or money.","December 26, 2015","false","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It might be that I'm not really interested in 'kill-streak' or 'score' based gameplay, but without that, the fast-paced "action" really becomes monotonous. None of the weapons really feel like they PUNCH and, even with enemies all being gibbable, I was never really getting that crunchy sort of experience even Doom provided. The sword was really the only weapon I liked using but even it really had no MEAT to it. The levels were also really repetitive, with no instantly recognizable locales or great design.\n\nThe bosses are hyped up as Mega Man/Castlevania style encounters, but this really clashes heavily with the rest of the game's design, turning the combo/speed aspect upside down and forcing you into cramped arenas where your options are very limited.\n\nI dunno. If you're into speedrunning/wracking up score and kill streaks you might like this game, but if you just wanted an old-school FPS, there are better options.

It walks in with its cel-shaded graphics and its scoring system and says "Check me out! Bobby Prince did my soundtrack! Yeah, that guy who did Doom!" He doesn't say that the soundtrack that Bobby did for Doom mostly consisted of lazy metal covers.\n\nChrist, where do I start? The story first. It could have just been "Aliens invade Earth because they want our resources". But nooo, video games are art now, and therefore we have a story that starts out with "All the problems of Earth are solved because we have a magic space engine. Therefore, all military has been dismantled but SUDDENLY ALIENS ATTACK and all the characters look like human versions of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters."\n\nThe game wants to hold my hand and encourage me with its advice instead of getting out of the way and letting me kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monsters. "Look," it says via cutscene when I press the button to open the locked door. "There's a door that's opened three feet away from you! That's where you go to continue the game!" "Oh no, look out! That special boss has a laser attack that is really close to the floor! You should press space to jump over the laser!" Who is this game for again?\n\nThe level design is a succession of boring square rooms, the weapons are your standard pistol-shotgun-machine gun-rocket launcher, the unremarkable enemies blend in with the cel-shading and the wall textures, and sometimes there's lava pools below bridges in rooms because the developers are hoping you think that there's invisible guardrails on the bridges but SURPRISE! OLD-SCHOOL FPS ACTION STRIKES AGAIN, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S! The game's idea of a secret is jumping from one platform to an alcove in the wall over a pool of radioactive goo that barely hurts the player, and usually the reward is just more meaningless points and extra lives. The game is competent but unremarkable and sloppy in places. The scoring system is a mechanic designed to distract you from the game itself, which is a pretty bad sign!\n\nTo be fair, this game does evoke the feel of an old first person shooter very well. Unfortunately it's evoking the feel of one of the really boring old first person shooters.","December 2, 2014","false","1.3"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

There just weren't enough enemies and the damage feedback is so poor you could be at 125 health one moment and dead the next, discouraging ballsy tactics.

(Pretty much pasted in)\n\nI'm really happy about having a modern game with the gameplay of DOOM, and a number of elements were spot on. But I got really, really frustrated over the number of times I died due to first-person platforming over lava, and had to watch a long death animation as a result; usually *just* after shooting through a horde of enemies. At the very least, those challenges would be acceptable if all of the following changed: 1) The lives system were taken out, 2) The game's loading times and death system were tuned to allow for very quickly reattempting an area with no excessive transitions, a la Super Meat Boy (or, Quake on a modern computer)\nAdditionally; not a fan of such heavy camera sway when swinging the character's sword. I've felt it never adds to immersion, and just makes it harder to handle correctly.\n\nI actually kind of regret giving negative feedback on this, because I liked Quake even though my first time playing it was on Windows 7/8, long after any feelings of nostalgia could have first set in.

While somewhat limited, it manages to replicate that same Doom feeling, and it does it well. The game's soundtrack was even composed by the same person who worked on the Doom soundtrack.\n\nSupposedly, the plot and characters are supposed to be a big selling point for this game, however I found all of the characters to be mostly uninteresting, and I found myself completely ignoring everything everyone was saying and disregarding the cliche storyline this game brazenly calls a "plot" after about halfway through the second level. Most of the artwork for the story is missing, and by most I mean there is only like 3 completed images for the story, another three rough-uncolored-undetailed sketches, and about 15 completely blank screens with a disclaimer telling you that the content is missing because it's "beta", whatever that means. (doesn't it seem like every game is a beta nowadays?) But if you're like me, it would take you a long time to realize that since you'll just be skipping the cutscenes anyways. I must give credit to the developers for actually trying though, and maybe when (if?) this game is finished, the story will actually be worth caring about.\n\nThe game is short, I completed it in roughly two hours on the Hardcore difficulty. This is somewhat offset by the ability to create custom maps, however if you pay attention to the Steam workshop you will realize that nobody is making maps for this game. That means if you want to benefit from community-made custom maps to extend the life of this game, you're going to have to make all the maps yourself. There are about nine maps that are included with the game by default, and they're all actually very good. They only take around 15 - 20 minutes to complete though, so you're looking at around 2 - 3 hours of playtime here.\n\nThe weapons... Where do I start? The pistol is weak and it feels like you're shooting BBs when you use it, the Shotgun feels too sluggish and shotgun shells seemingly saturate every corner of every map, the Pulsar is only useful for killing the giant melee mechs or bosses (or in certain cases, taking out giant insta-swarms of enemies in pits that are specifically designed around having the pulsar) and against everything else it's blatant overkill, and the Rocket Launcher only becomes available on the last level and the explosion feels way too powerful compared to the extremely disappointing "poof" that the rockets make. The Hypersword, on the other hand, is genuinely satisfying to use, and it's rather fun taking down the melee mechs with a few well-timed swipes.\n\nDid I mention that shotgun shells fill every corner of every map? Because they do. It's actually challenging to run out of them.\n\nWhile many of the enemies are simply variants of enemies you've encountered previously, they're all rather well diversified and each one feels unique. However, since the game is so short, there are only five different types of enemies (a total of 9 if you count the variants). After about the first fifty minutes, the enemies cease to be interesting. In addition, many enemies are clearly incomplete, most notably the railgun troopers who have no firing, death, or fire+move animations. There is also a boss who's body stands up straight with its arms cast outwards in a T shape, which lacks any animations whatsoever.\n\nThe gameplay can be challenging at times, but generally once you've become comfortable with the controls the gameplay becomes very simple.\n\nSo in conclusion (tl;dr), ...\n\nDoes this game has potential? Yes.\nDoes this game has that proper "Doom"-esque feeling? Yes.\nDoes this game has a great story? HAHAHHAHA--no.\nIs this game enjoyable? Yes... for about two hours.\nIs this game worth $15? Not even close. Maybe $5 in its current state.\nIs this game worth checking out if you're a fan of Doom and Doom-esque games? Maybe.","February 14, 2014","false","2.2"," 15 of 49 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","15","49","0","2"

Albeit it's still in beta, the problems lie with the core of the game having the player run at insane speeds and mini jumping puzzles whos consequence is respawning at the start and all the enemies coming back to life.  Often times the pits of lava that do this to you are far to sneaky and common to have such a severe punishment for slipping in.  Next to that, the guns are unsatifying and can be sometimes confusing to tell if you're really hitting the enemy or not.  The difficulty scaling goes from a tutorial to all out war.  The character script is completely pointless to read and is stiff at best.  The music is repetitive and empty for the most part.\nI'll probably finish the game because I like shooting and I like switching my weapons, but in terms of being a good game that the target audience and even others can enjoy?  3/10","June 16, 2014","false","1.2"," 4 of 30 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","4","30","0","0"

It worked well for a while, but after a while, it stopped working. The first couple of bosses were awesome. A nice contrast to the whole "puzzle boss" thing about attack patterns and waiting for a vulnerable spot to show up. The boss I've stopped playing at is exactly this. Dodge attacks without being able to shoot back. This sucks! Well, I've stopped playing after feeling quite meh already. Lack visual variety does it's part, also the inability to jump over tiny enemies which are not taller than ledges I can jump is annoying, with those enemies swarming me, it sucks.","February 8, 2015","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's right.\nLet's elaborate with an example: Your pistol in this game can carry 300 bullets: 50 per clip and 6 clips. This means 50/250. But when you finish those 50 bullets SURPRISE. No reload. So you have to change the gun. So you fill in those 50 bullets and then start filling in the other clips. Sure, this only happens once, when you get the gun. But that's when you need the bullets the most and walking over clips on the ground makes you take them but not use them. So you'll end up with 250 bullets that you cannot use and you'll have to use other gun or the super big super slow sword that's very likely to get you killed.\n\nAnother problem is the extremely small space you have when you have to fight some big guys or even the final boss. I played many old school fast paced shooters so far but non had this problem. What's worse, the game usually lags like hell when it comes to these fights BUT ONLY THESE. You won't encounter this problem nowhere else in the game. And dropping from 120 FPS to 5-10 is something I cannot accept that easy.\n\nAnother stupid problem occurs when you quick reload a game.

Then, I would experience 5-10 seconds of low FPS before the game goes up to 100+ FPS. I made the mistake of saving in the middle of a fight and I had to chose an older save point because I was killed before I was able to do something. Again, unacceptable.\n\nI tried this game on 3 different PCs and had the same problem. And I had no issues with Bioshock Infinite, Far Cry 3, Tomb Raider, Shadow Warrior and so on, all maxed out.\n\nBut I am willing to give this game another chance, as soon as these bugs are fixed.","April 10, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

It has only eight levels which make for about five hours of gameplay, additionally every map can be played in Score- and Time Attack mode. More were supposed to be created with the packaged editor, but the Steam Workshop is empty, which might be due to the editor being also very old school and complex to use.\nThere is nothing wrong with the gameplay of Wrack, if you're looking for an old school FPS, but also does not bring much new: fast paced action with the only goal to reach the end of the level were a boss fight is waiting, on the way numerous mini bosses wait. The weapon selection is rather small, but everything needed is there. The only thing seemingly missing is a sniper rifle, but since the levels are build in a thight manner, its not really needed. The story is not that interesting and the comic cutscenes in between look like concept art, but the most annoying thing about it is cliffhanger ending where it is not clear if it will ever be resolved.\nIf you're looking for an old school first person shooter you will find a good good in Wrack, especially if you look for Score- and Time Attacking the levels.","May 1","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fast paced and action packed. The graphics are nice. And the levels are big, long, and challenging. It’s unfortunate that the developers are finished with Wrack and that the game is supposedly not getting any more updates or changes. The game only has 9 levels. The game does come with its own level editor/level creator, and it has Steam Workshop support, but it really needs more content. It’s also unfortunate that the game has no multiplayer whatsoever. It is a single player only game. Wrack is a game that would have been so much better if it had (online) multiplayer. It would also have been so much better if the game allowed the player to play randomly generated levels (in addition to the game’s main campaign). That would have been nice too. Wrack has its flaws and it could have been a lot better, but if you’re a fan of old school FPS games, you might like Wrack","June 2","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
