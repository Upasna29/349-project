I'm not sure if these are removed if the game is removed, but it is annoying. The game requires activation by key, which can only be done 3 times before you have to send an email to some third party to get more activations. The interface is terrible and unintuitive. The game graphics are fine.\n\nIf you're a hardcore chess fanatic this might be really interesting if you're willing to put in the time to learn how to use it. For casual players, there are many better alternatives out there.","October 3, 2015","false","11.0"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","3"

The whole layout is cumbersome and unintuitive. The AI presets are wildly imbalanced (IF you manage to find them in the first place). You will NEVER get a satisfying win from the Fritz engine because it resigns every time it gets into a position where you can force mate in several moves whether you saw it or not. The 3D engine is poor and hit or miss whether it works at all. It's not just a case of "you can do anything with this engine but it's not for beginners" it's more like "the engine is quality at its highest settings (other than the fact that full depth analysis seems to take forever) and it has a highly extensive openings system (that you will never work out how to learn from)". Even chess enthusiasts who are perhaps swayed by Fritz's background as a 'serious' program should steer clear. About the only novel addittion here are the funny voiceovers and even they become just annoying after a short while. Do yourself a favour and go pick up one of the old Chessmaster games instead.","October 5, 2015","false","0.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Prior to this I played fritz 5.32 as white and Windows chess as black. In friend mode the program is quite sharp without being impossible. I've only played 3 games so far and each of them was very instructive. Fritz pushes the margin and makes you think. It doesn't play mechanically where you have to survive 20 moves then it makes an obvious blunder. It plays a full game and not a gauntlet you have to survive through. The 3d chess pieces and manual board orientation offers the perfect viewing angle as if you yourself were leaning over a chess board pondering.\n\nIt offers a lot of tools for practice and such but I play chess for fun and am not too critical. The evaluation profile window and the main engine window with the control board are staples of fritz for reviewing your games to see how you did. For positions where you don't understand why the computer uses the line it does in the main engine window you can use the analysis options to analyse a given position and it will show the branches saying why this and that doesn't work.\n\nThe only downside to Fritz for Fun 13 is it only supports one core. The only real downside to that is you can't use the 8 core Houdini engine to evaluate an opening in great depth and see what works and what doesn't(This is assuming you know the basic openings e.g. kings gambit declined, pirc, english, dutch ect.). You can get around that however by downloading the Arena GUI and running 8 core houdini from that.\n\nConclusion: Perfect game if you like playing chess for fun; this is to say you play to match your wits against the computer and not to memorize chess databases and pantomime.\n\nAfter playing 13 games against the engine I found the friend mode to be too soft compared with fritz 5.32. You can blunder your way through a game and still win. With 5.32 I've played about 500 games and win on average 1 in 5. With fritz 13 I've played 13 games and have won 4 and lost 1. The longest time spent on one move might be 5 minutes. Longest game might be 20 minutes. I've played 50 minute games against 5.32 because it creates more difficult positions and if you make a single mistake you lose unless you are better than the base engine which I am not. Also it seems the fritz 13 engine has disappeared entirely. I only have the option to use the fritz 6 engine. The only way I have been able to get it back is to do a second install with the setup file which spreads files across multiple hard-drives.\n\nI played another game against fritz and lost my queen at the beginning of the game and was down -6 and still managed to end up with a draw. I think I was even +3 eventually. I played another game where I had hanging pieces(trying out a new chess set) and the computer didn't capture them. Brutally obvious captures on the control board the computer ignores.\n\nAside from the generosity of fritz there is one particular position that I have difficulty playing against computers and that is roaming queen positions. e.g. Rook, minor piece, 2 pawns vs a queen with other pawns on the board. It's difficult simply because of the number of moves a queen can make on an open board and the computer calculates them all instantly. e.g. move 1 it can make five viable moves. Move two it can make 5 viable moves from each of its previous 5 viable moves. Continuing with induction by move 4 there is 625 move combinations(identifying the permutations is labor intensive). Harmonizing pieces and taking advantage of the fact the queen can't be traded still results in a difficult position where one of 625 possible positions being a fork can result in a loss. There is no end game exercise for this.","June 17, 2015","true","16.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Has everything you could want in one, including a strong engine, fully customizable experience, and a pleasing interface.  Much of the information it provides is written in plain language, and it also comes with some computer personalities, which makes practice a fun and safe environment.  Fritz for Fun 13 is the only chess program you'll need, whether you come as a casual or pro player.\n\nFritz Chess 14 is also available on Steam, but after having done extensive research, I can tell you that it's not worth the higher price tag.","June 27, 2015","true","10.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

They are doubtless "better" engines in terms of being able to beat Fritz 13, but even on the weedy hardware (an AMD A4 cpu) I run Windows on and even though it is limited to using only one CPU, Fritz 13 is looking at many millions of positions a second, and has checked every one within 20 moves within very few seconds. This means that unless you are a grandmaster, on its best settings it will destroy you every single time.\n\nSo why get it?\n\nWell, you don't have to play it on its best settings - it can adapt its level of play to yours - and, more usefully, you can use it to learn how to beat other humans by showing where you're going wrong.\n\nDon't forget to read the help files: there's a lot of impressive things this can do.","October 1, 2015","true","54.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get the Fritz interface which is great and has with lots of options and utilities. The engines it comes with are single core but still very strong. You can easily install any UCI engines you want and there are plenty of good ones out there like Houdini 1.5, Komodo 4, Stockfish etc. You might want liquid cooling if you run all of your cores though - they get pretty warm looking at 10 million positions/second. I even found some user designed 2d pieces you can install in you're fonts directory.\n\nOn the downside deleting games in the database and uninstalling/reinstalling didn't work as expected. I prefer a program to remove everything (files, registry entries etc.) when you uninstall. Because it didn't I deleted some files manually and when I reinstalled they didn't get installed so I ended up using a system restore.\n\nOverall it's best chess software I've used so far with a good interface, lots of features and flexibility.","September 23, 2015","true","71.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

This is truly a great chess program, with a smart opponent AI that adapts to your playstyle and an extensive database with plenty of games analysed. The interface is clean but takes a little bit to get used to. And there's also checkmate challenges. In sum, this is a collection of tools designed to help everyone get better at chess in an intuitive way.","October 9, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
