Then you work your way to better, and better fishing grounds via a dungeon. to help protect you while fishing you may purchase armor from merchants (with money you get from fishing!) or use the fish you catch to put a spell on your dog/cat to turn it into a more powerful creature to protect you from those who want to steal your fish.\n\n10/10 would fish again.","November 8, 2014","true","16.4"," 67 of 77 people (87%) found this review helpful 79 people found this review funny","87","67","77","79","0"

You catch an fish, and then find a fish inside of it, and keep THAT fish. (then for some reason you let the other one go.) You can find an item that takes up 8 inventory spaces inside of a fish (which only takes up 1 inventory space). This is a great dungeon-crawling game. I owned this game a while ago and then lost it. I got it on steam, and it is just as magnificant as I remember it. You can play for hours and hours on end; completeing quests, diving deep, and coming face-to-face with your greatest nemisis; yourself. Here are some of the ups and downs of the game:\n\nThe ups,\n+Play for hours, you can play up to level 2,305 if you wish. There is no limit to how powerfull you can become.\n+customize your character from a variety of races, each with it's own buffs\n+choose a pet companion from a bizzare selection of animals\n+go fishing and laugh at the hilarious things you catch (The majority of this games humor is in it's fishing and the references scattered throughout the world. For example, I once came across a semi-boss named Baron the Red, I also found a glowing red sword called the LITE SABRE, and another glowing blue sword called the LIGHT SWORD)\n+customize your charcter with skills, abilities, armor, and magic that suits your playstyle.\n+excellent replay value, when you tire of one character, you can retire and choose an heirloom from your inventory to pass down to you heir.\n\nThe downs,\n-very repetitive\n-You have to choose a specific path very early on in the game (Sword, hammer, shield battle, attack magic, charm magic, etc.) you can't really switch between paths later in the game, as you are almost forced to stick with one weapon the whole way through, otherwise your charcter will be ineffective.\n-not much of a story, there is an interesting narration followed by concept art in the begining, but from there on out, it's just run through the dungeon, complete quests, and level up.\n-The enchanters, (The NPC's who add buffs to weapons) are absolute jerks in this game. The money they charge for enchantment is outragous, and if they fail to enchant something the first time, (or accidentily drain all of the powers from your item) they simply keep your money and leave you with squat. So if you get the game, take my advice: If you choose to enchant something, make sure it is something you can possibly afford to part with. Enchanters can drain you more than the gamblers in this game. But at least with gambling you have something relativly valuable to walk away with when you lose.\n\nAll and all, I would give this game an 8/10. It is certainly a must-have for fans of dungeon-crawling or Role-playing games. NOTE: If you want this game, get ONLY this game, and not the first two FATE's because this game is all those games combined into one, so getting them all would bbe a waste of money.","October 29, 2014","true","84.3"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","90","43","48","30","0"

Fun, delightful, charming. It's a magnificent game, and there's so much to do! One of the best and most enjoyable games I've ever played. It was an instant buy when I saw it here again, even though I already have an official copy from WildTangent's own service.\n\nThe music, the graphics, the gameplay...it's all wonderful. I can't say enough about how much I love it. Plus you get to choose various races and animal companions, including a fox! They make authentic noises and the companion really adds a tremendous amount to the game. It is generally a very accessible game, not overcomplicated, but you can get into really exciting complexity with gear, magic, and the stats that suit your play preferences.\n\nThe Traitor Soul is a game I have literally played for years, and I've never grown tired of it. It's easy to pick up, play a bit, and put down...or play for hours and lose yourself in its absorbing adventures. There is literally limitless appeal and lasting gameplay value! At this price it's a steal, so please do yourself a favour and pick up FATE: The Traitor Soul today. It will be a faithful companion to you forever.","August 27, 2014","true","1.6"," 55 of 74 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","55","74","2","0"

But it should be of special interest to anybody who happens to be a fan of both Diablo II and Torchlight.  FATE is like the missing link that came between those two games.\n\nSadly, the only reason for my thumbs-down here is to help purchasors beware it's become impossible for most users to play any of the FATE games anymore under Windows 10.\n\nSo I'd just hold onto your wallets for now:  Don't  assume that since your other games are still running smoothly after you upgraded to Windows 10 that any of the FATE series will.  It won't!\n\nFATE unfortunately just has critical compatibility issues now with Windows 10; can't get any further than the first menu or so for most users without a crash to desktop no matter what tips they try.\n\nIt's a shame to lose being able to play such a classic as FATE.   So I'm still hoping for a Steam/Wildtangent fix.  But until then, I'd just continue to watch this space.","September 21, 2015","false","1.8"," 51 of 76 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","51","76","6","6"

One or some of the devs who worked on FATE later formed Runic Games, who brought us the Torchlight series, with the similarities between the two games being exremely evident. So Torchlight is the sexy game you wanna play, and FATE is the MILF.

Way back when Torchlight 2 was developed I kept on hearing that it borrowed some things like pets and fishing from this series. I don't look at this game with Nostalgia glasses as I just recently discovered it and though you will want some modern conveniences brought by the newer ARPGs, this game is pretty addictive. The game does not force you to go through Acts and you could just play it your own way. The way to describe it is like how the Supernatural TV show describes purgatory "you fight for the sake of fighting, loot for the sake of looting, play for the sake of having fun and everything felt so pure." The game just feels so pure, pure that it only focuses on what makes these type of games fun. I really wish I stumbled upon this series when I was younger. At the price it is selling it is highly recommended.\n\nMy only concern though is I don't know if its possible to access the grove main quest in this game. If only the developers would enable you to access all the main quest and all the dungeons and wrap the series up in to one neat package containing the contents from Fate, Undiscovered Realms, Traitors soul, and Cursed King.","September 2, 2014","true","5.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/felis_noctu/recommended/303680/","felis_noctu","A Cat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/felis_noctu/","599 products in account","A simple game that needs (or gives) very little explanation. Think of it as Torchlight 0.5, the father of the much more well known series. It consists of a practically endless dungeon, classless freeform character building, and the ability to retire characters in order to roll their best items onto another character. The dungeons are randomly generated, as are the side quests. This means that really the only static quests you'll see are the ones to defeat "so-and-so" boss on "such-and-such" floor of Dungeon #, as well as the unspoken ones such as returning the Heroic items back to their respective Hero Statues for a reward.\n\nIf you're looking for an in-depth story feel free to move along, but for those satisfied with some casual hack and slash, you're in the right place! Don't let my hours played fool you, I only just recently picked up the Steam version, I've sunk a decently sized portion of my life into the original with a boxed version, and Traitor Soul is all that and more!\n\nOverall, Fate is good for a casual dungeon crawl when you aren't in the mood for something requiring more thought. It can be paused at any time, and you can save and exit anywhere you like to continue exactly where you left off later. There are some slight targeting issues that I've noticed, but nothing significantly gamebreaking.\n\nWhile I wouldn't necessarily recommend it at full price due to its age, Fate's a worthy purchase when it hits sale prices for those who want to take a quick relaxing adventure into a deep and dangerous dungeon with few demands and plenty of freedom.\n\n-----\n\nDespite recent reviews, the game DOES in fact work on Windows 10, however it takes a little bit of effort on the owner's part. Fixing it up requires running the game once in order to initialize, letting it crash (yes, it will crash), then following the instructions found at Wild Tangent's support site: https://support.wildtangent.com/hc/en-us/articles/205720935-FATE-on-Windows-10 with a slight correction, the game's folder you're looking for is "FateTheTraitorSoulSteam".\n\nThe short form of this is to take the config.dat file found at the bottom of their support post and deposit it into the correct ProgramData folder (in the case of Steam's version of Traitor Soul, C:\ProgramData\WildTangent\FateTheTraitorSoulSteam\persistent). You can then open this file in notepad (or your favorite text editor) and edit the first, second, and fourth lines. These are the screen resolution and fullscreen options.\n\nWhat's making the game crashing is that Windows 10 doesn't like such a low resolution full screen application taking over the screen. Setting a higher resolution and/or disabling fullscreen does the trick. This fix works for ANY of the Fate games.\n\nAs well, if you're into modding your game and want to add a bit more oomph (and content, such as being able to fully adventure through the first Fate's Grove), there are a couple more things you can grab.\n\nThe first: Heron's Fate Fanpatch 1.0 ( http://fatemods.shivtr.com/forum_threads/1590087 )\nThis adds additional content, removes some redundant things, and smooths out some bugs. Be sure you pick up the FTS 1.0 file, NOT the FUR 1.5 file. The latter is for Undiscovered Realms, which is unnecessary in this case (and the wrong game besides).\n\nThe second: Heron's World of Fate 2.9 ( http://fatemods.shivtr.com/forum_threads/1590084 )\nThis includes quite a bit of extra content as well as enabling some of the content found in an older, no-longer-available compilation of the first three Fate games combined. It also reorders zones and their level ranges in order to give the game a better flow as you test your fate across the various realms.\n\nInstall them in that order, Fanpatch first, then World of Fate, and you'll be good to go!\n\nKeep in mind that there's no guarantee that you'll be able to import your character into Cursed King if you use these mods, but due to the nature of the 4th Fate game that may not necessarily be a negative. Fate CK is more of a sequel than an expansion and while it gives the option to import your characters from Traitor Soul, you should feel gently encouraged to start anew.","January 11","true","14.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Most people may find this game childish and/or repetitive though so are torchlight and Diablo.\nAnyways unfortunately due to windows 10 update the game no longer works for windows 10 users as well as any other FATE Games no longer work because of windows 10, compatibility does not work for this either hopefully it will be fixed at some point!

Yes, it can get repetitive, and yes there are some BS situations you can get yourself into, but becasue it lacks any real story you get a true dungeon crawler where your objective is not to save the princess or become the king, or even kill the devil. What you get is a game that is simple and uncomplicated.\n\nBasicly you kill things. Alot of things.\n\nI like this game becasue its simple and a nice break from bad plot writing and terrible mechanics that plague a lot of games that have come out recently, and you don't need DLC to enjoy it fully.
