"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thordred/recommended/46520/","thordred","Thordred","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thordred/","2085 products in account","This game somehow reminds me of the mid-90s sci-fi flick Tank Girl, but maybe the similarity begins and ends with the post-apocalyptic setting, the cartoonish art style and the main characters, both girls whose favourite activity seems to be shooting mutants. You take on the role of Angel, who drives around in her car and saves the inhabitants of post-world war III settlements from mutant attacks. So much for the backstory.\n\nGameplay wise, Wasteland Angel is a no-nonsense top-down shooter. You're looking at a desert landscape from an isomotric perspective, drive around with a car whilst shooting at other cars that likewise shoot at you. That's pretty much all there is. Your main armament consists of two fixed guns, additional weapons can be aquired by driving over power-ups. Each level has three stages and, after you defeat the stages final boss in the third, a short bonus stage that leaves the top-down view and switches to a first-person perspective. The game never breaks from this pattern.\n\nYour car can be controlled with the keyboard or a controller, both work equally well and what you prefer is just a matter of personal preference.\n\nI chose to write a negative review but that doesn't mean there's no fun to be had. There certainly is. There's nothing wrong with the simplistic approach to vehicular combat, driving around in a car blasting everything in sight. The game plays smoothly, the controls are responsive and intuitive, there's nothing bad to say about the sound effects, music and voice-overs and the visuals, while definitely not on par with bigger budget titles, are pretty much what can be expected from an indie game, at least they won't give you eye cancer.\n\nThe main problem with Wasteland Angel is that its initial appeal wears thin all too fast. It's incredibly repetitive. Every level offers the exact same scenario, level structure, you're fighting the same enemies again and again, even the environment looks exactly the same in every level.\n\nThe game is very short and not particularly challenging. You can easily play through the whole game in one session. While most players probably consider this a downside, achievement hunters might appreciate the fourty easily obtainable unlocks.","December 19, 2013","false","10.6"," 75 of 81 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","75","81","0","2"

But... it wasn't to be. Having had quite a bit of fun with top-down drivers in the past, be they racers or shooters, I had high hopes for Wasteland Angel. While it wasn't the worst game I've ever played, the game still disappointed on almost every front. Although... if you are an achievement hunter, the 40 achievements are not TOO difficult to acquire...\n\nThe campaign is only 6 chapters/levels divided into 2 missions, one boss fight, and one bonus mission - very short indeed. The plot was essentially irrelevant. Worse yet, the game is incredibly repetitive and boring. Every chapter plays the same way, with the same enemies painted differently - only 3 generic enemy types, doing the same thing, over and over. And you, defending against them for wave on end. The maps are stale and all have the same objective: defend one area. Once during the day, once during the night, and then the same thing with two towns... Even the additional/optional objectives don't really bring anything interesting to the game: escort a vehicle to the town, pick up some crates, become a turret. However, the bonus missions are all the same and incredibly strange: changing you from a top-down view to a first-person view, where you either race for checkpoints or kill as many enemies as you can.\n\nWhile the game offers weapon upgrades, they are arbitrary and do not carry over from a past map - every mission sees you start with the most basic weapons. Killing enemies and running over pick-ups automatically gives you more/better weapons. Sadly, you are unable to tinker with either your vehicle, or your weapons yourself.\n\nThen there were the bugs. Being stuck in mid-air, enemy AI resulting in them being stuck and unable to move, and therefore unable to be killed (especially the bosses). This is complemented by the top-down camera angle, which can be blocked by terrain, causing you to get stuck. The automatic 180 degree reversal whenever you reach the edge of the map (which also isn't particularly well delineated) was also disorientating. These issues were exacerbated by the controls: while it may not be the case for everybody, the controls were very sluggish and laggy for me, making it incredibly difficult to turn.","August 6, 2014","false","4.1"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","0"

My big issue is that the game has some bugs in it that render it unfun to play. For example my score at one point reached the max possible. (That is possible without cheats, this game is fairly easy) and apon killing more people it reached the negatives from going over the limit and then after going to far into the negatives was reset to 0. This happened 2 times in my playing of  the campaign. This means the leaderboards are useless if you play so well that your score can reset.

The Wasteland Angel doesn't have a name, so let's call her Mad Maxine. Her car Gypsy is built like a tank, ready to take on World War 3....oops? WW3 already happened and everybody lost. The scant remnants of humanity are just trying to survive under the crushing weight of evil. As the vigilante heroine you gotta protect the cities and kill all the bad guys.\n\nThis game has been making the rounds on various indie bundle sites. It's likely that you already have it (and you don't even know). My suggestion is to give it a shot and here's why:\n\nFirst and foremost this is an arcade-styled game. There's a scoring system, multipliers, bonus points, all that good stuff. Your primary objective is the survival of both yourself and 100 civilians. The enemies arrive in various vehicles and they're either targeting you, the civvies, or both. Regularly out-numbered (but never out-gunned) you make short work of everyone as they arrive in waves. Any leftover time in-between waves is best spent recharging in the city for bonus points. Occasionally secondary objectives will pop up. They are of the "do this" or "destroy that" variety.\n\nAside from the first-person bonus rounds, Wasteland Angel uses an overhead view. It's pretty easy to track the action and indicators will light up if enemies are kidnapping people. Destroyed vehicles tend to drop power-ups. I'd probably be a little worried if everyone happened to have an air strike or a nuke in their car but eh...it's a videogame. Every few stages there's a boss fight. They're pretty standard, though they can only be damaged by power-ups (napalm, mines, etc).\n\nFor the most part Wasteland Angel does the job. It's a fun game. Destroying those stupid bad-guys is satisfying, especially when it involves dropping a nuke on 6-7 of them. After you destroy their vehicles you can gun them down. The controls are satisfactory, and with 20+ stages and leaderboards there's no lack of content.\n\nHOWEVER. There is room for improvement. First and foremost, Wasteland Angel runs a bit long for an arcade-styled game. While playing single stages for score is fine, going through the entire campaign is going to take a few hours. Even with the option to save and quit between stages, this isn't quite ideal. I'm thinking instead of one long campaign, just cut it up into three or four. Also in the interest of pacing, each stage would have less but more intense waves.\n\nAnother issue is that the controls could be better. Well maybe better isn't the right word. Maybe uh...more technical? Technique? Ehh I'll think of a better word later. Anyway I'm thinking that Gypsy could use some more moves. While getting around the wasteland is fine as is, some tricks would help getting in getting out of screwy situations. It would also give the developers more room to try more ideas. For example, maybe the RB & LB buttons could be used for doing barrel rolls. Yeah I know "Do a barrel roll!" is hilarious & timely but seriously. Give the car a flippy move for dodging dangerous crap like missiles. Or if it looks like you're going to hit a building and crash just WHOOSH look at all the time you're saving. As a bonus, pressing LB & RB together could result in a 180 spin. The controls in this game are responsive as is, but more abilities couldn't hurt.\n\nUpdating the controls would also lead to better boss-fights I imagine. The few in Wasteland Angel 1 are lacking. The first couple are indirect fights. By this I mean you're dropping mines or napalm for them to run into, you're not actively fighting them. The current level of maneuverability just isn't enough to take these big guys head-on. Also there's a fight with a super mutant. I guess it's kinda direct in that you actually have to shoot him, but that's only after dropping an EMP to stun him for a couple seconds. Also the tank boss can be annoying, since it prefers to hang back and snipe at you rather than run over all the fresh mines you've laid out for him.\n\nAlso this probably counts as more of a nitpick but there have been a couple occasions, where I got stuck on something. There was also a time an enemy seemingly disappeared, but it didn't count as destroyed so I lost out on bonus points. Some of the stages are also a little too cluttered and lack the proper amount of "flow". Maybe for a sequel, they could use a base design for each stage. It doesn't have to be something obvious like a circle, but it has to be easily indentifiable to the player so they're not driving into a seemingly random wall just to rescue some hapless civilians.\n\nOh and make it so it's easier to run enemies over.\n\nStill, Wasteland Angel isn't too bad a game. It has the right concept, a solid core, it just needs some tweaks and it could turn out to be something really good.\n\nYMMV\n\nPS - Everytime I type "Wasteland Angel" I keep accidentally typing "Wastleand". Yeah I don't know either.","September 10, 2014","true","2.9"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The game seems to have a story but it's overall forgettable as the game itself is a simple arcade-style setting throwing wave after wave of enemies at you.\n\nSome of the enemies just try to kill you, other ones sort of "dock" to your settlement and try to kidnapp the people from it while you have to prevent them from doing so by killing them of course. Then there is a third type of enemy that can be either of the two types but you can't tell in advance because of their look.\n\nThat's quite all there is. Between waves you can replenish your health and often killed enemies leave power-ups behind that give you a better shot or more ammo.\n\nAs I said before this game could easily be called dumb but it tends to be that way by design. So I personally wouldn't call it dumb but arcade-ish. Just like in the good old days. Don't think - just shoot.\n\nOne thing that is annoying though is the standard joypad-setup, but once you set it to "standard-PSX-style" controls (for eg x is gas, shoulder buttons for shooting) it's ok and very direct with no mentionable input lag.\n\nOne big advantage of this game is that is seems to support any gamepad you throw at it and not just the x-box one which I found very nice since I tend to use a "Thrustmaster Modena Vibrating U-Pad" that I got pretty used to by now and while the game does support this by default I hadn't to fiddle around with xpadder or something else to get it up and running.\n\nI would recommend this game for people who like oldschool arcade style shooters. Maybe not for full price but for sure when it's on sale, just like it is atm I'm writing this.\n\nI liked games like this back in the days and I'm still happy to find new games like this nowadays.\n\nIf you're serious about wether you would like it too just try the demo.

The game has some style but its cliched, and and only skin deep, much like the gameplay, which is arguably some fun but quickly becomes repetitive, the graphics are servicable but underwhelming, kinda wish they made the whole game in the anime style of the cutscenes instead of this outdated 3D. AI is kind of dumb but comes in large numbers maintaining some challenge. Story is barely enough to give context to why you sometimes switch arenas to slightly harder to defend maps as you progress through the "campaign" but it stays within the theme of the post apocalpyse. Multiple difficulty levels - controller friendly - passable background music and score. The noise of the engine when you thrust constantly becomes grating on the nerves.

You are Angel, a beautiful but tough woman travelling around the post-apocalytpic United States in search of your friend, Eks, in your armoured car 'Gypsy'. As you travel around, you encounter towns under attack by Wastelanders and you help to defend them.\n\nYou are able to pick up weapon upgrades and special weapons to help you do this, and there is a wide variety of each, though the by far most useful is your main weapon, as most of the rest require good placement and the enemy AI is erratic at best. One of the problems with the weapon upgrade system is that eventually your main gun becomes powerful enough you can quite literally pick a spot and just rotate on it like a turret. Thankfully, weapon upgrades do not carry from one stage to the next.\n\nWasteland Angel, is, however one a game added to the list of games where the minigames are better than the actual game. At the end of each stage is a bonus level, which takes the game from isometric to first person, which I found a lot more fun than the base missions themselves.\n\nThe game's physics engine is... well... it's VERY arcady to say the least. Often times collisions cause your car to spin out of control, way beyond what would be reasonable. Fortunately there is a reset button to right yourself fairly quickly, though a lot of time this can mean failing to save and/or running over civilians. Worse yet, often times enemy cars will get 'stuck' offscreen, preventing you from finishing the wave until a car from the next wave hits them to get them unstuck.\n\nGraphically the game is okay. It isn't spectacular, but I have definitely seen a lot worse. The audio is decent, and the voice acting is comically bad but I am left with the impression that this is on purpose. The music gets irritating VERY quickly, but a lot of the time I didn't notice. I had tuned it out because I was focusing on the sometimes very frantic gameplay.\n\nThe game is very short. I was able to complete the game and collect all 40 achievements in just under 4 hours. It has the length and the equivalent overall quality to a mobile game, therefore while it is a lot of fun I think $9.99 is asking a little bit too much.

Game is super repetitive and boring. You drive the same car around generic towns on a generic wasteland towns and shoot the same cars every level. There is no progress at all. You get temporary upgrades every level but they don't last. There are 3 different enemy types, and you fight those three the entire game. Even if they get different skins, their function is the exact same. Every 4 levels you get one new weapon you can pick up, but they usually aren't that helpful as you drop them and the enemy has to run over them. It just gets boring that you do the same thing from the first to the last level. There are a few boss fights, but they recycle the same bosss twice in a row, so even though there are 7 different stages you only fight 4 different bosses, talk about lazy design. Also the bosses are buggy. Sometimes when I would use the emp against a boss it would work and stun him for 10 seconds, other times he'd be stunned for 1 second, and other times it wouldn't do anything, taking away consistency. Same with another boss where I had to lay mines and sometimes they would explode and hurt him and other times he'd run over them and nothing would happen. There are bonus levels which you play first person but they get old after the first one as they are basically all the same, killing guys or picking things up, and they powers suck in 1st person, so I usually purposefully failed them after a little bit. There is really no story, just you driving across the country protecting towns from having their citizens abducted, but that's not really a story. Weak attempt by the developers. Any variation in enemies, objectives, any sense of progression, different weapons, different locations........really anything would have helped this game not be as crappy as it was.

One of the bonus levels make it virtually impossible to lose, and I was racking up points for over 15 minutes..but after you hit the max points, your score resets into the negatives.

In that time I've cleared it's story mode and gotten all of its achievements (the first Steam title I've managed to get all achievements on; go me!)\n\nBut is it worth your time? Absolutely. There's a decent amount of content here, given you can get the game at a low cost (for example, with a coupon) but at it's normal cost it's not necessarily worth it. So keep that in mind.\n\nThe game is basically a twin stick arcade shooter. You drive with WASD, and shoot with your left mouse button and the right mouse button uses special weapons. You drive around, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, save civilians, and collect power-ups. It's pure mindless fun, with no completed story, or level up systems, or anything of the like. It's plain simplicity, which you need sometimes.\n\nThe levels also culminate in big boss battles, with the first two being relatively easy and the last boss (whom you fight twice) being a big pain in the ♥♥♥. You also get four difficulties (I played on Medium) and leaderboards if you're the sort who strives to be the best at the game. And you also get bonus levels at the end of the normal levels, which are played from a first person perspective. If you ask me there should be an option to play the whole game like this as it is pretty fun. There's a racing, survival, and frenzy that come up at specific points in the game.\n\nAll in all, it's not the greatest game out there but I truly recommend it to anyone who might be interested.","May 29, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The feel of the game (not the gameplay) reminds me a bit of Death Rally, though not as polished.  The car handles a bit strangely at first but I got used to it pretty quickly.  The game revolves around defending wasteland settlements from mutant slavers, who come in waves and try to steal your citizens.  Every couple levels you will fight a boss, followed by a bonus level.  For some reason the bonus levels use a first person camera and I wish it was an option to switch between the two modes.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is quite simple.  Waves of enemies come at you, and you must destroy them before they destroy you or steal your citizens.  Only certain vehicles can steal citizens so you have to keep an eye out for them.  You can recover citizens by destroying the vehicles before they can get away, but then the citizens are vulnerable to being run over and gunfire, and will often be accidentally killed by you just by destroying the vehicle.\n\nOverall it's some quick fun.  It doesn't take long to complete so I wouldn't say it's worth $10 but when it's on sale, it's not a bad deal.","March 18, 2013","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're looking for a quick desctraction from a AAA title, then you could do a lot worse than this game.\n\nArm your car with weapons, power-ups and amror. Point in the direction of the enemy vehicles and shoot away. Getting power-ups is addictive, as is using the special weapons to destroy the enemy cars. Gameplay is repetitive. Missions are mainly defending town population from slavers. There are a few that are variations: such as first-person drive-by levels and the kill or be killed boss levels. Six camapign stages provides 4-6 hours of play in story-mode, but you can play to beat the leaderboards on a per level basis afterwards.\n\nOverall the game is one of those easy to overlook, but if you take a chance in a sale it will give you a good few hours of destructive fun.

Well, Half of my keybinds for controller are "Left thumbstick" and "Right Thumbstick" and the other half doesn't have any keys bound to them (Because the key mapping just didn't work very well).\n\nThe KB+M problem could be because of poor coding in game.

You drive around killing enemies, collecting power-ups and preventing the enemies from taking your people.

The levels end with a boss which you have to take down in a special way. After that you get a bonus round, in first person view. That's actually quite fun, but a bit shallow as you do the exact same thing you did before, except that you don't have to defend this time, just kill.

Quit hacking terminals in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Don’t pass out waiting on Half Life 2 episode 3. Yes these games are amazing, but if you only play Triple A titles, then you are sure to miss out on what I am calling the most fun game that I have played this year, Wasteland Angel.Wasteland Angel - weaponized cars? Alright!\n\nWasteland Angel is the first release for game developer Octane Games, and what a heck of a way to come out of the gate. This game has everything that it you need to make an awesome game: guns, cars, apocalypse, huge bosses, power ups, and most importantly…..FUN.\n\nNow some of you may remember reading the preview for this game a couple months ago. To be perfectly honest, after writing that, I stopped playing this game. The slew of big name games coming out this year grabbed my attention and I was sucked in. But upon the full release of Wasteland Angel, I went back to see what had changed. Immediately, my memory was jogged and I have been playing this game non-stop.\n\nWasteland Angel Story\n\nAfter World War 3, the world fell into chaos. Most everyone had died in the war, but those who lived had to fight for survival. Some survivors formed gangs, some joined an evil militia, and were mutated into grotesque creatures by the excess radiation in the world. All of these people had one goal. To kidnap, kill, and steal supplies from the innocent people who huddled together in small towns and villages in the post-war wasteland.This is where you come into play. You take the role of Angel; a butt kicking heroine who is in search of a lost friend. She is driving across the country in heavily armored and weaponized vehicle that she lovingly calls Gypsy. As she makes her way across the country and stops at these towns to search for her friend, Angel takes a moment to help the townspeople out and fight off the never ending swarm of villainous thieves that try to steal what they have both day and night.\n\nWasteland Angel Gameplay\n\nThis game is the best driving shooter since Twisted Metal 2. The top down view lets you see what is coming from every direction. At the beginning of every level, waves of enemies will set out to destroy you and the city. As you fight, you can earn weapon power ups and armor upgrades to help you in your fight.\n\nYour trusty ride Gypsy starts out with twin mounted machine guns. As you earn upgrades you increase your rate of fire, shoot incendiary ammo, and even go as far as to mount an additional machine gun and rocket launcher to the car. All of these upgrades will make the game total carnage on the easiest setting, but on harder difficulties they are absolutely necessary to survive.\n\nThe enemies will have different vehicles as you make your way across the country. On the West Coast, the baddies drive dune buggies and vans. But as you make your way to Middle America you will start to see rednecks driving tractors and school buses. Even though the vehicles look different, you have 3 basic classes of enemies.\n\nKillers have only one purpose; to shoot and kill you. These enemies are fast and have mounted guns of their own. Slavers are bigger vehicles (large vans and school buses) that have no weapons with which to harm you. But don’t take them for granted. These guys will pull up to the city walls and start to load up the innocent towns folk. If you don’t kill these guys quick they will drive off with all of your people. One type of enemy the game refers to a “Duals”. I prefer to call them sneaky buggers. Duals can perform either of the tasks of the first two types of enemies. They are mounted with heavier weapons than the killers, but they also can kidnap the people. These vehicles should be watched closely.\n\nEvery section of America that you stop at consists of 4 levels. The first two levels are basically the same. In both, you must defend the town. The only real difference I can see is that the first level is in the daylight and the second takes place at night. The third level is always the boss fight. Bosses are massive vehicles with a ridiculous amount of health and hugely overpowered weapons. To beat these guys will take more than just your guns. It will take super weapons.\n\nSuper weapons are limited in number, and there is a huge variety of these to pick up. From land mines to napalm, from EMPs to Atom bombs, these weapons will be your best defence against the never ending hoard of enemies and powerful bosses.\n\nThe fourth and final level of every section takes a different course. Instead of being from a top down view point like the other levels, the “Bonus level” puts you in the driver seat of Gypsy. This is probably my favorite type of level on the game. And with the constantly changing enemies, and gameplay types, this game never gets old.\n\nWasteland Angel Improvements\n\nWhen I played the preview copy of Wasteland Angel, I thought I was playing the final version of the game. This left me with a little disappointment because of a couple bugs in the initial release. But coming back and playing the full release of the game, it seems that Octane Games has stepped it up.\n\nThere used to be several glitches in the game; including one that prevented you from firing your weapons on some of the later levels of the game. The new release seems to have all of these glitches fixed. It is so nice to see a game be released in good form these days with all of the kinks ironed out before you play.\n\nThere also seems to be some graphical improvement. I played both the Preview and the full game on the exact same PC. The full game looks so much smoother and the lighting effects look 10 times better. The only setting that the developer added was a shader setting. But I am sure that they must have done something behind the scenes to make this game look so much better.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI feel sorry for people who look down on indie games. I have played a lot of big name titles this year from big developers, and a lot of independent releases from small companies. Nine times out of ten, the big companies are motivated by profits and will release games that are full of bugs and glitches knowing full well that you will buy them because of their name. But indie developers don’t get a second chance from people, so when they put out a game, most of the time it is high quality. Of all the games I have played this year, some have been intense, some have been thrilling, and some have been down right crap. But of all of them, Wasteland Angel is pure unadulterated fun. I guess we forget sometimes that fun is what gaming is all about.\n\nReasonably priced at $9.99, and 20% off for a limited time, you can’t go wrong with this purchase. Hope you guys get to have the fun that I did with this game.","June 19, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

All of the main levels follow the same formula of defending civilians from attackers, then a boss fight which requires using different mechanics to defeat. Following the boss, there are first person modes for racing and fighting. Those are a nice break from the town saving missions. Controlling the player vehicle is easy to grasp, but there are some rough edges with physics and some objects/walls in the game (the tank boss also got stuck a couple of times). The achievements are very easy to scoop up, if you're into that. I was able to get 35/40 in my first session, and another hour or so to finish the campaign granted another perfect game.

Maybe the dictionary definition of such. I love shoot em ups and Wasteland Angel is a lesson in how to make a good one. You have an awesome vehicle, loads of enemies, powerful weapons, a clear objective in each level beyond just killing everything, huge bosses and even a halfway decent story to tie it all together. It seems to end on a bit of a cliffhanger, so here's hoping for a sequel. It's also one of the few games I've gotten every achivement in, so it holds a place in my heart for that reason. Plus, the protagonist is cute and she drives a Mustang. What more do you want?","February 13, 2012","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have infinite ammo, you kill a lot of bad guys, and you rack up a lot of points.\n\nHowever, the setting doesn't seem right for this kind of thing. You'll blow up hundreds, if not thousands of enemy cars and spend tens of thousands of bullets. It just doesn't feel right for a setting where almost everyone is dead and supplies survivors are few. There is technically a story, but you're not really here for that, you're here for the action.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, it is certainly fun to drive about blowing up hundreds of enemies and then splattering their drivers Mad Max style afterwards. However , the gameplay is pretty formuleic. Bandits are attacking a town. You need to stop them from enslaving everyone. Also, every 2 missions, there's a massive supervehicle that can only be defeated with special weapons. Its good the first time, but when you have 6 areas, all of which ask you to do two defense missions and a boss mission, it gets boring pretty fast.\n\nHowever, there is a very nice highlight to the gameplay. Every fourth level, you drive around on a small patch of wasteland in first person and all you have to do is survive. These levels have the closest thing to a Mad Max type of preformance that you'll find.\n\nHowever, on the downside, you are driving a car, not walking a person around and the terrain is pretty rough, especially near towns. Which means that you'll easily get caught on the map. This is kind of unforgivable in a game where you have a timed goal (stopping the slavers before they haul towns people away) and are being attacked by about 10 enemies at any given time. Not to mention that the reverse controls are pretty sluggish.\n\nHowever, despite its glaring flaws, Wasteland Angel is still enjoyable and an acceptable alternative to a Mad Max style game. At least until the officially licensed one hits store shelves.","June 12, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Within that mold, there's some aspects I appreciate quite a lot.\n\n1) Civilian towns. The primary objective is not just to survive against all comers, but to protect towns full of civilians - this often, at least for me - created situations where I had no choice but to hold off on blowing up targets trying very hard to kill me in order to protect civilians. This particular feature just seems very well designed - you've got enough heallth to sacrifice some if you have to in order to protect civilians, the game smoothly increases complexity from one town on a flat map to multiple towns on a map covered in impassable terrain obstacles, etc. If a bunch of civies are walking back to town after the transport which took them is exploded and you or an enemy runs them over, they die, etc. It's little things like that which make a good game a great one or a bad game okay.\n\n2) Unit variety. Within the central mechanic of protecting these towns of civilians, there are three opposing factions each with different effective gameplay. Within each faction, there's a unit which specializes in killing you, a unit which just captures civilians, and a unit which does both. Bandit forces are fairly easy to destroy, but they move quickly so their civilian capturers need to be destroyed immediately. Military units are tough but slower than bandits or yourself, with their dual-purpose unit having a nasty attack rendering it necessary to adopt hit and run tactics against them. Cultists put you on the run with waves of station wagons loaded with explosives, then land their helicopters (invulnerable in flight) next to towns to carry off the civilians giving you only a very limited opportunity to stop them. The final few stages of the game don't even need to introduce ultra-powered units or anything - they just mix and match units from all three factions.\n\n3) Power ups. While health and +Forward Firepower power-ups do exist, the majority are in the form of traps such as spike strips, turrets, and pouring napalm out of the rear of your vehicle. Honestly, they're very well done with unique effects on the targets and I wish I'd used them more often (I found it more expedient to just shoot them, but I was playing on mid-level difficulty.)\n\nThe story is largely perfunctory - in the context of diversity, I appreciate the female protagonist easily and effectively slipping into a role which would normally be occupied by a gun-toting cigar-smoking male action hero. Perhaps the most annoying aspect is the constant substitution of "shuggin" for a certain word being with "F". It irritated me to the point where I just wished they'd go ahead and ♥♥♥♥ing say it, if it's that much a part of the character. Anyway, I lost track of what exactly we were supposed to be accomplishing before we started defending wasteland communities from evil people, which I suspect may have been intentional. I'm pretty sure the protagonist lost track of her goals as well, given how she willingly pursued powerful boss-level opponents.\n\nThat brings me to the bosses - to be honest, they're pretty "meh". Each of the three is only vulnerable to a specific special ability, and that's pretty much their gimmick. One boss shoots fire everywhere, but that's not that dangerous, another is basically a giant tank but its easy to dodge its shots, and the last is one whose secret I will keep. I do note that I ran into a pathfinding issue in the second boss battle - the boss got hung up on the terrain, which is a pretty significant problem given I needed it to run into mines. Fortunately, after the boss' summoned units got me, it didn't happen during the second iteration      of the battle.\n\nAll in all, at $5, this was a really good way to lose six hours. There's a lot of care put into this simple game, and that carries it well. I recommend it, provided you know what you're gettin into and you don't pay more than 5$.","June 25, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
