It's solid. It's not the best and it clearly needs some work, primarily in the graphical portions of the game (water clips through ships and the waves can be higher than towns sometimes. It's odd watching a wall of water pass through your ship without the ship reacting to it). Gameplay on the other hand is very similar to games like Sid Meier's Pirates or Windward just with more focus on questing and you sailing back and forth throughout the world for reasons I'll not spoil here. There is a heavy focus on Sea Combat so you won't have any boarding actions or land battles like in Sid Meier's Pirates. You sail the boat using WASD and your cannons are fired automatically. Basically, you have a certain firing arc on your ship which you need to keep on the enemy ship and then they will fire after a few seconds. Theoretically, you could fire both sides of your ship as long as you keep both within the firing arc. So gameplay is pretty simple from what I've seen so far.\nYou've also got some pretty intense customization in the game and as you pick up bigger and better ships, you'll also be able to get more things to customize your ship with (Flags, Sail colors/designs, hull designs or color patterns etc). Your crew can also get injured and gain experience which affects the efficiency of your ship and how you perform in combat. You can hire new crewman by sailing into port, going to a "tavern" and dragging them onto your ship for a nominal fee. It's all pretty standard stuff for the "Pirate" Genre but it does do some pretty cool things with passive bonuses (Artifacts, skilled crewmen etc) that you might not see in other Pirate games. And I think that's what sets Tempest apart from games like Windward, you can really make your Pirate ship your own... think Pirates of the Burning Sea levels of customization, which is cool. For an early access game, this one is looking pretty good. Honestly my main complain is just the water clipping through stuff, it's crazy distracting.\nAlso, watch out for freaking Krakens. They are definitely out there.\nFirst Impressions Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7PJXV-b35A","December 4, 2015","true","8.1"," 126 of 143 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","126","143","12","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jakli/recommended/418180/","Jakli","Jakli Carsus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jakli/","94 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n3.7 hours(At the time of this review), I started playing right as I downloaded it(Which was just under 100mb btw,) and stopped moments before I wrote this review. To get the basics, its a pretty good game, obvious flaws, obvious strengths. The game highly reminds me of Sid Meiers Pirates, questing, and combat seems to be similar. So if you enjoyed that game like I did when I was young, this game  will be a good buy.\n\nHere are some pros and cons I have found.(So far.) (Updated: 2/14/16 (ABOUT Time..))\n\nPros:\n+Game is Easy to Grasp\n+Quests - Kraken Hunting Nuff said.\n+Smooth expierence - Didnt find any frame rate drops, game crashes, or any of that, seems very stable.\n+Difficult yet easy game expierence - Your enemies vary. Difficulty varies, Bigger ships and forts, probably should stay away. Small Xebecs and Sloops, easy prey.\n+Ship custimization - Yeah, you can add fancy stuff to your ship, make your sails look cool, change your flag, and thats all in day 1 early access.\n+Huge Future Ahead - This game can go so many ways on its current path, It makes me jittery on where the future goes.\n+Trading - Oh god yes, Trade Faction is well, a Trade Faction Come one come all spend your money here!\n+ Factions - You are finally enable to sneak into enemy towns, instead of just floating around rubbing against your fellow seamen wondering if your quest will ever continue or not.\n+ Quests - This game has alot of potential with numerous amounts of quests to do and legends to uncover.\n\nCons: (They have, man, they have stumped my Cons man, its like they saw these problems and got right on it. Good job Devs! Had 9 Cons.. now im at.. wow... 3. Hot Tomato Sauce Batman!)\n-Can be Repetitive - This depends on how you look at it.\n-Graphical Bugs - Water, doesnt act like water, and all these towns flood like crazy!\n-Grinding - Even though Trading was certainly giving verity, i still have a sense of "Grind" but it CERTAINLY is not as bad as it was when i updated this review on December 6th.\n\nTips: The game itself, is much easier to pick up on, and i cant say i have anything to really tip atm.\n\nFunny Little Glitch: I dont know how it happened, but while i was commanding the Bloody Pearl ship, while on the crew screen, if i attempted to move crew from the "Crew Stations" to either Sail or Hull, they instead multiplied. Leading me to be able to spawn crew. Now, being as it were, i decided to go as far as i could. Would you believe me if i said that i was able to put 15 million people onto one ship? Sounds like another sailor legend. but Darn it be true. It ruined my game so i had to make a new game, but 15 million. I commanded, 15 million crew members, on a ship only to hold 28. Dont even get me started on how much health my ship had before the game just bugged out hard. Lets just say, I am a true Admiral. Even with my ship now in Davy Jones locker. Oh, last i saw, i had almost 10 million ship health. I might as well be Davy Jones himself with all these souls.","December 5, 2015","true","16.2"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","59","67","4","6"

Shut up about it being a poor "Pirate Game"!! It's not!

You complete quests and there's a loosely connected story through said quests, but for the most part, you'll be sailing here or there and taking part in ship-to-ship combat.\n.Game play.\nYou can use the WASD keys or the mouse in order to guide your ship. While doing so, you have the option of watching movement via a map overview or the 3D rendered ship, which can be seen in third or first person point of view.\n\nIn ports, you can hire more men, buy supplies, and pick up quests. Quests range from fetch quests to exploring certain areas of the map. Some have a bit of story attached to them and you'll also meet new characters. You'll be rewarded money, supplies, and crew for completing quests.\n\nAlong your travels you'll face random encounters and, based on your point of view, you can handle them in different ways. If you're looking at the map overview, you can click "auto" and the battle will be resolved based on your health, crew, cannonballs available, etc. Otherwise, you can use the button in the bottom left corner in order to zoom into the 3D view and battle in real time.\n\nYour cannons fire from the sides of your ship, which means combat consists of trying to flank your opponent while using the space bar to fire your weapons once they've been loaded. You can use the mouse or the WASD keys to maneuver, but you'll still need to fire with the space bar. You can switch ammunition on the fly, but keep in mind that will reset your reload time. Reload speed can be altered, but doing so is a matter of risk and reward: faster reload speed means lower accuracy and conversely, slower reload speed means higher accuracy.\n\nYour ship is heavy and cumbersome (this isn't just some dinky sailboat!), so much of your time will be spent trying to find just the right positioning. It's fun, but I soon found myself hitting the auto button rather than engaging as battles can take a while to complete.\n\nYou've also got a ship log with various information:\n*Faction's attitude towards you: there are various factions you'll be attempting to sway and your relationship will decide who will attack you and who won't.\n*Reputation: there are five possible reputations you can have for the various things you do. For instance, the spider is combat-related. It's called "paralyzing spider" and it allows you to deal twice as much damage to enemy sails. Reputation acts as perks that develop based on your play style, essentially.\n*Game Progress: this covers how much of the map you've explored, the number of quests you've done, and how many hidden goodies you've uncovered in addition to how far you've traveled.\n*Economy: how much in-game currency (Piastres) you've earned in one way or another and how much you've sold.\n*Combat Actions: how many cannonballs fired, how frequently you've missed, how many enemies you've destroyed, how many times you've destroyed--and so on. Nothing too out of the ordinary here.\n\nYour logs also keep track of your active quests, and the statistics of your ship and crew.\n\n-My one complaint would be that there's not much of a tutorial for fighting or trading or... Anything, really. Leaving the tutorial box checked in the options menu means you'll get brief messages during battle or exploration regarding what can or should be done--without an adequate description of *how* you should go about doing those things.\n\n.Soundtrack.\nThe ambient sounds are great. The crash of waves and the crack of thunder are tumultuous and they reflect the name of the game rather well. You'll also hear bells ring, seagulls cry, and the occasional shout of your men. The background music leaves a bit to be desired as it's a single track that replays over and over based on the occasion (exploration versus combat, etc). The songs are appropriate for the moments they're used, sure, but I would have preferred more variety.\n\n.Graphics/ Art Style.\nTempest is beautiful. From the falling rain to the rough, choppy waves, to the ragged, flapping cloth of your sails the game drips with style.\n\n.Longevity.\nDespite the promises of an open world, it only took me a few minutes to sail around about half the map. Still, there are plenty of quests to do, so going between islands and completing them will keep you occupied for a good while.\n\nThere's also an online mode, though I can't say much about it because I didn't try it.\n\n.Bottom Line.\nTempest is a swashbuckling good time that will give even the landiest of land lubbers their sea legs. If you're into naval combat and exploration, I can easily recommend this game to you.\n","May 2","true","4.9"," 45 of 46 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","45","46","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/418180/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5484 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe increasingly intense winds come in hard and violently thrust into the sails, the mostly wooden schooner known as The Bleeding lady rattles from the shock of the strong winds.  Captain Mean Jay Strong-bone sits at the helm, ordering his crew to sail directly into the storm even though he knows this may wind up being a suicide mission.  His target is none other than John Ripton, the vicious pirate wanted for slaughter a boat full of noblemen and woman.  Stong-bone knows sailing around the storm may ruin his chance of catching Ripton off guard.\n\nA huge wave prepares to crash into the side of The Bleeding Lady, the fearless crew hold their positions and brace for the impact.  The wave smashes into the side with a loud "smash" and "crash", one of the crew members Harry Riggins gets pulled over board.  Harry was a good man, setting sail to help improve the lives of his wife and children.  Strong-bone makes a mental note to send Harry's widow word of his demise as well as a stipend of gold.  A captain always pays it forward, and makes sure the family of his fallen crew members get taken care of that is if he's a captain who wants his crews respect.  First more important matters are at hand, getting through this storm.\n\nStrong-bone stands stoically at the wheel of his vessel, rain pelts him in the face, he squints and looks from side to side, he can feel it, a little further and the worst will be past, but not wanting to think too far ahead, he spins the wheel hard to the right....\n\nThe dream of being a pirate was always one of my favorites as a child, I remember dressing up when I was in Kindergarten, my fake eye patch and brown vest, a black pirate hat on my head with the classic skull and bones.  A fake plastic sword with a golden hilt, tied to my side with a piece of string.  So now 29 years later those dreams aren't dead, but they have been pushed back into the doldrums of my fantasies.  Only cropping up when the occasional game with pirates peers through the slop pile of games on steam.   Speaking of which, one shining beacon in the darkness is Tempest.\n\nAn open world game of piracy, filled with everything necessary to make a great pirate game.   Make the choice, are you going to be the deadliest pirate, pillaging and plundering, murdering until your hearts content, or play the life of a trader, buying products for cheap and then selling them for higher.  Whatever floats your boat (pun intended)  You want to customize your ship...  you can customize almost anything, from your hull, to your sail colors, to the figurehead chilling at the front of your ship, letting everyone know (Like Samuel L. Jackson's wallet in Pulp Fiction) you're a badarse #%@%@%.  Completing quest, cracking necks, and cashing checks..\n\nPro's\nFun open world gameplay\ndecent combat\npirates are awesome\ndecent graphics and sound\nCustomize your ship so everyone will know you're coming\n\nCon's\nThis game needs some type of tutorial (the deve implied on the boards one is incoming soon)\nOpen world games can make it feel like the player has no direction, can be viewed either way\nRepetitive game-play\n\nRecommendation\n\nLong have gamers clamored for a great pirate game, few have tried, most have failed... This game is a nice start, very reminiscent of Sid Miers Pirates, although unique in it's own right.  Well worth the purchase price, I'd suggest looking up some youtube footage or reading through some game guides as the lack of tutorial can make getting into the game kind of frustrating, although if you stick with it, you'll be presented with one of the finest pirate games to ever grace the video game format.  The game does have a few issues, but ultimately if you're a fan of pirates you can overlook most of those issues and hop right into life on the high seas.  Just remember... don't go overboard, you may be a pirate in Tempest, but in real life poking someone with you cutlass can and probably will cause some serious bodily harm, I'd recommend not doing that...","April 3","true","5.0"," 45 of 54 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","45","54","8","4"

One quest has a ship that you can kill and you must repeatedly die until someone gives you a magic device to make it stop, this can cost you thousands in repair, dead crew and sometimes you lose rare expensice artifacts. The first update was great and contained things that people wanted but update 3 just threw all that away and made it twice as hard. They raised the cost of repairs, ships, death penalty while simultaneously lowering loot, accuracy, ship base stats and not letting you escape for 30 seconds.\n\nAvoid this game until some serious work has been done, I dont recall hearing about pirates/navys having to be careful with the amount of cannonballs they were firing because their accuracy was only 63% and the loot gained wouldn't cover the cost of the cannonballs fired!","February 6","false","11.2"," 80 of 114 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","80","114","5","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/418180/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTempest is an open world Pirate/ Naval combat game with elements of grand strategy.  With a good blend of minimalism in focusing on simple pirate combat, combined with the details of a 4X strategy game; Tempest delivers that happy high-seas adventuring every land-lubber dreams about.\n\n“A Very Ancient, and Fish-like Smell:”\nWith trade routes to plunder, slave ships to chase down, coastal factions to ally, and some common mythological elements to battle, such as sea monsters and the kraken; you’ve got more narrative than just pirates.  Through the missions, story and mystery unfolds. Not to provide a spoiler, but the act of making alliances will cause certain events to take place later in the story. The Lion’s Shade dev team seems to be putting out updates weekly, if not more often. So, I suspect it won’t see a long wait for release. But, early access does not mean a game is less fun to read about and play. Although most games are built on a mechanic that needs to be finished before its fun, there are numerous games like Tempest that deliver a fully built mechanic that will provide hours of fun and excitement in early access.\n\nArtwork & Graphics:\nThe art is lovely. Those storm-wracked seas provide a magnificent backdrop for hours of gameplay on end. No cards yet, but you can look for some fantastic artwork from this game. An art book would be a welcome addition, as well as full screen backgrounds. The player chooses a banner to display, depending on faction alliances. With the dynamic weather, the beauty of the map motif, and the colorful graphic representations of faction flag and symbols; the game immerses you in an era in naval history that is legend.\nTempest has some errors & bugs, with occasional splicing of elements and waves, & wall glitches, but none of these seem to affect the enjoyment I get from losing everything I had acquired to this gigantic sea monster that appears out of the depths. As Shakespeare said in The Tempest, “He that dies pays all debts.” Losing everything in such a manner is incredibly nice, and 10 times out of 10, I would lose it all again when the game is fully released, with as much pleasure.\n\nDiving into the Mechanics:\nThe game is played with the open ocean as the predominant view. Here in the 3D view you can spend as much of your time as you like in actual combat. Clicking the map button brings up a map overlay that is a fully functional navigation system. Your ship appears in miniature replica sailing across the map between various settlements. You set waypoints on this view for your ship to travel freely around the map. Interestingly, you can draw out the shape of the exact path you want the ship to take around obstacles. As you watch the ship sail, notifications pop up when you are encountering pirate raids, naval battles, merchant ships and the like. You can choose to click to the ocean view to engage those vessels in combat, or allow the AI to flee the encounter.\nWhen you reach your destination icon on the map, you are switched to the ocean view at the port. There doesn’t seem to be much difference between the map view and the sea. It is like being on the ship looking up from the map on the captain’s table as a ship fires cannonballs at you. In some of the more dangerous harbors, I found myself knocked out of the crew screens by an attack from pirate ships near me. I had been fighting an intense mission, and had several injured crewmen, so I was trying to find meds in port, but kept being attacked while looking for them. I soon realized I needed to travel to a safer port to go shopping lol. And, ports carry a different selection of goods anyways.\nManeuverability is well-thought out. Setting the sails at half-mast (50%) will boost the ship’s maneuverability. Arrow keys control the camera, as well as a right click & drag with the mouse. The camera is fully functional 360 degree rotation on every axis. Zoom works with the mouse scroll-wheel. Compass cardinal directions are visible on the horizon as well, aiding in navigation. It’s quite realistic like being at sea with the captain’s tools in hand, and yet it draws to mind the look of 17th & 18th century maps & ships, like reliving the adventure of the Golden Age of Piracy.\nThe drag & drop interface is touchscreen friendly with standard WASD keyboard shortcuts, movement around the ocean is possible by using the left mouse button to click and set waypoints, just like on the map.\n\nSea Battles:\nYour ship has a cone-shaped attack zone. The angle depends on the chosen accuracy mode. You can increase the angle with the Q & E keys. The attack zone lights up when you have an enemy in your line of sight. Fire when ready. It is entirely possible to turn on automatic firing in the settings. This causes your cannons to fire when anything comes in your attack zone.  The combat is what the game does best. The look of the battle scenes is reminiscent of the old BBC Admiral Hornblower series.\n\nAlliances & Factions:\nYou are building a reputation at sea which varies after each battle. The game provides a variety of factions which figure into the missions. I noticed a few errors, like the Foggy Harbor mission sends you to Foggy Harbor, labeled Misty Harbour on the map.\n\nA Motley Crew:\nYou want a high level crew. You train them with experience points earned in battle by clicking on an arrow button next to each sailor. Rank appears to move from left to right on the boat decks, from Greenhand to Pirate in 5 different classes. A simple click & drag of the screen to the left will reveal the Tavern where you can hire additional crewmen. But, if you already have a full crew, you will have to put some Greenhands on shore leave to hire more experienced hands, just by dragging and dropping them into the Tavern. Of course, the Greenhands are always free if you’re broke. To add an officer to your crew, click on an icon on the left and choose any officer from the list below. You collect these officers from various missions, so you’ll have none at first.\n\nTrading, Goods, & Your Ship:\nFirst things last. :D Yes, every sailor worth his salt had to start out nowhere. You begin Tempest as a poor scoundrel with a bare bones ship and little options for upgrading. So, you’ll want to just have a look around at all the finery you don’t have, before heading out to sea to sink a few ships and claim your first prize money. Then you will be ready to buy some of those red-hot cannon balls and an accurate pistol to board future ships, and perhaps a trusty spyglass. Buy ship parts and upgrade them in port. Here you can focus on Sail, Boarding, or Gunnery efficiency. Dragging the screen to the right while in Goods mode will reveal the warehouse where you can store unused goods until you need them.\n\nMultiplayer:\nIn the middle of a battle a mysterious ship on fire sailed up near me and began to lob cannon grenades into the air. His ship would glow with a strange blue artifact as well. He was bearing the skull & crossbones so we were allied instantly. I just tried to pick off the smaller ships around while coveting the firepower of this grand ally. But, the MP is the same map as single-player, with other players joining you at will & appearing on your map and in the sea near you, if they are logged in at the same time as you.\n\nPros:\nCombat to satisfy your inner pirate\nShip Navigation system that is fluid & fun\nDynamic Weather & day/night cycle\n\nCons:\nNo cards or achievements yet\nEarly Access\nIncomplete Tutorial\n\n\nI recommend Tempest for all lovers of adventure on the high-seas, and pirates-at-heart. If you enjoy sea battles and navigation, then this game has all that plus sea monsters to die for. I rate Tempest a 10 out of 10 for combat games in the genre.","April 4","true","17.6"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","28","30","2","2"

For you it will start on the 26th October 1743 when you lose your ship “The Genriett” to a brutal and mysterious creature after an epic sea battle. Doesn’t sound like you and your crew will start on a high, but deep down you know that your faithful friends are still alive somewhere close by. After all, they are strong as a rock and light as a feather (better to be a feather than a rock if you have to swim ashore).\n\nTempest is an action/RPG game set in the charming Pirate era, where you take control of a ship and its crew. You will explore the sea and battle with or against pirates and other factions (9 in total). Gather as many goods and gold as you can because your journey will not be easy, and you will not be without a scratch to you.\n\nReach ports and you will be able to repair your ship in case you could not dodge effectively those small projectiles named “Cannonballs”, “Bar shots”, “Shrapnel’s”, “Mortars” and others. Buy well-needed medicines for your wounded crew, ammunition, hire new pirate to your crew or even give them a bit of training (you need experience points which you earn in battle) so they can be a little bit more efficient during battle. Upgrade your vessel hull (can’t upgrade everywhere though) or add an artefact to it but first you have to earn it in battle. Another aspect I really like is the customisation of your boat, add signs on your sails and flags, defence structure, skull and others on your bow… Fabulous, I reckon I was a pirate in my previous life.\n\nMovements in battle are really simple, you just use WASD on your keyboard. W and S are for the speed of your ship: you can choose to have your sail fully open (100%), half open (50%) or just stand still and get probably get hammered! A and D will be the keys to steer your boat either left or right.  You will be able to choose the precision of your shots, but it will take you longer to reload your cannon. If you prefer to get 80% chance of hitting your enemies it will take you 4.9 seconds to reload against 2.2 seconds if you choose 30% chance of hitting your target. Sometimes, it is only a couple of seconds that determine success or defeat. The targeting system is like a V on each side of your ship. The point of the V will be on each side of your ship and that will give you the angle of your firing range. Keep your enemies in sight within the V and all you have to do is fire your cannons. The closer you are from your enemies, the better chance to hit them hard! Oh.. I nearly forgot, you might even encounter interesting sea creatures like the “Mighty Kraken” or other small sea beasts.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good graphics\n-	Good and easy combat system\n-	Good ship customisation\n-	Good  management content in port (trading, hiring, etc)\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Don’t have an option to start a new game. You will have reset and exit the game.\n-	No achievement / Trading cards (early access)\n\nWell, I am very impressed with this game so far. I truly can’t wait to see the final version! This game is a jewel in the making!\n\n8.9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/418180/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTempest is an Early Access naval combat game that focuses on ship customization, set in a vast world with elements of strategy and RPG.\n\nIn Tempest you'll play the captain of a ship who roams the mighty seas is search of wondrous treasures, destroying any who dare to cross him. Although still an Early Access title, Tempest has a lot of content to keep you playing including a large open world for you to explore at your leisure, multiple quest lines, factions and combat opportunities, ship customization such as weapons, colours, your sails and figurehead, and various mobs such as pirates, sharks and kraken (so I've heard). You can choose to live the pirates life with just you and your crew or find an alliance with one of the various factions you'll encounter throughout the world. You're welcome to plunder your way to riches or try the simple life of a sea merchant trading loot for gold both are viable options, all the while enjoying the rich graphics the game has to offer.\n\nYou start with just you and your ship and a quest that guides you to a close port to get you started. Once there you'll find a few quests, maybe a crew member and you have a chance to explore the port interface a little and see the options such as hiring and distributing your team, ship customization, available quests and traders.  Every port belongs to a faction and you can see the faction flag beside before you dock your ship. You'll make alliances and enemies with these factions and that'll affect which ports will be peaceful and hostile towards you. There are various ports dotted all around the world that you'll have the chance to find either being guided by quests, or just as you roam.\nYou can move your ship in one of two ways, the first being the map screen. On this screen you can simply draw the route you want your ship to travel in. Any ships you might encounter along the way will appear as a small pop-up and you can choose whether or not to switch to the other interface and engage. The second way to travel is in the 3D mode where you actually control your ship the same way you do whilst in combat. The 3D mode is much more immersive and gives you the feeling of actually sailing on the oceans. If you zoom right in you can even drive in first person mode from the ships wheel which, if you can ignore the rigid crew member sprites, feels awesome. Whilst controlling your ship directly you can choose to play with your camera free or locked, switching between the two can make combat a lot easier.\n\nCombat in Tempest is real time and consists of you choose which attack you want to do and which side of the ship you want to fire from. Different attacks have different ranges and different reload times but also increased or decreased accuracy depending on the attack you are doing. You can also choose which cannonballs you want to fire and this will determine the damage dealt to hostile ships. Though I enjoy the combat I don't understand why there is a chance to miss if I am 100% aiming at the ship in question. This doesn't work well with real time combat and I think the combat mechanics in game could do with a little bit of a rework. As you take hits your ship will lose some of it's health and over time your crew members will take damage and become wounded stopping them from being active at their posts lowing the overall efficiency of your ship. The more damage you take the more chance of your crew members dying completely and your ship sinking. Once combat is over you can loot all fallen ships (even those from factions you're allied with) which will be one of your main sources of income. If you sink after taking too much damage you won't die or get a game over, you'll respawn at a nearby friendly port but will have lost a significant amount of your wealth so sometimes a retreat is recommended or even just scavenging off of battles early on like I did.\n\nDespite Tempest being fantastic in terms of gameplay the lack of a tutorial is something which hinders the game massively. There is very little that is explained to you and it did take me around three restarts before I felt I had a firm grip on what I was meant to be doing. Combat is almost impossible to learn without being sunk a few times and can become very frustrating. Also distributing your crew is never fully explained alongside what is affected by 'efficiency'. Things like this could be explained a lot easier by some text when you hover over options or icons but there is nothing currently. Right now Tempest desperately needs some tooltips. On the forums the developer has mentioned this is coming soon so I'll update this when that update is out.\n\nTempest manages to satisfy all of your needs whilst playing and offers a large amount of content already for an Early Access game. Despite lacking in a tutorial once you've figured things out the gameplay itself is very fun and immersive at times. Steam is lacking in good quality games of the Pirate genre and I think Tempest fills the spot perfectly.","April 26","true","5.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

After first battle (1vs1-easy win) very often will battle window pop-out asking you to fight it or leave it, yea sure lets wreck everything on our path...but wait, you vs 3 ships? No way you can't win it! Tried few more times it is hard to win vs 2 ships, but 3 is impossible at start.

For a relatively cheap game it's pretty fun and entertaining. You sail around on a map and ocasionally run into some pirates or a battle between pirates and merchants. You can fight them, fight with them (if it is an already ongoing battle), or ignore them and leave. I have yet to find any instructions on controls or anything of the sort but it's not to hard to figure out.\n\nPros: decent graphics, fun gameplay, decent challenge in battles.\n\nCons: Needs instructions on how to play, still has some glitches in the water and some land. (a wave crashing through your ship like its on a different plane).\n\nOverall worth a try for the $11 dollors or so.\n","December 5, 2015","true","1.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

There wasn't a tutorial really that I noticed.  There were basic instructions on how to maneuver your ship.  I did the first quest pretty easy, the second a little more difficult, the third...impossible.  There isn't a way to become a merchant per se, trade goods cost the same everywhere else...so not making gold as a trader.  Fix in future?  THe only thing that I truly didn't like was there is no way to restart from scratch.  I got wrecked in the begining and have no way to come back from my destruction.  Overall, I would still give this game a 10/10.  I can't wait to see it come to fruition.\n\nOk, just finished most of the quests.  (Don't worry, no spoilers)  I have a few questions for the developers.\n\n1.  Are all of the items to customize my ship available yet, or do I need to discover them in game?\n\n2.

At the time of writing, some aspects are more polished than others, but there's some solid buccaneering to be had, with the potential to be a real gem upon final release.\n\nYour adventure begins in a second-rate vessel, your prized ship having been destroyed by a monstrous sea creature. This is a fitting way to begin because it stokes your anticipation of the ship upgrades to come and hints at some glorious kracken-cracking retribution (I hope). Gameplay is essentially split into 3 distinctly different, but complimentary forms:\nExploration, which takes place across an interactive sea chart with islands and towns revealing themselves as you navigate your ship through the receeding shrouds of mist.\nBattles. Other ships with malicious intent may randomly engage you while sea-faring. You have the choice to autoplay the battle and hope for quick bounty, or man the wheel yourself and take matters into your own hands. Choosing the latter will transition you to a real-time, 3D battlefield. Select your weapon and target, wait for your crew to load it, manoeuver your ship into position and fire. If you've played other pirate games you'll already feel acquanted.\nManagement. Recruit shipmates and assign positions to them, train them up, buy/sell equipment and repair or upgrade your ship. The use of 2D cut-outs/cross sections to let you see inside ships and taverns etc is really nice.\nThe overall presentation really stands out as a stylish, extremely well crafted piece of work that oozes a dark, yet jolly "piratey" atmosphere. Text is presented on dark canvas backgrounds, adornments are used to emphazise the era and super-slick overlays slide and pop in and out of view. It all blends together very well and if this level of polish can be extended to the rest of the game, it would amount to something very special.\n\nThe 3D battlefields have a unique look to them. Moonlight bounces a wonderful glow across the ebbing and crashing waves, natrual rock formations and towns offer really nice backdrops for the action and some scenery (i.e said rocks) are not super-smoothed, but every-so-slightly rough around the edges, which for my tastes is perfectly befitting of the theme and enhances the appeal of the presentation.\n\nThe customization, upgrading and crew leveling looks really promising. A good deal of cosmetic choices can be made from the beginning, with gems and weapons hopefully opening up more interesting options later on.\n\nAt the time of writing, I feel that the steep learning curve and punishing difficulty needs a lot of attention. You are simply dumped into the deep end without any idea of the controls or what any of the icons do. It's not very intuitive, but you will figure out the icons soon enough. Help with controls either pops up after you've figured it out yourself or disappeared before you can assimilate it. I'm still confused about the controls and how to line up an effective barrage of cannon fire. I almost always run out of cannon balls or health before the battle is over.\n\nIf you lose a battle, your gold and resources take a huge hit. Once or twice is enough to leave you in a situation where you cannot afford any repairs or ammunition. As far as I can figure, your only option at that point is to start the whole game again, as neither manual saves or multiple profiles are currently supported.\n\nWorth mentioning is that the game is very well optimized already and looks really nice even on older machines.\n\nI feel that Tempest will one day mature into a unqiue priate game with a ton of charm, so I'd recommend keeping your good eye on this as it develops.","December 19, 2015","true","8.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantis6/recommended/418180/","fantis6","fantis6","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fantis6/","2600 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTempest is a action game with RPG elements, you are a pirate and you manage your own ship. You should explore the sea, fight and do story quests. In the ports you can repair your ship after battles, can buy things (ammunition, ship parts, cannons, goods, etc.) and hire pirates. The ship customization is very good, you can change a lot of things at ship for example flags, sails etc. You also can develop your command, for this you should use the points what you earned at battles. Battle system is simple enough, however you should have good reflexes and tactic, the outcode depends on this. You can move your ship with WASD, also you can open a sails full, half or stay in one place. You also can choose the shooting precision, if chose for example the highest, the reloading time is been longer than if you chose the lowest. The story is not bad. The music and graphic is good, considering the game's size. The biggest problem in game I think is that, you don’t found here any good tutorial and without this you are feel very lost at the starts. Also the other enough big negative that the game doesn’t have saving system or option a start new game, if you want start new game you should reset a game, no other option.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+good graphic\n+good sounds and music\n+ship customizing\n+deep economic manager system\n\n-no option start new game\n-no steam achievements\n-no tutorial or good help guide\n-early access\n\nI think this game is good, it has a big potential and have a good atmosphere. The battles are enjoyable and challenging. Sound and music crate the good atmosphere, you are really feel yourself in the sea at the pirate ship. The biggest downside of that game is it missing a good tutorial or helping guide, so many people can throw away a game because they don’t understand what they should do and how do. But game in early access , so I think all problem is been resolved in closest time. So if you like this game types and if you like pirates this game for you.\n\n8/10","December 31, 2015","true","5.2"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","21","30","2","0"

It's just a marvel to behold, especially if we look at how small the size of the game is.\n\nCons:\n1. Little to no in-game tips. You have to figure out tons of stuff yourself or go to the discussion board (where is it btw, please, tell me if you know :))\n\nTips:\n1. Pirates are currently the only faction you can get benefit from being in good relations with, so put on the pirate flag and work towards improving your reputation with them.\n\n2. Quests are the source of income, random battles are more or less a maritime enjoyment, but they have little economic sense. Quest battles on the other hand are a different story, 50k gold for ruining some guys fort? It is there, though you have to be in good relations with pirates to get this one. :)\n\n3. Forget earning by trading. You can, but quests are way better.\n\n4. Run if you can't win. :)\n\n5. Don't carry money and goods, unless you just got them. Sell goods, put up to 12k gold to bank (yeah, figure out how :)) and collect interest from time to time. If you have over 5k gold, buy upgrades or buy goods in cheap port (yeah, figure out which ones:)) and store goods there. If you get sunk with stuff on board, you loose some.\n\n6. Don' try attacking forts until you have a better ship. They pack a punch and you need a good hp to withstand it. :)\n\n7. You basically don't need pistols and boarding unless for the quests, so you may carry your pistols without equipping them (unless on a boarding quest) and use your crew on sails and cannons only.\n\n8. Use spyglass to get info about your enemies in the beginning of a fight. Use Ctrl button to switch the glass on/off  (you probably should be sailing away from them and looking behind, right?). Spying info will include three bars for the targets: sails, crew, hull (same as your stats), so you can know for sure if you can win boarding before starting it and that kraken has only hull hp, so don't use shrapnel on it... :)\n\nAlso, multiplayer is accessible through the globe icon on the map. As far as I can tell, it is based on "rooms" system, so if you have friends, just put in the same room name probably? Or join random, me and some folks will be glad to help you out with some enemies. :)\n\nP.S. One of the factions works as the bank, check out faction descriptions in ports.\nCheap ports have a green % sign on them. :)","April 11","true","182.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The combat in the game is quite interesting in nature and is "live action" with a nice set of graphics to finish it off. You're thrust into the world without a clue of what to do, as unfortunately the game does lack any form of tutorial or useful information (at time of recording the video). You will have to micro manage your ship, including its crew, ammo stores, damage and general cargo most of which is done at various ports you find on the map. Each crew member can provide various buffs / stats to your ship, so choose carefully! I found travelling around the map relatively boring and essentially its just used to jump from battle to battle, I would have personally preferred this to be more like a true open world whereby I could sail around, a bit like "Naval Action".\n\nPositives:\n+ Great combat system\n+ Nice graphics during combat\n+ The upcoming introduction of multiplayer\n+ Ship customization\n\n\nNegatives:\n- I felt a lack of purpose or path in the game\n- Lack of video settings - although it does make up for that with decent graphics anyway\n- No tutorial or hits really leaves the player without a clue of what they're doing at the start\n- Could get very boring very quickly\n\nVerdict:\n\nDefinately worth keeping an eye on as introductions of new regions, multiplayer and other game aspects may turn this into a more interesting game.\n\nMy score: 3/5 (On behald of EchoThruMe on YouTube)","March 6","true","0.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","1"

It's a beautiful, somewhat dark-hued game taking in some low-fantasy elements while retaining a fair degree of believability. While it does look a bit like a mobile port (big, round buttons; Previously it had next to no keyboard shortcuts, even) it still feels like a decent PC game. While the ship and customization choices are very limited and the map rather small, the Developers have so far lent their ears to the community and have incorporated several requests such as manual cannon fire, a (currently) barebones co-op/pvp multiplayer, and a few balance tweaks. If you aren't afraid of the big "Early Access" sticker on it, I recommend you try it out. It's only 10 bucks, after all. It'll put more in you than something from McDonalds that's for sure.

Just started playing for a couple hours and am hooked on the open world aspect of commanding  own ship to do battle and trade, but unfortunately cannot make own custom character. There seems to be a main story going on where the main character recruit his friends to help him. So characters are predefined, though i wish we could make our own character and give it unique appearance. Also wished we could name our ship. The art is a mixed of 2D and 3D, where ship combat and sailing is done in 3D, but map navigation and crew/ship management is done in 2D, which is acceptable but would prefer 3D. The ship models are decent and have good details and the sailing mechanics feel right. Especially like the view switching between 1st and 3rd person ship-view, which enhances immersion. Being able to see wheel turn in the HUD as well as in-game is definately a nice touch, cannot imagine playing ship-games without the wheel now. I wish the game could be developed into full fledged MMO, as it is its still tons better than Naval Action and is cheaper...\n\nIts graphics might not be as advanced as Naval Action but the overall gameplay is definately more polished and more like a finished product. Combat and navigation may not be as realistic as Naval Action, instead its more fast paced and simplified, but in a good way. Still it's pretty immersive with decent ship models and weather and the cinematic camera view occurs at just the right moment to show ship exchanging fires. Amazing piece of program that only takes up around 250 MB! The game really reminds me of mount & blade, only on water. Countless hours of enjoyment could be had with this inexpensive game. It is everything you want in a pirate game, but with more funds and support it can be great...full fledged MMO maybe? A franchise maybe?

Do not get me wrong, I had a lot of fun with this game and I think you should buy it. There is solid combat, great graphics, and good writing but I did not come here to write this review based on how great this game is. I am here to say why I have stopped playing this game.\n\nI am at a point where I either spend hours being a "trader" for a 12 gold per item return or ending up spending more gold raiding people than I get from drops. It is a massive grind, I don't mind grinds but there are good ones then there are bad ones. I saved up enough money to buy a ship with 100 more cargo space but I did not know I had to have twice the sails, guns, and armor (hull plating) than my last ship. I ended up being able to carry LESS than I could in a smaller ship because things like cannon take away from the amount you can carry. I went from my "gear" using 56% of my carry weight to my "gear" using 76%... with no ammo so I could not fight at all. I went to every port and found the cheapest place to buy each item then found the place I could sell them for the most. I then mathed out which item, silver ware, gave me the largest return for the weight of the items. There is one item that I can buy from one port and sell at one port to make the best return...\n\nThe writing... at one point I was on a quest to kill a boss monster but it wasn't the boss monster I thought it would be... so after killing the thing there is this text box were my character is ashamed because, as far as I can tell, he killed a deadly beast but it wasn't the deadly beast he thought it would be. The character goes so far to say "I told the merchants not to tell anyone what happened."\n\nI really want to play this game more but I just can't. I have the best cannon I could find, it costs too much to use the best ammo, and it will take way too much grinding to get the (I guess) best ship at $30,000. It would take me a total of 2,500 round trips to buy that boat. Yes I know there are other ways to make money, like putting it in the bank at a 1% interest rate, but thats still going to take a looooooong time.","February 16","true","26.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/recommended/418180/","Psygineer","Psygineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/","1507 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntroduction\nAvast, me hearties! Are ye longing for the bygone days of wooden sailing ships ruling the ocean waves? Do ye crave the tang of salty sea air? Are ye jest unable to wait for weevils in yer bread to tickle the stubs of yer rotting teeth? Do ye long for the gentle touch of Scurvy as it sneakily weakens yer body and soul? Would ye give anything for a chance to see the mighty Kraken?  Well look ye no further landlubber. Tempest is set in the age of pirates. Ye command thee a small ship with an equally small crew as ye set off on yer high seas adventures. Ye don’t have to be a pirate though if ye don’t want to be. Pirates are but one of the factions that are willing to have ye fly their colours. The majority of the gameplay takes place on yer ship as ye quest around between the various islands getting into mostly optional scuffles as ye sail around.\n\nGameplay\nIn Tempest you are a captain of a fledgling pirate ship searching for your lost crew. Your main goal is to gain the wealth needed to upgrade your ship and keep it out of Davy Jones’ locker. You amass wealth however you like. You can be the scourge of the sea known as a pirate or live the respectable life of a trader. You might even become a pirate hunter. You are free to choose but if you cross a faction too many times, you will become their enemy.\n\nFlags help to show who you are. Decorative flags make you look spiffier, factional ones show where your loyalties lay. You begin with a Pirate and a Merchant flag. Leaving the pirate flag equipped when you join a battle will automatically represent you as the Pirate faction. The same goes if you have another faction’s flag equipped. If you are flying the Merchant flag, you will join your allies to rally against the pirate menace. If you go against a faction too much, you will quickly find yourself unwelcome in any of that factions ports. On the flip side, your Pirate buddies will see you as a mighty pirate and new quests will unlock for that faction.\n\nControlling your ship is simple in both the 2D map mode and in the 3D high seas mode. While in map mode, simply click where you want to go and the ship will set sail but it follows the course without deviation. You could ram an island en-route. There is a better way to set your course. Left click and hold it down to then draw the route you want your ship to take. The map is accurate in that it has the authentic dullness of maps from the by-gone days. The high seas mode is where the game really shines. The highly detailed ships are seen at sea complete with crew. The oceans look amazing and the ambient weather and diurnal cycle just make this mode look breathtaking. The controls are as easy as in map mode. Press forward for faster and backward to slow. Left and right to turn and that’s it. Use your spyglass to see what you are up against. The spyglass has a really cool effect on your screen that gives the feeling you are actually looking though one.\n\nLet me tell you a story. I had barely started the game when I decided to visit the various ports to see if I could find ships for sale and to see what I would need to purchase one. I battled a few ships on my travels while flying the Jolly Roger. I then encountered a fort that didn’t want me to dock in their town and attacked my ship. That was when I first encountered the monster. The malevolent Kraken attacked my ship! The Kraken’s tentacles began reaching up both sides of my ship in a furious attempt to pull me down into a watery grave in the briny deep. I’d love to say that I became more infamous than the Dread Pirate Roberts that day and won my freedom, but sadly I cannot make that claim. The combined fire of the fort and the Kraken was too much and my ship sank beneath the churning waves.\n\nSinking in this game is not the end. You lose most of your belongings and wealth though, so it is a wise idea to unload goods to your warehouse before heading out. Eventually I was able to afford a bigger ship with better guns and parts all around. I had a good crew and became a mighty pirate known only as G. Threepwood.\n\nCombat in the game is straight forward. Your ship has arcs for your cannons and once your arc lines up with the enemy hull you can open fire. If you hold off your trigger finger for a moment, your shot will gain in accuracy. You can select the type of cannonballs you want to use and the reload speed and accuracy in which they will fire. The more accurate you want to be, the less firing arc you will have and the longer it will take between shots. Next, you have to figure out how you want to win this fight. You can go broadsides to broadsides if you are so inclined. I personally found starting out with a little bit of cowardice… I mean tactical retreating is a good way to get your wealth flowing in. Once I had longer ranged cannons I was actually able to sink enemy ships without them scratching my paint so I was quite happy about that. I admit that taking long-range potshots on the enemy is expensive in terms of cannon ball expenditures so I changed my cannons to short range and decided to kill the crew instead. I read a comment by the developer that ship capturing is something that is being implemented. Currently sailing close to the enemy and boarding only allows you to get supplies. One day I hope to capture an enemy ship and keep it as my own. For now, I will simply have to buy my ships and upgrade them myself.\n\nThe ability to upgrade is simple. You find parts you want and dock at a port. The port is straight forward and mostly the same everywhere you go. You see several icons to choose from and once you select the one you are looking for you will be taken to the respective screen. Here is where you buy and sell, hire crew, take on new quests, and retrofit your ship with parts you have acquired. Artifacts can also be added to your ship to give you special abilities. These artifact abilities help to separate Tempest from other similar nautical games and add a whole new level of fun to the game. Not all stores sell the same items so you will likely have to dock a few times before you find what you want. This is where the factions really start to come into play.\n\nJoining a faction has perks besides just having a safe place to dock. Each faction has a joining bonus that you can’t seem to acquire elsewhere so you might want to visit each of the factions to see what they have to offer. Even if a faction hates you, it isn’t the end of the world. You can still equip their flag to suck up to them and eventually they will pardon you.\n\nConsidering Tempest is still in Early Access right now, it’s actually very good as it is. The developer is actively supporting the game and listening to the community. If you want your change to help shape the game, you might want to get it now. There is even a new area being worked on as we speak! Additionally, multiplayer is working already and is quite interesting. I have not played multiplayer as much as I have the single player so I can’t comment too much on it but from the looks of it, the game will really come to life if you play in multiplayer.\n\nPros:Visually the game looks great considering its low system requirements\nThe sound is suitable for the game and works quite well to aid in the immersion\nSimple controls\nRe-playable without getting boring due to Faction system\nWeather effects that go beyond just visuals. Some Artifacts only work when it rains.\nMythological creatures\n\nCons:\n\nUnfinished. It’s in Early Access so the game doesn’t have all the bells and whistles and polish yet. It stands pretty well as it is though so that is no reason to ignore it.\nCurrently lacks a proper/complete tutorial. Took me about an hour, with multiple restarts to really figure everything out.","April 7","true","8.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","1"

It can be pretty basic if you want to go bust some heads or you can get into it with the customiation and try to flesh out some more details.  It isn't Sid Meier's Pirates but it doesn't claim to be either.\n\nPros:\n- Easy to learn the basics\n- Don't have to waste time with a story, can just get in, fight a bit, and then go back to playing on Twitter or whatever it is you do at work.\n\nWhat's Fine:\n- Music is fine\n- Graphics are fine\n- Upgrades are fine\n- Interface is fine (see con #1)\n\nCons:\n- There is little in the way of instruction apart from these small pop ups from time to time.  You have to spend some time to figure out things like efficiency and what dragging this and that about will do for you.\n- The open world combat pop up option is a little too rapid.  Sometimes I want to go somewhere without being pestered by 30 sea battles\n- The waves kind of clip through all the things.  People can shoot through each other and the environment.  Not terrible, but sometimes when I see it I can't unsee it.\n- Can get to be a bit of a grind trying to score 9000 coins for an upgrade when you get 150-250 per battle at the start\n\nOverall, it's fine.  If you like naval simulations this may be too basic for you, but it has a place as a quick and easy age of sail-type game.

The fact that the game runs so well on an average computer at a very high quality shows that the developers know how to optimize for the best gameplay, and clearly know what theyre doing in the long run. I hope that adding ports where you can actually get off your ship and walk around will be added, its what I expect from this kind of game and sailing around gets a little repetetive. Despite listing the flaws first I HIGHLY RECCOMEND this game as I believe it will be a great buy in the long run. Even now, the world is HUGE and theres plenty of quests to keep you busy in the beginning. I only hope that they will continue to add to the game and add a story as quests right from the beginning are just a little confusing to follow when you dont know anything, i was totally lost first going into the game. Add some cut scenes maybe ? The pirate models are already there so I dont think it would be hard to add :)\n\nWith what the game currently has, I would rate it 5/10.

Its a good EA game IMO.\n\nSeen some negatives and several people mentioned being stuck in the slow motion looking view (people playing will know what I mean) to the point just click/drag right mouse click and you will be back to normal instantly.\n\nAlso I seen someone mention about not being able to do anything because they had no money. I've had 0 gold several times all I did was join battles and let other ships destroy the other ones loot the crates from them and the ones on the map. You can still ram ships when you have no ammo as well. However I am not sure if you happen to not have gold when you are not max in crew members as the port will not let you leave.\n\nSo to prevent this risk. You can pre purchase crew members and have them left in the tavern on an island (drag them to top floor instead of your ship). After a battle, click on the ship icon in open sea and check your crew. If your below an have no gold then go back to the island you have pre purchased crew and youre set.\n\nAlso I have to agree that a save/load function + being able to have several profiles is a must have soon. (Would had saved me before because I got distracted when I was selling some loot and accidently bought around 4 thousand gold worth of guns)\n\nIt is somewhat grindy and after what happened above I just didnt want to look at the game for awhile.\n\nDispite the few complaints I said I do enjoy the game and I will be playing in future still. There is several well detailed reviews already if youre looking for more information on pro's n cons or in general.\n\nGood luck\n\n\n","December 10, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So far, and I know it is just an hour oof play, I am happy I won one of them.\n\nBut now my "problem". What am I playing? am I playing a single player pirate treasure and sail game? Am I playing a limited multiplayer (say max 32 on server), Am I playing a mmo? It is not clear to me especially since there is a difficulty setting. If I am playing multiplayer I appologise to the poor souls that went to the bottom of the ocean due to my "no-one messes with the Dutch" attitude lol\n\nI am pleasantly surprised by this game, I watched the download being just over a 100 Mb and feared initially I had a game in the casual range like on playrix and such. good games if you like that sort of thing but not what I use setam for. However the graphics are very nice (using highest settings) the ui is easy to understand and even though there is a lack of a start up tutorial (or at least, I didn't see it) I was playing and enjoying myself within a few minutes. A look at the controls, some clicking here and there and I was off.\n\nHowever I am a pairate and I see several factions but can't remember seeing a character creation besides entering a name. No option to choose faction was present which I think would do the game a favor if available. I believe there are other games in this line of play as well and I even think I tried one a while ago but refunded it because UI and controls where.... lacking.

Alot of things are really expensive and i find im still floating around in the plain white undies you start with because i need to spend my money on functional items instead of cosmetics.\n\nanyway really cool game so far i would recomend it (even if it doesnt sound like i would) its got a really cool atmosphere, the game play is pretty solid, the questline(s) are really unique compaired to most other genres, ship/crew management system is fairly simple to understand (even with limited interface explaining some things you may not get right away).\n\nwould really like to see this balanced out a little and come to be a reall nice well rounded title with lots more game play to come (also a multiplayer would be cool, online pvp, private servers, and LAN games)\n\nAND it needs a wiki page","February 13","true","31.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But I really don't get it as an old player of Pirates! this is seriously lacking any consistency with the quantity of battles required to capture just a little loot. If your a pirate why can't capturing ships the old fashioned way get more loot? Also why are the deck battles such a crappy oversight. They did such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job on the deck to deck battles. Excuse my language but its really pathetic compared to the details in the other areas.\n\nI sooooooo wanted this to be a Pirates! Killer. But instead its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ iPad knock off version of a true pirates experience.\n\nPlease do the game justice and fix the realism factors, and make it more rewarding for capturing a ship and way more difficult to do so. Sinking battleships shouldn't be possible with a dingy of a ship.\n\n2.5 out of 5. For the potential I'd say buy it if its under 15 dollars.

For anyone who really enjoyed Sid Meier's Pirates but wished there was more, this is the game for you. A lot of other reviews say the ships feel good to sail, and they're right. They handle smoothly and wind does make a significant impact now (I imagine in the past it didnt, I've read complaints). Ship to Ship combat is fun, once you have a steady stream of income the exotic shots become much more important. Artifacts are a nice wild-card for these engagements too. They may become formulaic in how they start (Couple ships off port bow, couple ships off starboard) the fights never get routine unless you're sticking to pirating trade routes.\n\nThere is hardly any tutorial to speak of, and the quest system is a mess that has a bad habit of stealing ~5000 gold pieces to buy important quest items without my consent, but I would still highly recommend this to people that are comfortable playing open ended games, where your next prize is a significant upgrade to your ship.","May 16","true","46.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have always liked pirate type games and this one is a good start.  It just launched so I am offering some suggestions about how the game can be improved from my perspective.\n\nThe ship engagements are kinda crowded as I frequently run into friendlies (and friendlies run into me) and the engagement areas seem to lack sufficient room to maneuver around for shots.  The enemies and the AI friendlies seem to get bunched up often.  The enemy ships move quickly and its not so easy to enjoy much of a tactical fight with sailing mechanics and positioning for shots.  A slower fight with the effects of ship handling mechanics would be nice.\n\nDuring ship engagements can I zoom?  I have not found it yet.  Zooming out alot during an engagement would be nice as it would give a tactical sort of view to plan attacks.\n\nCamera control is a bit awkard during engagements.  My view is sorta big and I have to keep moving the camera around to see what I am attacking and to avoid running into ships.  Zoom out would help here.\n\nIt's ok for a starter game.  I would like the developer to layer on the complexity to make the game more challenging like manual firing cannons without a visible firing arc que, changing sea states, weather effects (fog, rain, wind) that affect ship handling, manual sailing around the map instead of fast travel, provision mechanics (food, potable water), and mutiny mechanics (crew maintainence).","December 11, 2015","true","2.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

Which is "fine" for an early access game. What really needs a lot of work is the adaptation to PC as it's totally clear the game comes from a different platform. Also, the tutorial needs to improve. You will find a lot of people criticizing the game not because it's bad but because you become clueless while playing. At this point I honestly would not recommend it. I hope these things will be worked on :)\n\nIf you wish to see it in action you're more than welcome to check this video, it's a First Look into the game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjdXYwtMWxQ&list=PLBqXrq67D6ooHk9drYSFDxURYRMCCUc-v&index=1","December 24, 2015","false","1.7"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","13","27","2","0"

Its kinda like "yay I got a good shot in, but oh crap I can't see where I am going. Crash!"\nNo trading, all goods in every port are the exact same price.

Now i come back to it and it seems to have been amazingly broken at some stage. Changing controls seems to do nothing as the old keys still do whatever they origonaly did, so at most you just end up spinning around unable to shoot, then i sat in a battle for nearly five minutes trying to shoot two enemy ships who without fail they would hit me a few times every volly, yet even when i got super close to them and unloaded a full volley at maybe what would be 40ish feet distance, every single shot i would fire would over and over magically be blocked by waves. This game is broken in its current state and needs some serious work.\nHowever in saying that, i love the concept, love the graphics and theme, the mechanics are great and similar to sid's pirates which i loved, so this game has a lot of potential to be fairly awesome. So lets hope they fix this crazy and new retardation with the water mechanics and fix custom the custom control setup and maybe it can be awesome sometime soon. As it is however i cant recommend this till they fix it.","May 2","false","7.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","1","6","2","0"

There's potential but everything just seems to come up short. The battles just aren't very fun, everything you fight is a cannon ball sponge, even after some initial upgrades and aim adjustments, which I imagine is "balancing" so that when you become more powerful and use the over the top stuff that it's not too easy but meh.\n\nMost of your time is spent in menus and a boring overworld map to move place to place instead of actually sailing to explore. Menus are also unintuitive and there are no tool-tips. So it's pretty frustrating at times. Getting your crew constantly sniped while in a battle with the constant, irritatingly pitchy shots ringing out and the incessant squaking of seagulls while in ports really starts to grate nerves.\n\nIt's worth looking into if you're into these type of games but for me I'll just wait until it comes out of early access before I take another look. In the meantime this will be my first refund for an early access title, but it's my own fault for wanting more than what this game advertised. Ultimately, the biggest killer is using a map to explore instead of the in-game engine, which is my own fault for not paying closer attention to the details and trailer of this game.\n\nFor a game being developed by one person it's VERY admirable and commendable, it's just not for me in its current state.","February 10","false","0.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

How ever despite my short play time I just cant.  The game is just to arcadey for me, meaning the ships sail way faster then they should as well as turn as fast and sharp.  You have very little control over the ship other the sailing, the computer handles firing the cannons you just set the accuracy rate that you want. The ship fixes it self after each battle, crew do not seem to die, and as far as I could tell there is no way to tell how many enemy you are going to fight.  The graphics, and the sound effects are well done.  I really like the cinimatic angle for firing the cannons. That being said the camera control it self is hard to manage with no mini map to tell you where the enemy ships are you have to move the camera to find the ship.

But loads of early access games come out and loads of them are garbage, not all. But a fair amount. I think the game should have better textures, it should also really feel like a sandbox. It to me feels like a "free" singleplayer game, I have freedom to do what I wish, but the game for now just makes it seem like I am doing something apart of a linear storyline. I hate that, esp in a game where freedom is a must have. I believe the game can be improved but as it just came out on steam a week ago, it isn't worth it for now.\n\nSome people may hate me for this review, or just refuse to read all of this and give me a thumbs down, but the thing is. If a game has been in development long enough to be considered worthy of SAIL, then it should have much more to offer instead of going on steam to pick up little speed, then they use some of the cash to make the game better over a course of 2 years, and then later have the game die and be horrible. This happens all the time with steam games, and people should wait before releasing their games to die so fast.\n\nThat being said...\n\n- PROS -\n\nCombat - as it is still early, there can be a lot more, however they seem to have many tools a ship would need with a week of release time.\n\nMaps - As promised there will be more maps, or at least an upscale.\n\nMultiplayer - Something intended to be added later I assume based on what I read before purchase. I think it would be and interesting feature. Not sure how it would work but then again I am not the devs.\n\n----------------\n\n- CONS -\n\nLack of freedom - Currently as I said, I just feel like a man with a ship, and there is some story I am not being told I am partaking in.\n\nUI -  I am not a huge fan of the interface, it seems slightly clunky.\n\nShip "Upgrades" - Really more customization, I am not immpressed with having FREE stuff to start out with on my ship, I like to earn it, and if I have freedom to do what I wish, I should be well able to start slow, and pick up speed with customization options. That being said, I also don't really enjoy the accessories your ship can have, like the side add-ons. Spikes, Guardes, etc.\n\nGraphics - As stated before, the graphics aren't too great, the water looks amazing but when you zoom in to dry land when talking to someone on a quest, it is horribly blobby and blurry. I am sure this could be adjusted early on but not too sure how they want to take a stab at it.\n\nI would say after all this I would pay 5 dollars for the game. But at 10. Nah.","December 14, 2015","false","0.4"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","4"

No tutorial whatsoever. No hints on gameplay. Nothing. read somehwere that someone said it was simple to get into. NOT. I've 10 minutes on the game and have died 4 times already. Nothing simple about any of the mechanics. Too much detail in what you have to worry about what the ship is doing. You have cannon degrees. You have placement of each individual sailors in whatever position you want maximized. No clue where and how you cannon will hit anything. I saild by a town, next thing you know I was getting bombarded.Why? LOL. no clue. However cheap the game is, don't waste your time or money on it, it is just not worth it.","June 5","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
