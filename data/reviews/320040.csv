Still, the experience as a whole leaves a tremendous amount to be desired. Here are the things that really come up short for me:\n\n1. The Combat\n\nIt doesn't feel like there was a comprehensive vision for this. The game simply vomits enemies and makes them run towards you. There is no real enemy AI from what I can tell. This means that combat isn't particularly interesting to begin with, quickly becomes very repetitive, and despite how the game is marketed, combat is definitely its core loop.\n\n2. The Polish\n\nScenes often smash cut from one to another super abruptly, with no fades or other transitions of any kind. The multiplayer is, as others have said, simply busted. There are just a lot of these kinds of little(?) details that make the game feel unfinished and rushed out the door. They say you gotta do the first 90% of a project and then the second 90% - Moon Hunters often feels like that second 90% fell by the wayside.\n\n3. Narrative Structure\n\nWhile the quality of the writing is quite good, the way that the story and characters are presented is a pretty hot mess. I understand what the game is trying to do in terms of allowing you to work out the story through multiple playthroughs (FWIW, I've been through the game five times) but in practice it doesn't function well. Character prologues would help, a little more linearity on initial playthroughs might help, there are a lot of things that could be done... Moon Hunters simply throws you into deep water without any real sense of how to swim.\n\nThere is a really great game somewhere in here, and a lot of the pieces are already in place, but so much of it just comes off as half-baked and barely-there. If this was in early access and coming to consoles a year from now, I'd say god bless - but it seems like Kitfox believes this is a fully-finished, ready-for-market game.\n\nI can't see how you can play this, eyes open, and believe that.","March 11","false","3.6"," 261 of 311 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","261","311","4","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tundranocaps/recommended/320040/","tundranocaps","tundranocaps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tundranocaps/","471 products in account","This is a game that makes me unhappy with Steam only having a "yes/no" option, as this is close. This is a 65/100 game, but not the metacritic game score where under 75 is basically "trash," more akin to IMDB's scoring, where this is, "Fine, alright." It might be the game for you, and I didn't suffer playing it, but you usually have better uses for your time, especially how much time this game asks of you.\n\nTime is what this is all about. Time and content. I've played this game a number of times, with all classes but support, more than once with most, and beat the end-game boss a number of times. Each single playthrough of the game is quite short, ranging from 30 to 90 minutes or so, depending on how well you're doing and the size of the maps.\n\nThe game is designed to be played multiple times, except where it is not. You only get to visit 5-6 locations in each playthrough, which provides a reason to play again, and again. Right? Well, except I rarely encounter new options, even 5 hours into the game, and less as I reached 7 hours. Not every location or every setup will appear in each playthrough, and not in every playthrough will you have one of the traits needed to make use of it, so you'd think they'd let you play through every locale the map generates each time, or most of them, and you'd still have reasons to play again for a new map, and to try a different combination of options, so why don't they?\n\nIt's exactly because the number of locations and events is so small, that even within two playthroughs, and sometimes within a single one, you'll encounter the same "unique event" more than once. So this would've been even more noticeable had you been able to play through the entire generated map. As is, you're playing lottery with getting some objectives done, which require two specific events in different environments appearing, and you managing to reach both. It's somewhat of a lottery over which you have no control.\n\nSo, one way or the other, the game invites multiple playthroughs, and it doesn't reward exploration all that much, by making new events quite rare, but there are plenty of games that revolve on "same content," such as Diablo, or all the rogue-likes, that are fun enough to play. So how is the other part of the gameplay, aside from exploration, events, and traits: The combat? Well, it's quite dull. Not all classes are made equal, with some being able to left-click to victory with barely any thought (except perhaps constantly walking back to avoid being hit, as you hit them), while others have to keep running away as they slowly plink the opponents' health away. Neither is interesting, and for the weaker classes, just spending 2 minutes on a fight, or up to 5 on the boss, and hoping you don't just mess up and die aren't really more interesting.\n\nThe combat traits have a number of useless ones (Blood Witch's gain more energy from LMB, while you don't really need energy after you're in melee), to actively harmful (Spellblade's "pull enemies to you with your attacks," because as said earlier, the best tactic is to constantly kite /away/ from monsters), but the vast majority are just not interesting, just allowing you to hit more or harder, and the merchant visits never really excite me. I'm never left wondering, "Ooooh, what will I get this time?"\n\nThe game is very pleasant for a single playthrough, but the traits and events being relatively limited in scope and number means you exhaust most options rather quickly, even with the RNG associated with needing the right trait with the right event.\n\nThe game's visuals and OST are very good, which makes the fact that the OST stops playing after certain events (such as fighting Humbaba in the desert) doubly unfortunate. The female narrator during cutscene's audio levels are much lower than the rest of the game's sound, which is a small annoyance.\n\nThe game does have a number of other bugs and annoyances, such as an achievement not unlocking (defying the Spirit Guard, in my case),  being unable to use the special unlocked skins for classes, being unable to change key-binding in the main or the bottom-most key while using a keyboard and mouse. The game is also woefully unoptimized, and at certain points it starts lagging and chugging, as it takes up way too much RAM.\n\nIf you're fine with playing this game once, or twice, and especially if you have friends to play it with (locally, as online is apparently a pain in the ♥♥♥ to set up), even though that'd make the game even /easier/, then go for it. If you really are looking for a game that'd allow for multiple playthroughs, which this game touts itself as encouraging, then look somewhere else, as the game design decisions that seem to point in that direction actually cover the game's lack of content, the sort of content that'd make multiple playthroughs rewarding.","March 13","false","7.7"," 167 of 211 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","167","211","4","6"

This dynamic way of playing is new and fresh in my opinion. It allows the player to be flexible in terms of their time investment, whether that be a large investment or small.\n\nI want to compliment the art direction of this game. I have seen a lot of harsh comments in other places that the game is ugly looking. However my opinion is that the game is the complete opposite of ugly. It is in fact quite beautiful, especially when you factor in all the different settings, towns, enemies etc. are all quite unique as well as make use of a wonderful range of pastel colours throughout the world. Scenes look like pixelated watercolour paintings.\n\nGameplay wise it actually is like a diablo/zelda style. Its not nearly as deep as diablo though so don't expect that. Its a very light rpg. Unfortunately the game is really easy. This in my opinion is the game biggest flaw and they really need to improve the AI of enemies because once you understand the mix of your abilities and start gaining modifiers and skill ups, you become super OP. The reason to keep coming back to to discover the world and all the unlockables (places to see, things to do, new classes, new pathways) however if the game was more challenging that those things wouldn't be such a cake walk to find.\n\nDefinitely buy this, once you indulge deeper into the games systems they grab a hold of you and make you want more. The world of Moon Hunters is compelling and definitely draws interest, but the level of challenge is fairly low. Nothing a few AI and blanacing twaeks wouldnt fix.","March 10","true","3.1"," 97 of 118 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","97","118","7","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Let me explain this rating: I would recommend the experience of MH, not the game itself.\n\nThe value of MH is learning from its mistakes of trying to develop a narrative through mechanics. As someone who likes rogue-lite games yet craves for more storytelling, the idea of uncovering/shaping the story through replay-value is a novelty I can admire.\n\nIt's no masterpiece nor a new benchmark for rogue-lites; it's something of a failed experiment. That's how I'd explain my apprecation for the game.\n\nSo if you're looking for the next Binding of Isaac, FTL or a cooperative rogue-lite with lots of complexities, then this game is definitely not for you. And even if you like the idea behind MH you may not enjoy it for its flaws.\n\nThe 5-Day Adventure\nA single game of MH can last you anywhere from 20 mins to just over an hour (alone). There are several contributions to the game's length: Exploring new areas/towns for the first time, combat, the game's structure and backtracking.\n\nEach game of MH gives you five days before the final boss. The map is procedurally generated with special events. (Some have to be unlocked beforehand.) You'll never explore the full map because you can only visit one region per day. However, exploring towns or unique locales will not take a day away. You can also go in any direction.\n\nThe strangest thing about this system is you'll wonder how much padding is there in such a short game.\n\nSome areas may be very small with several interactions. Others will have you in these huge empty regions with one or two interactions at most, littered with enemies. Some interacted characters/objects will tell you the solution--"You need to be more PATIENT!"--while others won't give you a clue on how to access them.\n\nUnfortunately, the result is you'll need a mental checklist. Even with almost seven hours done, I know I have not unlocked everything--such as being able to talk to animals or ghosts--and I've only played 5/6 characters. (Sargon is horrid for single-player.)\n\nThis structure may sound reminiscent to Majora's Mask fans. In that game you would have three-days to stop the end of the world, and you couldn't accomplish every side-story within that time-frame. So you would reset time and all the events. You would then have to plan out which side-story you wanted to discover by memorization.\n\nThe difference between MM's and MH's is that MH relies on RNG to shape how and when you experience these side-stories. You may not have the "Wise" rating to do a Wise action; you may not have enough money to buy something special; you may not have--you get the idea.\n\nWhile it may be a unique quality, I think most would find this system tedious. If every single story/character was as interesting as another special event, then maybe this system could work. However, some interactions are only flavor text and others have zero connection to how you develop your character.\n\nBare-Bones Development\nThe store-page boasts that MH is a "cooperative personality test", which is outright false. Even in the core gameplay, there is very little customizable options to shape your character. This is an issue where I think the gameplay is at odds with the game's ideas of character development.\n\nYour personalities are determined by the accumulation of your actions--but only the options you can unlock due to your history. Instead of, for example, leveling up an atrribute in an RPG to get a special result (like speech for wise-asses), the system is reversed; your actions define who you are. So you can't have a wise person do something foolish, or a fool stumble upon wisdom.\n\nNow that sounds like a good idea on paper. However, because of how short of a time-frame you have to play and how many of those choices are binary (be a d0uche or be a good-guy), you don't really make a character. You just stumble into it.\n\nWhat I think was a mistake was where the rest of the game was spent, the combat system. The rest of the game is a simplified Gauntlet. Each character has three abilities for a specific role. Upgrades give you stat boosts to those abilities, but none change how you play or is shaped by your character traits. (You don't even use all the buttons on a standard controller.)\n\nEnemies all basically charge at you in masse, and boses spam basic attacks or use the same tactic with large HP bars. They aren't interesting to fight nor rewarding to win against when the combat can feel broken for some characters.  And with six characters total and with so short of a game, I don't think the combat will keep your interested more than it needs to. In fact, after a while, you'll often run to the nearest exit to avoid the combat system.\n\nI would say that this system is harmless but because it's the main focus of the gameplay outside of your choices I can't help but think how much better the game would be if it the combat was taken away, The gameplay needed something to shape around the choices you made to make the characterization of your choices matter.\n\nNeeds More Gameplay Storytelling, Less Expository Writing\nIf I had to point to an example for Moon Hunters to learn on how to make its RNG Storytelling better, I would point to the Civilization games. Or for something more simplier (for a game around 60 to 90 mins), Armello.\n\nBoth of these games utilized the player's choices as well as limitations on each playable character to create the stories from the gameplay itself. Stat-increases or debuffs would push the player to tailor their playstyle one way while the other gameplay systems would offer the freedom to define the player through their actions.\n\n(Ex. You could make a communist America or a Democratic China in Civ. You could succumb to the Plague as Zorro or find some other means for victory in Armello.)\n\nThe most important part about these games is that the gameplay does not interfere with shaping the narrative. In fact, it makes it feel like the player's actions are the result of their story rather than being told who they are.\n\nIn contrast to these ideas are Moon Hunter's epilogues/constellations, They have almost zero bearing on the characters you create or they are outright false. (Unless they're supposed to be outright lies told as myths.)\n\nFor example, if you die at the final boss, the epilogue says you lived to be much older. Or a single-action you made at the end of the game redefined your character into something completely different. Or some actions will have no bearing on your legacy.\n\nAs mentioned before, nothing of the combat system develops or shapes your character in the epilogue. You would think learning a buff called Blood Magic might be a tabooish-thing that would influence your character. (Consequences are something that is absent in MH besides denying you content to access on your run. Even praying as sacrilege at the Sun altar gives you something good.)\n\nThat is just one idea for how to make the gameplay matter more to the player's created story. The point is the entirety of MH's gameplay should be ultized in shaping the characters if it wants to strives for better RNG storytelling, and I think that is MH's biggest untapped potential.\n\nAnother Story Etched in the Stars\nI realize I've been solely pointing out flaws and missed opportunities with this game. All of it is said with fondness for the devs trying something different while I don't think it has succeeded with any one of its ideas.\n\nWhile I may not find anything superb in its writing or narrative, there is a lot of dedication put into the art-style, the music and the overall world of Moon Hunters. I would be lying if I did not say I enjoyed the discovery aspect of the game.\n\nSometimes it's games with the most flaws that we have the most love toward, which speaks highly of what was created when we desire something greater.","April 2","true","7.3"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","40","43","0","2"

But as a kickstarter and beta tester, I felt compelled to give the game a chance to show its full hand.  I ended up playing for a little over 20 hours, and received several different endings including the good, the bad, and the non-combat ending.  And as I kept playing, I hoped I'd "get" the game eventually.  Well, I think I finally did get it, and I'm ambivalent about what I got.\n\nThe game is pretty and atmospheric.  The combat is decent though not challenging, and the classes are different enough that you have to change tactics to use each one effectively.  The game's real weakness is the story.  Whether or not you get to experience any of it is a total crapshoot.  Most playthroughs, it's like the game gives you two pieces each from three different jigsaw puzzles.  There's a slim chance you're going to assemble anything recognizable from them.  Every now and then, the randomness will align to allow you to complete the right encounters to build the right attributes, and talk to the right NPCs in the right order on the right day, and make a little progress.  But things don't usually align that way.  This would be somewhat tolerable if you could cumulatively build your character up over multiple playthroughs (like Rogue Legacy) but you can't. And Moon Hunters' moment-to-moment gameplay isn't compelling enough to warrant playing just for play's sake.  Sure, there are some unlockables, but I feel like I only unlocked them because I forced myself to play long enough, rather than having the unlockables motivate me to keep playing.\n\nSo I think they did a great job with the graphics and sound.  The mythology seems to have potential, and the combat is pretty smooth. I hope Kitfox will take these pieces and make a coherent game with them someday.","March 10","false","24.6"," 66 of 91 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","66","91","2","3"

A gorgeous melding of co-op ARPG and emergent storytelling. With choices that genuinely shape your character and the world (or rather the heavens) around you.\n\nPitched as a "co-operative action personality test RPG" it does have all those traditional RPG elements you might expect to find - Assorted class specific heroes with their own unique abilities. Character leveling and ability upgrades. And enemies (and cacti) that explode into loot if you hit them hard enough. But where the game really shines is in how it feels different each time you play.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb3gbs07yug\n\nYou play as one of 6 heroes (4 starter classes with two more unlockable characters that can be found in game) whose quest is to find out why the Moon Goddess has vanished from the land. What's more you only have 3 days to do so.\n\nAs you travel across the procedurally generated world you come across random characters & objects and the way you react and interact with them not only changes your personality traits but also unlocks new characters, skins, villages and even familiars that can play alongside you. Though more importantly it helps write the legend of your greatest feats and failures in the stars above.\n\nEach playthrough is about an hour long is definitely designed to be played with friends but more importantly to be played multiple times in order to unlock everything.\n\nAdmittedly the game is not perfect. I have come across a couple of minor bugs here and there (character names not appearing properly or hero skins changing mid conversation). The enemy AI can easily get caught on objects. And whilst there is a ton of content to explore the game is not infinitely replayable as you will soon get used to the various environments and start skipping encounters you've already made.\n\nThat said I wholeheartedly recommend giving Moon Hunters a go.

Each time not only is the map configured differently, but what you find in each tile is also different. Sometimes you'll have a playthrough where you encounter big sprawling mountains and gain a lot of wealth, while other times you'll be in small forests and are just scraping up enough cash to get by. Maybe you'll just play a runthrough to try a new build or character, or maybe you want to try and find a secret area or complete your recipe book. The length shouldn't be looked at as a downside, especially if you are a completionist.

Made some changes to the review to reflect their feedback (Note that developers providing feedback to reviews is usually a good sign)\n\nFirst of all I'm writing this review in response to @willoneill's review. I absolutely agree with him, and there are a few points I'd like to add.\n\nOnline mode is in beta (and it's pretty buggy) which I suppose is somewhat understandable if the singleplayer would offer a rich experience (which it doesn't, by the way), but what bothers me most is the lack of keybinding options and sometimes loading savefiles leave you hanging in the loading screen forever, forcing you to ALT+F4 and try again.\n\nThe current upgrades are dull and don't feel like they have much impact. The typical "X does more damage", "Y lasts longer", "You can cast 2 of Z at the same time" tell me that there's a certain lack of creativity, and even if these upgrades were more interesting, with the short playthroughs you feel like it doesn't matter at all.\n\nAI interactions are weirdly designed: if you encounter an AI and you're unable to acquire the right "reputation" or quest for it in the map you're currently playing, the interaction quickly feels like a waste of opportunities because you won't encounter them again in this playthrough. This happens a LOT. It would help if all the characters would have some backstory and default reputations, and if there were more characters to begin with.\n\n\nWhatever you do when camping depends entirely on the character you chose in the beginning, and you're usually best off just going for either Strength or Intelligence so you can kill stuff faster. You don't need all the rest because you'll be using the same combat strategy over and over again on just about every single mob in hopes of getting some shiny opals to spend on upgrades which encourage you to use the same combat strategy over and over again on just about every single mob.\n\nThe developers have confirmed that they will continue to support the game, but the question remains: will my playthroughs ever truly feel different?\n\nThis COULD be an excellent 4-player game, but the execution on pretty much all the important aspects (online,story, combat, replayability, bugfixing) is poor. It feels like the game isn't even half finished, but if it was then they could blend together so smoothly you could be playing the game for hours on end.\n\nI'll be checking in on this game in the future, because I really want to give it a positive review.

I've been following the project since day 1 and the first thing that got me worried was that at every indie showcasing gig, I would see the same clunky, boring combat system. I would always find excuses like "hey, it's still in development. Relax man" But in the end,  it's the exact system you will find in the final version of the game. I should've known though, because the only thing you would hear people say about this game is how the pixel art and AD are amazing. That's pretty much it... Am i being too critical because of high expectations? I just feel that they only scratched the surface of the concept and went in too many direction in terms of player's experience (narrative + co-op + short gameplay loop = meh).\n\nTo add insult to injury, being a game made by studio in Montreal  ; a bilingual city in a bilingual country, the french VO was one of the worse I've heard in years.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/finalsin/recommended/320040/","finalsin","Garfield The Deals Warlock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/finalsin/","436 products in account","Moon Hunters is a procedural mythology game about weaving stories, defining characters, fighting monsters, uncovering secrets, and telling tales. It's a lot of fun, looks beautiful, and has a gorgeous sound track.\n\nAs a little extra: Moon Hunters understands a lot about how to make procedural generation more meaningful. In most procedural RPGs, you come across little events or random encounters, and that's it. That feels underwhelming - it's a bit like being dealt a hand of cards. You might not have seen those cards in that combination before, but it doesn't make it special. Moon Hunters is a bit more like a tarot reading. The encounters you have become compiled into who your character is and what they're doing, and they become part of a little story about you. So you didn't just come across a chest with a thing in - because you were Patient, you meditated under a tree and understood more about your quest for vengeance. Or you didn't. Or you found a cat instead and that was way cuter.","March 10","true","5.3"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","31","41","5","0"

All you need to do is take the time to contact them.\n\n--\n\nHonestly, there are plenty of reviews on the gameplay for this game, so I'm going to do something a little different and talk about my experience with the developers instead. I will of course say I greatly enjoy the gameplay and bite sized play sessions Moon Hunters has to offer before I start. Now moving on to the bulk of what I want to say...\n\nI've had a wonderfully pleasant experience with the devs of this game. I'll preface this by saying as my current profession I work as a QA tester in videogames, for an outsource company rather than in house with an actual game company. So I have has plenty of experiences with different game developers across many different projects that have all varied in size. This is one of the few times I've reported an issue not as an employee but as a client. I really enjoyed Kit Fox's game Shattered Planet, so I was completely on board when this game came out. I bought it right away but didn't play until several days after release because I don't really play games on weekdays. I waited for the weekend. When the time came to play I was impressed by the beautiful visuald and simple, yet compelling gameplay. Before I could finish a full run, which takes around an hour or so depending on the class you play I ended up needing to close the game. This is where my problems started.\n\nWhen I came back to the game 20 or so minutes later I was unable to load my save. I got caught in an endless loading screen. So I did what came natural as a QA tester. For about an hour I tried various troubleshooting methods to see if I could somehow get the game to load, but to no avail. I was extremely disheartened and took to the forums to see if others were having similar issues. There I found some threads where Tanya Short had personally replied to users having other issues, and supplied her e-mail for people with issues to send more information. Now, had this been a AAA company I probably would not have even bothered contacting them knowing my own experiences from work as well as the times in my leisure at home where I had encountered issues with games but never been given a reply by devs... but knowing these were Indie devs I decided to give it a shot. Who knows, maybe this issue had gone under their radar. I wrote to Tanya, being sure to attach my save in my first e-mail, and gave a brief summary of what happened leading up to me being unable to load the game. To my surprise within a few short hours she replied to me saying she had sent off my save to their programmer, Henk, and asking for my output log to see if they could gather more information about the issue from what was in it. It was the weekend, so it was extremely suspiring Tanya would take the time to contact me. I sent the output log and patiently waited for what would come next.\n\nA couple days later I received an e-mail from Henk Boom. There was a save file attached. He told me he had managed to create a fix for my save personally, apologized for the inconvenience, and then said he was looking into a long term fix to prevent this issue from happening to other players. I was blown away by the care these devs had placed into delivering me a superior experience as a client. I hadn't received this kind of treatment with any other developer before. And sometimes at work the devs seem more upset than appreciative when we find issues, even though they're paying us to find them haha. These devs are truly passionate about their game. I had been disheartened and unmotivated to play the game again, even though each playthrough would be a short time investment, until this moment. So I finished the playthrough on the save Henk sent me, which was literally 5 minutes from the end of the game, and then I played more more.\n\nKnowing this I can give this game a thumbs up and my whole hearted recommendation to anyone who is intrigued by the premise and gameplay of Moon Hunters. If you encounter an issue the devs will go above and beyond to make this a pleasant experience for you. They care about making Moon Hunters a successful project that their name is tied too, and for me they have done exactly that. Thank you, Kitfox, for being such supportive and dependable developers.","April 3","true","7.8"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

This game is extremely bare bones and does not offer much replayability in regards to story and gameplay. I managed to play through the game 3 times in 100 minutes. I beat the final boss the second time and all I recieved was a different ending cutscene and a new map which doesn't add much gameplay wise. Gameplay consisted of either slowly picking off enemies using the same basic attacks while trying to avoid damage and running past everything trying to find the exit because I had no health.\n\nThe trait system is odd and seemed like a good idea but was underused. You get one or two traits early on depending on a vague choice and then if you are lucky you get the chance to use them. (I never did)\nPros:\n-Great Soundtrack\n-Good Cutscenes\n-Character Design\nCons:\n-Low replay value\n-Combat is meh\n-AI constantly gets stuck in place\n-Weird hitboxes on the enemies with frontal protection (you have to hit them from an angle? I think?)\n-Feels bare bones and underdeveloped\n\nI was hyped for this game and am severly dissapointed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/320040/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Every now and again a game sneaks under your radar and really surprises you. For me, Moon Hunters is the latest game to do that to me. It is the second game developed and self-published by Montreal, Canada based developer Kitfox Games following the popular Shattered Lands turn-based strategy RPG from 2014. This time around, however, they have created a marvelous little adventure-RPG game that is sure to surprise many.\n\nI can appreciate that this one wont be for everybody – two of the top three reviews for the game as of time of writing are well reasoned negative reviews – but for those who the game does appeal to, me for example, will discover a game with a fair amount of depth and that has been developed with replayability firmly in mind. In fact, the game almost demands that you replay the game almost to the point where it may as well be compared to some rogue-likes (different genres entirely, however).\n\nA single playthrough of Moon Hunters will last you about an hour to an hour and a half but do keep in mind that the intention was for the long game to be played over maybe a dozen or so times with each and every individual playthrough building the game world further. In each playthrough the likelihood is that you will see about half a dozen different locations. You will not see the entire gameworld on a single playthrough. That’s simply impossible. Unfortunately, what the game classifies as a unique event can pop up on consecutive playthroughs. this is a bit of a downer but the game does provide you certain objectives that it expects you to complete each game. I found the objectives to be a positive but it does disguise that there is a perceived lack of overall content.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game at this point in time is that the single player game can be viewed as tough but because the game doesn’t scale – or if it does it doesn’t do a great job of it – the more players that you are able to add the easier the game will become. If you’re an average gamer playing with a couple of friends then it can prove to be a walk in the park. Conversely, if you’re a casual playing by yourself then chances are you will find the game to be a tough challenge. But from my time with the game every time you would normally have died you ‘crawl away to safety’ and lose your opals (the in game currency).\n\nI found the combat to be borderline. There are class imbalances. Some of the classes make the combat feel far too easy – click a button and move and you’ll kill almost every mob quite easily. Then there are classes where combat feels ultra difficult. As a single player this was very apparent to me while the poor scaling made combat in multiplayer too easy. There aren’t any interesting combat mechanics and I genuinely feel that the devs missed a golden opportunity to make another fascinating component of the game. Even the traits aren’t as interesting as they could be with a number of them practically useless.\n\nI’ve criticized the game without really explaining what I’ve liked about it. There really isn’t any one thing that made me enjoy the game. It’s definitely a combination of things. I really enjoyed the aesthetic and the presentation of the game. I found it to have high production values for a mid-priced indie game and for a studio that have only ever created one other game.  I quite appreciated the ways in which the story is told and narrated. I enjoyed the exploration even though it wasn’t quite as rewarding as what I would have liked. I enjoyed spending time playing this with friends even with the poor scaling – we were able to become immersed in the world together and that made for a lovely experience.\n\nI enjoyed the game but I know that it’s not for everyone. I’d definitely pick this up for those who like the sound of the concept of the game and doubly so if you have friends or family to play with.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group","March 26","true","4.4"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","0"

"Each time you play" means "each time one of your character become a legend in 5 days and nights", which happens kinda fast to be honest.\n\nSo here it comes : the Main features :\n\n- Rogue like concepts.\n- Fast, easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master fighting system. You might die a lot, especially with the bard, but don't worry, it's part of the story to run away sometimes.\n- NG+ mechanics A LOT. In most rogue like, you spend a lot of time in game but you rarely beat the final boss. Here it can happen really often, but even if you die against it, you'll unlock new features anyway.\n- Poetry ! Songs and winds whispers are delightful !\n- You didn't read dialogues in game since the old RPG era ? This game might make you actually read the dialogues again, and wanting to read it, which for me is incredible.\n\nConclusion : Blend Gauntlet with rogue like elements, put an extra 110% poetry and "play again if you want to see what I have to offer" and you have a solid, original and enchanting game.\n\nThis game is like none other until now, and really has some fresh air for your face, so for me it's a solid 8 or 9 out of 10.","March 10","true","13.1"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

Another great thing about this game that really  suprised me was the sound track, its fantastic for a indie game, thats about all I can say about it, google it if your considering buying the game (since everyone has their own taste in music).\n\nIncase you don't want to read the whole review i'll summarize:\n\nPROS:\n- fairly cheap\n-fun gameplay (for this genre)\n- great sound track\n-high replayability\n-great progression system\n-gives a sense of continuity\n-fun co-op\n-good bug report system\n\nCONS:\n-does have its bugs\n-short story (IMO)\n-steep learning curb for most classes\n-difficulty spike between regular gameplay and bosses/ final boss (IMO)\n\nPS:\nif your hving trouble in the begining try the Druid, he tends to be much easier to play than the other three starting classes","March 16","true","5.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

What I did enjoy the most about the game is that your choices affect your character's traits, allowing you to interact with certain objects and NPCs differently. While this can cause some discontent due to missing out on some interesting dialogue or a chance to gain a companion/pet because your character did not have the appropriate traits, this is an incentive to play again and make different choices to gain access to things you have missed out on in previous playthoughs.\n\nOverall, the writing is fun to read, the art is aesthetically pleasing, the game sounds great, and the gameplay is solid!\n\nIf you are a single player gamer, don't be discouraged! Despite being advertised as a multiplayer game, it is just as fun playing by yourself, as there is more than enough content to keep you entertained. Though I should note that unless you are playing a DPS class, it would be relatively difficult playing on your own. Now, I am not saying that you would not be able to play as the other classes, but it would most certainly be challenging.\n\nI recommend this game if you are looking to have short bursts of fun (alone or with friends) that can be picked up whenever you like.","March 10","true","10.2"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

And the combat is a much more significant aspect of gameplay than I thought it would be from the kickstarter promotional materials. I found the single-player combat very difficult and I would repeatedly fail rounds. I wish that the game gave you a pacifist option or was scaled a bit better for single player. If you die early in your round often, it's hard to unlock future elements of the game. Also, your character attracts monsters like crazy and it's difficult to stealth or avoid them if your health is low.\n\nI am still recommending this game because I do think it was ambitious in its design and I can see how all the characters strengths integrate really well in the multiplayer version.

I don't mean in an "Art" sort of way. There was obviously a lot of care and love put into building the world. I actually can care about these little pixel dudes onscreen. The world itself is engrossing, but...*\n\n-- The soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic. Seriously. I need to change my pants. Worth buying on its own.\n\n-- The different initial classes have fairly different play styles, and they're all balanced pretty well.\n\n-- There's a cooking collect-em-up of sorts going on, to boost your character's stats, but...*\n\n-- The idea of building your own legend was what sold me on the game to begin with. I think it's an amazing idea.\n\nThe Not-So-Good\n-- Ok, this is where it fell apart for me, and as of this review date (March 12, 2016), the game is poorly optimized on just about anything but the most high end rigs. BUT (and for once in this review, a good "but") the devs know and are working to get optimization going over the next few weeks. Until then, expect insane intital load times, among other things. It's a massive RAM hog at the moment, so close everything else and do not alt+tab out of it. Go make yourself a sandwich or something. Or possibly wash your car. Or have a light read of the tax code.\n\n-- The game seems to lack a sort of direction. In a nutshell, the game takes place over 3ish days each playthrough. I ran a few different playthroughs and have clocked a little over an hour at this point, not counting load times. So essentially, each character's playthrough is its own legend (with an admittedly very nice ending text centered around your decisions in that playthrough). There are a few things to unlock - different costumes, recipes, and new characters. You can also get the aid of "familiars" and learn to talk to animals. But all of this...seems to lack focus to me. Hear me out. If you're given a kind of small amount of in-game time for each playthrough, you don't fully get to enjoy the world. The pace feels rushed, and it does a huge disservice to an otherwise amazing world.\n\n-- You'll hear comparisons to Diablo and Zelda, but those comparisons aren't fair. This game involves moving with your WASD keys and clicking to attack (and SPACE for your "mobility" power. The druid gets a wolf form, for example - with its own attack). The levels are procedurally generated with each playthrough, similar to Diablo, but there's no loot to speak of, only opals for buying upgrades to your character and recipe fodder. The nice thing about recipes is that they're continually added to your cookbook over your playthroughs, so you don't have to find mushrooms again, for example. If a recipe is in your cookbook, it's in there.\n\n-- There's only a relative few enemy types, and they get a bit...repetitive. To say the least. There's also a mushroom beast that I swear was created by Satan himself. Devs, please fix the hitbox on them. Please. For the sake of my sanity.\n\nWhere Does It Fall Short?Or, "The Tl;dr"\n\n-- I fully believe that this game is stuck between two different "worlds" so to speak. The lovingly crafted, immersive, epic-scale RPG and the try-try-again of roguelikes. The short timeframe, coupled with the necessity of relatively quick, multiple playthroughs limits my ability to fully enjoy the game's landscape.\n\n-- If you enjoy roguelikes, and you can appreciate the idea of each playthrough becoming its own "legend" (as I can), then you might like this game.\n\n-- Is it GOTY material? Sadly, no. I wish it were. I wish it were on far, far more grand a scale, and would absolutely LOVE the idea of a sequel to this in a vast, explorable full-on RPG.\n\n-- For average gamers, or those who enjoy building a single character through hours upon hours of gameplay? I can't really recommend it. And it truly does pain me to say that, since I've been following this game from its early days.\n\nVerdict: 5/10. Worth a try, not a buy.","March 12","false","1.8"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","2"

The game is fun to play. If you like 2D action/adventure games, like Zelda or Diablo, I think you will have a lot of fun with the game. The controls are pretty simple but are responsive. The game works better as a co-op game but you can still have fun with the game in single player. Moon Hunters probably works best in group settings where some of the players aren't experienced gamers since the game is pretty easy overall.\n\nThe story is interesting and I like that every decision you make has an effect on gameplay as well as the ending. Each decision you make gives you stat boosts that help you in the game. When you finish the game you also get a little story about your journey telling the legend of your hero. This legend gives you details about what happened to your hero after your journey. Combine this with great music and good graphics and Moon Hunters creates an engaging environment.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is that each game is quite short (30 minutes to one and a half hours). This means you will quickly start running into repeated material. While the worlds appear to be randomly generated, the events that you encounter start to repeat themselves quite a bit. A good example is that the final boss of the game seems to always be the same (unless I have yet to find events that change the final boss battle). While this doesn't ruin the game, it keeps it from being as good as it could have been.\n\nIf you like 2D action/adventure games you should enjoy Moon Hunters. If you want to fully explore the game's world you can get quite a bit out of the game. If you don't like to repeat a lot of material though you may not get as much out of the game as you were expecting.\n\nNote: I received a review copy from the developers but received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","March 10","true","4.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The cut scenes are beautifully illustrated and the dialogue articulate. The game is meant to be explored several times through, enabling the player to discover new and refreshing classes, skills, and areas. As a co-op team, it is much more thrilling. It is interesting and unique to see each player's choices and decisions in real time. While the game does not provide much background or lore in the beginning, the universe still feels deeply thoughtful and story-rich.\n\nMy only real critique of the game is the customization options. I am a left-handed gamer, and at the time of writing this review you are not able to rebind keys from WASD, which makes it more difficult for me to navigate versus the arrow keys.","March 10","true","3.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I was very excited for it and I wanted to play it with three buddies to have a some four-man co-op runthroughs, using teamwork and being total badasses.  My friends were skeptical and didn't purchase it.  I am, relucantly, glad for that, which is depressing.\n\nI have beaten this game twice on three characters and three times on the other three characters.  It feels like I have experienced a majority of the content and even while trying different playstyles and choices, am seeing the same scenes more often than I expected.  This is true of a lot of the "choices" in the game, that in the end, it either doesn't matter or is only an illusion.  The shops in particular are like this.  All of the items in the shop can pretty much be boiled down to: "Makes it do more damage".  It's not a gameplay changer, it's just a stat change.  Or at the very least, it's not a game altering choice.  You change nothing about what you've been doing.  Cooking is the exact same way.  A whole lot of variations of the same thing.\n\nThere's a lot of gameplay in here I find intriguing, in concept at least.  It sounds great on paper, but the execution feels just a little off to me.  A prime example is the main design of the Bard, one of the unlockable classes in the game.  You play the Bard by walking constantly, kiting enemies at close range and using your low range abilities to either buff yourself/allies or damage enemies with DDs and DoTs.  You press buttons to play songs, the number of buttons and the order you press them in determine the effects.\nLeft Click = Offense.\nRight Click = Defense.\nSpacebar = Support.\nLeft click (Dmg) --> Right click (Def): Damage Over Time ability in an area around your character. Close range.\nRight click (Def) --> Left Click (Dmg): Hold still for a moment, then summon three red orbs that follow you, exploding on contact with nearby enemies.\nHowever, if you get hit, it interrupts your combo.  Right click (Defense) by itself forces your character to stand still until you finish that song.\n\nTry to get close to DoT up some baddies:\nLeft click, get hit (interrupt combo), right click (since this is now the start of a combo, it forces you to stand still), get hit a few more times by enemies before you can force that combo to finish/it restarts again repeatedly, lose a quarter of your health and finally get away from them.  Your button presses were correct, the result is a horrible screaming death because you didn't time it well enough.  It's an extremely frustrating system (I did three complete playthroughs as the Bard).  I actually really enjoy the concept and I think it has a lot of potential.  I can see it making more sense in a multiplayer enviroment where other people are holding aggro, but I still can't help feeling that a MELEE glass cannon extremely dependant on NOT getting interrupted by melee hits is just not thought through very well.  Perhaps it could have had homing attacks, dropping little traps that you lead enemies through, having "charges" on certain abilities that fill up as you debuff targets.  Having a debuff that just INCREASES damage enemies take (slag from Borderlands anyone?).  Perhaps removing interrupts and instead having a more beat based system for that single character like Crypt of the Necrodancer but a caster system with spells to damage enemies by pressing buttons to the beat.  That would be an elaborate system to fit in this particular game though, so not all that practical.\n\nI'm not sure what the correct answer is, it just feels a little haphazard, which is pretty much my feeling about this game in general. =\ I tried to love you Moon Hunters, but all I can say is: meh.","April 29","false","8.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It is, however, a fairly short game but it makes up for it in the fact that is has a lot of replay value. You take on the role of a member of the Moon Cult who worship the Pale Dancer, the goddess of the moon. However, the moon has mysteriously disappeared and you are tasked with finding it. Alongside this you discover the Sun Cult, your enemies, are trying to take over the world. And so you are tasked with defeating the leader of the Sun Cult, "King" Mardokh, as well as recovering the moon. There are four classes to choose from when you first start the game, however there are two more which can be acquired via certain events in the story. The four classes are; Druid, Occultist, Witch and Spellblade. Each of these classes have their own unique skills, the Druid can transform into a wolf, the Occultist can create small worm holes, the Witch can shoot lasers and the Spellblade can use whirlwind attacks. These skills can also be upgraded stats like damage, stamina cost or ability duration. There are also several stats that can be upgraded, depending on how you approach certain situations and how you choose to spend the night. To name a few, you’ve got; endurance, which increases the amount of health you have, there’s also strength, which increases your physical damage and charm, which increases your leadership, making it so people will listen to you can fall for your charms, and yes flirting is also an option at some points. These are to just name a few and it’s fairly obvious how they help you out in the fray. Speaking of which, combat in Moon Hunters is fairly simple. Face the direction you wish to attack in and press the attack button, dodge with the designated key and use your special ability with the other. Enemies are also unique per area, with giant lion beasts in the desert to tiny beetle creatures in the forest. They all have different attack patterns and sometimes require you to take a different approach in order to take them out.\nGraphically the game has a beautiful pixel art style combined with the wonderfully hand drawn characters shown in dialogue sections. The colour scheme used is bright and pleasing to the eye, providing a clear distinction between each setting. Which fits nicely alongside the fantastic soundtrack, which wonderfully expresses the fantasy vibe.\nOverall Moon Hunters is a lovingly crafted fantasy experience with distinct RPG and rogue-like elements which can be played in both Single player and Co-op. Despite the short story it still has a lot of replay value and each time you replay you’ll discover something completely different. I’d highly recommend this game to anyone, if you love RPG games then it’s a must. But whatever the case it’s a game that’s clearly has had a lot of effort and time put into it and well worth a look.

The combat system is effective however the upgrade system is lacking from what I've seen (increase passives at end of day & buy upgrades that slightly change main combat abilities). But since every character plays uniquely (your starting 4 classes are a swordsman, a druid, a blood mage & a warlock?), the lack of game-changing upgrades might not be so big an issue as it may seem.\n\nThe game looks lovely, with the pixel-art being fabulous & the "cutscene" art looking lovlier as you may see. It's aesthetically very appealing on the eyes, with the soundtrack fitting for the game (but not the best I've ever heard). I've convinced some of my friends to buy it later and & I'll update this later to tell you if it changes significantly after playing multiplayer with friends. But until then, I like this game & I'm happy to reccomend it.","March 11","true","1.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sylvaar/recommended/320040/","Sylvaar","Cynapse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sylvaar/","286 products in account","Moon Hunters is a very gorgeous game. The visuals are stunning, and the music fitting. Its world feels inhabited, its gods real, and its inhabitants unique and interesting.  Couple these positives with impeccable level design, and you have a memorable game.\n\nThe story is an interesting divergence between an old pantheon of gods, and a new monotheistic religion threatening the old ways. Change seems to be very difficult for the inhabitants of this land. I won't go too in depth with the story, as I believe it's something you need to experience for yourself. Moon Hunters is more than just a "This is you. This is your story." kind of game. Rather, it asks the player "Who are you? What is your story?".\n\nKeep in mind, this game is more akin to The Binding of Isaac or FTL with its short "runs" with unlockable content. I've seen a few people on the forums being surprised by a single playthrough's length. What Moon Hunters lacks in length, it makes up for in depth. Each decision influences the kind of character you create, what choices you can make later on, and the reactions from civilians to your legacy. After all, the biggest draw for myself coming into this game was the procedurally created legacies of each character. At the end of each run, you read about what kind of character you have made based on your decisions, and what they have done with their lives since. (if they survived) The outcomes of each game act almost like a personality test, in a way.\n\nCombat does its job well enough. Each class feels unique, has its own set of three skills, and can upgrade each of these via the game's currency. There tends to be a prominent "Hit-and-run" strategy that works well, regardless of the enemy you're facing. I enjoy walking around the gorgeous levels, listening to the music and encountering events moreso than killing enemies most of the time. Combat isn't unenjoyable by any means, but it doesn't do anything outstanding, unlike the rest of the game.\nI do have some gripes with enemy AI getting stuck on walls, and melee characters feel slightly underpowered, though these are small complaints. I can't comment on multiplayer, as I have not tried it out yet.\n\nIf this sounds like something you'd enjoy, pick it up!

It's a wonderful mix of procedurally generated narrative and action RPG mechanics.

I've included my thoughts in video form as well here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8furYQuPVY\n\nMoon Hunters sets out to shake up the typical action RPG formula with an interesting take on narrative structure.  While there are a few missteps along the way, it largely succeeds in creating a meaningful and memorable experience.\n\nYou (and up to 3 partners) take the role of 1 of 6 heroes, setting out to explore the mysteries of the world and ultimately to stop the Sun Cult from seizing control of the populace.  Along the way you'll meet a variety of characters, shape the personality of your character, and leave a lasting impact on the world.\n\nThe most important hook of Moon Hunters to note is that it is a game entirely designed around the notion of numerous playthroughs. A single 'playthrough' can be completed in as little as ~40 minutes, but each playthrough has the potential to unlock new features, new areas, and otherwise expand the world.  Each completed playthrough (whether successful or not) leaves a lasting memory of your character in the world's mythos, with literal statues built in their honor.  Reflecting upon these statues will give you a summary of their past exploits as well as a statistical bonus.\n\nEach playthrough consists of 3 'days' in somewhat of a Majora's Mask style.  While it's possible to discover the final boss ahead of time, you will be forced into final combat at the end of the 3rd day.  As a result, you'll only be able to explore a small handful of locations each time.  Locations are somewhat randomly generated, though towns and special areas are static, allowing for a level of strategy and planning.  Between each area you're given the opportunity to camp.  In camp you can meet up again with NPCs you encountered during the day or partake in one of the many activities (including a rudimentary cooking system) for statistical bonuses.\n\nCombat is serviceable, but not exceptionally deep.  However, a level of customization in purchasable skill upgrades will make playthroughs with the same characters potentially different each time.  Each character comes with 3 basic skills, typically in the form of a primary attack, a secondary attack/utility skill, and a defensive ability.  The Songweaver mixes this up a bit with the ability to combine 3 different song notes into combos of 2 (and sometimes 3) for a large variety of functions.\n\nBasic enemies are not exceptionally smart, but characters are also not inherently very durable. Solo combat relies heavily on using your utility abilities to lockdown opponents in order to find safe openings to attack.  Some characters are easier than others; the Spellblade is a quick and deadly whirling dervish of melee combat, but the Occultist will need to use hit and run tactics in order to be successful.  Boss enemies are far more interesting (and visually impressive) encounters that require a fair amount of strategy to defeat.\n\nLast but not least, the audio/visual style on display is exquisite.  The world is beautiful and colorful, the music/sound set the mood.  The atmosphere adds a lot to the experience and simply makes it a joy to play.\n\nThe game is not without flaws: World object hitboxes feel a little finicky/oversized at times and the rate at which new areas unlock for future playthroughs can be slow depending on your luck of finding new things in previous playthroughs.  All told, however, I've greatly enjoyed my time with the game thus far and it earns my recommendation.","March 17","true","4.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

But let me give you my honest opinion.)\n\nMoon Hunters plays a bit like Diablo in the monster bashing sense, and a bit like Zelda in the world exploring sense.\n\nThe coolest innovation in Moon Hunters is the myth-building aspect.  As you play, you'll make choices that determine your character's traits.  These traits will unlock side quests, pets, encounters, and interactions with NPCs.  At the end of your run, your character's Myth is told to you, based on these traits.\n\nThe next coolest innovation becomes clear on multiple playthroughs!  Each playthrough you do will unlock new content for future playthroughs, expanding the world and the options every time you play, and revealing more and more of what is actually going on.\n\nI haven't yet been able to get online multiplayer working yet, and the combat can be a bit easy at times- though I personally was sufficiently challenged a few times each playthrough.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to anyone who likes the idea of playing a solid couch-co-op game with their friends, exploring the world and learning more about it, and making entertaining character based decisions to find out what changes happen as a consequence.","March 10","true","5.5"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

You really do have to play through the game a few times to start noticing the full extent of the narrative design, but thankfully individual playthroughs are miraculously short, 90 minutes at most - a great thing in a world of 60+ hour RPGs that nobody with a job and a family or relationship could easily approach. The first playthrough may seem a bit barebones, but the more you play, the more you'll notice the interconnectedness of your playthroughs, and the more you'll learn about the world you're playing in.\n\nCombat reminds me most of Torchlight, though simpler and more straightforward. This is not an extremely mechanically challenging game and doesn't have skill trees of character customization - and I like that. It's primarily about the sense of being a character in a world, and figuring out both the world and its characters, which is all I wanted for it.\n\nIf there's anything I'd criticize, it would be a couple of issues in the UI. It doesn't seem to like me wanting to use the mouse, so I often find myself needing to press E to select something under my mouse that isn't responding to clicks, or using the WS keys to scroll through large text boxes that also don't respond to clicks on arrows, or the scroll wheel. It's also unclear exactly how the upgrades you buy from merchants apply - once you buy an upgrade it's said to be active, but not all merchants display the same upgrades, and there doesn't seem to be anywhere to see all the upgrades you have so far, if indeed they're persistent. A few other minor UI bugs have cropped up as well; hopefully these will be patched up soon.\n\nI can see myself coming back for several playthroughs of Moon Hunters, because I still haven't figured out what happened to the Moon, visited all the tribes, or figured out how to talk to animals!

Unfortunately, this is not the game that I was expecting.\n\nThe Pros:\nThe art design is amazing, the music is captivating, and the battle mechanics are interesting enough to keep me invested. I really enjoyed exploring the zones (although you are limited to how many zones you can actually explore before you reach the end of the game -- more on that below). Each class has a unique style and strategy for fighting enemies. I also enjoyed the character advancement system. It really gave me an incentive to explore and kill more monsters so that i could purchase new abilities with the opals that I collected from the game world.\n\nThe Cons:\n\n=== No In-Game Tutorial ===\nFirst off, the lack of direction in the game is annoying. There are no helpful tutorials or hints for new players. When I first started, I was uncertain what the hell I was even supposed to do. I ended up wandering around the first zone, nearly dying while trying to figure out how the game actually worked. The npc interaction is pretty vague, and and I had no idea how each choice even impacted my character. You really just blindly react to npc interactions and hope for the best. Eventually, I discovered that all of these interactions are recorded and help to shape how my character is perceived in the lore of the world. Unfortunately this really only comes to fruition upon completion of the game, detailng how your character is remembered by your ancestors.\n\n=== Game Length ===\nYou have three in-game days until you reach the end of the story. This basically means that you get a handful of zones to explore before you must face the final boss. If you die in a zone, you immediately arrive at your camp and must rest, moving to the next day. This is very cumbersome approach to a game that has so much depth. I was expecting a longer, more driving narrative. I was expecting at least 40 hours of gameplay, side-quests, and an amazing RPG experience... What I discovered was that this game is basically a demo. The game that you can buy is really the first chapter or level of what it COULD have been.\n\n=== Hit Point Recovery ===\nThe only way to restore HP is from camping, hoping that RNG blesses you with a heart after you defeat an enemy or destroy something in the game world, or by a specific class ability. It would have been nice to have some potions that you can equip and use with the press of a button.\n\nVerdict:\nOverall, this game is an interesting RPG, but worth no more than $5 in it's current state. I would have much rather enjoyed a larger world with more time to explore the procedurely generated zones and advance my character. I would have really liked to see side-quests, equipment customization, and a longer storyline. The epic feel is just not there.","March 10","true","4.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

There are multiple endings to find, all kinds of interest secrets and tidbits, and the music is wonderful. The enemies on each map commonly require more tactics than "stand and click until dead".\n\nEach character plays differently. Very differently. And the shops in the game sell random powerups, meaning you can't plan on upgrading your favorite skill. Sometimes you have to spend your opals on something you never use. Then you start using it, and realize it's awesome.\n\nSome other reviews have said that the choices in the random encounters don't mean anything, and those people are wrong. Dialog choices in the game increase personality attributes, giving you things like 'foolish' or 'seductive', and certain hidden events require you to have certain traits.\n\nAnd by the way, the end boss isn't that hard for most characters, but he's not supposed to be, because that's not the real ending.

There are terrible sync issues, infinite loading screens, corrupt saves, and at times laggy. Connecting to each other was also extremly painful, sometimes the invite button would even disappear..\n\nOutside of multiplayer..\n\nThe combat is clunky.\nThe story is dull (to me).\nEach playthrough you're suppose to "write your mythology" story or whatever. Really, it's just going through the same few levels again and again picking one of the only two options you have which 'affect' the story and your character in some (inconsequential in my opinion) way. I feel like for a story to have any weight you have to actually become invested in it which is impossible to do in this game because of it's design. With the gameplay itself lacking so greatly, the story so short and unappealing, I've unfortunately got to give this game a negative review.","April 9","false","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jab2565/recommended/320040/","jab2565","Jab","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jab2565/","994 products in account","Product received for free\n\nMoon Hunters is the latest game from Kitfox Games, whose previous game Shattered Planet was a good, although simple, rogue-like. This time, they are reaching for the stars (pun intended) with a high concept action/adventure game built around replayability, I just wished the gameplay was as unique as the story.\n\nTime to Kill:\n\nThe story of Moon Hunters takes place  in a strange land where the cults of the moon and sun are fighting each other. You find out one day that the moon has disappeared and the cult of the sun has branded you for death in five days. Each character belongs to different tribes (that you can select at the start,) as well as being completely different classes that determine how they play out over the course of a play.\n\nA single play of Moon Hunters occurs over the five day period, where you'll explore the land to make your mark and ultimately decide the fate of the world. Each day gives you the chance to explore one hot spot full of enemies and items. You may also go to any villages and talk to the townsfolk there.\n\nMaking decisions will impact your personalty and affect your character's personal story, along with providing upgrades to certain attributes. During combat, defeated enemies will sometimes drop opals that can be sold for upgrades. Sometimes you'll fight bosses and discover hints and story lines to fill in the blanks about the world around you.\n\nAt the end of each day, you'll have the chance to camp and perform a task of your choosing to upgrade your stats further before starting the next day. At the end of the five day period, your character's actions and choices will be remembered by the people; leading to Moon Hunter's interesting progression model.\n\nReading the Stars:\n\nInstead of going for a grand campaign or lengthy playthrough, Moon Hunters is about short, replayable  plays. At the end of the five days, the game ends, and all your actions will be processed and the game will unlock new content for you via the constellation system. For each new constellation that shows up, unlocks some kind of new content; be it costumes, new environments, characters and so on.\n\nThis is the perfect example of "trophy room" achievement design: Giving the player a representation of their achievements and progress in the game. Moon Hunters is all about you replaying the game with different characters to see more of the story and make the game bigger in the process.\n\nThis kind of high concept take on story and replayability is something we normally don't see all that much from the action/adventure genre and gives Moon Hunters a different feel to it.\n\nAs you play, you'll unlock personality statuses that will give your character an end of cycle story epilogue. While all this sounds amazing, the problem that I have with the game is a common one when story and mechanics clash.\n\nA Limited Journey:\n\nOne of the hardest things to do when it comes to game design is when you have to balance a high concept or unique system with the basic foundation of your mechanics. It's very rare to see a game get both mechanics and storytelling 100% on the same page, and Moon Hunters is sadly not one of those games.\n\nWhen you have a game that's meant to be very replayable, the basic systems have to be engaging enough to make you want to keep playing, with the achievement and progression as the icing on the cake. We can see this in the Binding of Isaac and how the core gameplay and variety of situations by itself was great, and the achievement system puts it over the top.\n\nThe problem with Moon Hunters is that for the interesting storyline and unlockable system, the base mechanics simply don't reach the same heights for several reasons. The first is that the game was built around co-op (with both local and online options.) Since you have multiple characters, each character has to be built from a basic foundation.\n\nEven though everyone has different abilities, the basic gameplay never grows or evolves; you're not going to find any game-changing upgrades. Given the five day playthrough cycle, it would have been interesting to have that factor into the character's Meta; allowing the player to impact things on the next cycle.\n\nThis kind of basic gameplay also extends into the enemy and level designs. Enemies fall into the "charge the player above all else" kind; being really easy for ranged characters and punishing for melee when the enemies can't be stunned or knocked back.\n\nI like how there are hidden bosses to find and defeat, but you only get one chance per playthrough to fight them.\n\nThe levels were designed around wide open areas that points of interests could be placed into.\n\nUnfortunately this makes them very barren other times and you'll find yourself just running through waiting for things to happen. As with the Binding of Isaac, you do unlock new environments and enemies over time, but the lack of interesting situations really hurts.\n\nSpirit in the Sky:\n\nMoon Hunters does a good job of telling an interesting story and building it on a unique world, but the gameplay simply doesn't have the same level of creativity. Despite still having a lot of constallations to unlock, I don't see myself returning to the game the same way I did with The Binding of Isaac.\n\nCreating a game that's meant to be replayed can be difficult, there needs to be enough reasons to keep coming back for more, and I don't think Moon Hunters has it.\n\nFor more on the game, you can watch the video spotlight of it on the Game-Wisdom Youtube Channel.\n\nIf you enjoyed the post, check out the Game-Wisdom[game-wisdom.com], where I examine the art and science of games.","May 26","false","1.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

The combat is good, not great, but good. It could use a little work. The story idea is interesting, but it falls short quickly. You have four days to fight and explore before the final boss fight and then you battle the final boss, and game over. Replay with different character, same thing everytime. How this game took so long to develop is beyond me. I really wanted this to be more and maybe with a big dlc and some more story enhancing it will be, but as of now, don't throw any money away. The devs got plenty from their kickstarter and can afford to put some effort into making more out of the game. It is fun though, if it goes on sale for 50 percent, get it. It will eat a couple of hours, just not 15 bucks worth of hours.","March 10","false","4.0"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","19","37","0","4"

Local multiplayer, a bit like Gauntlet, some meaningful choices, and a game clock that enforces shorter gameplay. Maybe these will appeal to prospective players; if they do, have a blast, but it's not for me.\n\nLosing a boss fight and having to start the game over was just annoying, but I got through it to see if the reward would be worth it. For me, it was not.  I'd love to have seen more of the story revealed, but it feels like in an effort to make it "open" they didn't leave a clear trail of breadcrumbs of what to do next, other than "start over with a different character", and of course in doing so, leave all those purchased upgrades behind. Again, breaking the mold in terms of traditional RPG advancement, so for folks looking for something different, maybe this will appeal.","April 24","false","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's in a place where I would expect a game to be if it was just entering early access.\n\nMy thoughts are based on playing the game in single-player mode as I have no friends. So:\n\nThe story bits you interact with are interesting and brushed with pathos, but they are too short, too sparse and the results of your choices are so murky and unpredictable that it barely feels like making a choice at all. You could flip a coin and the outcome would be equally uncertain.\n\nSome story encounters are walled off to you unless you have a certain reputation, but there's no indicator that you might need that reputation beforehand, no way aside from blind luck to acquire that reputation even if if you had known you'd need it, and no reason to come back to that area if you acquire that reputation later. (Can you even go back to nodes you've already explored? I have not tried.) It's very frustrating to run into story elements you can't interact with when they are already so few and far between.\n\nYou spend a lot of time in combat and it just feels unpolished and bad. I may be being overly harsh here because I'm also playing a lot of Nuclear Throne, which is sublime and maybe not a fair comparison, but Moon Hunters suffers from unreliable hit detection, uneven enemy AI, and sadly unbalanced character abilities. Of the six available character types, I found only the Ritualist to be useful. Other characters either do laughable damage or get swarmed in melee.\n\nThe cooking system is pretty neat, although the benefits of using it seem scant outside of multiplayer.\n\nOverall, Moon Hunters has big dreams that I applaud, but it's going to take a lot of improvement to get it to be what it seems to want to be: A rich journey of heroes who become legend not just by records of enemies slain, but by stories of paths chosen.","March 14","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the people expecting a full-scale rpg like the Witcher consider the amount of people, years and insane amount of money and marketing it takes to make an rpg longer than 40 minutes. And for the people saying that a game is not worth this amount of money they should be ashamed of themselves. It is 15$!! One meal, 3 coffees, seriously...indie companies need all the support we can give them! For the insane amount of effort this game has taken to make, it is worth every penny and more.\nI love the art, the music, the story, the love that went into this wonderful game. Thank you for making it this far! I am a fan for life!","March 11","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's in a place where I would expect a game to be if it was just entering early access.\n\nMy thoughts are based on playing the game in single-player mode as I have no friends. So:\n\nThe story bits you interact with are interesting and brushed with pathos, but they are too short, too sparse and the results of your choices are so murky and unpredictable that it barely feels like making a choice at all. You could flip a coin and the outcome would be equally uncertain.\n\nSome story encounters are walled off to you unless you have a certain reputation, but there's no indicator that you might need that reputation beforehand, no way aside from blind luck to acquire that reputation even if if you had known you'd need it, and no reason to come back to that area if you acquire that reputation later. (Can you even go back to nodes you've already explored? I have not tried.) It's very frustrating to run into story elements you can't interact with when they are already so few and far between.\n\nYou spend a lot of time in combat and it just feels unpolished and bad. I may be being overly harsh here because I'm also playing a lot of Nuclear Throne, which is sublime and maybe not a fair comparison, but Moon Hunters suffers from unreliable hit detection, uneven enemy AI, and sadly unbalanced character abilities. Of the six available character types, I found only the Ritualist to be useful. Other characters either do laughable damage or get swarmed in melee.\n\nThe cooking system is pretty neat, although the benefits of using it seem scant outside of multiplayer.\n\nOverall, Moon Hunters has big dreams that I applaud, but it's going to take a lot of improvement to get it to be what it seems to want to be: A rich journey of heroes who become legend not just by records of enemies slain, but by stories of paths chosen.","March 14","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deemen88/recommended/320040/","deemen88","deemen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deemen88/","179 products in account","Moon Hunters certainly explores some interesting ideas. The game moves along at a good pace and you can expect to finish your first playthrough in 30-60 minutes. The art is nicely done and the music is excellent as well. I absolutely love the watercolors in the game. The character portraits are some of the best I've seen. The game constantly gives you choices and situations that are different every time. It was nice to learn about the world, cook, and shape the myth of my character. The fact that you restart the same story multiple times allows you to change your build every time without being overly invested.\n\nThat being said, the game isn't without its flaws. I played it coop and solo, and the coop game is much more fun. In solo mode the combat is more punishing and less interesting. The combat also feels a little clunky. The enemies pretty much strictly run at you, it would be nice if there was more variety in their movement. The character balance in Moon Hunters is very strange too, the spell-blade is a DPS storm and can annihilate the last boss in 5 seconds. The witch who is meant to be the strong character has a long cooldown on her attack and doesn't handle nearly as well. Depending which character you pick, expect a totally different (and sometimes unbalanced) experience.\n\nI'm hopeful that Kitfox will iterate on these elements of the game with updates. I think Moon Hunters is worth spending some time with.","March 12","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the people expecting a full-scale rpg like the Witcher consider the amount of people, years and insane amount of money and marketing it takes to make an rpg longer than 40 minutes. And for the people saying that a game is not worth this amount of money they should be ashamed of themselves. It is 15$!! One meal, 3 coffees, seriously...indie companies need all the support we can give them! For the insane amount of effort this game has taken to make, it is worth every penny and more.\nI love the art, the music, the story, the love that went into this wonderful game.

As a kickstarter backer, I'm thrilled by the sheer amount of mythology and personality that's been packed into this game, not to mention the subtle humour and surprising twists in the narrative that kept me constantly engaged. The reputation system, which adorns you with particular traits based on your in game decisions, is a key driving force behind Moon Hunters' replay value because it makes one playthrough vastly different from another. What makes the experience slightly repetitive at times is the combat, due to its simplicity and the fact that enemies attack in groups and follow you relentlessly, and occasionally the geographical appearance of certain areas is the same. Furthermore there are some random bugs and the game crashed very rarely, but that didn't detract from the overall experience. Moon Hunters has some serious staying power and I adore its sensitive exploration of abandoned religions and traditions-especially one that focused on something that humanity has been fascinated with for centuries, the moon.\n\nWhat a magnificent story.","March 10","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's completely untrue. You can get to the boss and defeat him in an hour, but you won't "complete" the game in a single run. There are multiple zone types that are only unlocked by beating the game multiple times. There are multiple encounters that can only be attempted if you have certain Traits, and you won't have every trait on every character.\n\nRoguelike players will have been trained to expect multiple failures before "beating" the game, but Moon Hunters isn't about that. It's a game about stories, and you can't see the whole story without playing through the game multiple times.","March 10","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me in particular I had a game breaking issue when I tried to remap the keyboard and mouse keybindings.  The developers at Kitfox Games have since fixed a large number bugs and performance issues and even provided a full additional iteration on online multiplayer functionality.\n\nBugs at launch asside, MoonHunters is excellent in many ways.  It has very pretty visual artwork and music.  It has a play time that is shorter than a full FTL run, but like FTL you really don't experience the entirety of the game without replaying it quite a bit.  There are multiple endings and many locations impossible to experience in even a few playthroughs.  Each time you play your choices become a legacy for you that then gets written in the stars of the game, and your choices affect what happens to you in the game.  It's cool how in future playthroughs you see statues honoring your previous heros.\n\nThis game breaks the mold in many ways.  Mechanically there is no traditional level up system.  Instead your characters gradually gain stats and purchase abilities over the course of a playthrough.  Neither is there death in the traditional sense.  Rather, if your character dies you simply crawl away skipping the rest of that location and unable to gain any additional benefits from it.  In addition, all your choices in the game contribute to your character's personality. This then is factored into how you are able to interact with characters and events creating a noticably reactive world.\n\nAs you can likely see in the art this game is not set in a world of high fantasy or sci-fi, but rather one that is built around mythologies of ancient Mesopotamia and especially the Epic of Gilgamesh. This setting is a welcome breath of fresh air.\n\nVisually the game looks amazing, somehow managing to use both pixel art sprites and detailed (what I think is considered) watercolor portraits and backgrounds.  Give the soundtrack a listen as well and you will find that it is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nMultiplayer mode is very fun.  In single player mode I often go in and out of battles while maintaining max health.  Not to say that it's easy, you need to be focused and patient to do so, but on multiplayer I often find myself and teammates with less than half health and enjoying the game all the more for the tension it creates.\n\nI consider this game well rounded.  I'm not sure how else to say it.  There's a lot of meat to it, like a lot of different aspects of the game are strong.  Many games fall short in one area or another, but this game has good art, music, story, choices, combat, and replayability.  It does all this without feeling like any of its strong points are borrowed from other games.\n\nThe mystery of the misssing Moon Goddess keeps me coming back right now, but even after I know the mystery I'm sure I will want to come back to enjoy smashing pots, flirting with npcs, and fighting all manner of strange beasts with my friends.","March 10","true","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is repetitive just like most games in general but that is not the main issue.  This games would be a whole lot better if there was 1) less lag and 2) less difficulty trying to play co-op with a friend. IMO\n\nDon't let negative reviews prevent you from playing this game.
