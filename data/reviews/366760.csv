"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/recommended/366760/","thecyberdruid","TheCyberDruid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/","4925 products in account","Extremly simple physics based 'ball' game. The presentation is neat, but that's about all going for the game. The game itself is bland, very bland. You control three Adorables that can shoot in a direction of your choice in turns. Your opponent has another three Adorables that do the same. There are three modes that are essentially the same: Soccer, Ice Hockey and Beach Ball. Then there's Last Man Standing and Mummy (which are basically the same thing). The last mode is capture the flag. All modes play almost the same and there are no specials to lighten up the rather boring game play.\n\nIf you like very simple turned based physics games this might be worth to pick up in a sale or a bundle, but otherwise I wouldn't bother to get it.","April 10","false","7.9"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","28","39","2","1"

You do this by specifying in each turn, how you want your 3 players to move.\n\n- There are a few different game types to choose from: e.g. soccer, ice hockey, capture the flag, escape the mummy, knock your opponent into the water, etc, and you can choose to play in practice mode, online vs, hotseat, world tournament, etc.\n\n- The goals of each game differ depending on the type of game you select. E.g. In "capture the flag", you must get to the other team's home base, steal their flag, and bring it back to your base, while making your own flag isn't captured first. And in "escape the mummy", you must try to make the mummy turn all the players on your opponent's team into mummies themselves, while making sure you have at least 1 player still alive on your own team.\n\n\nGame mechanics\n- Movement is free anywhere within the game board as long as there are no obstacles in the way.\n\n- On each turn, you can specify 1 linear direction in which you want your player to move, as well as the amount of force.\n\n- You can also choose not to move any of your players per turn.\n\n- If players bump into objects (i.e. game board items and other players), they will rebound.\n\n- I had no problems at all playing this game using my mouse, on my laptop.\n\n\nStrategy\nWhile kids may enjoy the cute graphics & sound and appreciate the simple physics involved, more mature players soon realise that, in order to win, you have to take into account how the other team is going to move, and also in which direction all players will "rebound" when they hit stuff.\n\nDifferent game types require different methods of strategising. E.g. In "capture the flag", you may find it beneficial to not move 1 of your players and have it permanently stationed at your home base instead.\n\n\nConclusion\nAdorables operates fundamentally like carrom, but with more options and a variety of interesting contexts.\nThis really is an adorable game that I would recommend to both kids & adults alike. I can see kids enjoying the colourful, cute characters and interface, and adults having fun thinking up various strategies to beat each game type.\n\n\nDisclaimer: Game received for free, thanks to my dear friend Unpageable. :)","May 21","true","4.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It is no fun at all playing it on Steam.\n\nThere are 6 minigames in total in Adorables: soccer, beach ball, hockey, capture the flag, push off opponents to water and running away from a mummy. Soccer, beach ball and hockey can be considered as one minigame since the only difference is a friction of a ground (the ball and creatures moves faster or slower). Scoring in these requires more luck than skills. Capture the flag, pushing off and mummy are slightly more interesting, though after a moment it is way too easy to win.\nYes, AI sucks badly in this game. Opponents follow blindly ball putting it to their own goals or in case of a hockey, they stuck behind goals unable to move.\n\nIf you actually want to spend 2,99€ for this game, I strongly recommend getting it for absolutely free from Google Play.","May 13","false","6.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

No sound effects of them hitting each other and 2. The "globs" don't even make any sounds (like Aw Oh!) like in Globulos Party! There is also a free version called Globulos(dotcom), however it's multiplayer only. The ONLY things it's got going for it, the ONLY things is that it can be played singleplayer unlike Globulos(dotcom) (but Globulos on the DS is Singleplayer, much better, and only 5 bucks), it has a few more things like tournaments, and I think you can make your own "globs", which is neat. If you want a good game and have a DS, get Globulos Party off the DS store, or play on Globulos(dotcom) with a friend. However, to me, Adorables isn't a good buy until the developer(s) add sound effects, slightly better graphics, and better music, not just wind blowing like on the hockey level!\n\n\ntl;dr: Don't get this YET! It has no sound effects, no music, and needs better graphics. Get Globulos Party on DS instead, play Globulos(dotcom) with a friend online instead, or just wait until those features are added.","April 7","false","0.1"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","23","41","3","3"

Thanks, guys.)\n\nJust like Boring Man, this game's name redefines the game's namesake.   This game is ugly and boring, simply put.

Here are your modes in a nutshell:\nKing of the Hill (Push the enemies off the platform)\nSoccer\nIce Soccer (Hockey)\nBeach Soccer\nCapture the flag\nAvoid the infected\n\nThere are two ways to play, normal (which requires you to strategically predict or sabotage your enemy's gameplay) and Speed (where your moves are live time).\n\nDon't let this "Variety" fool you, it's boring.  Very boring with easy achievements (...unlocking cosmetics is going to take a LOT of grinding though).  What are these cosmetics?  Hats, eyes, mouths, and shapes give you achievements.  Colors can also be bought, but they won't give you any achievements.  Keep in mind you only get about 70-80 gold per victory...\n\n\nIs there any reason to recommend this game?

As fun as it is, it's very easy to tell that everything but the visuals was done very low-budget and was rushed. The game plays fine, but somethig about it just fells like it could and should be done better. maybe it's that animation feels stiff or unfitting to the gameplay, maybe it's that the pacing of the game is just really slow, maybe it's the mobile buttons all around the game, there's just something about it I dont like. However, this game has variety in SPADES. wanna play soccer? sure! Wanna play some CTF? They got you covered! Wanna play some Last Man Standing games, both Player vs Player and Player vs Environment? Boom. Add in World tour, Tourney, and both LAN/servered and local multiplayer and you have a decently solid game.\n\nPROS:\nDumb Fun\nAmazing graphics and cosmetic design\nVariety to an insane degree\n\nCONS:\nNo dedicated servers\nnot much AI progression in tourney mode\n"Something about it feels lazy:\nFeels like a mobile port at times.\n\nOverall this game gets a 6.3/10 for me. Wait for a sale or it to be free, and for this price point, maybe just get it if your looking for a few hours of fun, but not much more.","May 23","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well. . . come on, what is it? It is the Adorable of course, and they are just waiting for you to come and play with them.\n\nAdorable is a casual/strategy/sports/online game for all ages. This game will offer you five modes to test your skills with these adorable creatures across three different sports: Capture the Flag, the Last Adorable Standing, and the Mummy Events. The sporting events are Football (Soccer for my Aussie and American friends), Beach Football and Ice Hockey. In these sports you have to score three goals to win the game. You have to capture your opponent’s flag three times to win in the Capture the Flag game. In the Last Adorable Standing (please use a slightly Austrian accent when reading it), you will be on a platoon and you will have to get rid of the three adorable opponents by sending them off for a swim. In the Mummy Event, all you have to do is to make sure your Adorables are not touched by the Mummy.\n\nHow do you control your Adorables? Well, it is like a turn base setup. Let’s take the example of the Football. Each turn you will assign each Adorable in which direction they will travel via an arrow attached to them. You can choose how fast your Adorable will travel by stretching the arrow as fast as you can toward the direction. When you are ready to end the turn, all Adorables (yours and your opponent’s Adorables) will launch themselves towards their specific directions and you might think you are playing a game of billiards.\n\nEvery time you win a game, you will be awarded with coins which you can use towards customizing your Adorables, from body shape, mouth and eyes to different colours.  The only option missing is the ability to save your progress or just have auto save.\n\nThe graphics are cute and adorable. Catchy music (cute) and the controls are easy to use and master.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Adorable graphics\n-	6 modes to play including online\n-	Fun customisation\n-	Fun and addictive\n-	Good price point\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No Saving options\n-	Repetitive\n\nAdorables is a fun, addictive and casual game for all ages!\n\n7.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.
