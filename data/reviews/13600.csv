This masterpiece has it all:\n\n- Amazing Story. (The plot is just a marvel.)  10/10\n- Great Graphics. (I still can't believe this game was released back in 2003.)   10/10\n- Fantastic Music. (The whole soundtrack was stunning. Perfectly scripted for every situation and utterly magnificent. Stuart Chatwood quickly became one of my favorite music composers.)   10/10\n- Charming Voice Acting. (Yuri Lowenthal's voice alone was enough for the top score. The whole adventure is so beautifully narrated, so full of great ideas and outright perplexing figures of speech...)   10/10\n- Addicting Gameplay. (A great mix of combat, acrobatic free-running and a some tricky puzzles.)   10/10\n- Character Progression. (The game constantly updates the player with new powers, weapons and even clothing.)   10/10\n- Diverse and Unique. (This game has some of the most beautiful surroundings I ever seen. Lots of unique enemies and  locations to discover.)   10/10\n\nThis game is pure gold. The characters not only look amazing but they also feel... Alive. Totally different, each with it's own moral standing and their way of thinking. There is this good feeling when playing this game. Both the Prince and Farah are behaving as natural as it could get. They are very distant at the beginning, unmoved, cold. But as they make progress, they develop this feeling of mutual respect. Later on they become good friends. Joking and taunting each other in a very loving way. Check this monologue here:\n\n"She said my love... I know she did. I didn't dream it... at least I think I didn't... It's quite natural really, her Kingdoms' conquered, she has nothing, no one to protect her. She needs me! I can see it in the way she looks at me. All I'd have to do is... Reach out and, take her hand... And she'd be mine! Why am I talking to myself ?!"\n\nI have beat the game at least 5 times. Don't mind my Steam playing time. It was before I had purchased it here. And I don't regret a thing.\n\nThis game offers and unforgetable adventure. If you haven't still played it, do it. The best game in the franchise.\n\n\n\n10/10","January 21, 2014","true","9.9"," 92 of 102 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","92","102","2","0"

However the constant changing view points have resulted in my death in the game quite a bit, nonetheless magnificent scenery and captivatng story. The gameplay was a bit shakey but very wonderful, leaping through the air from beam to beam tends to exite someone, and this game created that feeling.\n\nThe addition of the sidescroller prince of persia minigames was excelent.\n\nThere were a few issues with playing on steam however, I noticed that it lacked the ability to "shift+tab" while in game. The ability to "alt+tab" still remains however it is a tedious thing to tab out of a game for the purposes of a message.\n\nI did enjoy the soundtracks but there were some moments where it would not play during a fight and then start again at random intervals. Nonetheless this did not make the fighting less intense.\n\nIn summary a very well made game, it is astonishing to believe it has really been ten years since I have played it on the ps2.\nI recomend this game for anyone who likes a good story over graphics.","March 28, 2014","true","13.3"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FriendlyNeighborhoodButcher/recommended/13600/","FriendlyNeighborhoodButcher","Autistomatic`","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FriendlyNeighborhoodButcher/","2370 products in account","This game is a true classic, all the way back from a time when ubisoft wasn't a ♥♥♥♥ tier studio that barfs out half-baked Assassin's Creed clones which run like a nightmare on moderately good hardware. But I digress, the reason why this game is nothing short of awesome is the insanely well executed platforming. In a word... the platforming is just thrilling, its really tight and rewarding despite the sometimes wonky camera. However what makes it a bit of a flawed gem in my opinion is the combat. In theory, and for most part in practice the combat is actually great, way more fun than AC. The main issue I have with the combat is just how when you get knocked down on the ground, which will happen a lot with later enemies that you cant vault over(but you cant help but try to because the vaulting and jumping is the same button but depends on the direction you're pointing towards) its going to be really hard to get back up and so you end dead before you know it, since you'll always have at least 4 enemies constantly hammering you while you're desperately trying to jump back up on your feet. I also wasn't a fan of how each time you kill an enemy a new one spawns out of nowhere to replace it, this padding felt really grindy to me and ended up feeling much more frustrating than challenging so I found myself wanting to get through the otherwise excellent combat to get back to that oh so sweet sweet platforming action. Other than that the gameplay is just perfect. The setting, story, music and the decade+ old graphics all still hold up really well today.\nRegarding the technical stuff, you'll need to patch it for high res. support and disable the in game fog option if everything looks grey. I noticed some voice overs skipping and very rarely some weird physics happening @ 144hz, it didn't really detract from the gameplay though. Also It has partial controller support only, so I recommend using xpadder fill in the missing keys that will allow you to save and toggle walk with your controller. Thats it...\n\nPlay it/10","March 6, 2015","true","17.0"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is one of the most successful revivals in gaming history, and it is well deserved for having done so. The game is a third-person platformer interspersed with action segments featuring melee combat. A time-rewinding mechanic is present to assist both in combat and platforming, which can be recharged by defeating enemies.\n\nThe platforming is the focus of the game, and the combat serves more to break up the puzzles - the controls for combat are not as tight as those for platforming, so those sections of the gameplay can be a little less interesting/more frustrating.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are rather imaginative, and require some acrobatic moves in order to complete them.\n\nWhile the graphics are starting to show their age, the game itself holds up. If you enjoy puzzle platformers, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game.","February 22, 2014","true","34.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

These are usually pretty simple to work out once you realise most of them have only one path but when you consider how they work as a whole they are pretty ingenious and will challenge you're platforming skills and timing.\n\n+Great atmosphere and art direction. The Persian setting is unique and rarely done. Even in 2014 this game looks excellent. The character models haven't aged well but the environments have for sure.\n\n+Ability to rewind time and use it in battle is an excellent idea\n\n+First person view allows you to offset the terrible camera\n\n+Varied enemies force you to engage combat in different ways\n\n+The Prince. Although it happens infrequently, when the Prince does chime in it's usually something humorous and entertaining.\n\nCons:\n-The camera is a pain whether you're doing platforming or you're in combat. During platforming the camera will frequently move into undesirable positions forcing you to guess what you're supposed to be doing next. In combat it does the same which quickly becomes tiresome when you're unable to see the enemy attacking you from behind. It also struggles hard when you're in tight spaces and the camera has to contend with walls :S\n\n-You're companion is kinda useless and it feels as if you're partnership is a one way deal. During platforming she will stand there and let you do all the work aside from when she has to go through a few cracks or pull a few triggers (to Ubisoft's credit they use this as a point of humour which is much appreciated). In combat she is the same. The AI refuses to move from a certain position unless you stray too far from her which means that when there are multiple enemies attacking her she is essentially a sitting duck which wouldn't be too bad but she has very low health. Oh and her arrows can harm you. She killed me once when I had one enemy left to kill and a number of times her arrow has hit me stunning me for a number of enemies to take away my remaining health. Her voice actor is also very poor.\n\n-Combat encounters take far too long on occasions. You would expect combat to last about a cpuple of minutes at the most but sometimes they take double that making those encounters tedious to go through.\n\n-Fall heights are deceptive. There are essentially 3 fall heights. Twice you're height which the prince can handle. 2-3 times you're height the Prince will lose a bit of health. Anything above 3 times you're height and the Prince will die. This becomes incredible frustrating when you have what appears to be a manageable fall and yet the prince cant take it. What would have been useful is a more lenient falling system where you took larger damage rather than outright dying for higher drops.\n\n-The story. It feels as though everything is rushed. You never get a chance at the beginning to digest what is actually going and then suddenly you're on this Grand Adventure. What's worse is that at no point aside from the end of the game is the story truly developed, which is a shame because the concept is excellent. There are points in which the subplot with you're companion is expanded but it feels so contrived especially since she is so damn unlikable.\n\nMisc thoughts:\n\n=You're companion would be far more likeable if she was controllable. Frequently during the game there are situations only she can deal with like crawl into narrow spaces etc. I stand by my point that she is still useless as you tend to do 95% of the work but being able to control her would have enabled more complex puzzles and allowed there to be more varied\nplatforming challenges if creative enough. In combat it would allow you to experience a different combat style and allow you to better position her to reduce damage if you were primarily going to play as the Prince. I belieev this would also help you better engage with her as a character (although thevoice acting is still terrible)\n\n=It would be nice to have a larger variety of sand based abilities to use.\n\n=Controller support on PC would have made the game much more easier to control but as it is it's still very much playable.\n\nFinal thought:\nGet the game if you enjoy excellent platforming and puzzles but pass if you're buying it for excellent combat or story.","August 4, 2014","true","11.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Challenging but not frustrating. Acrobatics are incredibly fun. Puzzles are interesting without stopping you dead. Fighting is tight, responsive, and gives you a fine amount of attacks, dodges and the like. Good balance of how much time you spend on the different gameplay types herein: acrobatics, dodging traps, fighting, and solving puzzles. The score is cool, rock music with a Middle Eastern touch. Likeable characters. Engaging story. The graphics hold up rather well, albeit the pre-rendered cutscenes show the limitations.\n\nCons: some find the fighting too restrictive. The camera does get in the way, albeit using Landscape Cam, letting it "stick" to the current area for a clear view, can help. Roll and Jump are on the same key, which does mean you'll sometimes do one intending to do the other. You'll also sometimes accidentally run up a wall when you meant to run along it, and vice versa. If you play for half an hour and you don't think it's varied enough: you *will* not find the game overall to be. No collectibles, only one difficulty setting and no way for you to affect the story means little replayability.\n\n(please ignore how little time it says I've played - I've completed it several times, just not via Steam)\n\nI recommend this to any fan of fast-paced action-adventure.","March 26","true","0.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The puzzles and platform sequences are great fun, though the camera can sometimes cause a bit of confusion.\n\nMy only main complaint about the game is that there's just a tad too much hack and slash gameplay versus the 'sand of time zombies'.

The developers should have understood they were making PoP, not a God of War game. So as it stands I give it an 8,0 out of 10 (would have been a 9,0 without the excessive combat sequences that pop up every now and then).\n\nBut definitely, buy this game and enjoy its great gameplay because it's so worth it!","January 1, 2015","true","19.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

By today's standard, the graphics still look great and animation is even more fluid with the advance of video card speed.  The platforming is well executed.  The levels can be massive at times and requires you to go through a maze of wall runs, jumps, and many other acrobatic maneuvers in order to reach your goal.  The game almost runs like each major room is a level and you need to reach its objective/goal in order to move on to the next level.  The action can feel rather repetitive, however, some of the enemies do require a different approach and strategy to take down and kill.  However, the game is well paced to keep the actions repetition from annoying the gameplay too much.  Overall though, the fight scenes are well choreographed and your character looks really cool in action.  The introduction of the Sands of Time and the knife that allows you to rewind time if you fall to your death or get killed in battle is a really cool gimmick that works and fits very well in this game.  The storyline is great, especially when you realize how the beginning and the end come together to completely understand the story.  This is a classic, just as much as the original 2D Prince of Persia is a classic as well.  If you've never played this game, you should do yourself a favor and pick this up and play it.","January 11, 2015","true","8.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

The camera, for one, is horrible and at times can really mess things up, especially during combat. And this particular version of the game has a few strange bugs, but nothing game breaking (except for one at the end of the game which forced me to reload my last save).\nThose things aside however, the game is really solid. The gameplay is fun and quite a bit challenging, there are lots of platforming sections and environmental puzzles which are fun to go through. The story is... all right, nothing earth shattering but engaging enough and well executed, in my opinion.\nIf you haven't played it already, please do so, you will most likely enjoy it.

For me also introduction to Ubisoft games. And I really liked it. The story is awesome and has that fairy tale feeling to it. This is especially due to the fact that the game is mostly played in the past and is a story told by the narrator. So if you die the commentator says that this is not what happened and starts from a checkpoint. I love this and it makes it unique. The combat is fun for a while but having to battle guards over and over can get repetitive. But this game is more about the jumping, platforming, climbing and dodging. The parkour here is only flawed by the VERY weird camera shifting that killed me more times than enemies did. Luckily there is the dagger of time so you can rewind those mistakes. However it needs to be recharged so you have a limited number of tries. Overall a very cool game that has some bugs and annoying parts which mostly fade next to the epic story telling and puzzles.

I was really impressed for how well it stands up today.  The combat must of been an inspiration for Batman: ArKham Asylum, as the controls and overall core mechanic are very simlar.  The game does suffer from some camera/control issues that you don't usually see in today's top games. Story is decent and for the most part the exporation and puzzles are well done.  The save system works great as a story telling device and allows the user to reload after death as though the story was just being told wrong and needed to be corrected.  The other core mechanic is the Dagger of Time and it works pretty well as a recovery tool which you need fairly often to fix some of the control issue mistakes.  Hmmm, wonder which came first?

The story is quite linear but the ending is simple yet amazingly well done.\n\nPresentation: 8/10 Great aesthetic and atmosphere. Good looking levels and character motion. You're likely forget you're playing a 10+ years old game once you're in. Not a single bug was found through the entire game. Voice acting is a bit silly sometimes, but it doesn't hurt the experience. There's no native support for HD resolutions or X360 controller. The camera control got me annoyed sometimes.\n\nGameplay:  9/10 Tight controls in both platforming and combat. Movement is fast and fluid, puzzles are simple and rewarding. The combat system is fairly simple (very similar to found in Batman: Arkham Asylum) but fights can get tough sometimes. Its combat core mechanics lacks of depth given that the player can only attack, dodge and block. Overall level design is well done.\n\nStory: 7/10 Predictable from the beggining and slow paced through the game. As the game is platforming driven with combats filling in between, the story take place mostly in background. The last hour of the game is filled with more interesting facts that lead to a very well written climax at the end of the game, that left me wishing to play the sequel.","April 27, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Sands of TIme is a masterpiece in video game design, story telling, puzzling and a somewhat functioning combat system. If you get used to the combat of dodging, wall jumping and frog jumping over enemies to defeat them, then you shouldn't have a problem, yet the combat is the weakest part of the game. It can be frustrating and you may ask yourself, "How many ♥♥♥♥ing sand soldiers are there?" as they seemingly respawn for an infinite amount during the fight sequences. What is truly remarkable about the game is the character development of the Prince and his ability to grow affectionate for a sworn enemy. Now, if you do play this game on Steam, I highly recommend using a controller and binding the keys/actions in the games options, as the Keyboard and Mouse controls are clunky and extremely frustrating where I really wanted to quit playing the game, even though I was so close to beating it. Great game, terrible PC controls, use a controller.\n\n9.6/10","November 23, 2013","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That much is obvious. However it is more than worth it. The first to bring up the idea of rewinding time to fix your mistakes in parkouring instead of killing you instantly. Like plenty of platforming games of its' time a single mistake would normally send you to a quick death. With the time mechanics of PoP if you have the available resources you can go back and fix those mistakes. The combat is simple yet satisfying when you survive a horde of sand monsters. With a unique health recovery system of drinking water stumbling upon a basin of water or pool is like finding an oasis in the desert. While Prince of Persia is a classic game it has a few problems.\n\nThe biggest one is sometimes the controls don't work too well on a mouse and keyboard. With the health system you can go a long time with low health and end up suffering a few frustrating deaths multiple times. There are also a few enemies that are lackluster (crows, scarabs) that get annoying. This is compounded by a short animation that plays of your character putting his weapons away that you can't skip. The last con is that save points have you seeing a vision of a possible future. While it is a neat way of giving you hints there are far too many that are close to each other.\n\nTo sum it up Prince of Persia is the start of a good series that hit a home run despite the few problems it has. If you want a classic platformer this is the game for you with crazy contraptions and fun applications of platforming. This game is plenty of fun.","February 16, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you do manage to run out, the game is very forgiving in its checkpoints and save points.\nThe only thing I would change about this game is the fact that you're escorting a character pretty much throughout the entire game, which can lead to a lot of annoying combat situations and deaths. All I shall say about it is "You have a bow, stupid NPC! Learn the meaning of RANGED COMBAT!"\nOverall, a decent fun game, I actually want to play it again already after having only just beaten it.

The Prince of Persia Trilogy are some of my favorite games of all time, and I enjoyed them quite a bit on both PS2 and the original Xbox. Also, PC generally tends to be the most backwards compatible platform out there, and really the place to go to in general for those of us with a bit of a nostalgia kick. I've been able to play the original Doom, the original Diablo, Quest for Glory 1, King's Quest 1 (remake), Dune 2, and countless other older games on my new computer (core i7 with SLI GTX 980s, 32 gb ram, and 5 ssds in a RAID on Windows 10) over the past year with little or no issues.\n\nThere are far too many technical issues that ruin the experience here to make it worthwhile though. With having to set up resolutions outside of game to get it to even start to show up on modern monitors, a white out/fog glitch that makes it imposssible to see anything (and I mean anything, the prince, ground, walls, enemies all invisible), no real controller support, and the issues go on. Yes, most of the issues have solutions in the forums, and I probably would have been okay with one or two issues, but that there are so many. I have to go to too many different forum topics and edit ini files to get this game to the start of a playable state, makes it so I just can't recommend this version of it.\n\nIf you want to play or replay this game, do yourself a favor and get the PS3 version off Playstation Network. It supports modern resolutions, widescreen, runs smoothly, and even supports active 3d if that's your thing. All with much less work than this version. I feel like if Ubisoft wants to continue selling this on steam, it needs warnigs about it's issues on the store page, or some serious patching love.","March 17","false","0.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The camera gets in the way, the puzzles are dull, the combat is repetitive (and dull), the auto-aiming is horrid, and some of the basic controls are finicky (e.g., wall-running and time-control).\n\nI'm sure that if I had played this when it came out on the original Xbox, and had I been 13 at the time, I would have loved it. It's unfortunate, though, that I've played too many games that do too many of the things this game attempts - but better.","July 31, 2014","false","3.9"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","0"

The game seems fantastic with excellent graphics and story, and i really loved giving the parkour side a run but the game is very difficult to control.  I made it to the wall jumping section for the dagger but found the control seems to almost randomly jump between mouse view and platformer view (ie: still camera view with  left, right, forwards, and backwards).  This seems to be most common when near walls and can make it near impossible to line up a wall to parkour across.  I wont even mention the button mashing to get up the chimney like walls to the dagger.  Unfortunately this has detracted greatly from the fun of playing the game and i will be giving this one a big miss for the future.","September 1, 2014","false","0.9"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","3"

This game has so much potential but I haven't been more frustrated with a game since the N64 days when I was 12. The god-awful combat sections are enough to say you should pass this game over, but I could also add things like: The audio system is terrible; crank dialogue up to 100% and everything else to 10% to hear anything. The anti-success camera seems to intentionally do exactly the worst possible thing at any given moment, making control almost impossible. The movement controls are really buggy, in the sense that you will find yourself constantly doing the wrong thing for the buttons you pressed and the situation you were in (hold northwest to go south?). Get used to playing the same 10 minutes over and over for an hour, so you can move onto the next hour-long 10 minute chunk.\n\nThis game LOOKS like it should be good, and the reviewers loved it.

Why was this considered innovative again? The combat is nonsense. When you start a fight, there's no indication how long it could go on, because enemies spawn in waves, and how many is anyone's guess. Their AI is mindless. They just crowd around and jostle you and each other while attacking every few seconds. Frequently your character will be blocked from view by this. Allegedly you can aim your strikes by using WASD while attacking but in practice it's a crapshoot, and even worse with the dagger.\n\nThe platforming is pathetically easy, except for when you drop like a rock in the middle of a totally legit jump because the game has another route in mind for you to take. The environments are sprawling, homogenous and arbitrary; half of them have no apparent function but to be filled with booby traps. The puzzles look daunting but ultimately are paper tigers.\n\nInstead of playing this, why not track down the first three Harry Potter PC games? Basically the same mechanics, and they were as wretched as this one too, but there was a charming humility about them. You got to play as Harry Potter and explore Hogwarts and collect beans and magical trading cards and interact with your favorite Harry Potter characters and stuff. It was goofy and kind of cute.

Fluid acrobatics across the rafters of ornate palace rooms and along the sides of immense towers combine with the perfect safety mechanism - the ability to briefly rewind time and undo that disastrous jump or ill-timed leap into a rotating saw blade. The rewind ability is limited in use so that it doesn't become a crutch or make things too easy, but remains effective at helping to curb the frustration that would result from, for instance, a single mistake at the very end of a run of successes.

While this isn't necessarily a perfect way to continue into this game, it's the best one I've thought of. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is one you probably already know about. If you don't, then what you should know is that this game is half parkour simulator and half sword-fighting game; the latter of which I found to be incredibly infuriating at times, but I'll talk about that part later.\n\nThe platforming in this game is really, really fun. There's a slight bit of puzzle to the platforming sections, but usually never to the point where you've gotta stop for a minute or two to think about how you're gonna tackle these jumps. Those are saved for the actual puzzles in the game, of which there are about five puzzle areas. The first one is of the highest quality in my opinion, but that's not to say that the later ones are bad; it's just that the first one is really well-designed. As far as the controls go, there's essentially a "magic parkour button," (you should definitely use a controller for this game, by the way) and most of the actions are done automatically. This can lead you to throw yourself off of a ledge more than a few times when you're starting out, but thankfully you've got the ability to rewind time once you get the Dagger of Time.\n\nThis brings me to the combat, which I feel is both far too simple and far too complex. It's far too complex, since there are apparently 50+ combos that you can do in the game, of which I only ever really needed one (attack attack attack attack etc.), and there is no documentation in-game for the combos. That's not to say that having combos are a bad thing; I'd just like to know what they are. The game does no tutorializing as far as combos go, and in fact I only learned about this vast number of combos because I looked it up. This is one of the main reasons why the game can be very frustrating; I'm assuming that these combos are in the manual or something, but the Steam version doesn't come with a manual. Even then, the combos really should be in game in a menu somewhere. Also, there were many times in which I found myself stuck on the ground and unable to get up. It turns out that if you are blocking while you're on the ground, you can't get up. The game doesn't tell you about this either. Another reason why the game is too complex for its own good is that there's only about six different types of enemies throughout the entire game, and they all pretty much have the same AI pattern of "surround player, stunlock to death," which sure does suck whenever your  only real way of getting out of that situation is jumping over enemies, and the type of enemy surrounding you are ones that can't be jumped over.\n\nThe game is also far too simple, partly because of one major sin: automatic lock-on. If you are even pointing your analog stick in the directon of the enemy, you'll magically be attracted to that enemy for a while, even if you're pointing away from them. It's really annoying, and can lead to many times of getting surrounded. Trying to roll through a tight gap to avoid getting surrounded by un-jumpable enemies? Too bad; you're jumping on the un-jumpable enemy. Trying to attack a once faraway enemy that you're getting closer to? You will if you get lucky enough that the Prince stops ogling at an enemy you were attacking prior. Even beyond the frustrating bits with the controls, there's the fact that every single enemy is defeated in the same way: attack until they fall on their stomach, use the dagger to absorb them. Also yes, if you were wondering, the lock-on can mess you up with this as well, leading you to use powerups on enemies you didn't want to when you were just trying to absorb some sand.\n\nAnd then there's your game-long escort, Farah. Notice how I said escort and not partner? Intentional. She's an absolute idiot in combat. She comes with a bow, but constantly insists on standing statuesque directly in the fray, even when being attacked, when a much simpler solution would be for her to get to some dang high ground. There's loads of it around, so there's really no excuse for it. Also, if she dies, the game is over. What does she offer to the game as a whole? The ability to crawl through small gaps. Yes, in the grand scheme of things, she's about as useful as a puppy, mouse, or other small animal. She's about as useful in combat as well, actually. You see, she can't actually kill enemies. She just stuns them every now and then when she's not looking around in random directions admiring the architecture as though the idea of stone buildings is the most amazing thing ever. Long story short, she's absolutely useless and is more of a liablility than anything else.\n\nSpeaking of the architecture (and something positive), the level design is fantastic. I'll go more into detail in the graphics section, but for now, I can definitely say that they did an excellent job creating a world that feels natural for the most part. There are a few pretty contrived places here and there, but who knows what those crazy architects are up to anymore, eh? Apart from that, though, that's all I really have to say about this game's gameplay. The platforming is super fun, but the combat just really brings the game down in my opinion. Then again, maybe games like Metal Gear Rising, Bayonetta, and Devil May Cry 1 have led me to expect too much from these kinds of games. I still stand with what I said at the beginning; this game would be so much better if it were two games: a game focused almost entirely on platforming with maybe 5% of the game being combat, and another game being 95% combat (with a more-developed combat system/enemy variety) and 5% platforming. As is, you've got one really good thing and one really frustrating thing which kinda makes me not wanna play this game again. If it weren't for the combat, this game would easily get a 10/10 from me, but with the combat, it drops to a 7/10. Great at times; absolutely miserable at others.\n\nStory: You may have gathered from that one paragraph that I don't like Farah all that much. You'd be right. To be honest, it still doesn't really make sense why she comes along at all; she's useful for being small and that's about it. All this being said though, she's not a badly written character; just an okay one. She is a love interest of the Prince, which again feels pretty contrived to me, and to be quite frank; I think the Prince is insane for wanting her. Oh well; I couldn't possibly hope to understand what goes through the Prince's head. As for the prince itself, he's pretty much straddling the line between hero and anti-hero. He wants to do good, but he's a bit of a selfish prat at the same time. Then again, he *is* a prince, so you can't expect him to have had the greatest socialization experience growing up, so fair enough. Apart from Farah and the Prince, everyone else is just a minor character. The premise and delivery is pretty cool, too; it's being told in terms of a story, and as such, has the ablility to go back and forth, as does happen with the story and the gameplay. It's all quite clever, I must admit. While the character arcs may not be the most amazing thing ever, I can appreciate the clever nature of the delivery and the premise enough to give it an 8/10.\n\n(I actually have run out of space; time to put the rest in the comments again!)","December 25, 2014","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Aside from the compelling plot and memorable characters, Sands of Time features some of the best puzzle-platforming you'll find in any game. Fluid acrobatics across the rafters of ornate palace rooms and along the sides of immense towers combine with the perfect safety mechanism - the ability to briefly rewind time and undo that disastrous jump or ill-timed leap into a rotating saw blade. The rewind ability is limited in use so that it doesn't become a crutch or make things too easy, but remains effective at helping to curb the frustration that would result from, for instance, a single mistake at the very end of a run of successes. Combined with the brilliant and challenging level design, intuitive controls, and enough hidden secrets to make it worth playing over again, Sands of Time is an extremely satisfying game.","December 20, 2010","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now replaying it again I can still say it was one of my favorite games of the 00's; however it is beginning to show it's age.  SoT still has great level design, an interesting although simple story and platforming that holds up really well.  Traversing the environments feels very fluid and provides a sense of accomplishment.\n\nIt's not all good though, there are two glaring issues one being an awful camera and the other being some of the most tedious combat you'll ever experience.  The fighting is extremely simplistic and not all that hard; but they will spawn upwards of 20 enemies to fight through in spots which really drags down the pacing of the game.  As for the camera, I'm using a widescreen patch and playing at 1920 x 1080, so I'm not sure if there is some bugginess with my setup; but I've found the camera to be really hard to orient, especially during fights.  It'll often get stuck behind scenery or zoom in too close.  Most games solved camera issues about 5 or 6 years ago so to go back to a game with a glitchy camera feels even more frustrating.\n\nOverall though if you can look past the dated mechanics you'll get to experience a great game that many consider a classic.","August 10, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was originally released for major platforms (at the time) in 2003. Age has only made this game more of a gem. For those who have played Prince of Persia games in the past, and even this one, I would definately reccomend this, it is worthy as one of your many games in your steam library. This game is vastly better than Prince of Persia: Forgotten Sands 2010. To all newcomers to the franchise, I believe that this is the best Prince of Persia game there is. It is perfectly priced as a cheap but reputable price: £6.99 (although I did buy this during a sale at 50% off, I would reccomend buying at its full price too).\n\nSTORY 10/10\nThe story is very immersive, you virtually become the Prince of Persia, as he parkours and fights is way through the palace. The well written story and script adds to the characters' personalities and emotions. As the Prince's emotions grew, I became more empathetic of his lonliness and suspicions. It took me approximately 7 hours and 30 mins to complete, it will keep you hooked towards the end where the story becomes more intense and close to an end. For a game of its time, this is HUGE. It definately will take many sittings to complete, as it has many save points to allow you to save and "Continue my story from here..."\n\nGAMEPLAY 10/10\nSuperbly varied and stylish combat, enemies become progressively harder, but base mechanics still apply. Few minor glitches do occur rarley however. Smooth mechanics of using 'The Sands' to travel through time to correct errors. Movement is fluent and fun, especially when doing parkour puzzles, and backflips during combat. The graphics are very ahead of its time, and there are some colossal areas to explore and mount during the game.\n\nPORT 9/10\nRuns like a dream, I had no problems running this on Win 8 and Win 10. I would drop it a point due to its lack of (1st party) Xbox One controller support, but using keyboard+mouse was seemless and after the first 30 mins of play feels natural and intended. Using keyboard does cause minor ♥♥♥♥-ups during parkour, but its nothing to ruin the experience.","December 5, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They're minimal, sure but I keep finding myself trying to jump off a wall or dodge in a particular direction but more often then not I wind up jumping the wrong way and rolling straight into enemies. This gets amplifed by the fact the direction depends on where the camera is facing and I have to wrestle with said camera ALL THE TIME. It doesn't help that the game oftens moves the camera on you and you have to guess which direction is the one you want to go. It's unbelievably frustrating.\n\nHowever, if you can bare having to deal with the camera switching directions on you, the game can be quite fun. Running off walls, flipping switches, fencing with... undead sand people, etc. You'll even eventually have a companion with you that helps out along the way. Said companion will frequently comment on what the player character is doing during gameplay such as being initially scared of you using a save point and eventually learning that it's harmless.\n\nIf you want to see what the fuss is about, I say get this game. Just be aware of the annoying camera issues.","December 26, 2013","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is masterfully told, and was one of the first games I remember to really embrace the unique medium of video games. Whether it's the Prince's narration during the pause screen, or the moment you realize exactly how the main menu fits into the plot. The Sands of Time stands apart as a true masterpiece of video game storytelling.\n\nThe platforming, parkour gameplay, which eventually inspired Assassin's Creed, was surprisingly polished and fluid for the time. Gamers that have grown accustomed to more modern games may find it a bit simple, but gamers that remember the many headaches of 3D platforming on N64 will appreciate the ability to execute leaps and ledge grabs with precision. This game was clearly designed for analogue stick movement however; having to use WASD to move is a travisty.\n\nThe combat has always been the low point of this game. At best, it's a tedious, repetive affair, forcing you to learn the exact combination of acrobatic and combat skills to bring an enemy down easiest, and repeat that over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. At worst the combat is downright broken. The camera has tremendous difficulty keeping the Prince's schitzophrenic auto targeted foes in frame while bouncing off walls and around pillars. The Prince himself seems utterly unable to avoid striking the wrong target. A noteworthy design flaw is the fact that you can only block/parry when you are focused on an enemy, but you only focus on the last enemy that hit you, and it's rare for the same enemy to attack twice in a row.\n\nEven with the poor controls, camera issues, and tedious combat, The Sands of Time is worth playing for anyone interested in pushing video games as a valid storytelling medium. It shines even among modern games as the standard for story quality while making the telling an accomplishment that couldn't be done in any other medium.","April 2, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat in this particular iteration was not as deep and satisfying as that in Warrior Within, but it has wonderful puzzles and platforming is an absolute joy. The time related mechanics keep the game from being too punishing without making it easy (the game would keep more or less the same level of difficulty if they were removed, but they keep it from becoming annoying). Also, the game is filled to the brim with charm. Everything from the visual art direction to the music makes you want to lose yourself in the game world. I highly recommend the Sands of Time trilogy to anyone that likes puzzle platformers with good combat systems and a wonderful story.\n\nP.S. It's amazing how the same team that created this also created Assassin's Creed which has extremely dumbed down combat and platforming (comparatively at least). I love the Assassin's Creed series but every time I play one of those games I can't help but think that it would have been a better game if more of the mechanics were similar to the Sands of Time trilogy.","March 20, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

PoP 2008 as a reboot is a different thing and I do give it a proper actual recommendation.\n\nI played this game originally back when it was released a decade ago, and had a blast. The rewinding time mechanics were truly a wonderful technological and gameplay innovation. Playing through a second time recently was a bit of a challenge due to things such as terrible camera angles and changes that are barely controllable (it must not have seemed so bad then, but is nearly unforgivable now), combat is simple and a bit enjoyable but seems mostly to be a grind to refill time sand used to rewind time. The time rewinding mechanics are still fun and neat, but now just seem more and more like a limited use and poorly implemented quicksave and quickload or checkpoint system. It just seems punitive when bad camera angles, blind jumps, and controls that do not always do what you want cost you time sand over and over. Other modern issues to tackle are unsurprisingly difficult support for modern monitor aspect ratios and resolutions, but they are not horrible with a little tweaking.\n\nThe story, character interactions, and wit are just about as good as ever.

Okay. Sands of Time is an absolute gem of a game and it is by far the best of the trilogy overall. The characters are memorable, the story is novel, if not truly unique. The gameplay is elegant and flowing, and the eponymous Sands of Time fits perfectly into it. Among other things the Sands allow you to rewind up to ten seconds to retry a jump you missed or combat you messed up, which is both constantly handy and occasionally hilarious.

By far the best game I have played in a while. Story is absolutely perfect, dialogs are vivid and realistic.  Acrobatic sequences aren't too hard, because you can reverse time. So, one mistake doesn't send you to the beginning. There are even some puzzles, but don't worry, they are easy and fun to solve. Fighting enemies is joy to watch, because prince is doing some incredible moves, however you must learn different combos, otherwise you are screwed. Later in the game some fights are hard, I'll say too hard. This is only major drawback I can think of - there are no difficulty settings. By far the hardest part in the game is fight in a elevator. It took me about 20 tries to beat it.\n\nI can definitely recommend this game. Oh, I forget to mention the soundtrack, it is top class. I love the music.","December 28, 2013","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is masterfully told, and was one of the first games I remember to really embrace the unique medium of video games. Whether it's the Prince's narration during the pause screen, or the moment you realize exactly how the main menu fits into the plot. The Sands of Time stands apart as a true masterpiece of video game storytelling.\n\nThe platforming, parkour gameplay, which eventually inspired Assassin's Creed, was surprisingly polished and fluid for the time. Gamers that have grown accustomed to more modern games may find it a bit simple, but gamers that remember the many headaches of 3D platforming on N64 will appreciate the ability to execute leaps and ledge grabs with precision. This game was clearly designed for analogue stick movement however; having to use WASD to move is a travisty.\n\nThe combat has always been the low point of this game. At best, it's a tedious, repetive affair, forcing you to learn the exact combination of acrobatic and combat skills to bring an enemy down easiest, and repeat that over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. At worst the combat is downright broken. The camera has tremendous difficulty keeping the Prince's schitzophrenic auto targeted foes in frame while bouncing off walls and around pillars. The Prince himself seems utterly unable to avoid striking the wrong target. A noteworthy design flaw is the fact that you can only block/parry when you are focused on an enemy, but you only focus on the last enemy that hit you, and it's rare for the same enemy to attack twice in a row.\n\nEven with the poor controls, camera issues, and tedious combat, The Sands of Time is worth playing for anyone interested in pushing video games as a valid storytelling medium. It shines even among modern games as the standard for story quality while making the telling an accomplishment that couldn't be done in any other medium.","April 2, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They're minimal, sure but I keep finding myself trying to jump off a wall or dodge in a particular direction but more often then not I wind up jumping the wrong way and rolling straight into enemies. This gets amplifed by the fact the direction depends on where the camera is facing and I have to wrestle with said camera ALL THE TIME. It doesn't help that the game oftens moves the camera on you and you have to guess which direction is the one you want to go. It's unbelievably frustrating.\n\nHowever, if you can bare having to deal with the camera switching directions on you, the game can be quite fun. Running off walls, flipping switches, fencing with... undead sand people, etc. You'll even eventually have a companion with you that helps out along the way. Said companion will frequently comment on what the player character is doing during gameplay such as being initially scared of you using a save point and eventually learning that it's harmless.\n\nIf you want to see what the fuss is about, I say get this game. Just be aware of the annoying camera issues.","December 26, 2013","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aside from the compelling plot and memorable characters, Sands of Time features some of the best puzzle-platforming you'll find in any game. Fluid acrobatics across the rafters of ornate palace rooms and along the sides of immense towers combine with the perfect safety mechanism - the ability to briefly rewind time and undo that disastrous jump or ill-timed leap into a rotating saw blade. The rewind ability is limited in use so that it doesn't become a crutch or make things too easy, but remains effective at helping to curb the frustration that would result from, for instance, a single mistake at the very end of a run of successes. Combined with the brilliant and challenging level design, intuitive controls, and enough hidden secrets to make it worth playing over again, Sands of Time is an extremely satisfying game.","December 20, 2010","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Got it for my 8th birthday, and it took me forever to finish it because I was really bad at games and was scared of the sand monsters. Naturally, with a history like this, I am deeply, DEEPLY biased towards this game, so you should probably take my review of it with a huuuuuuge grain of salt.\n\nWell, with that out of the way, let's begin, eh?\n\nJust some fyi history for those interested:\n\nThis game is actually the fourth in a series that started back in 1989. The original game was a 2d sidescrolling-ish platformer-ish based entirely of (for its time) realistic movement and 1v1 sword duels. It was a pretty big success, and it spawned two sequels. The first one was just like the original in design, just better looking, longer and more cryptic. I haven't beaten it without cheats to this day, and especially the last level is very unintuitive, though also very memorable.\nSadly, the third game was made in a time where EVERYTHING had to go 3d. Though originally intended as a 2d game just like its predecessors, it was ground through the 3d meatwolf. Though I personally loved it, it wasn't a big success (understandably so), and the series went dead for a few years. Eventually, Ubisoft got the rights, and with the help of the original developer Jordan Mechner, they created a new Prince of Persia game, with a new character, and a semi-new setting (it's still Persia obviously, just somewhere else in Persia).\nSo what's the story? A young persian prince is riding with his dad, the king of Persia, to conquer and raid an indian palace. With the help of a traitor on the inside (an evil vizier, what a shocker), they get through the gates and storm the palace. The prince gets into the (unrealistically huge) treasure chamber, where two mysterious and powerful artifacts are housed: The hourglass, and the dagger of time. The prince claims the dagger for himself, and the persian army moves on to the kingdom of Azhat (Azat? Ahza... I don't even know if it's a real place, something like that anyway), where the evil vizier tricks the prince into ramming the dagger into the hourglass. That wasn't such a great idea, as it turns out, as the magical sand blasts out of the hourglass, ruining the palace and corrupting all living things inside, turning them into immortal zombies. No matter how many times you strike them down, they just pop back up. Unless the prince rams his dagger into their bellies and sucks the sand out of them, then they die for good. So now it's on: the prince and Farah, the daughter of the indian Maharaja, team up to fix the terrible mess that was caused.\nYou spend a lot of time around Farah actually, and she is a very great character to be around. Helping you out in battle with her bow and arrow, crawling though creaks too small for the bulky prince, helping him solve puzzles, and being an allaround believable and likable character. She's one of the few companion characters done right, and I say that even though you sometimes have to protect her during battle, which is, as we are all aware, the worst thing in gaming.\nThe game builds a very nice atmosphere too; it's just you and Farah in a ruined, but still beautiful world. Moonlit gardens, waterfilled caverns with flickering reflections, great halls and massive towers; the architectural design is as unbelievable as it can get, but it never takes you out of the moment since the game oviously has no pretends of being realistic; it's a fairy tale, 1001 night with time zombies, and even to this day, it's a beautiful looking game.\nGameplay is pretty fun, though the games following after it improved on the combat, it's still very solid. You swing your sword, you block, you counter, you can do some fancy jump maneuvers over enemies heads and off of walls. Most uniquely though, you can wind back time for a bit using your dagger, That technique is equally useful during combat as it is during platforming. You don't have to start back at the checkpoint every single time you die that way, which is really nice. Also, you can slow down time during combat, or freeze an enemy in place and then chop it to dust; ooor you can unleash a very strange finishing move where all the enemies get frozen and you zhip around between them, chopping em all up. It's nothing too special, but it's entertaining nonetheless.\nSo that's about all I can say about the game without giving the story away. As it stands, the only real problem I have with the steam release is that the ingame steam overlay doesn't work. But here's the strangest part: when I installed the game off the old disc version I still had lying around, and added it as a non-steam game, the overlay worked fine. What's up with that? I would've just stuck with that technique, but then I had to leave the disc in the drive the entire time, which is annoying. So I don't know what's up with that bug; it's not too bad, but I wish it wasn't there.\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\n-great story\n-amazing fairytale-esque atmosphere\n-likable and unforgettable characters\n-goodcontrols\n-solid and fun gameplay and combat\n-rewind mechanic makes platforming a lot less frustrating\n-the game still looks beautiful to this day\n\nCons:\n-steam overlay doesn't work ingame for no real reason\n\nNostalgia overload/10","November 7, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just be sure to turn off fog and configure your controller (double click with mouse in options menu). HOWEVER, some jumping is woefully inaccurate, the camera can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ sometimes, puzzles are 90% easy, but 10% of the time you wonder just where the hell you are supposed to even go.\n\nAnd now my biggest bug bear - combat: It would have been better to just remove it completely, because it is SO bad. You get to fight 10-20 enemies in each encounter. They respawn if you don't kill them quickly (a dagger finishing move you have to perform on every beaten enemy). They teleport after you, they swarm you and surround you, and when you're down on the floor you're as good as dead. That being said, most enemies are cannon fodder and dispatched easily enough, but some enemies (blue ones) can't be vaulted over, and they hit hard and fast, compared to the rest of the enemies. These are insanely frustrating since they make up most of the enemies encountered after the first quarter of the game. Combat is uninspired and irritating. As if that wasn't reason enough to hate it, you also have to keep an eye out on your companion, who inexplicably is NOT AT ALL able to move out of harm's way, meaning she will not move...at all, and frequently die, because she thinks she can take on a 3 meter sand monster with her bow and arrow in close combat...*sigh*.

Ubisoft can't make "combat" in games if their lives depended on it but the games are fun. This one is no different, story, art and gameplay are awesome. But when it comes to Cqc and all Ubisoft is the worst of the worst in their field. But nah go ahead and play it, its unfair hard but its awesome.","December 24, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This more or less plays like a very clunky Assassin's Creed, probably because its old and because Ubi decided to just focus excessively on that formula in its games that came after.  I'm only an hour in and I'm not sure how much I care to finish it, discovering that.  A few people have told me that its a great game but it's going to be hard to enjoy the early iteration of a game whose design I have already played enough of without seeing any real innovation.","October 20, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
