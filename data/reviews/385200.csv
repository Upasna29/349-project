The security system doens't appear to be realistic but keep in mind that this game is a puzzle.  I didn't like the way you need your mouse to move your character but some people may like. And now you can use your keyboard too!\n\nPros:\nIt's like a hardcore puzzle game and it is very challenging.\nCheap game and has trading cards.\nGreat game if you don't have anything to do or want something simple\nSome people didn't liked the music but i did.\nCons:\nMouse input only: When you start the game for the first time you will try the WASD keys and you will miss them so much. Problem solved :D\nLooks and feels like you're playing in your browser and you don't need to pay to do that.\nThere are more decent flash games out there than this game.\nThe name of the game is strange and doesn't make sense.\nFinal thoughts:\n\nIt's a great game if you want a cheap and challenging game on steam but if you want a free game with more quality just open you're browser.\n\nEDIT: Why do i still give this positive feedback?\n\nBecause i still want to play it. It's not a great game, but you always want to find out what the next level is. You would like some kind of "auto-save" because sometimes the levels are so hard that you need to start over when you're almost at the end.\n\nI'm giving it 6/10 to keep this a positive review.

In this case, how to avoid detection as you try to get out of prison.  Your timed against your best run for each level.\n\nThere is nothing new about this game.  There are hundreds, if not thousands of these types of games on Steam. There are probably a few “escape from prison” versions as well.  So why grab it? At under $1 you'll probably get enough fun out of it on the first few plays to make it worth your money.\n\nAt the time of the review you can get both Zatwor titles for $1.20 CDN (under $1 US).  At that price, it's even better of a deal. 2 sets of cards will offset half the purchase price and you should be able to get enough fun for the extra 4 bits.\n\nNow keep in mind that the devs are the people who brought you Why So Evil 1 & 2 ... so they are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  Expect Zatwor to be less irritatingly challengly addictive, but it's still no speed run game ... well unless your freaking awesome.\n\nIs it going to replace Witcher 3 in your gameplay line-up? F No! But, it is a fun game for the price.\n\nThis is a thumbs sideways game, but since we don't have that option .... very slight thumbs up.\n\nGrab it on sale (like now) or go grab Why So Evil instead.\n\n1¢ Review Pro:\nLow system specs\nUnder $1\nSteam cards\n\nCon:\nNo achieves\nNo demo\nGraphics\n\nOverall: 5/10 +1 price = 6/10","May 23","true","19.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

The garphics are ugly, music doesn't fit, story is just slapped to make the game seem a little more professional and the gameplay is horrendous.\n\nThe gameplay can be summed in a single sentence. You run around as a dude and avoid things in order to not get caught by guards. The gameplay wouldn't bug me that much if it wasn't that damn repetitive. It's not the worst, let's be real for a moment, but it's unpolished as hell. I can stand in a same spot for a minute or two but then randomly a laser detects me fore some reason even though I am behind cover. I don't know if this is some kind of mechanism to make all the campers fail a level but it seems to happen so randomly I doubt they inteted to do it.\n\nThis review is a complete mess, like the game is. I have nothing to say about it since it lacks everything. Everything is so off. Graphics and musics do not fit together, the story felt unnecessary and the game does not give you any idea if the developers were serious or not when making this game. I feel like it was put togehter in a month or so.\n\nI should not be so harsh on smaller games. But when game developers are trying too hard to start from the top they usually fail miserably. It's really unfrotunate to say that this game is a big no-no and should be either free or, better yet, released as a tech demo/programming skills demo game.","November 25, 2015","false","3.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The police shows up, grabs him and throws him in jail. No investigation, nothing was done to confirm if this person was truly the murderer or not.\n\nThe idea behind such games is usually to get you frustrated, but at the same time give you some kind of challenge to keep trying and finally beating the level. Absconding Zatwor doesn't on the other hand. It makes you hit ESC and go back to desktop.\n\nNothing pulled me to keep trying.

There's a tiny bit of stuffed in plot at the start, though you'll forget that about one minute into the game. This is a stealth game, where you calculate when is best to move, observe patterns in the cameras, noise detectors and guards, and hope you can make it to the next escape hole. It gets fraustrating super fast but you still want to complete it, and every time you're caught, the noise that plays when it happens will either give you a heart attack, a massive feeling of disappointment, or the urge to hit something, especially when you ALMOST made it to the end.\n\nI think the music in the game changes too fast. It could stick with the same track for a few levels and then change. I don't think the music fits a stealth game, it changes too rapidly and doesn't suit the mood of the circumstances you're in.\n\nIt is meant to be a difficult/frustration game where you feel reward for getting past all those annoying obstacles, but I find myself getting annoyed too fast to really enjoy it. Maybe if  you have the patience for this, you'll enjoy it. In the beginning of the game as well you need to set your keybindings, but you can't move with the keys. You have to use your mouse to really progress.\n\nPros\n\nI like the music tracks, however they don't fit with the game\n\nCons\n\nMusic doesn't fit the game\nControls are limited\nJust no.\n\nTL;DR\n\nOverall VerdictI dislike this for reasons.

It's fine if you don't actually spend money on it and you get trading cards by playing it which is great because you can then trade them for a less frustrating game.\nI can't recommend buying it when there are a ton of keys for it all around but I do recommend looking for a free key.

Got about an hour of enjoyment out of it, which is probably ok for the price (bought it for 0,24€). It is not too difficult, but still challenging (only got to level 19 before I got bored, though). The cameras, lasers and motion detection sensors will force you to think and act fast, or get caught and forced to replay the level. Luckily levels aren't that long and it isn't too annoying.\n\nHowever, I can't recommend a game whose developer can't even be bothered to spellcheck the 4 (I think) types of in game achievements it has. Seriously, it's way less text than this review -_- Not to mention misspell of a misspelled word. Unless cameras are actually coughing at you, but I haven't noticed that. It would be better if it had no achievements than some half made stuff, imo.\n\nEdit: They fixed the "cough" part at least, so I guess they care a little bit. "cought" is probably used enough to become a word soon anyways. Changing to positive.","July 6, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

Early missions have a nice balance of new types of puzzles and difficulty, but later missions require pixel perfect movements and timing which turns the rewarding feeling of completing a level into "why is this game so hard?" and made me give up rather than spend half an hour repetitively moving around lasers and bullets.\n\nIt ends up being a linear grinder of a game with an artifical difficulty of either not being able to work out what the exact sequence of movements it's asking for, or being able to dodge some dangers but just not all of them in one run. There's a difference between skill-based difficulty and what I think this game offers. The music is fair, and I enjoyed some of the first levels.

The idea is fertile - have players adventure through a complex, trap-laden prison; but with no change in the game beyond devices used in traps it squanders its potential as an adventure puzzler and quickly reveals itself for the shallow game it is. If you're looking to waste a dollar go ahead and try this out; otherwise, hold onto your money for now. And always be careful when heading out for smokes late at night.\n\nRead the full review for this game and many more at Budget Gaming Review!\nhttp://www.budgetgamingreview.com/2015/07/absconding-zatwar.html","July 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Controls: You click and your character moves there which would be fine in a situation where it doesn't have to be rediculously precise and your 'life' depends on it.

I think that more people should use the word abscond, so there's some points for you there. However, top down games with turn and walk mechanics (think Resident Evil) aren't my thing. Motion should be more realistic and responsive, this just leads to frustration. Now while it's nice to not have to worry about a particular type of detector, the fact that the "sound detectors" don't work- that's on you guys to fix. The soundtrack is minimalistic, and somewhat charming, but over time can probably drive you crazy. I can see why the warden chose it. So is it worth fourteen cents? If you want to see a quirky game that teaches you what not to do in your next game and get fifteen cents worth of card drops, yes.

In other words: you can only move forward, backward and turn left/right.\n\nWhile this kind of controls is "necessary" for old survival horror games, it should have been avoided for this puzzle/stealth game.\n\nI gave the game a chance and re-played many of the levels patiently. "Once I master the controls, the game should be playable," I thought. But I was wrong. When you reach higher levels, you'll encounter annoying rotating red lasers which are almost impossible to avoid because of the bad controls. I reached level 19 until I finally gave up and uninstalled this game which I got for free.\n\nIf it was possible to move left/right instead of turning left/right + forward, then this game would have been less frustrating. According to other member reviews, this game has glitches which can be used in order to finish the levels easier. I don't know how to do that but even if I could, this would ruin the game experience.\n\nHave the developers tried to play through all of the levels before they released the game?\n\nYou should stay away from Asconding Zatwor even if it's cheap and has trading cards.

I don't usually enjoy puzzle games like this--these don't relax me at all which is my sole reason for playing video games. However this was probably not the worst game I had ever played.\n\nThe grapics I felt were simple in today's market of gaming. Do they belong on a flash game site? Yes. On Steam? I can't really say, but these devs aren't asking for 14.99 like some people are for a broken and ad ridden version of a very popular puzzle game remake.\n\nI thought the music was decent. After getting stuck on a level and having to redo it six times, the music changed with each lvl reset which I found to be a blessing. If the same song played on each reset there would have been tears.\n\nThe controls weren't too bad. I suffer from an illness that effects my mucles so controls are important--and with the ability to either use a keyboard or a mouse deemed to be very positive.\n\nWhile I will probably never, ever play this game again; I hold no regets on owning it.\n\nAlso, the game is just like the video--so please watch the store page's video.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/385200/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","Mouse-driven stealth game with an older-school design. Requires memorization of patterns and learning the level to complete it and requires precision and control of your character because if you're exposed by a couple of pixels you'll be hit and be forced to restart the whole level over again. There is no indicator to show if you're in cover so when the laser comes spinning around you have to pray that your backside isn't sticking out beyond the edge. Pretty mediocre story and graphics, mouse controls feel a lot better than keyboard controls.\n\nKeyboard controls are 'tank controls' with a pretty wide turn radius so it's not so useful in a game that requires a lot of precision. I was hoping it'd be more useful in level 22 (which requires you to move in a perfect horizontal line) but your movement doesn't lock into a straight line (I usually moved in a straight line but often slightly upwards or downwards).\nThere might as well be a mode that allows both keyboard and mouse controls because they're both one-handed controls for different hands.\n\nThe game doesn't feel very polished; it's functional but without many settings and has several bugs/inconsistencies.\n\nIt saves your best time for a level but there are no leaderboards. It could be nice if it saved a ghost of your best time to race or had checkpoints so you could see split times for segments compared to your best time.\n\nCameras only see a certain range in front of them (it's pretty weird that a prison has nearsighted & narrowsighted cameras) and the vision indicators don't properly change to show how vision is limited by obstacles. However, lasers usually properly stop at obstacles so I'm guessing camera vision was harder to program. One exception is in level 30, where the lasers (but not bullets) pass through the exit doors. Machine guns are a little weird as well; they rotate faster the faster you run around them (instead of tracking at a steady pace).\n\nI couldn't replicate the bug with the "toggling" red lasers one review mentioned. However, I noticed that if you hit escape to bring up the menu, your character freezes in place but the spinning walls keep moving. So you can pause the game to make sure the walls aren't in your way. Also, loading level 30 brought me to the level with the two spinning crosses but completing it didn't unlock access to level 31 (two lasers and machine guns) in the main menu.\n\nI didn't really enjoy the game because while it was nice figuring out how to beat the level, it requires a high level of execution so it felt like I was wasting time repeating the solved level over and over again because of execution problems.\n\nThere are people who like to play games on the hardest difficulties, hardcore mode, solve things the 'proper way' and are willing to spend time learning and perfecting their execution. And then there are people like me who like checkpoints, save states, and are fine with solving things once and are satisfied with figuring out the idea/concept behind a level and moving on.\n\nIt might be for people who enjoy mouse-driven movement, hardcore/unforgiving gameplay where you may have to repeat the level multiple times for being a just little inaccurate.","February 15","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay would be OK if it were not for the unpredictable hitboxes, really a game this simple should not be using such a robust engine such as Unity, but that is just my personal preference and does not play a part in my recommendation. If this were a free web game I would be less harsh as it's apparent the developers of this game are beginner programmers and/or game designers, but to ask anyone for money for such a cliche and very unplayable game is unnacceptable.\n\nSeriously hand me the source code and I'll fix your problems over a lunch break. It's not that hard, put another hour into it to fix my two major gripes with this game and i might play it more.\n\nDefinitely not worth purchasing. This really is not something that should be on steam in the first place. I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to sell this but whatever.","February 5","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
