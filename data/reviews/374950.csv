"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atypicalchuck/recommended/374950/","atypicalchuck","AtypicalChuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atypicalchuck/","389 products in account","Developed by: Fancy Fish Games\nAchievements: Yes\nSteam Workshop: Yes\n\nStory:\n\nADventure Lib is set in a medieval world and you are a hero who embarks on an adventure to save the kingdom; however who/what you and every other thing in the kingdom is/are is totally shuffled when you start playing causing some hilarious moments.\n\nGameplay:\n\nStart the game with a shuffle button; every character and item is randomized but still keeps their assigned roles. (IE. In my first play through the king is a butter knife and the hero is a potato)\nClassic adventure gaming returns with looking at items, collecting items, combining items and using items. At least in this game the ridiculousness of that classic system is highlighted but the completely insane randomization\nBecause of this most of the game play is just trying to find the right tool for the job at hand, whether it‚Äôs fighting the PLUNGER or helping the CHICKEN. Results may vary.\nThere are secrets to be found, from the charming Easter Egg/Throwbacks in the backgrounds or the collectables that are a little tougher to find, sometimes.\nOne of the coolest features of ADventure Lib is the ability to create your own assets to put in the game! An easy to use interface lets you provide the image (I used a transparent PNG and it looked great) record the word yourself and it gets added to the game with everything else.\nSteam Workshop is also integrated so you can share your creations with everyone. Whatever they may be. We all know what‚Äôs coming.\nThe game is admittedly on the shorter side but that actually works for me; the best part of this game is shuffling the entire game into a new experience and playing with new crazy stuff going on. That said, the ending I received initially was fairly abrupt and I am not 100% sure if there is a ‚Äúgood‚Äù ending that you can receive on subsequent plays.\nAll in all there isn‚Äôt much that you wont be able to figure out with a light application of intelligence\nand patience. This isn‚Äôt Dark Souls; this is a lighthearted adventure and just a good bit of silly fun.\n\nGraphics:\n\nADventure Lib, for being a simple 2D exploration game, manages to look really clean and well put together.\nIt looks they way you would expect, being light on the animation side with stuff bobbing around the screen. This helps when you add your own content it fits in perfectly.\nAble to change character‚Äôs two main color schemes anytime\n\nSound:\n\nMusic and SFX: The sound effects and music are just fine. No problems with them; nothing special in that regard.  It all blends into the game play well.\nVoice Acting: This game is fully and independently voice acted. It is half of the charm, really! Its nice that they took the time to do this even if it was done by people who are new to the industry. Only a couple lines came off as recorded out of place but it was hard to notice amongst the crazy dialog. Also: If you add an asset to the game you can count yourself as a voice actor as well. üòÄ\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nADventure Lib is a light-hearted and loving tribute to the ‚Äúuse X on Y‚Äù genre. While it is small in scale I had no technical issues playing it and had a lot of fun working out the puzzles (basic as they are). Adults and kids alike would have a fun time with all the goofy situations that arise in this game and at the price it‚Äôs damn near risk-free to give it a try. It is a little short but it‚Äôs fun to replay (especially after adding new characters/items to the game!).\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a copy of this game for review purposes.  My opinions are my own.","August 4, 2015","true","1.1"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","29","40","3","0"

You have a "Look" action that gives you a hint what the object is meant to be used for. E.g "This rope is very sharp" so you know to use it as a sword. You also have your primary action which is to use or talk to objects/characters.\n\nThere's the option to have voice acting, which is decent and funny. Accompanied by some fun music.\nThe puzzles are incredibly easy to solve, so don't expect anything harder.\n\nA cool feature is the ability to import your own objects and characters into the game. You can import any picture you like, accompanied with an audio file of you choosing (or you can record it within the game using your microphone) so that the game will pronounce your object during voice acting sequences. You can also upload your created objects into Steam workshop. Obviously this helps refresh the game a few times if you want to have a laugh with a friend.\n\nAgain, if you go into this game knowing that it's very short, but its main purpose is to make you laugh, then you'll have a good time.","August 9, 2015","true","4.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

This isn't that deep a title, really. It's a basic story that relies on random objects in place of the real things. Fire breathing princesses instead of a dragon, kitten instead of a plunger, toilets are keys... Basic rules, limited possibilities.\n\nReally, this is something I'd play with my kids (if I had any) moreso than play myself. It bored me at first, but some of the bad voice acting and phrasing due to said libs made it worth playing (as you'll see in the video). But, it's only good for one play. Hopefully the developer releases more stories as free updates, and more people take advantage of the steam workshop option, to increase replay value.\n\nEven though it's maybe one playthrough at 35-40 minutes max, I suggest it. Fun little time waster, and a good way to spend time with your kids.","August 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","12","20","2","0"

It's not often you stumble across something as bad as this.\n\nI had read all the negative reviews for this game and wanted to give it a try because sometimes people can be a little over the top when it comes to writing something bad about a game, but in this case, every single one was justified. It doesn't matter how mad or wacky the developers said they tried to make the game, it is a lie. There is no effort put into the making of this at all. I truly feel sorry for the developers if it took them longer  to make than the twelve minutes I put into getting all of the achievements.\n\nIn ADventure Lib you play a hero who has to find a great treasure to prove himself to the king. There is a pool of words that are scrambled into the game and will be randomly assigned to certain items. These are words like 'key, butter, Charles, plunger, knife etc.'. Every time you begin a new game everything will be re-randomized using the same pool. The story remains the same, the characters remain the same, the only thing that changes from playthrough to playthrough is which item gets called what.\nBeing a point and click this makes ADventure Lib a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to play. Point and click games rely on you combining different items with each other, as does this, except these items are randomly named so the entire game is trying every single item with something else until something works. All future playthroughs will be boring as once you know where you find the item you'll know what it is meant to be and where it is meant to be used.\n\nEvery achievement can be found in one single playthrough and can be gotten within 15 minutes with ease, though there is nothing to make you want to get them besides the fact you actually wasted money on this and feel like you NEED something in return.\nThe voice acting is poor, the graphics are basic and the story is terrible. There is no re-playability, and no fun to be had the first time you play either.\n\nThere MAY have been a good idea somewhere here but the lack of effort from the developers have left this game completely worthless.\n\nADventure Lib truly is a game that doesn't ever need to be played. I hope that no-one spends their money on this and the developers should feel ashamed charging $2 for this mess of a game. I know I'll be avoiding anything Fancy Fish Games makes in the future, even if it's from a cheap bundle.","April 23","false","4.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It is NOT, however, anything worth paying money for. There's maybe 20 minutes of gameplay at best, the voice acting is sub-par, the alleged "wackiness" and "comedy" is one joke repeated over and over again, and the actual gameplay is pretty horrendous. It suffers from the point & click disaster of the most efficient strategy being to use everything on everything else - not only because the item pool is tiny, but also because most of the solutions seem completely arbitrary. Additionally, most of the interaction buttons are hard to actually trigger - you can be standing right on top of a character you need to talk to and still spend more time wiggling around trying to get the "Talk" button to show up than you spent working out the actual puzzle. This is presumably because the character sprites changes every playthrough, but that doesn't make the gameplay any more enjoyable.\n\nAll in all, it's an okay idea that was executed far too poorly to warrant charging for. I got this game for $0.40 from a Groupees bundle and I'm still not sure if it was worth the money.","March 2","false","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While being fully voiced helps the appeal for young players the voice work is spotty at times not just in performance but also recording quality.  Steam workshop support also allows players to add new words to the pool.\n\nDue to the random nature of the game, player experience will vary greatly depending on the shuffle.  Overall this game does a lot right and if it polished up some of it's rough spots it'd be a great kids game.","March 17","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also a nice jab at older adventure games that don't particularly make sense in the puzzle solving.   Overall, a very easy adventure that basically requires you to pick up items (read what they really are/do), occasionally combine them and use them at the appropriate time.  Short and pretty impossible to get lost.  Each play through mixs up the props but the "adventure" elements are the same so replays go very quick!  I played through a few times mainly waiting for trading card drops, but once that's done, I doubt I would play again. Fun for what it was though.","February 21","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
