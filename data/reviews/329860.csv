A bit of destruction, a bit of cats and you are in a good mood again. Purrfect.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You are a cat, which is pretty obvious. This game is an advanced simulator of most frequent feline behavoiur: you get to throw things from shelves, closets, tables, chairs, out of wardrobes, fridges and knocking down plants. In other words, you do what cats do best.\nThere are a few different game modes to prevent the game from getting boring.\n\nPros:    A perfect relaxation. You can play sandbox mode is you want some stress to get relieved or normal mode for time-limited destruction for skill sharpening.\nApartments that you are ordered to put in mess are procedurally generated. They consist of several rooms (bedroom, living room, kitchen ...)\nThere are a lot of different big objects (bunk beds, wardrobes, tables) to push smaller object (pillows, coffee cups, plates, chlothes) from.\nThere are powerups that makes you jump, run and punch better\nRandom events like disco lights\nYou can unlock different cats (like skins) by knocking down cat pictures from the wall\nAchievements for improved and a bit more meaningful gameplay\nYou can punch from left and right using two separate buttons\nYou can meow (F button)\nCons:    Apart from knocking things down, there's not really anything else you can do. Not that this game advertised that it can do anything else. Yes, there are different game modes, but they're not that different.\nThis game is fun, yeah, but not $10 fun. Wait for at least 50% discount.\nSuggestions:Lower the price, that's pretty much all that can be done. This game is great when it comes to messing up an apartment and nobody expects it to do anything else. But it's really not worth that money.\n\nThe final verdict:Great game, great relaxation, great fun. Not very many different things to do, but the game is made well and you don't easily get bored of it. It's fun, but the price is high.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

There's something to just knocking everything all and about as a cat and causing massive chaos all over the place, even if the games variety doesn't stand up over a period of time. It's the perfect game in my mind to pick up on sale: or if you need a stress reliever right now, or ever really wanted to be a cat persay. There's some interesting elements for the genre like being able to open areas and the extra type levels like the super market, even if some of the areas are really really hard to get to. Overall, solid game that's worth taking a look at as a destresser tool.\n\n+:\nLots of cat pictures. I mean, that's what you're here for in the end, right?\nGood physics for what you want out of a game like this (not necessarily realistic, but goes to the side of fun)\nObjectives add variety that the game desperately needed.\nLove the findable missions like the supermarkat.\nRandomly Generated Events keep things fresh and interesting. Particularly a fan of Moon Gravity\nLike the openable cabinets and various items.\nGreat destresser.\nUpgrades worth something. -:\nSome Strange jumping angles in particular with multi-layered overhead cabinets that can be frustrating to get to.\nWhile it has procedurally generated levels, they start to feel the same rather quickly in terms of basic layout.\nReally wish that one of the unlockable cats was a sabertooth tiger.\nNot really much more then knocking ♥♥♥♥ over simulator.\nSome reasonable bugs at times, like not being able to jump.\nFor Gameplay footage and more verbal first impressions: http://youtu.be/xWp40YM1AXc","May 27, 2015","true","2.7"," 51 of 68 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","51","68","8","0"

Start it, play it for a few minutes, quit. That's it.\n\nThere isn't much to sink your teeth into, but nor is there much to complain about. You play as a cat.

That's all there is.\n\nBut.\n\nIf you're the kind of person who takes time off from their cat-related subreddit to post on their cat-related tumblr while pushing their actual cat off their keyboard, you might find this game more enchanting.

You can sit in a box.\n\nThrilling stuff.\n\nTo conclude: if you range from contemptuous to ambivalent about cats, you'll find some vague amusement from this game. Buy it when it's cheap.

Nothing else comes close to it. In Catlateral Damage, one plays as a cat, with the sole task of doing exactly what cats do best: knocking stuff on the floor.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is well done, with everything working as it should. It's a simple idea, literally all you do is walk and jump and swat. But the developers have done a fantastic job with this, the only problem is getting used to the jump height. Now, I don't know much about cats, but being able to jump more than half a metre off the ground seems like a lot to me. This means that you'll often mess up your jumps and fail to get onto ledges and tables.\n\nThe way everything falls seems very real and is wholly satisfying. The upgrades and power-ups are useful, but really only a minor thing in the game, and the developers have avoided making the aim of the game to be getting all the upgrades, something that just wouldn't seem right in a game like this.\n\nThe events are an extremely fun thing that just happen every so often, randomly. Things like moon gravity, or killing the little red lights, or a disco. They just make you laugh when they happen.\n\nAim of the Game\n\nThe aim of the game is to knock everything on the floor, and to unlock cat photos. And boy, are there a lot of cat photos.\n\nThe game is collection based, where you build a collection of items to drop on the floor. They are divided into multiple categories, such as appliances, clothes, etc.\n\nGamemodes\n\nThere are two gamemodes; Objective mode and Litterbox mode.\n\nIn Objective mode, you are placed into a randomly generated location, and you have to knock a set amount of items onto the floor within a time limit.\n\nIn Litterbox mode, you go to that location again, without the time limit. The aim is to knock every single item in the location onto the floor. There is no time limit, but that doesn't mean it's easy, especially in the Supermarket and Mewseum, which have several thousand objects each!\n\nLevel Design\nThe levels are randomly generated, with the exceptions of the Supermarket and Mewseum. These two are the same every time, but are so big and awesome that you wouldn't notice.\n\nThe levels are well made, and you can always find some totally cat-like way of climbing up to every shelf or wardrobe. The feeling you get from succesfully parcour-ing up to the highest shelf in a room is immensly satisfactory.\n\nGraphics/Visuals\nThe graphics are not great. They are simplistic and there are no fancy lighting effects. That is not to say it doesn't look nice, because it still does. It has it's own unique style, and I personally find that it is still aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe texturing and modelling on the objects is very basic, just boxes with coloured rectangles, but you can always tell what the objects are meant to be.\n\nPerformance\nThe game runs surprisingly well. I have two copies of it on two separate computers; one for myself and one for my sister. I play on a 2010 MacBook Pro with 4GB of RAM, a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo and an NVidia GeForce 320M. The game runs smoothly at the highest graphics settings (called Purrfect). For my other copy, I'm using a 2007 Intel iMac, with 2GB of RAM, a 2.8 GHz single-core processor and an integrated Intel graphics card. It lags on anything other than the lowest graphics setting, but runs them extremely smoothly, at roughly 35 FPS, solidly. The game will lag on occasion, but only when you're knocking around ten items into the air simultaneously (this usually only happens on bookshelfs).\n\nMisc.\nThere are many random things about this which I like, but do not, however, fit into any of the main categories.\n\nTrading Cards - everyone loves Steam Trading Cards, right?\nAchievments - a way to show how far you've come\nThe 'f' key - pressing it can do three different things:                                                                                               On large objects, you bite them\nOn smaller objects, you pick them up in your mouth\nWithout an object, you just meow There are Atari 2600s - everyone's favourite games console\nTHE CONCLUSION\nThis games is fantastic for just messing around in, good for stress relief or if you're having a bad day and just can't quite complete that mission in Jedi Academy. The price of £6.99 is a bit much for what it is, though, so wait untill it's on sale to purchase it, but when it is on sale, purchase it immediately!\n","November 29, 2015","true","3.1"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","30","36","5","3"

The humans will pay for keeping me cooped up all day!\n\nCatlateral Damage is a new game where you play as a bored cat wreaking havoc on the everyday objects inside the house. We all know kitten thinks of nothing but murder all day so this game is a realistic simulation of what it's like to be a cat running around the house making mischief and taking care of cat business - knocking down items on shelves and tables, opening doors, hiding in boxes and tunnels, crawling above and behind everything and making a huge mess while you're at it.\n\nGreeting you at the main menu is a cheery jazz trio soundtrack which evolves to include some chip tune melodies and trumpets. There are two modes of play - Litterbox Mode and Objective Mode. Litterbox takes you to a level where there is no countdown timer, just tons of no-pressure fun. The objective mode has time and object objectives. The game begins with a cool camera flyaround to show off your kitty avatar and enter the first person view. The cel-shaded 3D graphics represent an array of common household items awaiting your destruction.\n\nUse a keyboard and mouse or a game controller to look, swipe at objects, run and jump around the house. There is also a nifty meow action that can also be used to bite and pick up objects when they are close to your mouth. The tutorial shows the controls onscreen which is handy as you get your bearings. After making your first mess, in true cat fashion, you hop in a box and take a nap. At the end of the quick tutorial, you know all you need to know and are given a summary of items you have successfully toppled as well as a breakdown as to which object you favored and what types of objects you went after most.\n\nAside from the Cat Training tutorial, each level is a procedurally generated house so you never know what you're going to get! On my first level, a timer runs while suggesting a total of objects and a couple specific objects to find and destroy. I found it hard to focus my attack on certain objects because it was just too much fun to knock everything down! While running around a random Event popped up and gave me a Force Field. This was fun because I gave my paw a rest and just ran into objects to send them flying. When an alert showed up for a New Upgrade, I had to hunt through the house to find the right room but was again distracted when I came across a Spinner Cat toy with a ball in it. I was mesmerized as I sat there swatting at the ball than spun around in circles. This is the life! When I got back on track and found my powerup, it was a box that took a couple of smacks then revealed a Jump Increase upgrade. When time was running out, the music increased tempo and the clock started flashing. I was having so much fun I'm not sure what my objectives were. Maybe I should go back to Litterbox Mode. Time to play again!\n\nWhether you need to vent your frustrations, assuage your OCD or just change your perspective, take some time out to attend to your cat business and play Catlateral Damage.","May 27, 2015","true","19.7"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","27","35","4","0"

There is an option to pick things up with your mouth (X on the controller), which also doubles as your meow button, you can simply push things with your nose (i.e. walk into them) or bat at them to the side (left and right trigger) or push them forward (LB/RB) with your paws, as well as crouch (B button). Knocking a new object to the ground adds it to your "collection". You can also knock cat photos to the ground to collect them as well. Sparkling items (scratching posts, toilet paper rolls, potted plants on the ground, etc) can be batted about a few times in return for upgrades, though the upgrades do not seem permanent for each cat, sadly (future update, maybe?).\n\nThe two game modes are Objective (knock X amount of points worth of objects to the ground in Y amount of time; bonus if you knock certain objects over) and Litterbox mode (a freestyle, relaxing mode). There are also secret areas to find, such as the Supermarkat (Go "shopping" within the time limit) and Meowseum (Break a certain dollar amount of priceless artifacts and displays within a time limit).\n\nCertain objectives (knocking over a certain amount of objects in certain modes, knocking over cat pictures, completing an objective with just your nose, playing on a "Caturday", etc) unlock new cats to play as.\n\nAll in all, a fun time, if a bit silly. Since there's no real end-state (no set story or stages) it's more of a fun time-waster, and also where the Katamari comparison breaks down. Also, you don't save progress in your Objective or Litterbox mode (it does remember how many houses you've trashed in Objective mode) so you restart at the beginning houses each time and work your way up to new random ones as you go.\n\nOverall, lots of fun, but maybe not worth the 10 bucks it currently is priced at (dependent on your penchant for wanting to be a cat, of course).\n\nFinal note: my wife calls it "A-hole Cat Simulator", if that makes any difference.","May 31, 2015","true","3.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

It's not overly complex, it's just what it says on the tin. An arcade-ish destruction simulator.\nObjective mode isn't terribly hard, but the time crunch does add a gentle challenge.\nLitterbox mode is just a nice relaxing 'I'm gonna break stuff' game. No pressure, just smashing crap and blowing off steam.\n\nThe cartoony look is a good choice; between your slightly odd perspective and quick movement, any complicated textures could induce motion sickness, IMO.\n\nI will warn you, though, if you have any epilepsy//seizure issues, this game has a couple of visual modes that will be super rough. Disco+Catnip is particularly brutal.","June 7, 2015","true","13.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

Here's the short attention span summary of my review: Catlateral Damage is a game with a simple premise: as a cat, wreck your owner’s house while they aren’t home. It’s fun to run around and knock things off of ledges and shelves and sinks, though only in fairly short bursts. Additionally, until the developer fixes some of the issues within the game, I might recommend getting it on sale, but if you’re a cat fan and love the idea of goofing off, knocking crap off of tables and bookshelves as a cat, this game is probably for you. It’s a gimmick, but it’s pretty fun for what it is.

How dare they! I might just leave a hair ball on your pillow while I'm at it!\n\nWhile you're giving a bookshelf one of these and the fresh laundry one of those, take your paws on a exploration of your surroundings to ruin everything. Because you can.\n\nBecause you're a cat.\n\nUse your mouse and keyboard to make a mess. Collect power-ups to stay in the game and rack up points so you can unlock new cats and secret levels. Sounds easy enough in theory. In practice, you're going to be starting over multiple times until you can master the feeling of being a cat in your surroundings. Once you find yourself in a groove and get the general idea of what you're doing, you'll be racking up points (and messes), and enjoying your new life as a new cuddly demonic furball that everyone can't help but love. You know, even if you busted that tablet for some points.\n\nPersonally, I've been using this game to help with some physical therapy. Remembering to use left or right paw became a little irritating on my behalf because it did matter and sometimes picking the wrong paw to bat and swat with would make my life very difficult. Sometimes, going straight was the best choice. You do have to pay attention (sometimes) rather than make a haphazard mess. Sure it really is fun just to let everything fly, but when you need certain individual items, it actually matters. Mouse and keyboard aren't too exhausting to learn, but if you have any sort of disability or condition that flares up in your hand, reconsider or give yourself frequent breaks.\n\nThis game also includes a lot of flashing light segments. There is a disco power up as well as a catnip high. This can be disabled via the pause menu if you are sensitive to flashing lights due to epilepsy, seizures, or migraines. Having the option to turn it off is amazing. Sure, I'm a person who does have this health risk so I'm already a fan. However, even a "normal" person can have a day where lights are a bit more bothersome and while we can handle a video game, the intense flashing is pushing it. Turning it off until we feel better is that great option to have. For this, I'm not only thankful, but I'm singing my praises about.\n\nCatlateral Damage is an incredibly lighthearted game. You don't have to be completely serious to make a game good. Your objective doesn't have to be serious, either. It's a cat making a mess. You really don't have to improve much on that. With the various backdrops you explored, I was starting to wonder if poor kitty was being rehomed to unknowing owners who weren't prepared for the master mess-maker. You can fill in your own storyline this way, but it really doesn't matter. Perhaps it's funny. Maybe it's a little "trendy" because the internet was created for two things and one of them was certainly cat pictures. You may leave the second option up to your imagination because I'm certain you're all smart folks.\n\nAn almost $10 seems a bit steep to just wreck a house, I'll admit, but if it's your type of game, it's very much worth it. You'll get replayability out of it and then some. Great and safe for your junior spawnling gamers, safe (with adjustments) for those of us with some handicaps, and a good way to blow off some steam if your usual games are making you ragequit. This is my current go-to game.","July 19, 2015","true","4.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

Catlateral Damage is simple but has its subtle nuances and charm to it. The goal is simple, knock stuff down and make a huge mess. This is something just about anybody with an inner child can relate to. There is something satisfying about swatting a pile of dishes and watching them smash against the floor and giving you an even more satisfying sound effect to go along with it. There is a sense of glee when you end up in a Meowseum and take down a 15 foot T-rex with just one swat of your paw.\nIs this a deeply complicated game? No. Is it a fun game? Yes. Last I looked that is what gaming is all about. Fun.\nWith procedurally generated levels, the designs, and layouts aren't always the same. With random events and secret levels it adds an even more satisfying reason to play this game over and over again. While the game seems easy enough at first. As you get deeper the timer gets smaller and the challenges become more specific. Hunting down one specific item in large supermarket. These are the things I enjoyed most about the game. Aside from the wanton carnage. Now there is ways to improve this game. Multiplayer would've sent this games appeal through the roof for me. I own 2 cats after all and 2 cats are always better then one. Adding more kinds of random events and even more crazy scenarios to put a cat in. Perhaps a level editor or platforming challenges. These are just some ideas. Nonetheless as a game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/recommended/329860/","XmiseryX","Misery","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XmiseryX/","382 products in account","Well, I only just started on this, as I bought it just a short time ago at random.  But I very much enjoyed what I've played of it so far, so I figured I may as well do a quick review post.\n\nIf you dont get the drift by looking at the store page or the trailer (how could you NOT get the idea of what it's like by looking at that trailer?), you play as a cat, albeit one who is missing a few screws... well... missing more screws than, ahem, "normal" cats are missing anyway (as if cats are ever normal.... not in my experience!)... and one who is very clearly bored, as this cat has decided to SWAT ALL THE THINGS.\n\nWhich is pretty much what you're doing; in each level, you're simply given a number of objects to knock over, and a time limit in which to do this.  Fail to clear that number, and it's game over, as you'd expect.  You're also given some specific objects to find that can give a bonus, and some that are worth extra in that particular level; the game will point these out to you each time, so make a note of that and keep an eye out for the thing.\n\nEverything of course is all filled with physics, which means that stuff is just going to go bouncing all over the place, exactly as you'd expect.  It's worth noting though that the objects have to hit the FLOOR to count; if they land on another piece of furniture, they dont do anything for you.  The game makes it pretty obvious when things have properly connected with the floor.\n\nMuch of the game uses procedural generation, so you cant just automatically head into a level and already know where the highest scoring spots are; that wouldnt be very interesting and I'm glad the devs didnt do that.  There are also random "events" that might happen.  You never know just what these might be.  They could help you, or just confuse.  You'll be running around, like "Oh hey, here's another book shelf, time to swat these books, swat swat swat, hahaha, swat swat swa- OH GOD DISCO WTF?!?" and there'll only be confusion remaining.  Or maybe the power in the house will go out.  Or perhaps you're told to go catch a mouse, and if you do so, you'll get a free upgrade item or even something else.  Upgrades are gotten usually by smacking around certain specific cat-related objects (like scratching posts) and will increase an attribute for your cat, like jumping or speed or whatever.  So you definitely want those.\n\nThere are also bonus levels that can be found in each of the main levels (4 main levels in one run), there's a "litterbox" mode where there's no objectives or anything and you just smack things around at your own pace, and about a bazillion cat (and dog?) photos to unlock, and who doesnt like those?  Sad, irritating little jerks, that's who doesnt like those.  There's alot of achievements to get, and many playable cats to unlock as well.\n\n\nOverall, it's a very arcade-y game, since it's fast paced and scoring points is the entire, well, point of it, and it seriously feels ALOT like Katamari, actually; if you liked that series, this is definitely one to try.  Not exactly a difficult game, but as with most score-focused games, the challenge comes from scoring high; not "beating" the game.\n\nI look forward to playing this quite a bit, it's definitely my sort of thing.\n\nBut for now, my arm hurts like heck from clicking the blasted mouse so much.  Had to do it though.  Those books wont launch themselves accross the room, after all.","September 5, 2015","true","0.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roraborealis/recommended/329860/","roraborealis","roraborealis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roraborealis/","15 products in account","I have found this game to be simple, but very addicting. You cause destruction as one of several different cats, most of which you have to unlock through gameplay.\n\nYou can play in two modes, objective mode and "litterbox" mode. Objective mode is where you are given a set of objectives to complete. You do this by knocking down or destroying the indicated items. You have a time limit in which to complete the objectives. You get bonuses for certain items, as indicated in your objectives.  If you complete your objectives, you get to move on to another level, up to four levels. There are special items you can knock down to unlock bonus levels which are added in to your four basic levels.\n\n"Litterbox" mode is an untimed mode with no objectives. You get to take your time and explore. You get one point per item destroyed or knocked to the floor.\n\nYou can level up your cat's abilities (Speed, Jump, Swipe) by finding upgrades. These consist of sparkling items that cats use or play with and by pawing at them, you can trigger an upgrade drop.  In objective mode, you have to decide whether or not you want to use your precious time to gather more upgrades while the clock is ticking. Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes it isn't, and you'll eventually start to figure that out.\n\nThere are collectibles and achievements, including secret achievements. I've played for over 17 hours and I still don't have everything.\n\nIt is reminiscent of Katamari Damacy. You are rushing around, causing chaos, knocking things down, and you have to get a certain number of items. It doesn't match up to Katamari in sheer variety of items and locales, or with an amazing soundtrack, but this is a much smaller scale game. It's still quite fun.\n\nI haven't had much issue with the camera angle, and I'm pretty picky with that sort of thing. I've seen a few minor graphics glitches, but that's it. It feels fairly well polished.\n\nI wish there was more variety in the soundtrack, but I can always turn down the music in the options and put on my own if I get tired of it.\n\nI hope the developer releases more content for this game down the line. I'd be interested in it.","November 29, 2015","true","37.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I like this game, a lot, I really do, but in its current state and at its current price I just can't fully recommend it. I bought it because I saw JoshJepson play it on YouTube, and it looked like fun... and it is! It really is! But it's just not enough fun and it's definitely not with $10! Thankfully I got it on a 50% off sale... but I still even hesitate to say it's worth $5. With the small amount of content and replayability it has now it's maybe worth $3.\n\nWhat would make it better, and push me to fully recommend it, is if it had more levels, with more objects and special elements, and more cats and maybe if the cats had different special abilities. Most of the varying events that happen and achievements things that you can unlock have little effect on the gameplay and are not very rewarding. Also, another big thing it's missing for me is multiplayer. I would love to be able to play in a map with friends playing other cats helping me knock stuff over, or in a race to see who can destroy the most stuff or whatever.\n\nSo in short -\n\n+ fun-sounding music\n+ fun idea\n+ fun to be a cat\n+ fun!\n\n- the fun gets old fast\n- not enough content to be worth the price\n- different cats have no special abilities\n- not much variation in gameplay\n- no multiplayer\n\nIf you really want it, get it on a sale. If the developer ever gives it a big update with more stuff, I might update this review.","February 25","false","1.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Chris Chung and Fire Hose Games have done all three of these things in the magnum opus that is Catlateral Damage. For centuries scholars have pondered over our feline friends "What do they think about while we are away" "How do they keep themselves entertained" and "Why do they hate me". Mr Chung has dug deep into the mind of the Felis Catus in search of such answers and revealed them to us throughout each unique handcrafted level "because they hate us". Perhaps it was stale water or tasteless food or maybe it was our poor choice in household furnishings, all questions become clear as you play as a simple household feline overcoming overwhelming odds... by wrecking everything in the house With tight controls and an amazing soundtrack the immersion is so "life like" you yourself will put off by stale water or a sudden change of diet. In the end you will find that these fuzzy jerks are justified when it comes to venting their rage and in many ways Catlateral Damage is more akin to "Hatred" than say Katamari Damacy. In the end what an incredible gift we have been given, the simple but complex life of a cat.\n\n10/10 Would Cat Again.","July 8, 2015","true","7.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","6","9","6","1"

Catlateral Damage has a cartoony art style but it's not a gimmick--it's clearly crafted with care and attention to feedback.  This is a game that has a Disco Mode... and also has an option on the menu to entirely disable Disco mode forever.\n\nThe main, timed game is cleverly self-limiting--four timed trials with potential unlock of a special level--so you have a good stopping point and might not end up swatting things off shelves all day.\n\nAs an extremely casual gamer, one of my criteria is whether a game lets you unlock photos of the devs' kitties.

That's pretty much the whole game. You can also unlock pictures of cats and more cats to play as, although they don't make much of a difference to jumping or swatting or bashing things off shelves.\n\nIt can be difficult to smash enough things to be able to move on to the next level, especially with the time limit, and if you knock a stack of objects over, like plates or towels, if they're still in a stack and only one touches the floor it counts as one item, you have to make the rest of the objects touch the floor too. Although a little annoying being close but not being able to move on, it's still fun.\n\nOne thing about this game is that I find the graphics make me feel a bit sick (maybe motion sick), especially as you have to spin around a lot to be able to knock everything over and rush around to do it all in the time limit. If it wasn't for that I would probably be playing this game more, but for now, I can only seem to handle one level worth of time without feeling too unwell.\n\nI do however like the fact the insides of the levels, although have the same general layout, have randomised items in them, and some things are in different locations, so you're not playing the exact same thing over and over, I found more rooms on one play through and in others there were less things to smash. I can remember areas and maps quite well and can get bored if games have the same paths and places to go if they're not big games, and although there's the same basic layout of the building every time, having different objects to knock over and a different colour pallet each time helps give it a little more variety.\n\nIt's probably a good thing each level is only a few minutes, I admit if a level was longer I could see the music start to get annoying, but in short doses it's fun and catchy and adds a playful mood to the game which goes nicely with its style and colours.\n\nWould I recommend this game? I kinda wish there was a more neutral option sometimes, I'd want to say yes and no. If you've ever wanted to knock tons of things over, look at cat pictures and be a little fluffball of  destruction  fun, I'd say play the game. However, if you have problems processing things visually, can get motion sick or get dizzy easily, and want to try the game, I'd say wait for a sale first, just in case.","May 31, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's perfect.\n\nCatlateral Damage is kind of reminiscent of Katamari Damacy. Like rolling a katamari, the gameplay is simple but fun- it's oddly satisfying to swat things with your paw and watch them fall to the ground. There's a lot of different environments to play in, and the layouts never seem to be the same twice, though a lot of the same items are used. You can also play as one of about 20 different cats. I don't think your choice of cat affects your playing experience, but it's a nice choice.\n\nYou can collect power-ups to increase your speed, jump and swat power, participate in special events in the game's world for powerups or points, and collect special items to teleport you to event levels where the gameplay ranges from collecting items in a supermarket to destroying things in a museum. The low-poly aesthetic and chill soundtrack help make the game a relaxing experience.\n\nAlso, one of the collectibles is just pictures of people's cats. Which you collect by knocking over.\n\nBest $9 I've ever spent.","May 30, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thanks, Ashen.)\n\nIf you ever wondered what it was like to be a cat or why cats made messes, this game is for you.  Play as a cat who has some random excuses to make a mess (every time you start an adventure campaign)...only thing it doesn't mention as an excuse is being spayed or neutered. ("Where are my balls?  Those humans will pay."  "My balls are gone.  Time to make a mess.")\n\nThe moment I booted this game I fell in love with making a mess.  A simple game with a simple objective, you get points for knocking stuff onto the floor.  Starting out, it was difficult to find a way to get all the items on the floor in time.  The secret, though, is to know what the high-items are and where they're normally located.  If all else fails, just make a big mess.  That works too.\n\nPROS:\nBe a cat\nMake a mess\nCameo references\nMeow\nLevels randomly generate objects for you to make a mess with\n\nCONS:\nCan get old (You'll find yourself busy for 15-20 minutes)\nNot much variety in terms of levels (last I recall there were a total of 8-9 maps)\n\nIt's great to see that maps aren't COMPLETELY identical as the layout can change upon each boot (along with certain spawned items).  The game is currently priced at $10, which it does not feel like it's worth.  Wait for a sale before getting this one if you want your money to feel well-spent.  After a while, it will feel old.  I feel like it's run it's course at 18 hours.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=613456768\n\n7/10","January 31","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We're basically going for more "funny" and a bit less "ridicule" here by adding motion controls in this physics sandbox game.  The VR experience was mesmerizing enough to land me nearly an hour of gameplay in my first two tries.\n\nMy only complaint would be, having an extremely substandard amount of space to play in (to the point where Room Scale setup in SteamVR won't let me finish the config) that the teleport feature likes to land you too far away from objects, resulting in a few accidental *real* object battings :-) It might make the game slightly easier to allow us to land right next to stuff, but it'll also be more fun that way.\n\nI'll try to give this a good shot in a larger space at one point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/329860/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","I love living life as a cat. See a shelf full of books? Knock 'em all on the floor. Big, expensive TV perched precariously on the edge of a table? Floor. A bunch of supermarket aisles filled with hundreds and hundreds of premium buyables? Yep, eeeeevery one of them, right on the floor. It's like I'm playing as Michael Douglas in Falling Down if he was a cat and the movie ended with him falling asleep in a cardboard box. I'm just really disappointed there were no toddlers perched up on highchairs in the game. Oh well.\n\nIn Catlateral Damage you'll play as a cat with the sole aim of knocking down a target number of items in a small handful of rooms within a certain amount of time. To begin with, your feeble, fuzzy paws will only be able to bat items ever so slightly (left or right click will do a left or right swipe while Q, E or middle mouse will jab), and you'll move kinda slowly and won't be able to jump very high, but playing with cat toys will reward you with an upgrade for one of those three attributes. And if you're particularly lucky, a random event such as catching a mouse, swatting a glowing red dot, or "moon gravity" will grant you a limited increase in abilities. By the end you'll be running at lightning speed, jumping almost the full height of a room and swatting away big, heavy objects with ease. That end actually comes pretty quickly, though, given the structure of the game.\n\nBy default there's only four stages to play through; what looks like a standard apartment, a log cabin (or possibly a summer camp?), umm, a slightly different apartment, and, uh... a really fancy apartment. There isn't really a massive amount of variety in the settings, I guess, and no additional floors to move up and down through, just a small handful of rooms where the collection of items you'll be knocking over are largely the same. But at least the actual layout of the rooms are procedurally generated so you'll never have exactly the same setup of rooms twice, for what that's worth. There's a chance that each stage may hide a collectible which will unlock an additional bonus stage (a museum, a box fort, a spooky lab or a single room decorated for Christmas) making for up to eight stages you could potentially play through in a single run. Failing to hit the target within the time limit on the default stages will end your run, while succeeding will allow you to continue to the next stage, with the overall goal being to score as many points as you can during a run. There isn't really a huge amount to it, and if I'm being honest the whole thing is pretty quick and shallow, but, damn, if I didn't have a whole lotta fun playing it.\n\nI enjoyed the simplicity of it, and there's something incredibly cathartic (no pun intended!) about leaping around and thrashing the sh*t out of a place and not having to care about it or feel the least bit guilty. It's a sense of contented joy that comes second only to exposing yourself to random joggers in the park. But just as with waiting in the bushes for the right moment, leaping out, helicoptering a bit, then running away and finishing yourself off, by the end, I still wanted more. I'd love to see a greater sense of meaningful, permanent progression. Like... for some reason I keep thinking of Crackdown as I play this - that itch you constantly have to scratch of seeing an orb, trying to get it, not being able to jump or climb high enough, then coming back later to get it when you've become more powerful. I'd really loved to have played something like that here... but with cats.\n\nI can imagine having an entire mansion to play with, where you start off only being able to jump small distances or knock over light objects, but as you gain more XP you grow stronger and gain new abilities. Maybe you can eventually see in the dark to explore the basement (and attic, once you can jump high enough to get in), or longer claws to scratch and damage items that were previously untouchable, as well as being able to climb special surfaces with them. Gain enough speed to eventually outrun the chain chomp-like dog guarding the tool shed, or enough height to jump up to the vents to reach other locked rooms... and so on. I know it's the easiest thing in the world to play backseat developer and say how great something would be, but that the reality is it's incredibly difficult to actually make an even remotely competent game, which is especially true if it's only a small team working with modest resources and budget. But, y'know... a guy can dream. To quote the girl in the trailer, I just want to cat, dammit!\n\n[Steam is being weird again and won't let me post the review properly.

Even if I've got a dozen other games to play where I'm shooting/stabbing/exploding enemies and watching all this bombastic action, sometimes I come home after a long day and think...\n\n"Nuts to it, I'm gonna play a cat and make a mess."\n\nThere's just something so satisfying about it. Especially when you've fully upgraded your cat to maximum destruction levels. It's a cute and harmless little game about playing a disgruntled cat. I really look forward to seeing if they make a few new special levels and events for the game. The bonus stages are really amusing and some of the random events just make me smile. ("kill the red dots!" for example.)\n\nI say it's worth the price, certainly worth it on sale.","January 10","true","7.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also the physics and jumping are pretty bad for a game that's entirely about jumping around.  It'd be great if the levels were designed to be more of a puzzle but instead they're bland and obvious, and the jumping takes no skill (except when the jump key does nothing and you have to try again.)\n\nAll in all it might be worth it for say.. 50% off?  Definitely not worth full price, and after only 20 minutes I'll definitely be seeking a refund if possible.

In all honesty, I wasn’t sure what I was expecting. Their video was pretty funny and definitely grabbed my attention. Ever wanted to be a cat and knock junk off of… well everywhere before your humans get home? Well, now there’s a simulator for that! It’s not a plain cat simulator, but it’s a cat carnage simulator for sure.\n\nThere is not much to Catlateral Damage. It’s simple premise of being a cat and knocking things off shelves pretty much describes the entirety of the game. There is an easy enough time-limit which does get a little hairy in the Museum (or Mewseum), but all things in time eh? That’s Objective Mode in a nutshell where as Litterbox Mode removes the time-limit on your destruction and lets you run rampant throughout the rooms knocking things over at your leisure. Remember to pick up the power-ups to help you knock things over with more ease!\n\nThere are also a lot of unlocks to … unlock (for lack of a better word there) if that’s your thing. You can get more cats to play as which basically gives you a different color paw to swat things with. There didn’t seem to be a stat difference so I guess it’s all up to color preference (I prefered Kratos I believe). Also, the pictures hanging off the walls are there for you to knock off and collect to keep in the out-of-game collection of funny cat pictures. It’s nice to be able to go back to and giggle at them.\n\nScore: Meh...\n\nDid you want a cat simulator in which you knock things off the shelves? This game will deliver. It’s a solid carnage simulator and seems to be created to just let the player have fun as a cat without breaking items in his/her own house. It’s not overly challenging and has smooth controls so it could be pretty good for kids to better their hand/eye coordination. There’s a lot of stuff to collect so if you’re a fan of collect-a-thons, you may also find a home here. Maybe it’s that it’s too simple or that I just don’t get it in its totality. Maybe I’m just looking too deep for something that the game wasn’t intended for, but I wasn’t 100% sold on this.  Catlateral Damage is well made, but I didn’t have that much fun playing it. In the end, I would say this is more niche that I would have thought and I don’t think I fit into this particular niche.","June 11, 2015","false","1.3"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

It is exactly as described.  Not too complex, but honestly, it doesn't need to be.  It may get a bit repetitive after a little while, but it's great to play in short bursts of a few rounds.  And there is plenty that will keep you coming back for those short bursts ranging from finding all the photos, powerups and objects to the procedurally generated levels that change each time, and unlocking more cats.  I hope there's a tortoiseshell.\n\nThe only real criticism I have in the full release is that the jumping mechanics remain somewhat imprecise as they were in the early access version.  It can be particularly difficult to jump up shelves.  I found that lowering the camera sensitivity in the game's options helped to mitigate it some.  But other than that, this is a fantastic game and well worth it for fun, stress relief, or if you just want to be a cat.","June 13, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the beginning, the motion aspect was the biggest target and then later came in meowing, additional achievements, mini challenges, litterbox mode, and the Kickstarter stretch goal levels such as the museum and grocery store.\n\nThus far, I have played Objective mode, Litterbox mode, and the bonus museum level. I don't have any complaints about the game because it is certainly satisfying to swat objects onto the ground, watching some of them shatter (like dishes & vases!), getting upgrades, and the disappointed feeling that comes when you jump and fail epicly. Objective mode features a timer and a goal to destroy a number of items within a timeframe while Litterbox mode allows you to destroy items at your leisure. After each level is completed whether through timer in Objective mode or casually through Litterbox mode, you can simply click continue to be taken to a whole new house/level. I really like how each house has a different design to keep things fresh.\n\nAs I've gotten older, I have become more of a casual gamer so I mostly play in Litterbox mode. I'd rather take my time destroying my owners' precious items than being rushed to do the job. I'm a cat, right? I'm gonna take my sassy-♥♥♥ time then. The only problem I could see other people having, is the graphics, but what you see above is what you're getting. It is a simple, sometimes slightly stressful (Objective mode) game. Catlateral Damage is a fun distraction simulator essentially and I love it. And yes, you can chase a red dot when the challenge comes up.","August 14, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play one of the selectable cats and make a mess in your owner's rooms. You have to throw everything on the floor - plants, pictures on walls, books, TV screens etc. - until the time runs out.\nThe "Litterbox" mode however gives you the time you need to vandalize in peace. Inbetween you get nice little extras like faster speed, disco atmosphere or jumping through the air like on the moon for a brief time.\n\nThe standard controls are fine, you usually play with keys and the mouse (fits since you are a cat - HARR HARR).\nThe entertainment factor is not so big but as I said: okay for now and then. The graphics are simple and pastel-coloured, the music is more bland, happy easy listening music, there are not many sounds (unfortunately).\nWhat I miss is the reaction of your owners at the end of every round. You just end the level and the results appear on screen, that's it. I also see a few missed opportunities. If you as the cat can actually turn the faucet on, then why not flooding the room's floor? But things like this are just details.\n\nSo if you got a few Euros to spend you won't regret trying "Catlateral Damage".\nJust one last thing: I'm not one of the people who get sick by motion-capture movies or games but in this case I can't play much longer than 15, 20 minutes as it makes me feel a little sick in my stomach afterwards due to the graphics. But it's okay since the game is not engaging enough to keep me playing this for hours.","June 19, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the end they did not succeed however and their civilization fell to dust. Fast forward to present day and in all this time, what have we learned? Absolutely nothing, if you think about it.\n\nSchroedinger knew this. Clearly it impacted him personally, since his musings on cats was his greatest legacy. He proposed that nothing can be certain when a cat is put into a box, yet if you put a cat in a box (hardly needed for a cat will seek out a box on his own) he will simply stare at you, smugly, as though asking why you as a human have such a hard time understanding quantum theory and the nature of reality. Perhaps the cat has mastered it?\n\nUp until now the motives of the common feline have been shrouded in mystery, but thanks to some brilliant computer programmers there might be the first advance in understanding mankind has had since before written history.\n\nBe the cat.\n\nThis simple philisophical proposition combined with modern computing power has given everyone the chance to take a first person glimpse into the every day life of the common house cat. It's taken thousands upon thousands of years to bring technology to the point where this is possible but now the riddle that escaped ancient Egypt might now be within OUR reach to be stroked between the ears or scratched under the chin.\n\nIt is by no means a complete picture but a breakthrough nonetheless.\n\nIf you ever wanted to get insight into the engimatic creature known as a house cat, play this game.","January 6","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember some kinks in the early portion of the beta but it has come quite a bit of way now that we're getting closer to release  (beta until Sept. 1st as of the latest email from creator Chris Chung!). I periodically play in to see new development on the game and it has smoother swatting motions, fun challenges, and a lot more ease of movement than before. In the beginning, the motion aspect was the biggest target and then later came in meowing, additional achievements, mini challenges, litterbox mode, and the Kickstarter stretch goal levels such as the museum and grocery store.\n\nThus far, I have played Objective mode, Litterbox mode, and the bonus museum level. I don't have any complaints about the game because it is certainly satisfying to swat objects onto the ground, watching some of them shatter (like dishes & vases!), getting upgrades, and the disappointed feeling that comes when you jump and fail epicly. Objective mode features a timer and a goal to destroy a number of items within a timeframe while Litterbox mode allows you to destroy items at your leisure. After each level is completed whether through timer in Objective mode or casually through Litterbox mode, you can simply click continue to be taken to a whole new house/level. I really like how each house has a different design to keep things fresh.\n\nAs I've gotten older, I have become more of a casual gamer so I mostly play in Litterbox mode. I'd rather take my time destroying my owners' precious items than being rushed to do the job. I'm a cat, right? I'm gonna take my sassy-♥♥♥ time then. The only problem I could see other people having, is the graphics, but what you see above is what you're getting. It is a simple, sometimes slightly stressful (Objective mode) game. Catlateral Damage is a fun distraction simulator essentially and I love it. And yes, you can chase a red dot when the challenge comes up.","August 14, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play one of the selectable cats and make a mess in your owner's rooms. You have to throw everything on the floor - plants, pictures on walls, books, TV screens etc. - until the time runs out.\nThe "Litterbox" mode however gives you the time you need to vandalize in peace. Inbetween you get nice little extras like faster speed, disco atmosphere or jumping through the air like on the moon for a brief time.\n\nThe standard controls are fine, you usually play with keys and the mouse (fits since you are a cat - HARR HARR).\nThe entertainment factor is not so big but as I said: okay for now and then. The graphics are simple and pastel-coloured, the music is more bland, happy easy listening music, there are not many sounds (unfortunately).\nWhat I miss is the reaction of your owners at the end of every round. You just end the level and the results appear on screen, that's it. I also see a few missed opportunities. If you as the cat can actually turn the faucet on, then why not flooding the room's floor? But things like this are just details.\n\nSo if you got a few Euros to spend you won't regret trying "Catlateral Damage".\nJust one last thing: I'm not one of the people who get sick by motion-capture movies or games but in this case I can't play much longer than 15, 20 minutes as it makes me feel a little sick in my stomach afterwards due to the graphics. But it's okay since the game is not engaging enough to keep me playing this for hours.","June 19, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is exactly as described.  Not too complex, but honestly, it doesn't need to be.  It may get a bit repetitive after a little while, but it's great to play in short bursts of a few rounds.  And there is plenty that will keep you coming back for those short bursts ranging from finding all the photos, powerups and objects to the procedurally generated levels that change each time, and unlocking more cats.  I hope there's a tortoiseshell.\n\nThe only real criticism I have in the full release is that the jumping mechanics remain somewhat imprecise as they were in the early access version.  It can be particularly difficult to jump up shelves.  I found that lowering the camera sensitivity in the game's options helped to mitigate it some.  But other than that, this is a fantastic game and well worth it for fun, stress relief, or if you just want to be a cat.","June 13, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then look no further! Catlateral Damage is a first-person destruction simulator where you play as a cat and knock as much objects to the floor as possible. Along with that, you can get powerups by using cat objects such as the litterbox, scratching post, cat tunnels, and more that help you knock objects faster and farther with one flick of the paw! But if you're not a fan of having a clear objective, try litterbox mode! In litterbox mode, you can freely knock down objects like its none of your buisness with as much time as you like.\n\nBut if you think thats all, there is many more than just knocking down objects and collecting power ups. You can collect cats by unlocking achievements or doing other things or collect over 200+ real life cat photos for your own personal enjoyment. And so the game doesnt get repetitive, the houses are never the same and are always randomly generated so you wont get bored so easily! But the most cool thing that you can find in the game are the secret areas you can unlock such as the "Mewseum" or the "Supermarkat." What you do in these places are a suprise... :3\n\nThe graphics in this game are not that bad in my opinion. They give off a cartoon-ish feel that really doesn't distract from the gameplay unless you are one about realistic graphics.\n-\nOverall: A great game to spend your money on if you love cats or ever wanted to be a cat and make a mess.","August 13, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If the idea of playing as a cat and knocking things on the floor doesn't appeal to you, don't expect anything more here. Sure, there are things to unlock, half a dozen levels, and a get-the-laser minigame, but at the end of the day you're just a cat pushing cel-shaded objects on the floor.\n\nThe game's Objective mode can be frustrating but is almost always fair, where you knock down a certain number of objects in either way too little or way too much time; the different time limts set a good overall pace where you don't have to be entirely frantic or bored the whole time. Sandbox mode is pretty much exactly what you'd expect, although perfectionists ought to be careful here as it can be difficult if not impossible to "complete" certain levels as there is zero leeway regarding object count and sometimes an object that has fallen on another object will not count toward your total. Although you can collect power-ups in both modes, they are not persistent except immediately between levels in the objective mode, so consider yourself starting from scratch in each session.\n\nI really like the collectibles aspect, where a list of everything you've encountered is archived and separated by item type. It would have been nice if you could interact with the objects in this list to view their models, or at least if they were named, but it gives a little more depth to an otherwise simple game.","June 4","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
