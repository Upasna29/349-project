You buy the game, watch the tutorial, get excited, build your first ship, first ship sinks, you go back to the drawing board, you make improvements, Ship works YAY, you get excited, you spawn a small enemy ship, you blow it to bits, you feel accomplished you spawn 2 small enemy ships you blow them to bits, you start to have faith in your design, so you spawn a bigger enemy, and guess what happens there, YOU get blown to bits, you cry, rage quit the game and go to sleep, after all you've been playing for 7 hours straight. During your sleep, you get a dream about a new stronger design, you either wake in the middle of the night with excitement or wait untill morning, anyways, you construct your new improved and mighty ship, you spawn the bigger ship that blew you to bits hopeing for revenge, 20 seconds later you're inches away from breaking your monitor as your ammo caches gets hit by a stray shell from his cannon and makes a majestic explosion. You ralise, armour is the solution, so you go back to the drawing board and make the most armoured ship you can, you release it in the water....it sinks, you keep trying and it keeps sinking....you're frustratd, insecure, you have lost faith in your designs, you think you cant play this game anymore, but it's too late you already played 20 hours of it in the first 2 days, you realise you cannot give up. You then open ol' trusty google and youtube you scour them for as much information as you can. 7 hours of research later and a few physics lessons from your old school book read on the way. You become a ship building expert, you then use your new found knowledge to design the ultimate boat to crush your fearsome enemy and then...... SUCCESS!! You have sunk the enemy ship. You feel good about yourself, go fap and go to sleep all happy feeling like a worthy engineer. You wake up next morning thinking "Hey, I wanna try my luck with the campaign" You start the campaign, remember you still have some left over confidence from that battle in the designer mode, first thing that happens in the campaign, you get attacked by a dingy you feel even more confident and actually for a second believe you can win this campaign. 20 mins later, you get attacked by the Deep Water Guard Crazy Chicken Armada. You look at that vessel in disbelief, cursing the day you bought this game (which is about 3 days ago) and the Crazy Chicken blows you and you fleet to smithereens....you rage quit and you rinse and repeat the above.\n\n11/10 would buy again.","September 6, 2015","true","240.8"," 329 of 341 people (96%) found this review helpful 302 people found this review funny","96","329","341","302","12"

For people who like building things this game provides an outlet to not only be creative, but to also try to put together new and interesting mechanical functions and systems.\nSo, what is the game?\nFundamentally, it is a complex vehicle designer with a focus on water based ships, and flying things which you then use to destroy other designs either in the vehicle designer, or in the massive campaign.\nAs a new player you will first be heading to the Vehicle designer to figure out how to build something. Here you can use blocks to build the shapes of the vehicle you want. Anything from Small boats to battleships, jets to spaceships, hydrofoils, helicopters, submarines, even rudimentary ground units (Wheels and ground stuff are rumored to be improved in the future)\nYou can mix and match as you please too, want a ship powered by large jets? Fine, go for it, its all up to your creativity.\nThe weapon systems are also highly customizable, you dont just choose a gun from a list and smack it down on the ship, no in FTD you build the weapons block by block. Want cannon? Well do you want fast firing machine guns? That will take many auto-loaders and ammo boxes and little or no gauge increases. Want it to shoot Armor piercing rounds or Explosive? Gotta added those blocks to the gun too. Your gun knocking your ship over with each massive shell? Better add some recoil suppression to the cannon barrels.\nDo you like missiles? Big ones or small, fast, or slow, Fragmentation, Explosive or EMP? In the water? You bet you can make torpedoes! Mines? Check! Dumb fire bombs, Absolutly! Laser firing sharks tied to a rocket?!?!? Posi…wait, no you cant do that one, but maybe its in development.\nAll weapon systems are modular (except simple weaopons).\nThese systems are currently\nCannons\nMissiles\nLasers\nAll of which can be customized to function in multiple ways.\n\nSo, now you have your awesome first design? What do you do with it?\nGo play the campaign! You load onto a world named Neter where you have a tiny wooden fortress and a dinky little boats. In the campaign you gain resources by mining it in zones, so when you start you may not be able to afford your awesome boat you designed so you will have to go design a smaller cheapers boat (in campaign or in the designer)\nNow, you have this tiny sad little wood boat, probably with some missiles on it, what to do? Well, there 8 factions out there waiting to be destroyed or destroy you. You can control your boat yourself, or send it out to fight under the control of the ships AI, which you will need since you will have many ships in a fleet.  You are already at war with the Deep Water guard, and they are coming to get you. As you build up more resources by mining and destroying enemy ships you can in turn build up bigger ships of your own.\nSo, now you've destroyed everything in Neter and you own the world? What do you do now?\n\nWell, a recent addition to FTD is the world Editor, here you can build your own world and your own factions to go blow up, or share the world with friends so they too can blow up YOUR world.\n\nThis game has limitless potential, with a Developer who literally works WITH the community. I dont mean he reads suggestions, no he actually puts the design of enemy ships and enemy factions in the hands of the community and puts in new things based on the suggestions of the community.\n\nGive it a try, once you get the hang of it you will be rewarded over and over when you build something new and more awesome than your last creation.\n","June 11, 2015","true","866.9"," 192 of 205 people (94%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","94","192","205","24","13"

I'll write a real one now.\n\nFrom the Depths (or FtD, as I shorten it to) is a game where you build ships, tanks, planes, spaceships, space stations, flying fortresses, and submarines, among other fantastical sh!t you can make. The building, while originally counterintuitive and clunky to new players, quickly becomes engrained in the muscles, making it very easy to begin building once you master the controls and read a few guides.\n\nGameplay- 9/10\n\nThe game plays incredibly; it's fun, relaxing, and exciting all at the same time, depending on what you happen to be doing. It is, however, marred by occasional frame issues. I myself have not had many, but I have built myself a godrig, so consider your hardware carefully before puchasing.\n\nAudio- 6/10\n\nArguably the weakest part of the game, the audio and soundtrack (of which there is none at time of writing) is very generic, with almost copy-pasted wave crashing effects, firing sounds, and propeller and engine sounds droning on. Many people, among them myself, have learned to ignore it, but it still is a weak point in an otherwise good game. It will most likely be rectified as the game progresses (it is an alpha, after all).\n\nVisuals/Graphics- 8/10\n\nThe game doesn't look terrible, despite its indie roots and early dev. stage. In fact, many of the best looking areas in gaming that I have seen come from me dicking around on small skiffs on the highest graphical setting. Most of the time, however, it looks fairly standard. As stated above, it might challenge some older/weaker PCs, but it will, most likely, be fixed over time.\n\n\nOverall- 8/10\n\nThe game is a quirky, fun, and addicting building game, where the inner engineer in you can come out to play in a voxel based world, where very little cannot be overcome by a little bit of thinking. It's very new, however, and may seem rough to those not familiar with it. The price point, another weak point, hovers around $20. It is worth it, but be careful, and seriously consider what type of gamer you are.\n\nAlso you can aloha snackbar. That part was pretty great.","July 27, 2015","true","212.9"," 406 of 483 people (84%) found this review helpful 388 people found this review funny","84","406","483","388","13"

But I've enjoyed playing this game a lot. I've had this want for a deep physics based building combat game and when I saw this game back in January I was like WHOA NICK SMART YOU NEED TOTAKE MY MONEY RIGHT NOW. It has so many things to make and mess around with that it keeps me delightfully interested and curious, exploring new aspects of this massive sandbox.\n\nI have probably put around one hundred hours just making a large ship in the sandbox mode and having it face large ai ships. Watching as my watertight compartments become breached and seeing a rush of repair drones fly over frantically trying to keep the damage under control as the bow starts to sumberge, I continue to engage. A shell from an enemy heavy deck gun punches through the armor protecting my ships forward magazine, and the majority of the front deck of my ship disentregrates and flies everywhere with a huge explosion. My stern's array of 24 missile launchers fire possibly one last volley at the enemy battleship, and I score a hit on their fire control center, stopping their weapons from firing and giving me a small bit of time to do repairs to keep her floating.\n\nOf course if sandbox isnt your thing there are missions and campaign mode as well. Soon there will be multiplayer as well, and I think that will be amazing, considering the copius amounts of fun I have only against the AI.\n\nCannons, guns, missiles, lasers, drills, rams... All are yours to build, and you don't just place them, you put down each block of that cannon to tailor its size, range, damage output, speed, and armor penetration to your liking.\n\nCheck out Youtube videos of this game if you need more convincing, espically the AplhaMaster tournament to see some crazy designed ships/aircraft on a budget. I made a goliath cannon that ran the length of its hull, turning into a fireworks show when it was hit once. It was quite amusing.\n\nTheres something that the developer here does that almost no other early access game developers are doing: He actually works!! Wow! I have had a few buys of early access games that have become stagnant and unfinished, and that have not considered the players wants and suggestions (StarForge  I'm talking about you). I feel that the developers from some early access games have stolen my cash and everyone elses cash, making empty promises.  Not only do updates for From the Depths frequently come out with new content and fixes/optimisations, but Nick(the dev) is extremely active on the forums. It shows that he really cares about making this game for his players to enjoy. This is one of the few early access games that I can see the progress and feel satisfied that my money went to helping the developer make a game, not sit around.","August 2, 2014","true","320.2"," 130 of 145 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","130","145","0","6"

There's lots of (good) teaching material, and the creative mode editor is great to play around in. I suggest giving your character the cheats early on in creative mode as they will help you move around and deal with "I really shouldn't have spawned that yet" enemies (I'm inside your megaship, death raying your ai mainframez).\n\nI absolutely recommend this to anyone who likes creating stuff.","October 8, 2014","true","38.8"," 114 of 124 people (92%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","92","114","124","19","0"

The only thing you are provided with in the campaign is a simple fort and a small boat. Everything else is up to you. you build your ships how you want to. Your cannons how you want too. want a long range Artillery gun or a rapid fire AA gun? Go ahead and piece it together and build it. want a submarie that fires torpedos or launches torpedos that turn into missiles? Piece it together how you want to.\n\nFor me the game did take a couple youtube videos and about half a bottle of whiskey to really figure out how stuff works together to really make an effective ship. of my 20 something hours played so far probably 15 of it has been spent trying different designs of ships and weaponry to see what functions together well. But, that has been the best part.\nThere really is no better feeling than building up a fleet of ships that you have created to watch them blow up the enemy in a battle and tear through the offensive lines.\n\nIt is in early access and has a few minor bugs i've seen, but nothing really game breaking that i have discovered. The graphics are nice for a voxel based game. On both my PC and gaming laptop i have not discovered one second Under 30 FPS, it runs smoothe on my machines.\n\nAll in all, buy this game, it really reminds me of a game i would have always wanted as a kid when all i had was legos.\n\n4.5/5  -  The only reason i wouldnt give this game 5 start is the lack of a tutorial or some explanations of certain things. Which really isnt a big deal because I'm fairly positive in beta or full release they will have a very nice in depth tutorial.","July 28, 2015","true","48.6"," 97 of 102 people (95%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","95","97","102","13","0"

Which is to say, this game is not for everyone.  It appeals to a certain venn diagram demographic of people who grew up building castles with Legos and then finding ways to wreck them.  Which I imgaine is a pretty big group, it is true, but still isn't everyone.  Lucky for me I'm in that group.\n\nBe warned, however, that it requires that certain obsessiveness when it comes to building things most commonly seen in Minecraft players who live logged into the game from inside their life support pods, being feed through IV drips as they continue the sixth year of their quest to recreate, in 1-to-1 scale, the Taj Mahal and it's surrounding gardens.  If you're not that insane, however, you're in luck - the integrated Workshop is already overflowing with more prefab designs of varying degrees of "That's no moon!" than you can imagine, so honestly you'll never really have to design anything if you don't want to.  And if you are that kind of crazy, thanks!  We really appreciate all that neat stuff in the Workshop.  Well done!\n\nThen comes the fun part - destroying everything in sight.  Once you get your Insane Flying Battleship of Laser Doom finished it's time to head out and see what it's got.  Thankfully, do to an amazingly complex AI system, at this point you can just sit back and watch your engines of destruction curb-stomp inferior NPCs all day until you find yourself drooling and yelling "Smash Beetles!"\n\nAh, but eventually the game difficulty will ramp up, the NPCs will start fielding their own doomships and from there the battles will look like a Minecraft rendition of "Star Blazers" as kilometer long dreadnauts butt heads against each other in battles worthy of Godzilla's applause.\n\nThere is, of course, some downsides: If you're actually playing the campaign, good luck in actually getting any of those super-dooper ships assembled in anything less than five hours, because the gap between a player's campaign starting resource generation and the ambitions of the Workshop gnomes can be measured in parsecs.  Picking out the cheap, practical stuff can be a quest in itself... unless you want to make it yourself, and that leads to the other problem: The AI system.\n\nWoe to he who does not spend several hours learning the many intricacies of the AI modules & system, and I don't just mean the tutorial stuff.  Making AI do anything more complex than "fly in circle and shoot stuffs" requires something resembling actually programming ability, and is not for the faint of heart or lacking of scripting skills.  Mastering that can make building your first working laser cannon seem simple in comparison.\n\nHowever, again a lot of people who can handle that probably fall into the same venn diagram area I mentioned at the beginning of this review, so it's not that big of deal.  Yeah, the game almost requires a certain mindset but then it appeals most to that mindset to begin with.\n\nNow as for the "Early Access" thing: The campaign system still need some work but it's functinal.  In fact, everything in the game is functional right now.  From here my prediction is that development will simply be bug fixes and refining the many rough edges of what is already in the game.  Right now it's kind of like a perfectly functional car without any paint, trim or dashboard lights.","August 1, 2015","true","25.0"," 82 of 84 people (98%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","98","82","84","21","3"

The scope and breadth of this sandbox is impressive. That's the short review.\n\nPros:\nThere is seemingly no limit to creativity and imagination when it comes to constructing real, functioning, capable vehicles of war in this world.\nThere is no clear path to victory. If you want to conquer the world using only balloon airships equipped with lasers, you can. Subs? Surface fleets? Fortresses? No problem. Replayability is fantastic as a result.\nThere are truly capable and complex engineering frameworks in place that allow you to make spectacular vehicles with discrete propulsion, offensive, and defensive systems.\nThe graphics are playful and cell-shaded, which I usually detest. However in this case it works.\nThe developer is active and working hard.\nCons:\nControls. This is not so much a con as a warning. The controls are GREAT for this game...once you learn them. They are not intuitive, but they are also no difficult to learn. If you want a more simpler "Minecraft" style of control, that is available as well. However I urge you to take an hour to become comfortable with the default control scheme, as it works exceedingly well once you grasp it.\nIt's an Alpha. That means there are broken or disabled parts of the game, balance issues, and plenty of opportunities for optimization. However none of these are game breaking (IMO) at the moment.\nThere is a LOT to learn. Seriously, you can spend a whole day just learning how to design cannons. Or lasers. Or engines. The cool part about this is that you will find that there are many many ways to engineer any of these, and you can have a lot of fun experimenting. But if you want a casual game where you won't find yourself looking up a tutorial on YouTube for how to contruct a laser-powered missile defense, this is not the game for you.\nI am truly obsessed with this game at the moment.

It will become your World of Warcraft. It will suck your life away. You will think of new designs, new crazy things to build, weapon systems to obliterate your opponents and AI systems that can get the job done under any circumstance.\n\nYou will reminisce the possibilties of fleet management, what forces you need where - which resource zones you need to suckle upon to better your advances against the incoming factions. You will bribe with oil and crystal, why be enemies when you can be friends? And then you will backstab the very faction you befriended, because this is From The Depths and you need all the precious resources you can get.\n\nWhen you are taking a shower, you will contemplate just how to get your orbital bombardment of custom made ICBM's raining down on your rivals with unprecedented insanity and accuracy. You will ponder over your cruiser and if you really need those massive drills spinning at 50k RPM on the front, do you really need to drill into every enemy ship and watch them explode in majestic fashion? Yes, the answer is always yes.\n\nYou will board enemy ships and attempt to destroy whatever you can with the weapons of your choice. Minigun? Hrmm, maybe. Grenade launcher? Yes... that feels right. Blow up their mainframes, disrupt their AI connections, take out their command center, or just launch into the ammo storage and watch the fireworks.

Then, it went on sale and I thought "It can't be more complicated than setting up a military in dwarf fortress," and it isn't. From the Depths is a complex game, but it is not that complicated. At the time of this review, I've spent only two hours playing it, and feel that I have a basic understanding of the mechanics available. I havn't touched any of the guns yet though, so we will see.\n\nIn my two hours;\nI watched a tutorial on mouse controls, it was all very straight foreward, and by the end of the 6 minute video I felt I was ready for some basic gameplay.\n\nI played with the sandbox "spawn a ship and test it's effectiveness" thing, which was fun time for about 15 minutes and served to get me acquainted and interested with what the fights would be like, but didn't really tell me much about how it would all work, so...\n\nI went to select the campaign, but was met with a popup stating, basically, "are you sure you want to just jump in? The games kind of complex, maybe you want to start with the build a ship sandbox? just until you feel you are ready?" I liked that, so I went to build something in the safety of the sandbox.\n\nI spent about an hour and a half in the sandbox, generally getting used to how it controlled, playing around with blocks an then decided I wanted my raft to move. I went into the build menu, clicked the button that said "engines" and noticed two red flashing boxes. I clicked one, and it was a guide on how to build a simple engine. "well thats nice" I thought, and using the guide I built a small single cylinder engine. after checking the guide again to see what I did wrong (becuase it didn't work) I realized that I had installed everything on the wrong end of the engine block and so corrected the problem. before moving my ship, I wanted to stabalize it. as a simple wooden raft, it rocked about horribly on the oceans swell and with the new engine making it a bit top heavy, it only got worse. I endeavored then to build a pair of outriggers and expand the main body of the ship a bit to make it more stable and bouyant. To my immense pleasure, it worked and I drove my small boat, no longer a pathetic raft, around in circles for a bit before deciding that "From the Depths" is not nearly as difficult as playing dwarf fortress, no where close to as complicated as people say it is, and that I would rather like to play more of this very nice ship building game.","November 28, 2015","true","6.2"," 57 of 60 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","57","60","8","0"

Don't scroll down just yet, I have an explanation for my madness.\n\nThis is an engineering game with block style building and heavy sandbox elements. One could say that this is like Space Engineers, but there's something different. The craft you build serve a point. There's a dynamic, open world war-like campaign that you must build and design craft for (or snipe them off of the workshop and learn how they work,)  to complete.\n\nIn this campaign you'll be introduced to several factions with vessels that are very different per faction (The developer is currently taking user submissions that fit a certain faction's theme) that you must design crafts that can combat this.\n\nI keep saying the word "craft" in place of boat because it can be anything. Boats, planes, land vehicles, spacecraft, ballooncraft, submarines, anything you can design can come to life in this with its simple automation that you can put in place.\n\nWhile this game, at the time of the review, has a small-but-growing community, it is VERY robust, there has to be the highest ratio of players that are also streamers and youtubers to regular players I've ever seen. There's loads of tutorials and user submitted designs on the official forums (don't let the Steam forums decieve you.)\n\nAnd for those holdouts that are concerned about the longevity and developer-community relations on this product, the developer is very active on the official forums, with, to date, 18% of all the total posts on the forums being his. He constantly throws out suggestions that he wants to see in the game to gauge community reaction as well as take in any well-thought-out revisions that the community members have to offer. There's even been a quote of him saying "I can put it in, people just need to ask for it." When it comes to longevity, it used to be just him on the project, but I've seen some more people come on as official staff.\n\nThis is a hidden gem. I want the world to see it.

This is a game that requires patience to be put in but gives back in copious amounts, learning the usage of every tool is key to creating the most enjoyable experience as you'll have plenty to use at your disposal.\n\nFirst and foremost, every player from the curious new builders to the most seasoned of engineers will want to delve into the playable tutorials and building guides supplied by the game as you'll quickly find the learning curve is no joke. Although it may seem tedious at first the more patient of players will begin to slowly learn important hotkeys and shortcut tools such as copying and reusing large sections of previously created vehicles that will make your building endeavors quick, seamless, and enjoyable.\n\nCreating vehicles is way more than just their visual appearance and basic form, you'll have to get into the guts of each machine and engineer their inner-workings putting you in full control of everything from connecting series of logic up to thrusters, distributing equal amounts of power evenly across your ship, to creating your own missiles and ammunition as well as defining their behavior. The limits in From The Depths are determined solely by your own creative capacity.\n\nAside from the vehicle creation and building mode, there are some ambitious features to battle it out in including a progressive campaign that expands with each update and quick skirmishes you can set up for testing your new creations in the heat of battle. Terrain in the game varies from sea, to land, to air/space giving you lots of types of traversable landscape to consider when creating your specific dream vehicle.\n\nThe campaign itself is impressively engrossing for those well versed in the mechanics of the game throwing you into the world with a starting base to gather resources from and expand off of as you fight for survival and resourceful territories. This campaign mode is already very addictive and continues to grow rapidly with each update, promising the addition of more enemies, factions and objectives to spice up your survival in this free-form sandbox adventure.\n\nCurrently in development is the story based mission mode but it already features a couple of the basic starting missions which I found to be some of my most exhilarating moments with the game. The few story missions we have already do a great job of setting you up with some pre-determined scenarios, getting you into an operable pre-made vehicle and dropping you into the midst of a full-scale battle. These missions are a really excellent way to get a glimpse at what all-out war looks like in From the Depths.\n\nConsidering the complexity of what you can do and the scope of freedom you have doing it, From the Depths is a game I feel deserves way more attention and hype from sandbox and crafting enthusiasts. For me it's certainly the next biggest sandbox game on the market and one I've already put more time into than KSP or Space Engineers, and the prospects shown from constant updates and a very close relationship between the developer and the community make it even more important to get involved early to watch something already engrossing turn into something huge.","August 26, 2014","true","4.9"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","56","67","0","2"

The game implies they are long/hard to learn that is a lie.\nDo use the symetry feature for symetric vessels ;) .\nDo familiarize yourself with the basics in the vehicle designer before attempting a campaign. Why not?\nIn all my hours of gameplay I haven't yet touched the campaign (though I feel that I could, at any time... it's just that there's so many designs to build and test, and so little time! Oh the misery.)\n\nStart small.\nKeep an eye on your craft's center of mass. A lot revoles around that (pardon the pun).\nThus place your means of propulsion appropriately; for small adjustments to the center of mass I recommend lead blocks.\nLearn only a few systems at a time in order to not get overwhelmed.\n(So don't be discouraged if you fail to build a working airship armed with every type of weapon as a first build.)\nYou'll get there sooner rather than later, and nothing can compare to the satisfaction you'll feel when one of your cherished design performs better than intended and obliterates similarly priced stock vessels.\n\nI'm still in awe such a game actually exists.\nIt's still in early access, sure, but each major update introduces new systems or improves upon a previous one, and it just works so well. Walking around on a very fast-moving and unstable vessel can feel a little jerky at times, but only because you've become habituated to how smooth it feels in every other situation. Anyhow, navigating a "sinking" airship feels appropriately cataclysmic, and I know of no other game that can deliver a similar experience with such fidelity.\n\nAs I said earlier, it just -works-, and the amazing (yet very approachable) complexity of the systems on display is an incredible stimulus for your imagination.\n\nThe game, even at this (early?) stage, truly lives up to its premise. If you have any doubts, there are a few youtube Let's Plays floating around; Lathland and Rosefall come to mind, but there are others of equal quality which I shall not name here because I am lazy. I've learned quite a few tricks watching their videos!\n\nGreat/10","December 23, 2015","true","343.8"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","40","42","3","0"

Walrus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrigadierGeneralWalrus/","126 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n*ahem**read imaging Morgan Freeman as the narator for full experience*Long ago, a young walrus laid in his bed watching Netflix late at night. He had loved customization in video games, so much so nothing quite solved his hunger for customization; not Grand Theft Auto Five, and even not DC: Universe Online. This creative young walrus envisioned a sandbox-survival where you could do more than slap 200 pre-build engines and cannons on a vehicle to make it good; a game where he could customize every aspect of everything in the whole fuzzing universe. Long since then, that poor little walrus gave up on that dream, realizing nobody would ever go the extra mile for such a game. But Brilliant Skies Ltd. proved little Willie walrus very wrong. They went the extra GIGAPARSEC (for those who\nare NOT the largest nerd in ze world, zat is the largest unit of measurement, a.k.a. 3.6 billion light years). Little Wilhelm was ecstatic at this marvelous game. As fast as a tubby little walrus could run, he grabbed 20 bucks out of his wallet and sacrificed it for this marvel. But it was too good to be true right? NAY, NAY I DO SAY. Little Willie walrus discovered he didn't even know where to start when trying to POWER his vehicle with an engine. Willie could not even make a ship that drove correctly; he had to make a katamaran (3-platformed boat). But with the power of his friend YouTube, Wilhelm Walrus make a boat (given, it is not very good a fighting), and soon enough he joined the campaign to stick it to the Deepwater Guard (he still actually hasn't, but he is trying (:3=)).\n\n*nerdy white kid lispy voice*Now that I have told the story of little Willie Walrus, he shall list the pros and cons\nPROS\n-This game has already improved its graphics form the older videos on the steam page.\n-Brilliant Skies has managed to find balance between content and bug-fixing updates, like ye old Space Engineers.\n-It never gets old, there is simply too much to do, too much to make, *deep-voiced black guy*too much love.\n-3 types of weapons is actually enough to play hundreds of hours, 3; that shows the complexity of this game.\n-You can make any type of vehicles, form fortesses, to mountainside artillery, to cars (i think, haven't expirimented), boats obviously, balloon-craft, helicopters, helicarriers, aircraft carriers, jets, propeller planes, space or air satellites, and maybe spacecraft, I haven't seen it one but I'm confident someone will.\n-Controls are intuitive once you learn them, but you better spend some time with 'em TO learn them.\n-There are 19 parts for missles. You can make any type of missle, even torpedoes or, uh, harpoon missiles...\n-Everything is balanced.\n-No bugs that ruin any experience.\nCONS\n-It can be a bit annoying just staring at your resources going up when you're saving up to spawn in your pimping new battlecruiser in campaign.\n-Campaign mode is a bit simple (at the moment at least)\n-LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG. And I have a ASUS G750 Republic of Gamers. So if you run your games in POTATO OS v. 6.7, I reccomend staying away till further notice.\n-I have been failed far too many times by early access (looking at you Starforge and Stranded Deep, and, well Stomping Land), however this looks very promising.\n-If you're a bit more casual, then look at that street sign over there, <Steep Learning Curve Ahead>\n\nAll-in-all, 13.536 out of 5 stars. It is my new favorite Steam game. It beat Payday fudging 2. A must for people who like games they have to research, and btw a great place to learn is Lathrix's channel on Youtube, it helped a lot.\n*UPDATE* They have now added a 4th type of weapon, of course not counting simple weapons. They are complex cannons, and they are far more customizable with different mantlets and best of all custimizable projectiles (:3=)! They have also improved the texture for wood further, and it now looks like it could actually be used in more than a flimsy wee raft.\n*NOTE* As I said in my cons list, this game be not for the casuals. It is very hard, it can take hours to design a simple corvette, or a little raft with a gun. Some of the UI doesn't make this much better, just with the way it is presented seemingly randomly.","October 16, 2015","true","174.6"," 52 of 66 people (79%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","79","52","66","46","4"

You have much more control over everything (from custom-building your engine to building your entire ship around a giant gun if you so choose) but there's also a steeper learning curve due to the wide range of features. If the in-game tutorials aren't enough, just ask on the discussion forums and you'll get a quick answer at most times of day.\n\nFrom the Depths is centered around two things\nBuilding vehicles- either to use against other players in a battle, or against the AI in a campaign\nBattling against players or the AI in a game mode of your choosingIf you don't find the idea of trying to custom build the best combined fleet of ships, submarines, aircraft (whether propellled by jets, balloon, or propellers), and then sending in your fleet to fight as per specific set of commands you and the AI mainframe will give it, this probably isn't the game for you.\n\nI'll explain the campaign, but first I want to talk about what From the Depths has that really sets it apart:\n\n-A unique keyboard-based build mode (in addition to the mouse-based mode of building common to games like Space Engineers.) It's impossible to explain in words, but I find it more efficient in most cases. Don't worry, there is a symmetry mode. It'll take you an hour to get used to this, the time investment will pay off in the long-run, the only downside is you'll be wondering why every other game like this doesn't offer the same system. Also, make sure you don't build your ship backwards, the in-game tutorial will explain this, don't skip it.\n\n-Four unique offensive weapon systems, all customizable. Also, your AI (if properly set up) can use all of these effectively, don't worry about trying to pinpoint the lasers your guided missiles will follow far into the horizon. I'll try to explain each in-game system briefly (the in-game tutorial will give much more detail):\nMissiles/torpedoes. Missiles can be short, medium, or long ranged depending on how much fuel you give them, which has the obvious tradeoff of carrying a smaller payload, you can add a lot of maneuverability and speed to intercept small aircraft at short range, or you can go for longer-range missiles that slowly but surely send their payloads in excess of 3-4km. You can actually use missiles to distract missiles- get a small missile system, set it to "flare", set a control block to "fire when hostile missile is within 300m" and whenever a missile is close enough your little set of missiles will fly from your ship or aircraft- works well against infrared seeking torpedoes, not so much against laser-seeking torpedoes.\nCRAM cannons. The name "CRAM" stems from the fact that the way the guns work is that you have a series of "pellet boxes" and "ammo boxes", the more pellet boxes you have the faster you pack your shells with explosive/EMP/kinetic material, the more ammo boxes the faster you load, you'll definitely want to focus on packing over reloading as there's no point in firing a shell with hardly any power packed into it. These are great against large, slow ships and can have a barrel gauge of 2,000mm, really substantial- you might think that it would be immensely overpowered, not so, as with any weapon system there's a big trade off in reload time, and other variables.\nAdvanced cannons/rail guns. Depending on how you design your shell, and the more parts you have to a shell the more room you need to store that shell at any given gauge- the more you can "do" with it. I'll give you a concrete example. If I want to fire a shell with 10 gunpowder casings, 2 stabilizing fins which reduce inaccuracy by 80% each (the effect stacks), 3 HE warhead bodies, 3 EMP warhead bodies, 1 proximity depth fuse, and 1 AP capped nose, my shell will release a combined HE/EMP explosion after penetrating a certain depth, the drawback of using this number of parts is that I have to use a lot more storage space for the ammo of a gun of 100mm gauge with a 19 part shell, as opposed to that same 100mm gauge gun firing a shell with only 6 parts. Every thing has a cost and a benefit, so you have to make a compromise with every design. With advanced cannons, you want to focus on accuracy and cooldown so you can fire quickly and accurately, without taking up all the space for gauge increasers which let you fire larger shells, and without taking up all the space for your autoloaders and ammo clips. You can set these up to fire at incoming missiles, if you want to try, use a small gauge and a rapid fire rate.\nLasers- I haven't used them myself, but they're designed with several components which, again, have their costs and benefits. These use up energy from the engine, so probably are a bad choice for a small vehicle with a small engine- better go with a cannon or missile system. These are also effective against missilesHonorable mention would be drills and rams, both of which can be used to ram other ships, and some people create some rapidly spinning versions mounted on the front for a large boost to the damage- but I don't really bother.\n\nFor defensive systems, you can use shields which, at steeper angles, reflect incoming cannon shells, flares as mentioned before can distract incoming missiles, and of course you can stack heavy metal armor for protecting against anything that gets through. Do not forget to put some surge protection from EMP around things like your AI mainframe.\n\nEngines are fully customizable- I won't explain it in detail, but the way you design your cylinders/exhaust/carburators/injectors/etc. allows you to compromise between fuel efficiency, performance, and so on. Jet engines also come in a small standard size which takes up 1 block, or a large customizable jet which has parts that are 3 wide x 3 high x 1 long, and you can stack these parts to make an engine as powerful as it is thirsty for fuel.\n\nNow, why does any of this matter? Because of the creativity the massive set of tools allows, my overview of what you can do in the game is far from exhaustive. If you want to create a giant, inexplicably airborne floating metal death cube, you can do it, and you've got about half a dozen different ways to make sure it doesn't fall to the ground, or you can make much more realistic design of fighter craft, you can try to design a fleet around a set of workhorse medium cruisers with a few pieces thrown in, or, alternatively, gamble the whole battle on one giant metal ship which has a huge engine, is shielded from all angles, and has several systems designed to fight submarines, aircraft big and small, defeat missiles, and of course destroy large enemy ships threatening you from several kilometers away. IF you really want, you can design your ship around a massive railgun which fires shells at several kilometers per hour, and an engine which can hopefully power it- sort of like an A10, except it floats and is intended to fire through entire ships- also, make sure to use hollowpoint heads on railguns, they impart the entire kinetic force of the shell travelling at 3km/second to the point of impact.\n\nNow, again, if you're only interested in seeing these ships blow up, and you don't want to tweak them yourself, you're better off not buying the game and instead just watching a nicely edited video someone else has made where they below up the ships for you.","April 21","true","115.9"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","28","29","4","3"

Trust me; calling this Minecraft would be like calling "Space Engineers" Minecraft. Honestly Space Engineers would be a far better game for comparison to FTD than Minecraft. Does Minecraft have missiles, space-ships and lasers? Didnt think so.....\n\nYou can basically build just about anything from Submarines to boats to spaceships in a pretty wide variety of ways, Land structures and vehicles are also gonna be in the game in some time. The engine is very versatile, and the game is  VERY stable for a Pre-Alpha game; seriously ive run into more or less no major issues so far. The campaign mode is aimed to be a very strategic mode where you basically command fleets of vessels (designed by you and made using resources harvested by you!) against the AI factions and there own respective fleets; each faction having unique designs, tactics and difficulty.\n\nNow onto the frequent complains that negative reviewers are making about the UI and control system. The Control systems basically designed to give a high amount of fine control over block placement; giving control over all 3 Axis using a combination of WASD keys and the mouse, which helps when your making complicating designs. It also makes it easier to edit componnents that are deep inside the constructs hull; letting you reach and change them easily without having to strip off parts to reach it directly. Despite its versatility and varied usage I really dont think it takes too long to get the hang of the control system; but if you really cant stand it the game also offers a much simpler "Look and place" build mode. Building stuff and making it work is a lot easier than people keep saying it is; while at the same timing perfectly optimising something to run via the AI system can be a very interesting challenge for those that wanna have a go at it.\n\ntl;dr: Its a lot easier than most people keep saying it is; and if you played Space Engineers (or another similar build-style game) and liked it then youll most likely love this.","November 7, 2014","true","307.1"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","4"

And thank God they were, for there actions that morning saved countless lives. It started with a strange radar signature, about two kilometers off the coast, moving incredibly fast. then two more.

The developer is doing an insane job with updates, and he is truly building an outstanding sandbox game *with an awesome mix of campaign/strategy gameplay* that just blew my mind away. I play minecraft, terraria, starbound, space engineers, etc etc, and this one took me from all of them. Absolutely awesome game, great updates on a routine basis, open minded developer, great player community, and a fun and interactive experience to keep you looking forward to playing when you get off work huzzah!!! I highly HIGHLY recommend it, big time kudo's to the dev.\n\n*Adding notes*\n\nMk so, reading my review, I realized it doesn't really, give a great review. It's just me being like, super excited because I love the game. So i'm gonna go for a more 'in depth' approach to some things i've come to love and the things i enjoy but, don't love....yet >.>\n\nFirst off, the pro's and cons.\n\nPro's\n\n1 Great building interface, with 2 ways to build, keyboard and mouse. Both of which have their own pros/cons. It also boasts a significant variety of blocks making every creation truly unique in it's own way.\n2 Sub assembly system - Ever build something on something else, and wish you could take that something off the something else, and put it on something else? Well, in this, you can. Say you make a kick ♥♥♥ turret on one ship hull, but realize the hull just wasn't the right style, and couldn't hang. Well, damn, you don't want to rebuild that turret all over so, you make the hull work, right? Wrong, you can save subassemblies so that when you build more ships later you can add the same things to them w/out having to do all the work to recreate the things that work\n3 4 area's of combat *although space has been...interesting...follow up on that in the cons >.>* You can fight on land, sea, air, and yes, even space.\n4 AI system for your creations to make your own fleet and evolving options to control the actions of your AI drones. I for example have my B-ship i control, with 4 fighters and a destroyer escort that are all AI controlled to escort my Big boat ♥♥♥ around. w00t w00t\n5 Open minded and honest hard working dev team. Now as of now, the only 'dev' i know of, is Mr. Nick Smart. But he has been ON IT. I mean, I participate in alot of early access games. And this is the only one where the dev is constantly in the forums, posting on others and publishing his own, on a frequent basis. He is constant with updates, and is truly doing a phenominal job trying to keep the game in the direction his vision has for it.\n6 Campaign system - ok this will be my last pro, as I don't want to bore anyone Ok so, the campaign, has some ups and downs of it's own. Upsides - harvest multiple resource zones, have multiple fleets, multiple battle fronts, simple interface to navigate around your fleets, simple dipolomacy panel to ♥♥♥♥ peeps off or make them like you, Pretty good map layout, difficult AI once you get about 1/2 across the map. Overall the campaign, I luv it. I know there are some things in the works so i'm going to list them in the cons section BUT, big disclaimer, they are already on nicks workload and I can't wait to see what he hits us with when he starts evolving them.\n\nMK so, Cons. I'll be honest, not alot of huge game crippling things i have found. There are some nuisances but, the dev's actively working on them and, i'm not an impatient guy so, w00t w00t can't wait to see them fixed. Here they are\n\n1 MP (creative) is a little buggy. The host is the only one who tends to see all the action going on in the map. For example, if a cannon has a prediction piece on it, and you are the client, you won't be able to see the line drawn to show where your round will go. YOu also can't see the power, speed, drag, so on so forth. Now, do'nt get me wrong, the client can still do everything the host can, but the downside is, he won't SEE everything he's doing. Creative is basically no resource costs, on the campaign map, where you and all connected players can just, build.\nMP (AI fight) is a neat concept, but it can be hard finding games up unless you have buddies who have the game to get on at the same time. Basically, you build a ship with an AI interface. You load it against someone elses, and you both watch the ships fight to the death, with no involvement from you. It's great to do to see how your creations stack up against other players. Neat little game mode.\n2 AI in campaign is, well, garbage >.> As in you can just flot over to a ship, SHOOT the AI mainframe, and walla you have a new ship. Now if you decide to not do that, it can get hard granted if you up the difficulty it does get pretty rough, BUT you have to have a high end machine to handle the big boys, and that means you may be annoyed with the scrub ships your stuck on depending on your gaming monster which takes me into\n3 Frame rate can get pretty low when alot of stuff is going on. Another *disclaimer* is that nick is already working on moving to a different game engine, in order to improve this. But as of now, if you aren't sporting a hot rod, and your just cruising with a sedan, you may want to keep your block count a little low to keep from getting to choppy.\n4 Getting to space *this might be restricted to just me* Now i have been having the hardest time getting a ship to leave orbit and actually get into space. The only way I have been able to get into space is to, well, build in space. I've been trying to build jets with ion thrusters that could leave the planet go to space and come back in, but i've had no success. Again, this could be a just me moment, but it shouldn't be that hard to leave orbit if you already have the engines to get you to max altitude in the first place. which rolls me into\n5 the playable field, while awesome, is also kinda limited. Now it's cool because, you can really chew someone up and they can't get away from you b/c the deepest the water gets is like, 50 meters, and the air goes up as far as 500 meters, and your weapons can easily reach 1000 + meters. So, ya, they can't get away unless they just run, horizontally, str8 away from you. However, if your on the 'oh ♥♥♥♥ i gots to go' end of this, ya, it sucks. You have nothing going for you as the height/depth of the playable area is pretty small and therefore you have to just go for speed to run for your life.\n\nThe last 2 cons, are the only ones on my list that I honestly don't know if the dev is working on, and to be honest, if he didn't change it, i wouldn't be heart broken. B/c yeah, it sucks to not be able to go higher or lower in order to increase my survivability, but it has led me to make more interesting designs with a little more armor to take those hits. And the space thing, meh, i can get over that, i'll just keep building in space.\n\nEnd of discussion Game review - Overall, i've been in 18 Early access games, and so far, this one and space engineers are the only 2 that truly paid off. This one is STILL in early access, but still is truly on point and moving forward at an amazing pace. Again, great dev, great gaming community, evolving game interface and AI systems make it a truly unique experience. Again, if you would like to play a sandbox game, and bring some idea's to the table, or just enjoy the game, this is a great pick. and hey, it'll be going in and out of sale frequently, so get it when it's cheap. I could easily see this game going for 40+ once it's finished. great game. If you happen to get it, by all means send me a message to do some building together, or to blow each other up, i'm always down for both!!","November 22, 2014","true","567.7"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","27","31","2","0"

The game is still in alpha so expect some problems like somewhat poor graphics and a lot of lag during big battles. Although the developer is working on these.\n\nFTD is essentially a building game, mixed with an rts, and an fps. Because of this the game is immensely complex. The greatest complexity comes from the building process, which will take a lot of time to learn. You will need to learn to build hulls, ai's, cannons, missles, and engines. Each one of these has different rules that detirmine what parts can be connected to what section, and these rules will force you to make decisions about your ships design.  This will be espicially true when you play campaign where resources are limited. You can even use LUA scripting in the game to give your vehicles or missles custom behaviours.\n\nBecause of the ability to build what you want, the rts like gamepley is pretty interesting. Like modern battles from the depths battles are often detirmined by range and the ability to gain intelligence on enemy movements is crucial to success. The ability to download units from the steam workshop also makes it possible to play the game without needing to design a ton of vehicles.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to design your own weapons and take them into battle, then ftd is a great game for you. Just realize that this game gives you a ton of design options and a lot of the possible designs suck. This comes from the games balancing that usually forces you to choose between multiple factors especially how big your willing to go.","March 5","true","585.5"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

Where to begin?\n\nHow about by getting something out of the way first: this is no Minecraft. It isn't download and just "get" it straight away, and the included tutorials...well they're tutorials, they get their job done. Point is, there's a learning curve to this game as others have mentioned, both in the construction of parts such as cannons, AI, and engines, then in the actual build process itself.\n\nIt takes some getting used to when using tools that expedite construction to say the least.\n\nBut then you get your first boat built and working in the creative mode. Maybe you rig it with the simple weapons. Maybe you make your own weapons. Maybe, just maybe, you start building the largest most fearsome ship possible and just pack that thing full of custom cannons that are essentially full bore autocannons, enough missiles to start and end a war with one of the game's factions, turreted lasers that burn aircraft out of the sky, and a gigantic slash elaborate drill system just to get the point across to your enemies: this is not a boat to be trifled with. Then you make more and more.\n\nPerhaps you go into the actual story missions. They have restrictions, parameters, quotas that can't be surpassed. You could just choose to use the resources ie ships given to you to complete them, or you could just make your own machines, using those same restrictions to guide how you cobble them together. Therefore you can complete them your own way, and with plenty of trial and error.\n\nEventually; very quickly if you continue to just smash enemy story mission ships to smithereens; you unlock the campaign mode. Suddenly, all the wonderful ships you built and the machines you used to beat the story missions can become your very own personal fleet with a bit of time, AI, and some patience. Just as suddenly the game ceases to be some sort of "meet the objectives" shooter but rather an RTS where your units are those you've built yourself from the twisty maddening reaches of your own imagination. Now you're after efficiency: how can you, the admiral of your fleet, get ships built that are as cheap but effective as possible to mount an assault or defend against enemy fleets? So you continue to build.\n\nUpon which you realize that this has ceased to be a sandbox; it is now a "toybox." A vehicle simulator, shooter, real-time-strategy, and a huge heaping box of building blocks all mashed together to let you build your own naval and air-force warmachine. And best of all, it gives you most of the building pieces from the get-go.\n\nCriminy, if you're still a little iffy on getting From the Depths since it's on Early Access at least follow the confounded game!","May 16, 2015","true","78.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","22","24","3","3"

The only warning I give is this: be prepared to tackle a very high learning curve and a very high complexity of mechanics. I have seen a few bugs here and there, but the dev is fast and usually fixes them right away. As for those complexities I was talking about? Well, you can build completely custom cannons, lasers, missiles, engines, jets... You get the point. Not to mention the fact that you can build any vehicle you want, except for land, which has not been fully incorporated yet. (Wheels are there though).\n\nOnce upon a time, I had fininshed a battleship, was beating enemies untill a larger, better made ship came and crushed me. Their initial salvo had crippled my cannons. I was left with only missiles and torpedoes, which I fired desperately. It was no use, not only had they had a larger ship, they had anti-missile systems. So my ship sunk...\n\n\nAs I pass 850 hours of playtime, I have run out of ideas, I have built everything by now. Battleships, cruisers, patrol boats, airships of every kind, bombers, interceptors, microjets, helicopters, submarines, spacehips, castles, fortressess, spinning wheels of death, suicide bombers, satelites, microjets, battleships --- wait Im starting to repeat myself here... I think I lost myself in everything that I have done 0-o.\n\nMoving on, I have been reading many of the negative reviews lately, its just sad tho... I read that the controls are wonky, the building mechanics are funny and the ui is terrible. Rest assured, these people are exagerating, the building mechanics only take getting used to, and are fine if you play the game, controls are the same, the ui--- I have no clue why people complain so much about it--- I dont see a problem with it, it works. The only thing that is dragging this game down is optimization, but, with all the time i have been in the game and on the forums, I can say that it is something that is activly being worked on. I just dont understand the people who do not take the time to play the game, do their fair share of looking around on the internet to understand something they dont know. The easiest way to get an answer if you have a question, is to ask on the forum.\n\nHoly cranbery flying cows! Its been almost a whole year since I posted my review!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bombzero/recommended/268650/","bombzero","Bombzero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bombzero/","161 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPretty solid in its current state, promising future, dev actually interacts with community and the game was a functional and playable product when released on Early Access, which already makes it more likely to not get abandoned than 99% of games on here.\n\nThat being said, if you want a more 'secure' project or a game that can be played for merits other than sandbox elements I'd wait a month or even several. There's a big update coming soonish to the 'main' gameplay mode, and a huge list of not-yet-implemented features at the current time.\n\n\nGameplay wise. It uses a very well fleshed out sandbox building tool to design ships either on the fly or in advance that can be made or spawned into the various game modes. Eventually should feature a rather lengthy campaign that looks like it'll basically be a set of scenarios and goals, simple but entertaining, a Multiplayer campaign mode ("world domination" style gameplay with resource zones and stuff), and single battles pitting ships against eachother within a resource budget.\n\n\nPros:\n-The building tools are amazing, actually including features like fill tools, mirroring both 'along a line' and between two blocks allowing both odd and even number symmetry. Saving and loading sub parts of vehicles (tad odd at this time), and a lot of other "Blatantly obvious" things that it's always annoying when sandbox games lack.\n\n-The game appears to have a fleshed out backstory and lore that the vehicles of the factions and the story missions are being created to match, and will likely feature a content rich and interesting game world in the end.\n\n-The aesthetics. The game's graphical style is quite nice, with wooden structures and vehicles appearing a tiny bit ramshackle but still sturdy, metal stuff solid and sleek in form but covered in weld lines and rivets, the avatars(player controlled characters) interesting and unique. All in all it reminds me of steampunk with a bit of a clunkier appearance that I think fits the general design of the game perfectly.\n\n\nNeutral:\n-The weapons, while satsifying and powerful, suffer from a bit of 'one best option' problems. For example cannons are best served as being stupidly long guns with obscene fire rates, without much reason to do things like a massive caliber slow firing gun as you could make it rapid fire for purely an additional resource cost. Meaning "Bigger is always better, faster firing is always better" with nearly no exceptions.\n\n-The physics engine for vehicles is a decent blend of realism and gameplay/CPU intensity concessions. Don't expect an accurate naval warfare simulator or realistic aerodynamics but it's definitely solid.\n\n-The combant. Sans current minor AI derpiness the combat is rather well done, with versatile weapon options for your vehicles, ammo and fuel management being things you need to take into account, and lots of information presented in nice visual and auditory manners that don't look out of place. (Shell tracers that indicate shell type, energy shields showing up in world, engines changing pitch by power drain, thrusters for fortresses and jets showing information about themselves by the color of their trails, etc)\n\n\nCons:\n-The AI is a little clunky at present, does ok navigating and fighting solo but tends to ram allies repeatedly, make a beeline for stationary structures or sky forts and get caught on those, and the 'orders' system is as of this update not terribly useful or fleshed out, and results in even more of the above. Unfortunately, this is also a key feature of the game, and will almost be required for success in campaign after the coming update, so hopefully it's put in a better state in the next few updates.\n\n-Lacking in content, obviously, it's an Early Access game, but the core gameplay ideas are present and largely functional.\n\n-Multiplayer is in early testing this version, don't buy it for that, yet.\n\n-Current implementation of campaign mode maps is unwieldy and a little derpy in how it handles diplomacy, e.g. allies will 'capture' any territories you leave defended only by structures or empty, but you will still receive resources from your harvesting objects there. Next version this should change but we have limited info on that, so perhaps hold off if that bothers you.","October 24, 2014","true","238.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

It's hard to believe this thing is still in Alpha. There are a few eccentricties that I hope get ironed out, but it's really hard to tell whether these things are user error or bugs (though I must admit I usually find through trial and error that they're my fault). The only complaint I have is very minor, and that is that certain objects cannot be inverted...this sometimes impacts the performance of my designs or at the very least detracts from their aesthetic appeal. I'm really splitting hairs there though...overall it's truly amazing.\n\nNow the learning curve is rather steep, but I've found that looking over some of the many designs available through the workshop as well as the included designs that you can get an idea of how to actually design things yourself. If you're unwilling to put the time in, though, you should just keep on browsing and find something else. It takes some thought, tweaking, and occasional reloading of previous designs (definitely save your builds often, if there's an undo button I haven't found it and find myself occasionally detaching entire portions of builds and can't bring them back) to get something really usable.\n\nHowever, the reward of watching your functional (if ugly, in my case) aircraft streaking across the sky and firing giant heat seeking missiles down onto a ship until the AI detaches the magnetic free fall bomblets all while continuing on to circle back around for another attack run...well...it's totally worth every agonizing hour of design work.\n\nTry it out...I mean it's already awesome and this early in development it can only get even better.","October 13, 2014","true","42.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

I loved that as a kid, with this game it brings back so many great memories aswell as great fun. You start of with one block and build amazing things from scratch, either a helicopter, plane or maybe a submarine, boat or even a hot air ballon, then drop it into the water and see if it will float, sink, fly or sail. Then add some Ai for Ai controlled guns and Ai controlled movement, then add some some CUSTOM made cannons, lazor's and/or missiles, Then spawn in an enemy ship and test your almighty beast against the scum of the sea, the "Deep Water Guard", you may lose the first battle, you may lose the second battle and maybe even the third, but with every defeat you grow stronger, its not how hard you can hit (well thats pretty important too lol), but instead how hard you CAN get hit and get back up and create another ship/plane or whatever it may be and finally destroy that enemy ship!\n\nThis also has Multiplayer so you and a few friends could build a masterpiece together or just build your own ships and see who wins. This game offers alot of fun and replayability even for an early access game (never thought i'd say that) and this also has a compaign mode, but thats all I will say for now, I will leave you discover the master piece which is from the dephts for yourselfs, and also if you want to watch any videos about this game I would recommend you watch "Budkai" on youtube.

This hasn't occured very often but is annoying when it does. I therfore recommend saving before and after every battle just in case it does crash.\n\nAfter getting over the negatives of bugs/crashes and the insane learning curve i have to say that this game is absolutely amazing (when you know what your doing :P) The conctruction is really good, basically if you think of something in this game you can build it. Replicas of ww2 warships? yep, large bombers? yep, A death star orbiting the planet? yep. The battles are awsome, they allow you to slow down time, zoom over to your enemies and see the chunks being blown out of them by your ships weapons.\n\nIn all this game is really really good but is a challenge to learn and can be buggy at times.

It has no real constrictions to the way you play, you can build monstrous battleships that are almost unsinkable, hitting harder than a Sunday morning hangover, or squadrons of ultra nimble fighters that can outpace missiles and bullets with ease, though personally I go for edge of space motherships that rain down molten pain from a distance. The ability to craft a cannon piece by piece is something I've never encountered before, taking into account what kind of weapon would be appropriate for the craft you can fully customise the weapons capabilities from the range, to the accuracy, firerate, caliber and ammunition type, or opt for a laser or missile system with just as many options.\n\nAnother wonderful thing about this game is the developer's 100% commitment, I've seen on the forums more than once, someone having an issue getting something to work correctly or encountering a bug of sorts and the developer promptly replying, first to appologise, then to explain how to make something work or to say that he will fix this in the next update, which he seems to always follow through with. The developer's liveliness in the community is reason enough to buy this game as he listens to suggestions and responds almost always saying that he will add this as a feature, or that it may damage the balance and it may possibly come as a feature in the future.

I can build small vessels, make custom (Somewhat working) cannons and gun batterys, but large ships, planes, spaceships, or heck, engines? Not a chance. If you don't mind a confusing start (Or i'm overlooking something) this game is great.\n\nTaking part in a massive fleet battle, with aircraft carrying out bombing runs on enemy ships, or defending your flagship from airborne threat. Submarines sneaking in to sink enemy command vessels, cruisers firing missiles at the enemy, small attack boats dodging in and out launching torpedos, high altitude bombers obliterating enem coastal gun positions. You take a look around as a ship slowly capsizes and begins to sink, or another plows into a smaller enemy ship, snapping it in half, and you can't help but be impressed. At it's best this  game is just incredible, plain and simple. The basic buidling is essentially easy, but getting the balance right, and the finer points, like weapons, propulsion, and control (Rigging the thing up to an AI system) is complicated at best.\n\nThis is well worth the twenty dollars, even for an early access game. I have yet to find something that even comes close to this. If you don't really want to part with that much money for it though, pick it up on sale. This truely is a great game.\n\nThe graphics are fairly decent, the underwater scene could use some help, it's very barren, but the gameplay compensates for this. Who has time for scenerey when your jet powered submarine plane is racing along at high speed.\n\nBear in mind this game is EARLY ACCESS!

Penney","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197967643963/","232 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n-Core flaw (of personal opinion): Very tiring and steep learning curve with the build interface, I would say thats its biggest flaw. Example: theres an 'align block with camera' button, but not a rotate button? Or if they do its very hidden, so again, deep (lol) learning curve.\n\nYou can always find guides on youtube for ship building / button layout, etc. But for example: I purchased this game some time in 2015 and had a blast with it, trying to relearn the controls again after remembering the several sessions I spent trying to memorize things so it didn't take me an eternity to build the simplist of things really sort of just 'turned me off' again from playing, my feelings on its flaws aside and how they discouraged me from re-learning at the present moment aside!\n\n------------------------------------------\nIt's a very 'deep' voxel based game, not quite as hands on as minecraft, you dont collect your resources by hand. The process is some thing of harvesting resources from visable fields in the ocean / using the remains of your enemies. The game does offer missions, multiplayer, a few different campaigns. If you lack ideas you can grab almost anything conceaved on the workshop, no one seems to be shy about sharing their vessels, terrible or not some times. The campaigns sort of turn into an RTS of sorts pretty quickly, as you manage AI fleets and build / repair / arm said vessels with autorepair parts once you can afford them / build repair AI vehicles / Add guns, missiles, torpedoes, etc.\n\n-Build anything from 'Space Ships' (I'm not sure if you could call it space, look into that if its a selling point to you*) to old timey galleys to submarines to helicopters to zeplin airships, Aircraft carriers, aircraft carrier subs, sub carrier subs, space ship carrier subs?- the sky is sort of the limit along with your imagination (hence the title) and it can seem a bit primitive, users have come up with some very creative content and shared in the workshop to help 'put wind in your sails' for creative ideas of your own.\n\n-Battles can become very exciting, and you can witness your dreams get ripped to shreds, luckily you can save blueprints of your works in progress pretty much any time you like before hand so yeah, you'll learn to save often. I would say having your creation fight other AI craft and win or lose can be quite satisfying and challanging especially at first. Combat can be done manually (manual turret aim, etc) or have AI do 50% - 100% (shoot, or shoot & drive) depending on how you've designed your ships, again because its a voxel game using odd blocks to represent ideas of ship componenets, there is a learning curve even on how AI works on a boat, unless its been changed you must add certain AI controller blocks to work with other AI blocks, its not quite as complicated as it sounds but does take a bit of reading and guide sloothing. That being said, because of its complexity with parts it will allow users to create very cool and unusual concept vehicles.\n\n-Bugs and crashing, it's at a minimal if any, and if memory serves me correct earlier versions were relitively bug and crash free, though again if I remember correctly from the peroid I played when I purchased, it did not include multiplayer of any sort less sharing vessels, so I cannot speak for the potential bugginess of the MP aspects of the game.\n\n\nDO I recommend this for you?:\n--------------------------------\nIf you enjoy playing creator mode more so in minecraft for the end results of aesthetics or loved tekkit because of the layers of complexity from new blocks it added and how they worked together, and you can learn a 'new way of building' with some keys that almost seem to have purpose behind their strangeness after you remember/figure out why, then yes I do recommend this title to you, especially if you're a fan of naval combat.\n\non the other hand if you're looking for some thing quick where the user simply plays the game more so then building ships in the ship / vehicle creator then you may not quite enjoy this title like I and others have,\n\nthough like I've mentioned its vast armada of user created content avialable in the workshop allows you to download and plug into your campaign any vehicle of any purpose, refinary, rig, or what ever you might need at almost any time, but be weary you can't build GaryColeman68's USS Enterprise (with A-4, F-14, & AH-64) if you just start your campaign and have limited resources! So keep all that in mind, though at any time you could take said Enterprise into a combat simulator against JakeLongArm82's Space Drednaught (with submersive and sub-bay abilities) and see who's fleet 'keeps afloat', Both those examples of users content are totally made up, though lots of that stuff does exist.\n\n-------------\nShort & Sweet: It's a creative man's fleet builder and psuedo RTS, in no way is it a quick way to burn some time for fun though.","May 4","true","24.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

Its high felixability feature is the thing that most attracts me. But it is not perfect, not yet, at least.\n\n\nThere are some minor problems that you guys could try to dealing with:\n\n\n1. User interface: The current UI is not quite friendly to be honest, the construction mode is to complicated and unconvinient for building such a large scale structure such as the bettle ship. Warping from one vehicle to another is not smooth enough. Also, the UI should looks better.\n\n2. Better art design required: The texture and the shapes of different component is not yet satisfying. Is that possible to add some better visual effects in later update?\n\n\nThat's basicly all the information I want to imply. From the Depth is definitly a fantastic game and you are all doing a great job!","March 6","true","1.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dimaurora/recommended/268650/","dimaurora","DimAurora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dimaurora/","49 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWritten as of Release 1.947, 19 April, 2016.\n\nThis game is one I've been addicted to for months now. I may not have the hours to show it, as I play a fair amount offline, but the experience is definitely here. I'll have a quick summary. Would I recommend From The Depths to someone who is willing to learn and values gaining experience through trial and error? Yes. Would I recommend it to someone who just wants a simple game that's easy to get into and you can easily become a powerful god in? Absolutely not.\n\nWell, why would I recommend this to the first type of people? Well, it's a hard game. I'm not going to lie. This game will slam your face in the ground many times. But the ones who learn from things like that will thrive off of what they learned from that. They'll get back up, dust themselves off, and fix the problem before heading back in. A fair amount of knowledge is useful in From The Depths. Simple physics, some mathematics, advanced problem solving, etc. But even people who don't know those can easily excel with the will to learn from mistakes. Your ship keeps flipping over? Well, time to make sure the center of mass sits lower in the vehicle. Basic problem solving can soothe the rage I see in others.\n\nBut what about the second group, Dim? As I said, it's a hard game. Not everything will just pop right up to you. I first started playing this before the new tutorial additions, and let me tell you, it was hard. 90% of what I know came from reverse engineering, experimentation, and watching others. But now there's a much better tutorial system that even helped me with some things. I can say if you instantly want to be a god at building things, this will never be the game for you. No amount of tutorials will ever make it so. You have to be able to not get frustrated at every little thing and be able to problem solve. It takes time.\n\nNow some people complain about the "horrible" UI. Well, yes, it's extremely simple and definitely not pretty. But it gets the job done. There are a few things that I'd say are difficult to figure out, but once you get it, it's second nature. I will admittedly say the multiplayer is lackluster. It's originally what I got the game for, to play with friends. But now they're working on it. It's an Early Access game after all. There will be issues. There are quite a few other little issues, but everything is subject to change since I first typed this. No game is perfect. I will say the learning curve was rough, but the game must have some addictive drug in it after you get the hang of what to do.\n\nPros:\nAmazing building capabilities\nSmart AI systems (usually)\nInfinite combinations of gun systems\nHighly reactive physics\nSuperb combat effects (shell impacts, pieces flying off, etc.)\nAmazingly rewarding for the ones who persist\nGreat graphics (for a Voxel game)\n\nCons:\nHarsh learning curve\nPoor optimization\nPoor multiplayer\nSmall glitches (shouldn't be much of a problem, however)\n\nOverall:\n8/10. Amazing game in my opinion, but it has flaws. Worth the buy for those willing to invest some time into it.","April 19","true","296.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

This is an gem of a game. The building is fluid, and the amount of creations you can make are endless. Be it a barn, battleship, or a battle-balloon you can build it in this game.\n\nConstruction is fluid (sim planes, tool bars, ect all ease building tremendously)\n\nCustomization is endless, your not just designing the chassis or the guns here. Everything from the cannon barrels, to the hull, to the props is of your creation. There's even an editor if you tire of the stock campaign.\n\nThe campaign is a unique feature all on its own.

So far this is the best game I've played in years, Honestly my entire life I've looked for a game with such an easily customizable AI system that's still super in-depth as this one.\n\nDon't get me wrong, however. This game is NOT easy. The controls aren't easy, the mechanics aren't easy, and even the battles aren't easy. This game is more than just a challenge for your reaction skills though. This game is a challenge for your brain. Coming up with new and innovative ways to use the mechanics to make amazing creations for either looks or potency is what is, has, and will always be what separates this game from the others. This game is Minecraft on steroids. If you enjoy being able to build legos with computers that you can program to do pretty much whatever you want, then this game is for you. I would highly recommend even though there is one glaring issue I will address down below.\n\nI'll cut the developer some slack and let any bugs slide for now since it is after all an alpha. The one thing I do have slight issue with however is the framerate. My pc is more than capable of running most games and in smaller engagements I lose slim to no fps. However in the larger battles and even the benchmark it goes and stays around 10-12 fps on the lowest settings. I sincerely hope the dev will have some sort of breakthrough in the code to get more performance out of the larger battles because that's the only thorn in the side of this game right now.\n\nOther than that, I would recommend this to only the more intelligent of my friends. Not to insult anyone's intelligence but unless you're smarter than the average gamer, this game will get on your nerves quickly with all of the mechanics it has available. It can easily overwhelm a newbie or a more casual gamer so take caution, this game is not for the faint of mind.","August 31, 2015","true","210.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

From The Depths is a game about both creativity and efficiency. In order to vanquish your enemies you must build up an automated army of ships and flying vehicles that can fufill it's job as efficiantly as possible. making a wodden boat with a big cannon on the front you let you get by... for a little while, but eventually your opponents will start making truly fearsome vessels, at wich point you must start thinking outside the box and approach things in different ways.\nI could spend litteraly days in the vehicle designer, testing designs, optimising older ones and then pitting them against enemies to see how they perform, so that i can see what i did well and what needs improving.\nThe concept of FTD is what makes this a worthy investment, but you may want to purchase it later on. As is the way of early access games, there are things that are planned, but not in the game yet. Indeed there are quite a few missing features as of writing. There are also performance problems, mainly when huge battles take place, the game can slow to a crawl.\nThe way I see it, if you're gonna buy one early access game, this is a great choise.

Just for being in Pre-Alpha there is an insane amount of content in this, one of my favorite aspects is the custonizable weapons, (custom cannons and missiles). All you can do in this game so far is a few story missions and a campaign where you conquer the map while building better and better ships along the way. Infact, you dont have to build each ship block by block, you can make ships in the editor and save them, then make them in the campaign so long as you have resources for it.\n\nCreativity:\nThis game relies heavily on your own creativity. The better you can imagine something, the better you can make it in-game. Not trying to turn people away here, because there is the workshop where you can look for inspiration for your own creations.\n\nDifficulty:\nThis game can be very challenging when you first start as you can not just build a little raft with a cannon twice the size of the raft and expect it to float (it will sink like a rock, trust me i tried).\nonce you get where you can build the bigger and better stuff later in campaign the bigger and better your ships can/have to be as the AI has better and better ships as you progress.\n\nPerformance:\nI run an okay rig with about 6GB of ram and this game runs nicely, so long as you dont have anything open in the background. With me only having 6GB of RAM it takes almost all when you get into a battle with ships that fire ~4 shells a second. Other than that one small problem It runs nicely.","October 7, 2014","true","105.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

This is done mostly in first-person although there are map overview RTS aspects as well.\n\nFrom the Depths has a lot of, well, depth to its building.  Every aspect of your air/water craft is constructed of essentially minecraft blocks.  Even fuctional aspects, like the engines or weaponry, are contructed of special blocks.  There are several weapon types to build, including two types of naval cannon, missiles and torpedoes, and even lasers, each with relative checks and balances.  There is a ton of customization when it comes to building your fleet, but there is also a big learning curve.  I feel this curve is not insurmountable though.\n\nThere is a strategic campaign where you fight and defeat 8 unique factions for world domination or something.  The forces featured are largely designed by the community.  The campaign can be fairly challenging for a newer player, but it can get very unbalanced later on, as you get an over abundance of resources.\n\nWhile Early Access titles are typically very dubious in value, I find From the Depths trustworthy.  The dev is fairly active on the official forums, and often informs us on what he is working on.  I've owned this game for about six months, and multiple major updates with big features have been released.\n\nOverall, From the Depths is a complex but nonetheless fun and intriguing game in the build-stuff-out-of-blocks genre.","April 8","true","77.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psy_commando/recommended/268650/","psy_commando","Psy_Commando -=SF-O=-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psy_commando/","166 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOut of all the vehicle building games around I played a lot of (Space Engineers, Empyirion Galactic Survival, Starmade) I have to say, this one is my favorite.\n\nYou can do so much!\nAt the time I wrote this review, you could do: Ships, Hydrofoils, Hovercrafts(Well, technically. But there's no hovercraft skirt parts right now, just thrusters and propellers), Submarines(those are a bit trickier to get working AI wise), Aircrafts, Airships, Spacecrafts, Helicopters(Those are tricky to make too), and they just added land vehicles(Still rough around the edges, and not very usable in combat, but some fun can be had with those already).\nOr, you can get creative and just abuse the physic engine to make weird contraptions :B\n\nThe game relies mainly on AI to control the vehicles/structures you build in the game. The AI is still a bit wonky, especially path finding and collision avoidance, but its possible to minimize the problems using long range weapons and spreading your ships around in formations. However, it'll always find a way to use whatever you give it..\nAnother nice thing is that, your creation can be controlled in battle using a strategic map view, which makes things much easier.\n\nManual controls are available, but, right now they're very limited, convoluted, and not very practical for anything that's more than a simple basic ship. And even then, there's some weirdness with it. However, I'm pretty sure the devs are definitely going to fix those in a way or another before release.\n\nThe build mode is probably one of my favorite part of this game. I'm talking about Keyboard mode. Its really efficient and handy most of the time. Most people seems to say it has a high learning curve, but personally I figure it out under 2 hours, after watching the video tutorial. And I usually have issues with different control schemes in games. (Actually, the vehicle steering controls are more confusing than this tbh)\nSure its a bit intimidating at first, but try messing around with it, not building anything serious. Your first ship will probably be a complete piece of junk that keeps sinking on its own, or capsizing but try watching getting started tutorial videos by Irelan gaming for example, you'll understand a lot better how to make things work. Or you can also just spawn ships/vehicles from the campaign and take them apart and see how they managed to make them float/fly/etc and work.\n\nOne thing I love particularly here is the way you can customize almost every system you build with attachements and extensions. Nearly all systems are multi-blocks. And not just in a quantitative way, like Starmade for example(AKA more blocks == more powerful) Building large systems without powerful enough support systems to back them up will yield a pretty innefective system. It'll still work, but you could do better use of your space.\nFor instance, you can build a huge engine, but it'll drink so much fuel at mid and low RPMs compared to several smaller engines that turn on and off to meet demands that you'll get a very fuel hungry design with a very weak spot. And well, there's also overheating to take into account, but its pretty manageable, even though radiators are pretty shoddy right now.\nOf course, you can do that with way more things than just engines! Weapons systems, propellers, etc.. And probably more in the future. You can build canons from the magazine to the tip of the barrels. You assemble each parts together to get the best out of the space you have, while making sure a single shell won't find a way to hit your magazines and blow everything up! And you can customize your shells, build gauss canons, add timed/proximity detonation and a lot more!\n\nThe recent weapon and armor rebalance did a pretty solid job at balancing out the game. AKA you can't sink a big floating metal castle ship armored with 2 to 5m of armor, with an army of tiny ships with 20mm chainloaded AP guns anymore :P\nSome things are still a bit overpowered though, and some things definitely need some work. Namely UI, engine and power mechanics, shields, player weapons, land vehicles, space vehicles and the physics involved with going to space.\n\nBut, from what the devs teased, there's a lot of great improvements coming soon. And even in this state, the game is a ton of fun. Playing the campaign and designing your ships, or refitting any enemy ships you manage to capture, sending massive fleets against an enemy's forces is already tons of fun IMO.\n\nThe devs are overall doing amazing work with this game! They listen to feedback, keeps asking questions and mentioning what they're working on in the forums, and release patches and content regularly.

You've successfully descended into the world of niche titles. Unlike most others from this category, this is an amazing game. Buy it now.\n\nNot enough juicy, succulent review meat for your tastes? Then let me lead for you.\n\nThis game is unlike anything I've ever seen before. Seriously, the team of two devs (I think there are only two, they're the only two I've heard about) is a wonder duo, one specializing in PR (Her name is Elizabeth, she gave me this game free!) and one for the game (Nick, he updates his game almost daily!). The game focuses (obviously) on the construction (and following demolition) of massive...whatever-you-wants, basically. You can make trains, planes, ships, spaceships(!), orbital cannons, you name it. You can even do stuff like  this . You really don't have a set goal, the play style reminds me somewhat of Minecraft. The game can fit to your personal fetishes, in my case spaceships. You're probably saying "Meh'" and moving on. Wait! You haven't even seen the best part.  You can completely customize your systems, including but not limited to: AI Mainframes (autotargeting and performing of customized if/then statements), Engines (focusing on either insane fuel-gulping power or fuel conservation, or a balance), Cannons (you can change ammo types, barrel  length  for increased accuracy, determine whether it's a one shot explosion or an 18 shot salvo), shields (whether focusing on a wide area with weaker deflecting, or a smaller shield capable of deflecting the strongest explosions), and even targeting system priority (for AI mainframe). Nick says he's soon gonna implement something From the Depths players have been waiting eagerly for a long time: Sea Monsters. This inspired the name of this game: From the Depths (just think here for a second)! Imagine battles like this but instead of fighting massive battleships, we will fight sea monsters! As of right now, this game is mainly focused on single player. Multiplayer exists but only comprises of simulating a battle between two ships, you can't control it (but that IS planned). Suprisingly, there actually is a campaign, but I haven't experimented with that yet. I only have minor qualms about this game-NUMBER ONE ON MY LIST IS THAT JETPACK. Seriously, that jetpack. Many times have I tried to keep up with one of my creations before it takes off, but stopped an  inch before I got to the ledge because of that jetpack. Could we at least get a noclip? Another thing: we need to be able to move a group of blocks (regardless if it's our creation or not). Last thing: we need MOAR documentation for the engines, AI, and other systems. I still haven't mastered them.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic game. I highly recommend this to all of my friends, and to all you guys out there. Please give this adorable little game a chance in the big mean world of Steam. I wish the best to all you guys out there that play this game and to the Little Dev Team that made this little slice of history.\n\nStay frosty, y'all.\n10/10","October 15, 2014","true","98.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","1"

The creative potential in this game is amazing, really humbling to see what other people have come up with. Controls take a while to figure out and putting together components such as cannons and engines can be tricky but rewarding at the same time, especially when your creations are battle tested in the campaign.

Always wanted your boat to have guns? Wanted guns in Minecraft? This game is for you.\n\nPros\n- This game is absolutely amazing, the amount fo customization for Early Access imrepssed me and hooked me, and the water and ship graphics are very pretty\n- You "feel" the power in your weapons when the destroy an enemy ship or aircraft.\n-The single player campaign is very fun, you get to take on  diverse factions. I've spent about 60 hours in one and finally took out the first one.\n- The AI layouts and LUA scripting do a good portion of the work for you in many aspects once you get them down. ( Isn't smart enough for LUA scripting, so that's still getting figured out. )\n- The guns? The "cannons"? You have your way with them and you can create an EIGHT BARREL CANNON, and just obliterate enemies with those.\n- The missles are hugely customizable, just add lots of missle blocks and you got some serious firepower there.\n- The engines, while complex, 'sound' like they give you lots of power. You'll get the hang of it quickly, take a look at the example in the Prefab section, and you got it.\n- Haven't even "touched" the multiplayer, but I've heard nothign but good things, while buggy, works fine and there's CO-OP. WHO DOESN'T LIIKE CO-OP DESTRUCTION? (This is Early Access, so of course it's gonna have bugs, so duuuuuh.)\n\nCons\n\n- It's early access. This is an Early Access game. This is buggy, it's getting worked on. Don't like it? Go blow up stuff in another game.\n- It does slow down when you have lots of blocks, so you'll need a decent computer.\n- Does tend to crash a lot. ( IT'S EARLY ACCESS, THIS IS NOT SURPRISING )\n- Does tend to freeze here and there when loading a crap ton of blocks. ( Like my massive warship of over 30,000 blocks and it's 5 fighter jets of about 15,000 blocks altogether, but again, this is probably gonna get fixed. )\n\nConclusion\n\nThat's pretty much it. This game is amazing, I bought it a couple weeks ago and already have about 100 hours into it. it 'is' absolutely worth the 20 bucks if you want a complex, gun-toting, seafaring, explosive, "massive" minecraft from AWESOMEVILLE. ?While it has it's faults, you'll see from my comparisons, they are vastly outweighed by what it has to offer. Take some time to look at the controls, the tutorials -totally didn't do this part, but I had lots of fun figuring it out on my own-, and get to builidng your ships, yours gun, and claim those resource points!","October 10, 2015","true","155.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

A solid game here even in this stage of development, fun mechanics, easy to learn design system, resource based consructions and real time damage on a block by block basis. Careful and clever design is key to making a solid ship/sub/plane/spaceship, build your ammo storage with too little armour and you'll get a spectacular explosion if you're hit in that area. You can customise missiles to be armour piercing to punch through like a needle or use high explosive to cause damage over a wide area, or even somewhere inbetween. You can make custom cannon turrets too, want dozens of tiny barrels firing like a shotgun or a mammoth cannon that takes 2 whole minutes to reload? Why not build 2 mammoth cannons bolted together?!\n\nThis is one of the best games i've played in a while, and new features, tweaks and mechanics are in the works making this a title that just keeps delivering.\n\nSolid 9.75/10!!!!","October 25, 2014","true","115.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It's hard not to reccomend with a fully realized resource system, single-player campaign, regular updates, and a truly bewildering array of components that puts Space Engineers to shame. That said, it's also hard to reccomend this game, at least solidly, due to the many technical limitations.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm aware that it's incomplete and that work hasn't been finished and that, given the track record so far coupled with my own personal (if limited) interactions with the developer, it's very likely that this WILL see a final release. That said, you can'y play it right on anything beyond a dedicated gaming rig. The preveiws would have you believe that it's a game that's filled with epic clashed on the sea, in the sky, and among the heavens beyond... AND IT IS! But... they can only be realized by machines that can handle that sort of thing, and since (as of yet) the game still runs on 32-bit, so no one on a moderately powerful lappy willl likely ever see them.\n\nHowever! For those with machines that can run this game without slow-down or imcomplete fleet pop-in? It's a fantastic experience. Skies choked with missiles, the sea churning with explosions, blocks flying in every direction, lasers burning through armor, shields deflecting exploding shells. Guns, lasers, missiles, torpedoes, mines, aircraft, ballooncraft, ships of every description, AND WOODEN SPACE SHIPS! Incredible battles with meticulously crafted vehicles, where unprecedented customization finally passes the barrier of mere "customization in games" and actually becomes ENGINEERING.\n\nSo, I have trouble recommending this game because not everyone can enjoy it as it should be enjoyed. But for those who can... get it. Get it now.

I've owned the game for a very long time but never bothered to play the campaign since it confused me at the time. Well, i started playing it recently and know how to work most of the HUD in the campaign. this is my story of my struggle against the deep water guard.\n\nI started off int he starting base doing the usual. Making the crappy engine much more efficient, armoring up the supply room, etc etc. well i decided to take my huskie ( my fast scouting ship ) out to find some deep water guard. i unfortunately  ran into their main force near the resource zone and tried to retreat. I failed and my huskie was a goner. i knew they would send that force to me so i build a rocket launcher that held 8 laser guided rockets and waited. Thankfully they only sent one plane and my rockets quickly dealt with it. I had more confidence and decided to build a semi expensive ( crystal wise) ship that i knew would help. I eventually built up a 6 ship fleet and decided to bring the fight to them. Short story short, i got slaughtered. i only had enough resources to build 2 ships. My small rocket plane and my rocket cruiser. i decided i would build another huskie and go scout some place since i had nothing else to do. ( i grabbed the resource zone that i mentioned earlier) i found 3 ships. They had a plunderer and 2 atlases coming for me. i decided  to lure them to my base and they destroyed both my fortresses. i reloaded my last save and decided to try taking out the plunder by destroying the ammo barrels. i rode my huskie into battle with a overpowering determination and i boarded the plunderer. i quickly punched my way to the core and destroyed it. i cheered in triumph and noticed my repair tentacles were repairing the ship, i panicked and checked the map only to realize that i captured the ship. I laughed and realized the ships gun systems were down till the core i destroyed came back to repair. i noticed the ship had plenty of repair bots and decided to man the guns myself till they were repaired. i started shooting the atlases with little affect. things were looking bad, with the ship being constantly hit by the atlases i thought i was doomed. Then, all of a sudden all the guns pointed the enemy balloon crafts and blew them out of the sky with little effort. i rode my newly captured ship back to base in excitement and knew, that the tides have turned against  the deep water guard.\n\n100/10. ill never regret buying this game.","May 29, 2015","true","175.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","2"

Ever. I write this as my first decent attempt at a campaign fortress is slowly being ripped appart by the AI after disabling my weapons systems. I'm not even angry - just impressed that there is so much depth in this sandbox/strategy/vehicle builder game. Block by block construction is both simple and leads to intricate detail possibilities for construction. I agree with other reviews - research & planning is essential for this game if you want to enjoy it - and ends up being part of the fun.\n\nThere are numerous strategies that can be employed for the fleet & ship based fights - naval & air vehicles need to be allow for in this game. It lends itself toward letting the AI do everything in controlling ships/weapons however it is possible for the player to use both. I haven't tested out the fleet systems properly yet but going by the AI it looks to work fantastic - seriously the AI kicked my where it hurts with a pincer movement - then from above- seriously who attacks you from directly above????\n\nAny lack of documentation is made up for by an incredibly supportive and involved community - the developer has obviously gone to much lengths to ensure that all learning styles are accounted for.\n\nReplayability:\n*If you are like me and love tweaking those designs just that *little bit more* and getting satisfaction from a good system, I can see it proving hours and hours of additional time.\n\n*The current campaign is great for getting a feel for construction techniques and tactics to use in your own creations\n*Not really a story based game - but why would you think that is what you are playing for\n\nPros\n*Lasers\n*Really, really big guns\n*Customisable missile systems\n*Smart/programable systems - seriously takes hours just to scratch the surface.\n*Amazing tactical/strategic possibilities - I have not seen a game I would rate higher in this regard (I would love to see some tutorials on the map systems & maybe some more depth on campaign for this reason)\n*Very customisable interface\n\nCons:\n*Steep learning curve\n*Requires a level of sophisication & engineering mindset to truly appreciate it. (Think minecraft bashing creeps with a sword to using automated traps to farm them) Not truly a con but may be a consideration for gifting.\n*Some of the interfaces such as battle seem buggy (the intent is well documented but can be confusing when starting up)\n**Very customisable interface - makes it difficult to remember what key map to press for certain situations (take this as an advisement if considering how much time you want to invest rather than a con.\n\nWell recommended and cannot see what comes next as it develops.

It is not just a pick up and play sort of game.\n\nThere are negatives naturally, the story mode isn't much good and with the game constantly being updated/developed, it does have stability issues. Nothing that wont be fixed in due course naturally.\n\nIn conclusion for this short review, I rate it 4 stars out of five, a great game to lose yourself in for a couple of hours.","November 2, 2015","true","107.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Yeah, this has a learning wall.\n\nIt's an incredibly hard game to get your head around. I strongly recommend watching an LP or lots of YT tutorials(TheBudkai's was good for me, although S1 will be very outdated now) if you want to play it.\n\nOnce you understand this game, it's amazing. Gameplay is very rewarding, especially watching your designs destroy (or get destroyed by) your enemies' designs. Building vehicles, their defenses, their propulsion, their weapons, is extremely in-depth.\n\nIt's pretty poorly optimized, but there should be an optimization update coming up soon according to the main dev. You need a good CPU to play, especially when you get further into the campaign. There's also lots of crashes (surprisingly few bugs considering the speed updates are churned out and the EA state), so make sure to save a lot.\n\nThe dev team are incredibly active, and clearly have an idea how the game will pan out.\n\nHonestly, the biggest con is that you'll probably end up on the NSA's watchlist for googling so much about military weaponry.","January 4","true","383.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a ♥♥♥♥ing game." But aside from that, Here are some Pro's and Cons from me playing this.\n\nPros\n-----\n- Amazing AI fights, if your AI is set up correctly for each ship/plane\n- Easy to start building, if you have a good imagination. (I don't but this game helps me.)\n- Good basic tutorials to show you all the basics of this game, learn by playing is how i prefer to do it though.\n- Helpful Community. Nearly everyone on the disscussions page of this game helps you out if you have a problem. Some may be basic questions that are not stated in game yet, some may be pretty hard. So very helpful community.\n\nCons\n-----\n- No dedicated servers. If you would like to play this game with a friend that lives in another state or something along those lines, prepare for you or your friend to get lag. Very bad lag at that. But this game is made mainly for Single-player, but MUCH more fun with a friend.\n\n- Some of the mechanics in the game, such as making a plane or a submarine that works well can be hard to do. But as i stated above the disscussions forum on steam for this game is a great place.\n\n\n\nIf i have to give a solid rating for this game, all i can say is 10/10. Even with the cons such as somewhat hard to learn, are beaten by how fun the building and Battles this game has. I would definetly recommend this game to anyone who has patience, and is willing to learn how to play a game instead of trying to rush everything.","March 5","true","120.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Minecraft) and want a bigger focus on PVP then this game is for you. Much deeper and customize-able than games like Robocraft. While this game does have a fairly steep learning curve and Youtube tutorial videos are practically mandatory for some of the more complex designs like setting up your own AI control of your ships and building custom weapons once you get the hang of it the game is a blast. Anything from submarines, planes, and even space ships are possible in this game.\n\nThere are some features that really make this game stand out to me that I haven't seen done anywhere else like being able to design your own custom weapons and setup your own AI to control your individual ship or even your fleet. While there is a "simple weapons" tab which includes prebuilt weapons like small and heavy cannons, a missile and torpedo launcher, and ramming weapons like rams and drills the real meat and potatoes is the Custom Cannons, Custom missiles/torpedoes, and laser weapons. Simple weapons work fine early on against smaller ships made of wood but don;t have the versatility or sheer damage custom weapons are capable of.\n\nCustom weapons aren't simply placed on a ship but have to be built using individual components. For example to build a cannon you start with the firing piece. Then you can add different types of barrels (recoil reduction, flash suppressed, etc) and can add a component which increases the barrel gauge. Then you can add components like ammo crates, armor pen and explosive shells, autoloaders that speed up firing, shot predictors, etc. These components all modify the weapon in certain ways like accuracy, range, and dps. Custom missiles are built differently but the core idea still applies and same goes for the laser weapons.\n\nAt this point you have a great game where you can build some pretty awesome combat vehicles but they didn't stop there.\nThe feature that makes this game stand above most other voxel style games is the ability to create your own AI for your ships. Using an AI mainframe and a selection of different cards like target prioritization and Naval AI you can program your entire fleet or just individual ships to act autonomously within the rules you set for the ship. If you have a long range missile boat you could set it to try to stay within a certain range from its target. These are just the most basic AI functions and can get very deep and complicated depending on the design. This means not only can you create an entire fleet of ships with AI, but you can create an enemy fleet using AI to do battle against. Campaign and story missions do a good job of showing this off in single player.\n\nMultiplayer is planned and the option is in game but is currently not implemented but should be soon.","August 20, 2014","true","666.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","9"

Just epic.\n\nI tend to shy away from Early Access nowadays, given the recent disappointments like Starforge or Towns, but this definitely hit the sweet spot of EA.\n\nThe sheer scope of the premise, given with the activity and apparent competence level of the developer made this pretty much an instant buy. It also has a pretty good AI (one that even the player can use, too), so it offers a ton of replayability already. A campaign with resource gathering, diplomacy, hell even a working RPG system with levelups are there to tamper around with. Didn't even factor in things like multiplayer or co-op, which are still pretty much a work in progress.\n\nAlso, the physics are pretty nice. Recoil has an actual impact, parts breaking off of your vessel can make you lose control, and weight will make you sink to the bottom of the ocean, whereas airtight compartments on a metal ship will keep you afloat, unless breached and flooded with water.\n\n\nIf you like Kerbal Space Program or Starmade, or if you like the big, humming multiblock machines of certain Minecraft mods, you're probably going to love the hell out of this. Oh yeah, there's space, too. Orbital cannons raining down fiery death on submarines are possible and encouraged. And don't worry, the graphics are going to get an overhaul, too.

It is the perfect blend of all my favorite sandbox games. However, it is very complex, from designing your very own engine, to getting the thrust to weight ratio perfect, all the way to creating artifficial intelligence to control your weapons that you created.\n\nPros:\n\nThere is so much variety in this game, anything you want to do, you can.\nAmple amounts of tutorials are at your fingertips, as a beginner I had no troubles learning how everything worked.\nFor an alpha game, it is suprising how optimized it is. I have not dropped below 60 fps once, even with large vehicle battles surrounding me.\nYou can create any sized vehicle as long as you design it correctly. From 4 x 4 rafts, to 300+ x 300+ Airships.\nAll of the controls and graphics are 100% customizable, so you can have the perfect game experience.\nThe developers have been great at constantly updating this game, I am certain this won't be the same "sell & run" experience that we get with so many early access games. (DayZ, 7 Days to Die, etc.)\n\nCons:\n\nThe multiplayer is not yet developed, but the developers say they will be coming out with a fully functional multiplayer.\nTo the faint of heart, the building system might be difficult to understand.\n\nDo not let the complicated mechanics of this game get you down, this is a near perfect game for me, and it has only been out for around a single month. Give this game a shot, for $20 you can't get anything better.\n\nFinal Rating: 9/10\nNote: This will be 10/10 with the finished multiplayer.","August 11, 2014","true","25.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Have you ever thought Kerbals were too peaceful? Have you ever wanted to design a plane that used cannons as a means of movement? Me neither, but in From the Depths, YOU CAN!\n\nFrom the Depths is a sandbox physics game with some rts elements thrown in for good measure. Build a ship, watch it sink. Build a better ship, one that moves! ....Then watch it get blown up. Build a gun, then build a ship around it! This is, in essence, what FtD is all aboot.\n\nIn career mode you can take your designs and put them to the test. Capture resource nodes, battle pirates, and build your empire. Switch from game view to map view and position your fleet. Instead of rolling the dice when two ships meet, go back into physics mode and battle your enemy head on. You can manually control your vehicles and bases, or you can use the modular AI pieces and build an AI to do it for you.\n\nSpeaking of modular, this game features modular engines, cannons, lasers, missiles, etc. Instead of placing a gun block where you want a gun, you can build your cannon from many modules that altar how the gun works. Range, reload time, damage, armor penetration, explosive rounds, accuracy, etc.","November 20, 2014","true","43.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Sure, it isn't a finished product, but you can build stuff, and then customize the heck out of whatever you just built, and then build on your customizations with further modifications. I like games that allow you this kind of freedom. It's the type of game that says you can have as many guns, and as much armor as you like. You'd better be prepared to have your hopes and dreams dashed if it's poorly set up, however. Oh, I haven't mentioned the developer yet.

The difference being it is heavily focused on combat and fleets of units rather than a single craft. It has a steep learning curve so it can be daunting at first although there are quite a few videos and guides out there to help you on the more complicated things. The satisfaction from getting your fleet afloat and firing a hail of cannon shells and missile streaking towards the enemy is akin to glee as you watch the enemy fleet explode into little bits.\n\nSomewhere between a simulator, rts and a fps all rolled into one, its not for everyone, but for those with a creative streak its a highly addictive mix. For those with less patience they can always use the vehicles created by others from the workshop or FTD forums to get straight into the action.\n\nOnce the co-op campaign is finished I doubt there will be any other game I'd rather play than From The Depths for a long time","September 24, 2014","true","396.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Build your units block by block if you want to.  Build your resource collecting block by block too.  Build engines and tinker how many cylinders, how many crankshaft sections, where to place carberators, more suerchargers or more local fuel tanks etc.  Listen as the torque capacity goes up and the RPMs go down!\n\nWarning: The learning curve is rather large.  There are still non-intuitive parts of the interface.  For example, if you try to put a gun together, you might have components that aren't contributing anything just because of where they are placed, and I'm still learning to master these nuances.  Looking at a block shows whether it's connected, but it doesn't glow or somehow make it more obvious at a glance - you have to double check.\n\nSame for engines - it's a balancing act swapping out a supercharger for a fuel tank to see if the power capacity goes up in unforseeable ways.  Maybe eventually this will all make sense (like an "aha!  that's because there was only 1 carberator there and not 2!") - but right now for me it's all very mysterious and fun.  :)\n\nAnother Warning:\n\nThe build mode also has a concept of what is being editted, which isn't clarified by the tutorials that I had gone through, so if you want to change a gun in the middle of changing the ship, I was scratching my head why it wouldn't let me place blocks for the longest time before it made sense.\n\nI'm sure I have not fathomed everything possible in this game, but it is meting out a great feeling of satisfaction discovering all it has to offer.\n\n--- FINAL WARNING ----\nThe game really does move heavily in the direction of "serious games".  These are games which try to simulate real world problems.  You can program Lua scripts in FTD, and you may want to, if you have that sort of time at your disposal.  Personally, I start to wonder if I couldn't be spending my time better programming in the real world, rather than in the game....  your mileage may vary.  :)  Chin up!\n\nAlso have a look at the very detailed models available in the workshop.  There are 1:1 ratio replicas of historical battleships and ...  lots more.","August 19, 2015","true","22.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I regret that now.\n\nThe time willingly put into playing this game makes up for the price paid. Therefor I know that players who enjoy constructing war machines of all kinds will enjoy this. So far the ship I've made floats and is agile after the second construction - that's more than can be said for the 20+ flight tests you go through on Kerbal Space Programme. It functions, and in that sense it isn't hard.\n\nI simply wish the learning curve wasn't as steep in other ways. For example, I still don't really understand the mechanics behind custom cannons and other complexset-ups, even with tutorials. This could be on account of my own stupidity, but in a way I would prefer simpler options that produce the same results or at least a simple pictorial diagram of a simple, working set-up (like my dads old haynes manuals from the 90's - for the primitive man).","April 26","true","40.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It stands alone as a brilliant game in a very different genre.  If you ever enjoyed building legos as a child, you need this game.  If you ever loved designing ships in Master of Orion, you need this game.  Imagine if your built something with legos, programmed it, and then it began shooting at other legos, built by other people.\n\nThe AI shines in this game.  I would never fire my own guns, though I have the option to, as the AI is simply a better shot.  Countless games that allow massive creative freedom lack any sort of 'challenge'.  Not so in FtD.  Enemy designs are hugely varied and hugely dangerous.  This game provides 4 singleplayer campaigns, resource limits and gathering, and multiple faction that can battle each other.  Designing a single turret can be very satisfying, and there is a lot of skill that goes into designing ships that are effective.\n\nDid I mention that you can build submarines, planes, functional helicopters, and even spacecraft?  And your spacecraft can shoot at planetbased targets?\n\nNow, the game is good, it's entirely worth the full cost, but it is alpha.  It's a very complete alpha, but there is clearly polishing still to do.  Optimization and balancing is needed, though the game is very playable and very fun currently.  Shield generators are OP at the moment, for example.  I am incredibly pleased to have bought this game, and I hope to see more people buying it, and a wonderful future for it.\n\nThe ships are both durable and fragile at times, with armor and materials playing a very realistic role.  Ships can be blown in half, but they can also take 10 minutes of solid pounding.  Everything is built into the game.  If a shell hits your ammo stores, it can gut the ship, or it can do very little if you designed to prevent a chain reaction.  Everything has tradeoffs.  The very AI that controls your ships is built on your ships, and pieces of it can be blown up.\n\nUnlike most early access games, this game would be worth the price even if it there was never another update.  I would be very sad if that happened, but I wouldn't want a refund, because I'd still want to be playing the game.  I can give no higher praise.","March 29","true","169.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Although the game's genre is focused on naval battles, you can build ground vehicles if you so wish. You can create various weaponry for different roles: Flak cannons for your battleships; CRAM cannons for your artillery; or LUA-guided missiles for Air-to-Air, Air-to-Ground or vice-versa. There are wheel blocks for land-based vehicles, but they are highly neglected, and I hope they are worked on soon; as you can create some stunning tanks with various shell types that will surely catch the interests of many War Thunder players, such as myself.\n\nPros:\nA vast selection of parts ranging from lightweight metal alloys and ERA armour to LUA script for AI mainframes and various cannon types for both beginners and professionals.\nStable multiplayer capability, although some bugs should be ironed out, such as the lack of Prefabs and host-only barrel-number selection for advanced cannons.\n\nCons:\nYou need a good graphics card to run this game over 30 fps at 1080p. I had around 15 on 720p with my old GT 620 (came with my prebuilt computer), now I get 60fps on 1080p at high.\n\nAll-in-all a fun build game for Land, Air, and Naval vehicles.","April 17","true","40.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This is a kind of game where you can show off your skill and power to your friends because you put in the time and effort to master the game. If you are a lazy person who likes playing games like Call of Duty just because they are easy, don't get this game. The game itself is a pretty interesting sandbox game where you can build ships, fortresses, planes, and even land vehicles. Most of the game revolves around the ships (hence the name, From the Depths) which all have main components like engines, propellers, rudders, AI cores, weapons systems, and etc. Each of these components will need to be learned individually and will function together to make your ship. The game allows for a lot of customization with its parts.  I think that this game really shows what you can be capable from learning from a game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested.\n\n-TheNileCroc07\n\n[EDIT] By the way, the achievement of completing the first tutorial is broken for me.

The learning curve is like getting hit in the face with a bowling ball. If you are going to buy the game prepare to do countless hours of research on how to play the game.\n\nThe game itself has one simple objective, destroy the opposition; Simple right? Well it is if you know how to construct might war ships and planes whilst also keeping an eye out for enemy fleets and keeping an eye on your own. Distrubuting resources left right and centre and all sorts of multitasking that I cannot perform because I'm just simple minded.\n\nBut if you know how to play your cards, and can learn the fundementals quickly then you're going to have 100s of hours of just pure fun bombarding with every missile, cannon and railgun you can muster. At the end of the day its just another war game but in my view it is one that stands out above every other war game because of just how unique it is.\n\nI could go on explaining the pros the cons and every detail inbetween but I think I've said enough to show how good it is.\n\n10 Kitkats out of 10\n","January 31","true","78.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It may appear at beginning this game is difficult to handle, but once you get into it, it is so much fun. There is plenty of tutorials available for new and old comer, on the official forum http://fromthedepthsgame.com/forum/ on Youtube, Steam and what is interesting, in game itself.\n\nSo what you can do? Well actually A-Lot...\n1. You can play in creative mode, building your own designs, structures, fortress, vehicles (submarines, naval ships, air ships, space ships, or any of mix of them and more)\n2. You can play campaign, fight against AI driven factions (player made vehicles), in form of RTS, or/and FPS, while you can develop your own designs and forces, as long you got enough resources.\n3. Test your own designs against your, or other players' designs.\n4. Making your designs to behave, as desired, which may be challenging.\n5. Design your own weapon systems, both offensive and defensive.\n6. Setup your vehicles and weapon system AI behaviours.\n7. Experiment with anything, you got access to.\n8. Making "block" art.\n9. And whatever else your imagination allow to ..\n10. Download and share your designs with the community, on Steam and main forum.\n11. Share and gain experience with community\n12. Join player hosted tournaments and test your secret design against other contestants. Results are tend to be uploaded to youtube. For example by TheBudkai, but not only (youtube channel) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmkTaK7E7RJouOrgdGANTTna-_5J6fVYL\n13. On main forum, players opinion really matter. Players have great input, in which games is getting developed. Bugs are dealt very quickly.\n\nAt some point you may face you know all, when suddenly facing enemy, with stuff, which you are never thought of. Then you may realise, you are barely hit iceberg tip of FTD possibilities :)\n\nSo what more about my own experience? Oh well, I love this game, since I have gotten it in Feb 2014. Since then FTD is still in Early Access, so it is something to keep in mind. But this means, it is constantly changing, adding more and more fascinating features. Always something new to learn. Cannot get bored, if such games is what you are looking for. I play mainly creative mode, testing game's possibilities, my imaginations  and applying my childhood dreams :)\nExamples http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998578301/myworkshopfiles/\n\nSo what you may need to be aware of, before getting in FTD?\n1. High learning curve is expected. 2 hours of play, will not give you full FTD experience.\n2. Imagination is your main limitation.\n3. I know many players wait for player vs player battles, but unfortunately multiplayer is disabled atm., as it is completely reworked at the current, to handle players better. It will be possible to run also multiplayer campaign, which sound really cool. I have been running few multiplayer events, before this mode has been disabled and they were so much fun, with smaller and bigger vehicles. Some example is here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQOlUmvjmLc\nI am waiting, like you may also do, for multi return. This should be soon I hope, with much greater possibilities :)\n4. Unfortunately, bigger designs and battles, require better PC. So don't expect Bismarck, or Yamato ships run smooth on the low end machine. But running smaller battles, with smaller vehicles run smooth and they can be so much fun. So you don't need high spec machine to enjoy FTD.\n\nAnd there is much more cool things, I can not think about now and I could write ...","June 14, 2015","true","715.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Early access done right.\n\nFrom the Depths, despite its blocky appearance, is a startlingly original game. From the construction features to the customizable combat AI, almost everything in From the Depths is innovative, exciting, and easy to use. In practice, many games in the construction genre tend to fall flat in certain areas. Unlike these, From the Depths is already well optimized, intuitive, and fun. From the Depths construction mechanic is unique, allowing extremely complex ideas to be easily realized. Unlike space engineers and many similar construction games, FTD's construction system is fluid, polished, and robust. Creating complex vehicles such as airships and battleships is easy enough- play the game, familiarize yourself with the mechanics, and boom! There you have it. That's all the experience you need to build something cool in From the Depths. Building something that works really well, however, is more difficult. The good news is, you'll never runout of ideas because From the Depth's extremely in-depth armor and weapons mechanics allow for hundreds of viable strategies.  Hollow armor designed to absorb enemy damage and insulate the core systems? Check. A floating reactor, relying on its powerful shields to rain death from above? Check. A wooden sailboat? Check. Several hundred wooden sailboats? Double check. Combat itself is no less impressive. The AI works surprisingly well out of the box. Because vehicles in From the Depths rely on many individual systems to continue working, combat in From the Depths is always dynamic and interesting. Aircraft usually rely on their speed to outrun danger, casting their lot on large engines and light armor. Landing a hit on an aircraft's jets is often enough to send them into a tailspin. Knock out the engines, and the battle's already won. Target a craft's radar and sensors, and leave a battleship blind. If you're brave enough, it's possible to go one step further and knock out a ship's master AI control. Target the propellers with torpedoes, and leave your enemies paralyzed. The possibilities are quite literally endless. When played In first person, From the Depths can become a fantastic roll-playing game. Ignoring the campaign, From the Depths is a fantastic sandbox. Ignoring the construction, From the Depths is a damn good action-RPG.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get across here is that From the Depths is fun. Like, really fun. Everything works, and the price is right.\nDo yourself a favor and buy it.","August 14, 2014","true","89.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

(As Nick, The Awesome dev behind this marvel, Moved it to Steam)\nThe Amazing thing about this game is there are HUNDREDS of blocks and modules, each with there respective purpose and resource cost. This makes me willing to spend countless hours creating the most efficient design possible.\nBut Alas, Not one design can be all that. So I'm forced to create many vehicles each with an intended role. I have A bomber, An oil drill ship, A mining and salvage drillship, An anti air patrol craft and most of all my personal fleet of war machines with my signature command battlecruiser.\nInterestingly enough it is just as fun building the ships as pioleting them as you have to endure trials where you realize "Oh god noooooooooooooo......."  if you happened to forget an engine on your tiny attack fighter and "HOLY SH** THATS AWESOME" If you were lucky enough to discover a great use for the many components. I often find myself loading up vehicles that were made by other players just to test how well my design would hold up.\nAll in all the main attactivness of the game is theres no one to tell you what to do, Build whatever you wan't It dosn't matter if its not combat effective, The pure graphics and construction alone can inspire great awe. (As The giant chicken somone made did for me)\n\nSo if you have a spare $20, and a steam account then this game is perfect for you\nIf you don't have $20 then its still perfect you just need to save up :P","September 3, 2014","true","470.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It has ridiculous customization, so you could if you wanted to, have a giant boat that looks like a sheep fighting a submarine that looks like pikatchu that spawns miniature goat subs.\n\nThe campaigns people make can provide a challenge, too. Don't get too mad if it crashes... it does that alot.\nFrom the Depths has a very friendly community. In all the time I've been on the forums, very few arguments really arose... and most of them were really stupid. They will usually help out with a problem that you have... unless they really can't figure what you did.\n\nThis may sound like me rambling on, but don't just sit there, questioning your life, and if you should buy the game. Do what Shia Labeouf would want, "Just Do It!"    Not sorry at all.\n\nIt is a really rewarding game if you can be patient and can learn. (There are people who just hate this game to hate it. Seriously, look past the flaws. There aren't many developers for this game. If I remember correctly, some of the community members work on the game too.)\n\nThis is getting a little long... well, boohoo.

If you DO go looking for things to do, you'll find that there are, in fact, meaningful things to do with your creations, such as:\n\n- Entering them into a tournament;\n- Playing through the campaign using them;\n- Playing through the story missions using them;\n- Creating a custom campaign filled with them.\n\nNot to mention the possibility of creating custom LUA AI code for the vehicles you make. There's potential for hundreds, no, thousands of hours of fun here. For only 20 euros at the time of writing, that's a much better deal than a thousand hours of film, a thousand hours of lecture/literature, a thousand hours of other games... you name it.\n\nOf course, to get so much out of the game, you'll need to do some work yourself, too. Not only will you have to look for things to do (tournaments, custom campaigns, etc.), but you will also have to learn to play the game. I must warn you: learning to create all the possible vehicle types and making them work well took me a good 200 hours, if not more. This means you have to be prepared to learn. And by learning, I mean learning through trial and error.\n\nThe learning experience, however, is fun. That alone would be enough of a reason to recommend this game, but the best part of the game very definitely is this: building your creations, of whatever kind you choose*, for whatever purpose you choose**, at whatever time you choose: there's a great deal of freedom and a lot to do here.\n\n*Submarines, boats, helicopters, airplanes, hovercraft, spacecraft, fortresses, hydrofoil surface-skimmers, completely unrealistic flying behemoths, land vehicles with jet engines because wheels don't work yet...\n\n**The campaign, story missions, custom campaigns, tournaments...","March 27","true","439.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is for sure complex when first starting out on it and it has a large learning curve, but once it is mastered, it is a hella lot of fun. Basics of it is building your own vehicle, such as a boat, airship, plane, submarine, almost anything you want and then it gets raided by AI armies. Another great feature is that you can build your own cannons/turrets and customize them however you want. You can make it deal massive amounts of damage or have a crazy firing speed. It is so amazing how you can create such a variety of things from just a single block. I 100% recommend this game to those with a creative mind and are looking for loads of fun!\n\n---EDITED:\n\nPLEASE FIX ALL THE BUGS IT IS DRIVNG ME INSANE","August 15, 2015","true","121.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its fun, creative,interesting.  it still has some content to come, but in terms of current content, this game really does have some serious replay value. I've owned the game for a little while, and i will admit, most people will find the game every difficult at first, but after a while you can slowly get used to the complex mechanics and parts involved when building in from the depths.\n\nBuilding boats is surprisingly easy, as in, a slow , small, lightly armoured, lightly armed cruiser. But as you play you can really build glorious things. Im now starting to make space platforms, and slightly more advanced vehicles.\n\n\nWeapons\nAlas, some of my favourite parts of from the depths. Unlike most games on the market, you engineer your own weapons of destruction using complex and simple tools. Simple weapons are for those just starting, already made, work normally, all you need is ammo and some space, then you can branch out. Cram cannons are surprisingly simple for how powerful they are. launch explosive 50 pound shells, or build a piercing machine gun. Missiles, pretty much do what it says on the tin, plus a bit of what seeking and some fancy tricks. lasers, helpful for more than mayhem, anti-ballistic properties.\nadvanced cannons, for , i quote "experienced people with too much time on their hands".\n\nperformance\nit dosen't lag unless your doing something really bad. movement is smooth, so on.Not much else to say.\n\n\nSummary\nThis game is cheap, fun, open ended, imaginative and generally a fun experience for everyone.\nHowever, the in game tutorials on various blocks aren't great, its time consuming, On all game modes( non creative) its difficult, its very difficult to use certain parts in general. However if the campaign is hard, you can always sneakily change the price of a few objects in there in-built modding tools!

This means there are bugs and not polished. But the gameplay is there and it does work.\nThe game is regualrly updated and the Dev is responsive to players comments and issues as long as he knows there is an issue.\nThe biggest tip I could give anyone is get on the officail forums and you will find a community willing to help and responsive to any issues you may have. If you don't tell anyone about tyour problems don't moan when they don't get fixed for you.\n\nOverall the building of ships with a physics implementation is a great idea and means that some very complex designs can be built by players. Then being able to pit that design against other peoples or the game created design makes you feel fabulous when your designs win.\n\nCheckout the varoious youtube videos on this game for tutorials and helpful hints.\n\nMy own Video review of this game is below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDDIdSwOqqI\n","June 15, 2015","true","430.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Currently one of my favorites. The learning curve is incredibly difficult and even after 200+ hours i still struggle with making effective aircraft and airships but this is also what makes this game good as there is still something you can learn after so many hours. The advanced cannons are amazing once you figure them out and with the planned updates the developer has I feel they will be quite balanced. The developer is incredibly commited and squashing bugs that are posted on the forums in matter of days. The community in my experience is also very positive and offers tips without putting your designs down. The AI to start with is incredibly easy to use and understand to make your ships work and then with the introduction of lua and PID controllers if you know what your doing you can make them more effective.\n\nIf you pick up this game, expect to put time into it before you build something that doesnt get wrecked easily. my best tips i can give for starting out is pay attention to center of mass and try to have it below water line for ships. Learn the advanced cannons and watch irelan's and rugers tips for building them.

This game alone can be considered a gem for that reason in my opinion.\n\nThe game itself is a voxel style build e'm up. You can literally build anything from spaceships, submarines, battleships, helicopters, hot air baloons, and more, as is evident in the game description. As long as it makes sense in terms of physics, and common sense, you can build it.\n\nAdmittedly, the game is very complex. Most get turned off by the ammount of completely this game has (as you can tell by the majority of negative reviews). I admit, I was too. Uninstalled the game after about 2 hours of trying and failing to build a dinghy. Came back to it a month later, and haven't stopped since.\n\nThe designer mode, for me at least is where most of the game is, as I like to play around with the mechanics of the game, especially since they change almost every other day on the dev test build which I'm subscribed to.\n\nThe campaign mode is relatively simple, but pretty fun. At the moment, just "kill everyone" to win. It takes a quite long time to do this, so you needn't worry about that.\n\nEdit: The developers are currently implimenting scaled down campaigns, so instead of you versus everyone, you get to be one of the base factions against a different faction.\n\nTo be fair, there is no real sense of "balance" in the game. That's not to be taken as a bad way. Everything you, and your enemy has has a hard counter designed specifically to beat it. Enemy has cannons? Use shields. Enemy has shields? Use missiles. Enemies have missiles? Use lasers. Enemies have lasers? Use smokescreens.\n\nThe only potential issues with this game at the moment of this review are that it still uses the slightly antiquated Unity 4 engine, and the bugs/performance that goes with it.\n\nThe only other, honestly fair issue is the lack of depth in the tutorials. They cover the bare basics, and that's about it. Admittedly the game gets updated basically every other day, so it's going to be pretty hard to nail down a tutorial until you at least get close to finishing the game, and I won't hold that against the developer, especially since the in game encyclopedia-learning center leads you out to all the resources you can think of to learn the game.\n\nThe community is small, but very active, and helpful, as is attested by the size of the workshop, and always will help you with any issues you may have with this game.\n\nI would wholeheartedly reccomended this game at full price, and even more so at sale price.\n\nP.S. My review doesn't cover multiplayer. It's usually unstable, and largely unfinished, so I'm not able to fairly justify a review of it. It works until people start to desync, and then it usually breaks down. This isn't a game that's designed around multiplayer, but may be in the future.","February 1","true","79.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

YOU decide who to fight, and when, in the Campaign.\n\nSeriously...I've played 5 hours of the campaign and killed 1/8 factions. That means each campaign could take you 30+ hours, with customizable campaigns and ships.....endless replayability.\n\nMultiplayer is on the way too. The Developer comments daily (hourly at times) on the Steam forums, while he works on the game. Updates weekly or less.\n\nEARLY ACCESS DONE RIGHT!!!!!!!!!","August 20, 2014","true","120.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As I write this review it is still an early access game but shows promise as it continues to grow and expand.\n\nIf you think it is fun putting your creations into a skirmsh  with various opponents and see how they thrive or fail inspiring you to improve on your designs or create better ones from scratch.   You'll have to learn all you can at making efficient and effective designs if you want to surive and not break the resource bank.   Making vehicles that compliment each other and work together is crucial and challenging and expect to spend lots of hours learning by doing.\n\nWhen starting out I'd recommend watching videos on youtube and understanding how things fit together it's not very intuitive and there are some thing you simply need to know before you set out.  The In-game tutorial is helpful as a leap off point but you'll still want to study others designs either on the workshop or those placed by the developers in game to get get an idea of 'how do they make this work?' and go from there.\n\nTest and retest, trial and error is key here, don't expect to master things in a day or a week even, there are so many possibilities and generally if you can think it you can build it, the big question usually is if you should.\n\nThe only gripe I had is that he interface/controls take a lot of getting used to and feel clunky to me, but you can remap keys and such to something more to your liking but there is still room for improvement and as it is still in development I am sure it willl there have already been strides in this regard so I have high hopes for it.\n\nThis game may not be for everyone but if you like sandboxes to play in this certainly fits the genre and is worth a look.","November 27, 2014","true","72.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'll admit it's difficult to learn at first, but well worth it. I can't get over how much there is to this game and it is still only in Alpha. I absolutely can not wait for more features.\nThis game just makes sense. Most creating games there is no reason for building a fortress or a ship or anything. This game gives you a reason, and the better your creations are the easier life is for you. I love the fact that you don't have to spend all day contantly repairing or building the same thing over and over. You design a ship or a part, copy and paste. Improve it, save over it. Repeat. I think the only thing this game needs now is a research tree.

The action side to this game is slow when you're in the campaign mode, but once you start up the designer thats when it gets fun. Now keep in mind, you have to build a boat first. Once you've made a boat or found one from the Workshop just press X and you now have a GUI letting you spawn in any enemy you want. After you've played around with the designer and decided to open up the campaign you now have a large challenge infront of you. The campaign mode is amazing, that about sums it up. The building mechanics are a bit confusing at first. but after you've mastered them its very fluent.

There's no denying that, you have to learn how to play the game before you can have fun.\n\nHowever, when you do it's a surpsingly amusing game to get sunk into. The problem i find in the long run, is that the single player at least is very shallow. You don't find yourself doing much other then building big things and wrecking stuff. and if you can do that, whats the point of going further? This is not, however to say i didn't have a huge amount of fun seeing how large a gun i could fit onto the chassis of a ship\n\nThe game is reccomended, but i really really needs the Dev's to look at the control system (which is difficult for newer players) and work on getting the multiplayer functionality going. Once that's working, it has the potential to be a great game! (take the main kind of mission setup, lower it to a single screen and go from there?)\n\n\nEdit:\n\nThe Singleplayer has been Largley updated from since i last played, with a larger set of ships and more AI in relation to what you do.

Once you understand it a bit better and get used to it, you can make some crazy contraptions.\n\nI'm being kind of traditional (lazy?) and sticking to ships for the moment. Going crazy with those missile launchers, tho.\nSo much fun to see 10 or 20 them fire in series and strike a target.\n\nNow, something I disliked a lot was the fact that you need to level up in practice mode before you can enter the campaign. I guess it serves the purpose of making sure you know how to fight, and it's good that you don't have to do a tutorial every time you do the campaign, but the learning tools seem a bit crazy to me (a 1+hour youtube video? Really?)\n\nNow, there are also text and interactive tutorials, however the interactive ones kinda zip by so fast that I had to re-do the AI training a few times in order to figure out how to automate a gun.\n\nSo far, sandboxing is a lot of fun. I'd rather the freaking flying units to be a little easier to understand, tho.\n\n----\nAn incredibly, INFURIATING part of the game is that, when your stuff is in combat, EVERYTHING ELSE GETS PHASED OUT. This includes your repair dock entering combat while it's repairing your combat ship.\nGuess what happens? Your dock goes into combat while your combat ship phases out, entering a 500 second cooldown. If your dock has a minimum amount of guns, YOU'RE SCREWED.\n\nAnother frustrating thing that seems to happen is that the AI seems to have first pick in the spawn order.\nMeaning that, if you have set a limit value of 20,000, the AI can spawn ships worth those 20,000, or more -using the entire match's unit value- and you will have second pick to the spawn table and it's very likely you'll be stuck with one unit facing an entire enemy fleet.","December 1, 2014","true","504.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you sink a few hours into it to really learn how to play then it is going to be amazing fun for you, and if you have friends that might like a game like this then tell them about it and if they like it then have them get it to because you and your friends can play co-op and pvp, me and my best  friend have sank a lot of time into this and we've both found it to be great fun, and honestly I would still be willing to buy this game even if it were $50.","August 10, 2015","true","376.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game has great detail you can make the eninge and guns to make the system run at it's best I haven't had the chance to check out the muiltplayer yet so theres not alot I can say about that not thing is the Ai is great the learning curve on the game is still very sharp next thing is  the Eemey growth factor it seems that if you have it on one more easier ships will come if you have 0.1 more harder it is I think it is the way the Ai behave but it is extremly annoying to try and deal with. the next thing is the "One day blocks" It really isn't gonna do much as it is in most casses people are gonna rise it either way.\n\nIt would be nice if you could add an misson where the basic block placing would be explaned and basic ship building skills insted of the way it is now the map It would be nice to have an option so you could turn fog of war off I don't like it much but thats all I can really fault about the game I am just going to recommend the game as it is barely but if a couple of theese issues are fixed I could easily recommend.","July 7, 2015","true","45.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

Create your own vehicles and wage war against other player's and/or AI controlled opponents in either scenario play, sandbox or a 'Grand Campaign' setting.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. Creating your vehicles isn't a monumental task by any means but it requires a deeper understanding of the mechanics than might be apparent at first glance. Engines are designed block by block and vary in power output and fuel usage. Weight of your vehicle plays a vital role as most engagments are sea/air based and you can't have a boat that bobs and weaves in the water, you'd never be able to hit anything!\n\nBasic learning curve is right around 5 hours with no handholding by the game itself. there are some pretty basic tutorials to get you going but by this time you should be able to make a small raft and make it move about with some simple guns on it.\n\nNovice learning begins about the 10 hour mark where you've probably completed your first custom cannon and missle arrays and can make a solid ship that doesn't flip over when making a hard turn in rough waves. From here its all about refinement. You won't know how good you are until you match up against some of the big AI ships in the game and even those can be dealt with in clever and inexpensive ways.\n\nMultiplayer is foreign to me. I haven't spent any time there yet in my 20+ hours and don't anticipate to do so in the near future.\n\nSingleplayer is a blast if yet unrefined. The planned updates are very promising and what the developer has already delivered on is well worth your $20 if you can stick with it, watch/read a couple of tutorials and enjoy figuring things out on your own. once your first completely AI driven ships moves to take out an enemy fleet and succeeds, you'll be hooked.","October 6, 2014","true","37.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm going to start with the construction mode which I feel is the strongest part of the game. In the construction mode the controls are great, they work very well once you learn them which was annoying at start but once I learned what I was doing it got less irritating. There's a huge learning curve involved in this game but numerous online videos and ingame turtorials assist in this matter. My only real grievance with the construction mode is that forward, left, right and backwards are all relevant to the camera instead of being fixed. I personally do not consider this a weak point of the game mearly a different feature that appeals to different people depending upon who you are. The only final issue I have with the building mode is how you can'thave blocks levitate in mid air which I would have found very useful at it'd let me place down "borders" for my vehicle. One other issue I have with the game is the inability to move blocks around after you place them down or select more than one block at a time. To sum this pargraph up the building mod is good and has a very strong series of core mechanics, if with a difficult and often annoying learning curve as well as a few control issues and lack of helpful features here and there.\n\nThe controls are great for piloting boats, not sure if they work for aeroplanes or the other vehicles as my personal lack of enjoyment with the game drove me off it before I got to that point, but when it comes to using turrets on rotating bases I found the only way I could decently aim was to stand on them which resulted in the turret being shot at an me getting knocked off, all the while I was being shot at. Personally I believe just removing the robot you played as would be easier for the game. When you're in the building mode this removal of the robot figure would simply place you as a disembodied camera. And when controlling vehciles being a disembodied camera wouldn't be useful I admit but a feature that "locks" you to the vehicle looking over it in a third person angle would be much easier. The final point I have to make regarding vehicle controls relates to the weapons and how they are only controlled if you're close to them, at least that was how the means of controlling them seemed. This system of only being able to control vehicles you're robot is standing on or close to sounds a little silly to me, after all you could easily get seperated from your vehicle due to incoming attacks.\n\nOver all I give From the Depths a personal 6/10 and I would recomended it if games of this nature are your cup of tea.\n\n+Creative and interesting concept.\n+Good mechanics are sound\n+Entertaining creating/building system\n\n-Intimidating learning curve\n-Feels unpolished in some areas\n-Weapons can be difficult to use.","October 28, 2014","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was browsing my cue, and all of a sudden, this weird, obscure indie game called "From the Depths" shows up.

Actual sloped blocks that you can make inclines with (take notes minecraft)? Check. Cool campaign? Check. Destryoing stuff, massive explosions included? Check. Building a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Halo frigate and using it to bring the hammer of doom down upon my puny and utterly overwhelmed enemies? CHECK.

The freedom to build and fight your own vehicles is amazing, and it works beautifully for an Alpha game. I do have some suggestions though:\n\n1) In creative mode, WSAD should always control horizontal plane and ♥♥♥♥ and space the vertical plane regardless of which way you are facing. The current method is unweildy.\n\n2) Please, please, please: Instead of having our characters be miniature helicopters that slide and bounce around, just give us humanoid avatars subject to gravity so we can walk around.\n\n3) Enemies should preferably be fastened to the deck for the most part. Hovering character melee/close quarters firearm combat is not fun.\n\nObviously this is an alpha and glitches and mechanics problems are to be expected, but these are my biggest gripes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kittttttty/recommended/268650/","kittttttty","May","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kittttttty/","542 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game has shown me that indie games can be absolutely awesome.\n\nMaybe I'm just a fast learner, but after a bit of messing about I'm already making great things. And I'm still just messing about in the designer, building stuff without constraints and such. Which is beyond fun by the way.\n\nAnd you see all those ridiculously fancy pants thingos in the screenshots? I just want you to know that while all these things are huge complex things which probably took whoever made em days on end painstakingly working everything out to the very last block, they're things you and I can make too. I get the odd sensation when I'm playing From the Depths that, yes, anything is possible.\n\nUnlike Minecraft, you've got way, way, waaaay more block shapes to choose from. There COULD be a few more shapes, but I'd say that'd just be going overboard, as it is I'm perfectly happy with it. I can make good looking boats, planes, helicopters, anything with what I've been given. In addition, you've got blocks that MOVE. As in, you point your mouse, a tiny spin block points to where your mouse is pointing.\n\nUnlike Garry's Mod, you have far more freedom with your weapons and materials. You don't have to hunt through the prop list to find exactly what you need, no, it's always right there in front of you, ready to be grabbed. And it's actually fun killing stuff. Obviously less physics based than Gmod, but, well, you're never really going to want to pull out a catapult to fight a boat when you could fire a cannon instead. Or a laser. Or a missile. It's fun killing stuff.\n\nAnd unlike Robocraft, this game is not actually ♥♥♥♥. It's satisfying to kill things. When things lose blocks, they get blown off and float around for a while before disappearing. When you hit something with a really really big cannon, and it does a lot of damage, it really feels like it. There's no stupid block limits or anything. Unless you build something outside of the designer, which I have not done, since the designer gives me all I need: materials, and infinite space.\n\nSeriously, I know this looks like just another block-based building game, but it's the one that I've been waiting for (metaphorically). I wasn't expecting this even to be good. But it is. Just testing out my designs against enemy ships and planes is beyond exhilarating.\n\nIf you've got $20 to spend, pick this game up. It's eyebrow-raisingly expensive for an indie game, but I'm saying it's well worth it at present.","September 26, 2015","true","25.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Something where the stuff you build is pitted against one-another while retaining that blocky, friendly atmosphere that you've grown accustomed to?\n\nThis is it.\n\nThink of the most outrageous and OP vehicle ever in your head, whether it be a spaceship, aircraft, structure, land vehicle, or ship. This game can bring that thought to life. Why build huge airships in minecraft that can't really fly when in FtD they CAN fly, they CAN shoot, they CAN (and probably will) lead to hours upon hours of your life wasted away just to build, tweak, and perfect that one airship?\nAnd for 20 bucks this indie game has drawn more fun from me than many AAA titles I’ve played (other platforms/computers). Not only that, but a community friendly to new and experienced players alike, a developer who actually cares about his playerbase and is SUPER active on the game forums, and full workshop, custom campaign, and soon to be modding support!  Another thing, if you look at the reviews 90% of those who gave this game a thumbs down have less then 20hrs put into this. My point? It takes time to learn.\n\nPros:\n-awsome community\n-LOTS of content\n-active dev(s)\n-workshop, custom campaign, and (soon to be) modding support\n-easy to waste hours upon hours of time on\n\nCons:\n-optimization is spotty, leading to needing a pretty beefy computer to be able to spawn in just one replica battleship\n-multiplayer needs to be reworked\n-I don’t have enough time each day to play this enough\nWanna know something though? Nick (the main/lead dev) has stated that he’s working to fix and improve all of these things and more!\n\n\n\n\nTl;dr	If you skipped to this before reading the rest of the review, then you don’t have enough patience for this game.

When everyone else struggles to even set up a cannon.\n\nIn all seriousness. Its a great game. It runs well with ordinary computers. Building is fun but time consuming. Most of my builds take a few hours or more to complete. My HoverCraft the Auxius has had around 5 hours of work put into it. And it still needs improvement. There are unlimited ways to make your vehicle. As there is LUA terminals for scripting (If you know how). And multiple vehicle types. Aircraft, Submarines, Helicopters, Battleships, Space craft, You name it. You can do it (Except for land vehicles). Everything you have to build from scratch. AI, Guns, Engine, ect. This is what I find the funnest thing about FTD. Being able to design the guns the way YOU want them. If you want them to shoot incredibly fast. You can do that. If you want to make one that shoots shells that could obliterate an entire ship in just a few shots, you can do that. But physics still apply. A large gun on a small hull can and will make your ship top heavy. That with the dynamic wave system. Can really 'rock' your ship. Campaign is fun. But hard at first. So I reccomend playing around in the creative session of the game and grab the ropes. Farther in the campaign you begin to come across hard battles. The ships you nerf because you think they are too overpowered will get killed pretty quickly. The Onyx Watch is such. They use no shields. But their ships are heavily armed and bulky. Meaning they can eat damage and deal even more back.\n\nOh. Also, watch out for the flying squirrels. They can eradicate your most armored ship easily.\n\nEither way. This game is very addictive once you learn how to play. I rate this a 9.5/10.","December 2, 2015","true","202.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But under the natural and approachable way the keyboard building mode works, you'll build ships of any and all possible configuration, you will arm these ships, with sensor arrays, lasers, defense lasers, long range missles.  tactical warheads, harpoons, torpedoes, torpedoes that launch into the atmosphere to splash into the ocean miles away to start hunting enemy ships, that you can't see.  -  That's just boats -  I spend six hours last night, messing around with the different size rockets that I can make to see what a certain combination of things would do...\n\nI have 49 Hours of Game time, and I'm just barely scratching the surface.\nThen you have Subs - Flying Boats - Planes - Planes that can launch from water - Blimps - Planes that can be blimps - Aircraft carriers that can fly and launch their own AI controled planes..... and helocopters.\n\nWeapons platforms - Refuling stations - long range sensors - ICBM's.\nHow about that you also have above all this, a starship orbiting?  Yeah, you built that too.

The main concept of this game is that you are a little cute robot, all by yourself, and you have to make and build ships and destroy the 8 factions. The story itself is pretty vauge, but the lore is very nice and detailed (except for Steel Strider's lore, they are just the government, Barack Obama probably leads them.) By default you start out against the Deep Water Guard, pirates who want to kill you and pillage the little resources you have at the start, they are typically the longest faction to defeat, as they attack you when you are building up your forces, and they have a nice mix of every ship, and some fleets they build are devestating, a Moray, Barracuda, and Plunderer in a fleet together is almost complete death.\n\n\nPros:\n\nGood developers\nIncredible Replayability\nRarely Lags\nYou really use your imaginiation\nYou can build pretty much anything, from submarines to huge airships\nThere is multiplayer, but it isn't incredible at the moment\nSteam Workshop integration\nLore is incredible\nCommunity is incredible\nMany more that I can't think of right now\n\nCons:\n\nTends to crash a lot\nDoesn't autosave (yet)\nIt's quite complex and difficult to learn\nA lot of Trail and Error, especially with air vehicles\nSome more that I can't think of right now","October 24, 2015","true","253.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

Despite taking a long time to learn even the basics, if you watch a youtube series or two, read guides and put time into the game, you will learn it. When you finally unlock the campaign (since you have to reach level 4 to play it) and beat your first wave of DWG cannon fodder, you feel really good and satisfied. Everything must be built from scratch, whether by you or one of the built in prefabs. Building your first ship, your OWN ship (thats good) could take you a while to make, but using your creation to beat enemies is an experience like no other. One defeat in the early campaign can be devestating, and seeing a ship that got you so far reduced to nothing is actually sad sometimes, but that is part of the wonderful experience in the game. Oh, and I highly recommend Aavak, Enter Elysium and Lathland's From the Depths series'. I fully recommend this game.","October 24, 2015","true","227.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Overall I really love the game and it has come such a long way, the game is not even completed yet and just when I start to think maybe there is not much more that can be added FTD comes back around with a slap that says "As you were saying?" with more content and tons of updated content. Personally I really enjoy naval games and I do enjoy strategy games.\n\nIn FTD you can develop your weapons from the ground up and design powerful machines of war from submarines to powerfull space stations with everthing inbetween. The custom weapons system is one of my favourites, there is NO END to the abilty of your designs offensivly and deffensivly, there is always room for improvment\n\nI strongly recommend this game, the developer isn't a jerk off and the game isn't a money bag and run. I don't really want to mention pricing because 'X' ammount of money is a small ammount for some and a large ammount for others, however I will say if you get the chance to purchase a copy it is worth every penny.\n\nOLD !!Most or all of the issues listed below have been fixed and are ancient!!\nI really love this game. There is a few things I would like fixed that are real simple annoying things like my taller ships akwardly leaning to the left for no reason(I say now reason because I use L&R symetry). Also I would like to see a symmetry simmilar to Starmade's that has multiple planes of symmetry and the missles akward flight path if launched vertically; for some really wierd reason the missles fly in what seems a random direction when luanched upwards unless there is a target immidiatly above. Other then that I love the game and if there were a demo available befor I bought it I would have put the games value far above $20. But the fact that it is $20 attracted me. Would I pay more for this game? Probably. Am I glad I only had to pay $20? Hell yeah.","November 15, 2014","true","192.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGoodFight/recommended/268650/","TheGoodFight","The White Knight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGoodFight/","97 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is absolutely brilliant in so many ways! I can remember way back when I was just a little kid playing G.I.-JOE's in the backyard. I didn't need the expensive, very cool toys that all of my friends had. Although the aircraft carrier was totally awesome, and the F-14 Tomcat was just bad a$$. I was perfectly fine using my mom's tupperware and various other types of household odds and ends to wage war behind the garage... All I needed was the little, flexible JOE's with cool nick-names. My imagination would take care of the rest!\n\nYears later I am 36 years old, work my a$$ off and find it very hard or difficult to lose myself in my imagination just as I did many years ago! That is why I love video games. They give me the opportunity to leave my job behind me, venture off to uncharted territories and save the world from a vile, discusting and viscious evil with capabilities far beyond our very own. From the Depths not only allows me to venture off into La La Land, but I get to create the vessil of which I use to get there! Should I fly, or should I sail? Should I use a submarine or should I use an extremely huge aircraft carrier? These are a couple of the thousands of questions that From the Depths lets me ask. Just as I did years ago with my moms tupperware, I can create virtually any type of vehicle that I want to create... I am being serious... What ever it is that you can dream up, From the Depths allows you to build it. I do have to say that building your dream machine is not a walk in the park... At least not on the beginning. When you first turn it on the game does seem very overwhelming... EXTREMELY OVERWHELMING!!! As long as you do not let the complexity of this little gem detour you from having fun you will gradually get the hang of it amd before you know it you are building your very own Battleship with a vast array of turrets, missle silos, gun bunkers, engine bays, controll rooms and anything else that you might find on a Battleship. Along with other goodies that you would only find in... Your Imagination!!! After you have created a fleet of multiple armed and dangerous multi-terratoried vehicles you may sick your vast army on your friend, or foes vast army. Simply put... This game is a build it yourself version of the game Battleship, Legos, and Minecraft all rolled into one.\n\nAlthough I highly recomend this game and that I truly believe that this game offers custimizable options unlike I have seen in any other game. Please note that it is complicated. It is not a game that you can just walk right in to. I have played it for only thirteen hours and I am still having trouble with it. But for me, the "Juice is worth the Squeeze"! Although it is complicated I am quickly getting the hang of it and having a blast while learning to do so... A BLAST! I just finished building a boat that I have been wanting ti build since I was in the 8th grade. I still have a hard time believing that something I sketched out nearly 23 years ago is right here in front of me plowing along as fast as a speed boat while I am blasting a set of guns that I custom designed myself. Oh I forgot to mention... You can also design your very own weapons which you can put on your custom designed vehicles.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to say that if you are into building vehicles/forts/weapons, have a wild imagination and a srtong will to learn than this game is definately right up your alley. Everything you could ever want to build anything you want is right there in front of you on your screen. The learning curve is high as the Dev (there is only one... and he is great) has made ther game very easy to pick up as long as you have patience. Please do not let this game pass you up. It is a gem... A diamond in the rough that is still in it it's early stages (which is VERY hard to believe as good as the game runs) but is not far from being polished and placed on display!!!","October 20, 2014","true","19.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

If you love to build, get it.)\n\nI've been playing From the Depths for a very long time, and actually, I now assist with some of the game-building mechanics for one of the factions. For the sake of keeping things simple, I'll post below the positives and (few) negatives.\n\nPros:\n- One of the most diverse building games out there. Seriously, there is very little that can even compare to From the Depths. You can build anything from a 30 block ballooncraft to 120000 block behemoths. (I don't advise trying to build something 120k blocks though. lol)\n- Customization is now part of the game in that you can create your own campaign with your own designs, or simply just modify the current campaign. This adds to the diversity of the game.\n- Graphically, it's not a bad game in the least bit, especially with high graphics.\n- Overall, there are not many bugs in the game due to members testing the game in a development branch, where most issues are resolved before stable patches are released.\n- The main developer is very active and responsive to community members. A lot of upcoming changes are actually due to members of the forums requesting them.\n\nCons:\n- Right now, the game is very CPU intensive due to the current way the game calculates the physics, resulting in FPS dropping on most computers. This is due to Unity's standard raycasting being rather poor in calculations for large-scale battles, but work is being done to change these calculations to improve gameplay immensely.\n- The learning curve for this game is quite steep at first. A lot of things won't make sense, but then again, with time, this is overcome. If you ever have trouble, just consult the forums and we'd be happy to help!\n\n...that's about it for cons. If you love building and enjoying things explode, then what are you waiting for?

Will this design philosophy stand up to the test of battle? Only time will tell.\n\nBugs pop up, and bugs quickly get fixed. Updates happen on a nearly weekly basis.

This is smart, since it would be kind to call the building controls clumsy, and they have a steep learning curve to gain any level of control. This is not helped by the tutorials and tooltips insisting on telling you the default control mappings and not using any re-mappings you may have done.\n\nI was a bit surprised at how fast the tutorial ramped up the difficulty, with a very early tutorial "Muddy Waters" giving you a very short time to repair a ship hull and build an engine before enemy ships blow your ship apart. I'm sure this is a trivial task for someone who has played the game for months and is an old hand at using the clumsy building controls to make numerous ships, but having only about 10 minutes to fight the controls to build anything is quite the challenge only a few tutorials in.\n\nJust two examples of clumsly build controls:\n1) Placing and motion are relative to the camera, not an absolute coordinate system. So as you try and find a camera angle where you can see what you are doing in cramped locations your control direction keeps changing with respect to trying to place blocks on the ship.\n2) The cursor keeps moving toward/away from the camera every time you place or remove a block (depending if you right or left click). So if I'm trying to place blocks horizontally I have to keep re-adjusting the place cursor back to the row I'm working on.\n\nI'm sure with enough time I could get used to how it behaved, except for the fact that you do not get an opportunity and are thrown into the timed build mission long before you have a chance to get used to the controls. It is literally the second time you build anything, and the first time was a "place the block I tell you here" sandbox mission.\n\nThe alpha nature of the game is very evident in the help/tutorial sections: spelling errors, sentences that just sort of trail off and missing words are just some of the more obvious. I've also encountered strange graphical glitches like the water surface vanishing; sometimes it is there and looks nice and other times not.\n\nTL;DR The game shows some promise, but give it a pass until it gets out of alpha unless you like torturing yourself.\n\n(edit for spelling - thanks jordank321)","April 3","false","2.5"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","3","12","2","5"

Gameplay balance is debatable, with single player being neglected for the sake of multiplayer tournaments, and an open multiplayer game is often impossible to find. Most people spend 100 hours learning to play before they really start enjoying themselves.\n\nThe online community is somewhat toxic, especially the developers. I was excluded from contributing content into the game by a kotl and the pr manager. I have been singled out as the target of jokes on the forum and teamspeak. I was outed as transgender against my wishes. I had people make an uncomfortable issue of my gender on teamspeak when I really did not want to discuss it. When I won a tournament I was insulted by the 2nd place finisher. I am the only player ever to receive a permanent ban. I was never given a temporary ban or a warning before this, I had a +21 positive rating on my profile when I was banned, and when I asked what recent behavior I was being punished for the dev said "for equality". I responded that wouldn't be equality that would be corruption and spite and was banned permanently.\n\nThe game is boring without a community to interact with, but if you have thick skin you might like it.\n\nhttp://puu.sh/ozlGG/210d2570b8.jpg\nhttp://fromthedepthsgame.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=5636&pid=51784#pid51784\n\n~Miss Ion~","June 11, 2015","false","928.1"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","17"

Ok, first, the lead dev seems to have some kind of thign against the normal intuitive controls used by games liek minecraft ot Robocraft.  That makes the controls for this game about as intuitive as compiling a linux kernal is to a happy emachine user.  First I tried the campaign.  I saw a youtube video from Robbaz and thought "that looks great".  So there I was not quite standign , but not quite floating on a cell shaded hull of a weird floating house on massive rollign swells of the ocean.  I dont' knwo what I pressed that disconnected me from the little robot body, but I wasn't in build mode, because I coudl switch into it.  The fly speed is set way high so strafing was disorienting as hell.  Up and down ofted plunged me into the ocean.  There were signs identifying systems, which was great!  But control indicators were awful.  I hopped into the little skiff.  I figured out how to start the engine.  Yay.  Then i figured out how to control it.  But the littel robot hopped in and I was still floating abouve the skiff.  The UHJK keys worked.  Thats a weird combination when you could just use asdw and a locked cameral.  Whatever, so I quickly accidentalyl drove the skiff off screen.  When i caught up I killed the engine manually, because who thinks to hit T+G to kill the engine.  I dunno about you but I have a single button brake in my car and I figure that is as intuitive as it comes.\n\nClearly I wasn't ready for a campaign, so i quite out of that, which took a nausiating length of time readign white text on light sea blue background.\n\nI went into the vehicle designer thinking surely that would be somethign liek the Robocraft garage.  hoyl hell, that was worse.  I was suddenly on a 3X3 raft with the little robot and the waves were crazy.  Ok, so i built out some pontoons and it got more stable great.  The turtorial on engine building was awesome, but again not mouse friendly.  I felt like I was back to the old rubber ball mice I had to pick it up and reset it on the pad so many times.  The best is when a part would spawn for the tutorial, it woudl reset the view (damn thats disorienting), spawn in a cloud of black smoke, and spawn behind other parts so I could never tell what had just spawned.\n\nLong story short I flipped my skiff as soon as I tried to drive it.  That caused the build mode to flip to, but the little robot was still right way up and spinning.  so as I was tryign to fix my skiffs orientation, the world was spinnign and the waves were rolling.  I nearly got sick and said screw this.\n\nI want to be fair.  I love the idea of the custome engines.  I love the variety and the idea of buildign vehicles.  But this is over complicated, and does very little to help people enjoy it.  This dev needs to get in touch with the Freejam guys who do Robocraft, get his head fixed about controls and gui design, and maybe this idea can take off.\n\nRight now I'm wishing I hadn't spent $20 on this.  But I want this to be awesome enough that I'm not ready to ask for my money back.  I'll check back when the sea sick wears off.","August 17, 2015","false","0.7"," 11 of 34 people (32%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","32","11","34","4","6"

Yes, it's early access.  Yes, I know the game will change.  Yes, I know that make tutorials hard.  None of that softens my stance that this isn't worth the time it takes to find out how to play.  Not learn how to play because there's nothing in the game that is useful in *telling* you what to do.  Throwing together a hull and propellers isn't hard, but once you get into building engines or weapons the built-in guides are so scanty that they are very little use.  Especially since some parts only connect in certain ways and there is no easy way to see what is connected without tracing the entire path.  And you need those long paths since the guide examples with one (or a few) of each part are useless in the real game.    Don't get me wrong, the guides are good.  It's the game that doesn't give me the info I want in a useful way.  There's no way to know the number of parts I need without building them.  I *think* it's the ratio between parts that's important, but there's no way to verify that.\n\nThere are ways to find out what to do, but "Look for people playing the game on YouTube" is not a substitute for in game info.  Let's say you want your base to have a horizontally-rotating turret with a single gun in it to shoot aircraft; that sounds pretty cool!  *Open build menu* Hmm no turret listed.  Let's try custom cannons.  Nope.  Advanced cannons?  Also nope.  Misc tab? Nope^3.  As a noob you didn't go to  'New Object'->'Two axis turret'->'One Axis Turret'.  But let's say we found that and started construction.  We slap down the main piece and hook up the ammo boxes and other blocks to give us the explodey, armor piercing goodness that we want.  How much of each does your gun need?  Beats me.  Just slap things on&off and figure it out.  Finally, we need our gun to elevate to attack flyers.  Oh look, a block called Elevation Barrel!  How many do I need to hit 60-70 degrees?  Beats me.  You have to slap them on and then either scroll your way back to the firing piece block or just try out the gun to see if you put in enough.\n\nFiguring out how to play the game should be a choice of tradeoffs.  I should be asking myself "Is it worth the resources to have guns that elevates to 80 degrees or is 60 enough?", and not asking "How in the gently caress do I get a rapid firing gun that elevates to 60 degrees with alternating explosive and armor piercing shots!?"  The entirety of my issues with the game could be solved with a 'design wizard' that would let me see how the number of parts affects the final stats.  I'm fine with something that let's me see that I need x gauge increasers, y cooldown decreasers, and z recoil dampers.  I'll take it from there and work on fitting them in.  Without something like this, I find that I need to regularly stop playing the campaign mode and go into the designer to get a weapon I want.  I would much rather prefer trying to fit in the parts I know I need under the time pressure of an approaching enemy.\n\nFull disclosure:  I have still haven't gotten belt-fed autoloaders to connect properly(They work now!  Details below).\n\nGun stats provided in game: -Max shell diameter: 0.020 -Gun has 1m ammo clip and loader\nAmmo stats: -Shell diameter: 0.018 -Clip size required: 1m\nError message that gun cannot be loaded.\n\nCan you guess what the problem is?  If you guessed that the shell was too big to fit in the gun, you're right! (although it beats me how I should have known that)  I reduced the number of shell parts and now it all both fits and tears up the Onyx Watch flyers.\n\nIf this was helpful, please stay tuned.  I'll happily update the review if things improve.","December 2, 2015","false","45.0"," 20 of 54 people (37%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","37","20","54","2","10"

I read a lot of the reviews and they are universally positive.  After seeing the screenshots, the game looks quite interesting.  The UI looks clunky, and the graphics aren't that good, but I was willing to give it a shot.\n\nAnd I gotta tell you, this game lost me pretty quick.\n\nThe UI is worse than clunky: It is downright incomprehensible at times, and is a serious of confusing beveled rectangles that are sometimes buttons, sometimes radio controls and other times just static text.\n\nI had to alt-tab out of the game and look up hints on the forum on what to do or how to manipulate the UI, and these hints were sometimes very vague.  The graphics are jarring and mismatched, as if six different styles of art were crammed together.  (Or six different artists worked on the game.)  The audio is not very good, with the same 30 second sea sound effect looped over and over.  The build mode is clunky and difficult to figure out;  Creating just a simple craft required several hours of tweaking and messing about.\n\nThe missions are many and varied, but at times it's impossible to figure out what you are supposed to be doing due to the minimal mission-objective UI.  Building the right sort of craft to complete each mission takes a while (due to aforementioned tweaking) and I lost patience trying to win each scenerio.\n\nThe controls are atrocious.  It uses a lot of none-standard, none-intuitative key binds for critical functions, and it's difficult to play the game on a laptop because of this.\n\nThere's a lot of depth to this game (ha!), considering how many building parts there and how they can be linked together to make all kinds of vehicles, but it's really just not very playable or enjoyable game to me.   Which is weird, because I read the reviews and people are absolutely raving about this game.  But to me. From the Depths feels like a very early prototype game, a proof-of-concept that needs a LOT of shine and polish before I would have considered it a public alpha.","February 19, 2015","false","5.9"," 59 of 140 people (42%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","42","59","140","5","2"

The short version is this : The physics aren't right to the point where the AI is the only reliable pilot. Unless the physics are fixed, the game will be unplayable for me. I don't find it fun to design an amazing ship only to watch an AI have fun with it. Unless you are prepared to spend long hours trying to learn the mechanics of this game and brave the incredibly steep learning curve, I would recommend you waiting until the game is developed further. It has great potential, but very serious issues holding it back from being great.\n\n1. Physics\nA: Boats\nB: Planes\n2. Tutorials and learning\n3. User Interface.\n4. Controls\n\n( Note that the other categories I can't cover due to character limits. So what if my review is 17,138 characters long? That's how many characters I need to sum up the experience! So I'll just cover the main issue. )\n\nI've sunk a few hours into this game and I liked the concept. But I didn't realize what that concept really was. I came into this game expecting something like Starmade but with planes and boats. What I got was something very different.\n\n\n1. Physics\n\nThe main issue I have with this game is the physics. They just aren't right at all. The objects don't behave the way you would expect them to and the forces that act on objects don't seem right at all. Thrust of any kind on even a very heavy object don't seem proportionate. I will try to explain.\n\nA: I first tried to make a boat. After long hours of fruitless experimentation, I found out that boats do not take into account account the amount of air inside of an enclosed space. I experimented on this concept and found that I could have two objects of the same weight but different volumes of air and they floated identically. So this tells me that the volume of air is not being calculated. The weight of the object seemed to be the only factor determining it's buoyancy. Both of these objects had air pumps, I should mention.\n\nInitially when I was making my first ship, I thought that it would be best if I start small and aim for a ship that could move quickly. The issue with making these small boats was: Whenever I would put a significant amount of thrust to the back side of the boat, the nose would rise up out of the water almost immediately and the boat would backflip in the air and land upside down in the water. So of course I tried moving the rotors to the front of the ship only to have the same issue. I got very frustrated and added immense amounts of lead blocks to the nose of the vessel and even with more weight than the entire hull of the ship, the nose would rise up out of the water and the boat would capsize.\n\nNaturally I gave up on the idea of a fast boat as it was clearly impossible for me. So I moved on to making a sturdy boat that might be able to withstand some punishment as I couldn't seem to move very quickly without capsizing. After a long time I made something that was barely buoyant but I was able to reach about 20 – 24 meters per second without the ship flipping. Even this was only possible with very close attention placed on the 'water drive'. If I pushed it to the maximum, even that would flip it. So I was able to get a ship that weighed 1251.51 go at about 20 - 24 meters per second, which was the fastest I had gone in the water without the ship flipping, but I could not get a ship that weighed 118.75 to go any faster than roughly 6 – 10 meters per second. And even at that speed it would flip.\n\nEven with this small victory, there were yet more problems. Now the issue was that I would roll over completely if I wanted to make an even relatively sharp turn. Your ship does not right itself well. Period. It does not act it's weight. What I mean by this is that everything is very 'floaty'. If for example my nose would climb out of the water and I would end up perpendicular to the water ( my ship's nose pointing directly up into the sky ) the ship's nose would fall back into the water at the same speed as the much smaller 118.75 weight ship. As for the rolling of the ship, the same thing is true. Now, if you want to use a cannon, oh boy, you had better hope you're not shooting broadside because if you do, you're rolling! The strange thing that I noticed is that you could be stock still in the water and if you try to turn, nothing happens. This makes sense as the rudder is the only thing turning you, assuming you don't have rotors on either side of the nose of your ship to try to turn you. ( Even those don't seem very effective in my experience.) Now if you get any kind of speed, your ship will start to roll if you try to turn it. It's not as though it's rolling from the force of your speed as it seems to start rolling at 1 meter per second. So you're moving it 1 meter per second and you can completely roll your ship belly up in the water. This does not work in reality. I have been on big ships. It doesn't happen. So it seems like instead of having true ship physics, it feels copy pasted from the plane physics. It's rolling the ship like a plane would with ailerons. So sharp turns in ships would only be possible if you were to use the rolling to your advantage and then attach rotors to the underside of the nose of the ship and the use that to turn yourself, again, like a plane might. But that's not feasible as your nose is likely to be out of the water, and if it isn't already, those rotors on the underside will solve that quite quickly.\n\n\nB: The next thing were the planes. I struggled immensely with planes. It was nigh on impossible for me to get anything to fly that didn't  act as if it had twenty anvils attached to the tail. Every time I built a plane, it would pull up constantly. It was as though the joystick of the plane was pulled back at all times. I would have to try to push the nose of the plane down constantly just to stay level. It was infuriating. I eventually found something after hours of testing that would sort of work. It was a flat block shaped like a T with wings at the upper ends of the T. The weight almost didn't seem to matter as far as the constant rising problem; As I could make the entire T shape out of heavy metal and it wouldn't make a difference. It would, however, cause the plane to fall more quickly but did nothing to affect it's orientation. As soon as I tried building the T thicker, it would go back to the constant rising.\n\nSo about the only thing I was able to make with any kind of success was a fortress. Yes, a massive floating piece of metal that barely moved.  With a gun.","February 21, 2015","false","149.8"," 29 of 75 people (39%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","39","29","75","3","21"

The controls are horrible, your fighting the camera constantly, the building is tedious, and the controls for that are miserable as well. Just trying to figure out how to build a simple boat that works is a three hour long process. The scheme of the game is all over the place, steampunk, future robot, and post apocalyptic, all mixed together, but not in a good way, more in a different artists having very different ideas. The water is invisble untill your under it. Its just so many little things that make this one big giant crap fest.\n\nThe tutorials are also confusing, but they give you plenty to choose from. Read about how to, watch someone else do it, and play through it yourself. However, they aren't very clear, more of click on this to add this now add this, place some of these, and there you go your a good Stanley! After you do them, your like but wait, what did I just do exactly?\n\nThe controls, argggg the controls. There are some games where your pretty sure thats the difficulty is dealing with the terrible controls or fighting a terrible camera, well this gives you the power of both. Every time you place a block the screen kicks a block forward towards the cameras direction. Which can and will screw you over. Trying to change your creations is also a nightmare if you forgot to add a chair.\n\nI know this is in EA so hopefully they will do something about the control scheme. Because you know half the point of this game is to build stuff to fight others with. So far building crap is so horrible and annoying that only the diehards are seriously building. And thats great, the world needs architects, I'm just not an engineer by trade and didn't read in the description that I should be.","February 15, 2015","false","3.4"," 19 of 53 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","19","53","2","0"

The mechanics are wonderful. It runs very fast and smooth and i do love a good meta-strategic long-game.\nHOWEVER. beginning the game even with assistance of an experienced player is a long, frustrating and unrewarding experience.\nFirst you're going to have to get to grips with a very fast, hotkey based control system. -which is great - except you can't modify the keys to your liking so if you're intuitive and fast with another game or program you're going to have to UNLEARN all of that first.\nRight now i can't stop hitting E because i use it to pitch in a couple of other games (those games allow me to tune the controls when a button clashes) but FTD forces me into a tactical map view about once a minute.\nFOR THE LOVE OF BISCUITS WHY CANT I REMAP CONTROLS?\nAlso you are in two places. you have an avatar for some reason. No idea why since it's invincible, doesnt do the construction and has such bizarre movement characteristics that you never want to be first person viewing.\nThe second viewpoint is a sort of spectator-cam that moves at supersonic speed with a momentary blip on the directional key. -again adding to the feeling of being trapped in a clumsy, jerky body with no influence on surroundings.\n\n\nOK, putting all this aside you set about trying to learn the ropes 'cause it looks like fun once you know them.\nYou have a few options:\n\nVehicle Designer - infinite resources, virtually nothing to restrain you or drive your build. What am i building for? oh, the campaign. but i have no idea what works in campain. 'cause i'm here trying to get ready for campaign. SO i place blocks for an hour or two, get bored with how awful they look and exit to main menu.\n\nCampaign - i go to start campaign since many games use missions as a way to introduce game concepts - Offering microgoals to help the player understand mechanics and priorities - maybe this game will be like that. Nope. Just plopped on a raft in the middle of a hostile ocean with 5 factions at high development levels and minimal pointers on how to even begin to gather resources.\n\n\nMultiplayer - obviously a place you go once the new player skill-cliff is a distant nightmare. I can't offer you any reports on this.\n\nI'm glad i own this game because when it's done it could be wonderful but having to re-train my hands to use it simply because the devs won't let players remap controls spoils the experience enormously.\n\nTLDR: Great potential. Maybe awesome if you've been playing since day one and all the complexity got added underneath you but it's becoming inaccessible to new players. Too little reward for your time.","September 5, 2015","false","15.2"," 13 of 40 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","13","40","0","3"

Sadly, I am not a ♥♥♥♥ing genius. The game is extremely hard and the game mechanics are not explained. There are so many different settings and options and I do not know what they do or how to use them (such as difficulty. The difficulty option is garbage. Instead of easy, medium, and hard mode, it is 0.00-???.) I tried to play but the cannons would not work. I searched the boat for the computer thingy that I saw in a video. Apparently, this thing was very important and turned on the boats AI. I found it but turning on the AI did not make the ship fight back when enemies came by. I also played some other mode where I had to capture a ship but I was killed everytime I got close. I placed a cannon but it did not work so I could not defend myself. I tried to steer to the ship I had to take over but my boat flipped over. I assume that I need to place some sort of ammo container but I could not find one in the inventory. I also noticed that every single object says press Q when you get to it but pressing Q only controls the AI unless you press it on a door. This is garbage and I have requested a refund. Maybe I will buy it when there is more explanation and help added. I am VERY VERY disappointed. I was expecting a fun game about fighting ships and flying vehicles but I got a game harder to control than Kerbal Space Program (and that says ALOT about how difficult it is). I rate 1/10.

Best advice would be for a demo consisting solely of the tutorial and a free build mode to be released so that people can try before they buy. Game is overly complicated just for the sake of being so. The default controls make the dark souls mouse+keyboard controls look good, the tutorial makes you look at youtube videos to learn how to play rather than doing the job of a tutorial AND TEACHING YOU HOW TO PLAY. Seriously, kerbal space program is about sending stuff into space and does 1000x better at teaching the player how to play as well as makes it engaging, whereas this is a game about building things and making them fight other things and collecting resources. A game about rocket science is less complicated and more fun than a game about building stuff and blowing up other stuff.\nSuggestions:\nMake a proper tutorial that spends more time having you build things than it does giving you slideshows with bad camera angles and manual pages to read.\nPut the fixed tutorial and a free build mode up as a demo so that people don’t waste time and money on something they don’t like.\nWouldn’t recommend this to anyone who likes building games unless they were looking for kerbal with added layers of complication and dark souls controls.","May 2","false","7.1"," 0 of 13 people (0%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","0","0","13","3","2"

There are extensive tutorials for this game, but the tutorials throw you right into a MASSIVE builder, which is literally EVERYTHING you can build. Seriously? you just expect to us to comprehend all of that info?\n2: The combat is awesome... IF you or the other person knows what the hell they are doing. I see this game as a more advanced toribash.\n3: The limited amount of experienced players are mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S. I came across one guy who i had asked for help while we were battling. He taught me how to make a neat ship, it was a tiny little raft with one cannon. His ship literally steamrolled my ship. Did i mention how this game works? which finally brings me to my next point...\n4: BIGGER = BETTER. If your ship is the size of a planet, chances are the other guy's game will crash or he will be destroyed by the shear massiveness of the ship. For example, There was a ship i came across called the "titanic battleship" Sounds really impressive right? if you like a ship that is basically a giant ram. No matter where you came at the ship from, you would destroyed. For a noobie at a game like this, there are SUPER simple changes that could MASSIVELY improve the game.

I understand that they are aware of this and are taking measures to combat the situation but more still needs to be done. The game seems like a complete cluster-f**k of huge buttons being thrown in your face right from the start. The UI is clunky and half of your screen is taken up by the GUI when in-game. Even with all of the "helpful" tutorials that come with the game it is still hard to grasp the basics. I appreciate that it is in early access but it is still not worthy of the £14.99 price tag. I do enjoy complex games that take a while to master but "From The Depths" takes a while just to navigate the menu and controls. The game has a huge potential and i love the concept. Hence the reason that i decided to pick it up. I just hope that the developers can continue to improve their game.

The combat in the game is very fun, but that is where the potential of this game comes to an end. In order to create even the smallest of boats, one must spend upwards of an hour to make it work properly, and even then you end up with a peice of ♥♥♥♥ that can't compete with the workshop blueprints. I feel like this game is unplayable to anybody not willing to spend at least 4 hours learning the mechanics, which sounds easy and tolerable at first, but ends up being a drag. You will buy this game, start it up and then think that for some reason you can jump right on in, and that you don't need to watch the tediously long videos on how to change the direction of a wooden triangle. You will start to build a boat, then halfway through get frustrated and go back to watch the videos, you will then repeat this process around 4 times within the first hour of the game.\n\nIt is so frustrating that you start to get stressed, not a good stressed like facing a boss in dark souls, but the type you feel when you have an essay due in an hour and you haven't started it. I feel like the one and only reason this game is getting good reviews is that people don't want to admit that they can't build anything amazing so they act like the game is simple.\n\nAll in all, if you buy the game stick to using other peoples stuff and actually play the game, don't spend hours attempting to learn the building basics that are on par with the difficulty of the blender software.","August 10, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 17 people (6%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","6","1","17","3","3"

Maybe if they attached the character to the wheel would be best and using the normal controls for steering. Instead you just have to be on the vehicle and it uses different keys on the keyboard. The game controls are so cluttered that any new person has to drown in video tutorials to understand how to do anything. Also the UI is crap and WAY overcomplicated. you can build your own engine and guns is really cool but the menues and UI tries throw so much information at you that it becomes too much. Final gripe here is the bots. In first person there is this limb clipping where if you turn the arm turns before the head and you can see detachment which is annoying. They also have poor models and textures. Finally their movements are too wild in and the ability to fly and survive under water ruins the feel of the game.\n\nTLDR summery: controls are very bad, UI is very bad, player model is TERRIBLE, way too much learning and not enough playing, building is cool.\n\nThis game has SO much potential and perhaps by release it will be one of my favorites but until then I reccomend you skip over this one for now.","August 5, 2015","false","35.5"," 1 of 17 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","1","17","0","0"

Because every main aspect of the game is not finish and all frustrating.\n\nFirst, let's build something. Anyway you dont have choice since this is the only thing you can do at first. So let's try ! Yeah, let's more see the video first looks a bit complicated. Beacause yes, a 1 hour video can quickly teach you how to do (I never thought one hour could both look so long and go so quick). You move the cursor with arrows, and click to place stuff (shouldn't it not be the contrary ?!). First surprise, the notion of "forward" depends on where you looking at ! Yeah, because nobody remember where is forward on a ship ... You have many keys, each one changing something and managing to not make building easier. Then, what to build ... there are hundreds of blocks. How is it possible ? Because many of them are useless copies of the previous ones ! Angle block just to make it look better, longer block for ... I don't know, isn't the main objective of blocks that everything is build of single same size blocks ? A good surprise, engines and weapons are complex pieces with many quite logical parts to tune it (like a canon with ammunitions, automated loaders). But some other are not: the engine is a complex part where everything must be conected, but helixes can be placed anywhere and magically get the power ! Anyway, I couldn't make neither my engine or canon work, so let's skip for the missions which magically unlocked.\n\nOne aspect I forgot is that when you build your ship, water magically goes through it. Let it be clear, a boat for full of water sinks. Wood is slightly lighter than water, but with all the metal stuf like canons, it sinks. A boat only floats because of the air inside, like a baloon. So why here it doesn't think even if half of the bocks are the engines and the canon ? because the wood is as light as polystyrene ! So now, a polystyrene boat is not stable. So you need to put lot of lead under it to stop waving everywhere ! Boat do have a stabilizer, but it's not supposed to be heavy, just large to avoid lateral movement by friction. And friction is something this game totally forgot.\n\nSo, now I have a fast boat, and I need to go somewhere. Let's have fun and crush into a big boat. I pushed the heavy polystyrene gallion on the side, then due to collision bugs we both started sinking, then physics rembered we are made of polystyrene so we start going upward, while friction kept not existing so we both accelerated, then finally out of water we jumped hundreds of meters high is the air, and then felt back in the water as deep as we were, and go on ... Next mission, I have a boat with cool saws on it and I need to destroy anither gallion. First surprise, my view is inside the ship, so I cannot see anything ! I found a way to have an outter view but the boat is too far. Next try, I hit the boat, but once I go deeper inside it falls on me and I cannot move. Tens of tries later and after adding saws on the boat, I destroy the right side of the gallion, make the bottom totally explode (it says I destroyed 40% of the ship) ... And the gallion is still floating like a piece of polystyrene. I had to destry 70% of it, and I never could make it because of stupid physics and collisions, and other ships firing at me.\n\nOther mission, on one plateform, few canons to use to defend, never could fire with one. Another one, the boat goes so fast it cannot turn. When I see the IA driving the planes like a sick ostrich, It says a lot about the playability. And I didn't talk about the useless robot you control and sinks deep in the water each time you lauch the building mode, or the fact that the games doesn't pause while building the so the boats keep waving everywhere and the parts you cut fall in the ship without anyway tot ake it back. Clever.\n\nSo let's face it, this game is not finished, does not worth the 20€ it asks, neither the 8€ I paid in sold. Building anything is light year from the playbility of any minecraft-like game. The two main elements which make a boat go, the air inside and the friction, are totally absent. Driving anything will only bring you frustration. Looks funny on the paper, looks like many people already have fun on it, but right now it's too unfinished to even be called an alpha.","January 2, 2015","false","3.6"," 11 of 44 people (25%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","25","11","44","4","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ancientburn/recommended/268650/","ancientburn","Ancient","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ancientburn/","141 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor me, the quality and value of an Early Access game is represented primarily by two things: the state of the current build and the level of involvement of the dev(s) within the community. The latter I believe is the foundation of a healthy community for pretty much all indie games. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and unpassionate devs tend to result in a community with a black cloud lingering above it. I think these aspects are about 50/50% as far as importance to me, with either not being fulfilled to some degree usually being a dealbreaker for me. The software usually stands up to the test, but in cases where the devs are not involved with the community or updates come at barely a trickle or seem non-existant, I usually expect that there will be no or a poor community and and that can ultimately lead to an EA game which feels like it ever reaching beta, let alone a release build which the majority of players will be happy with, starts to become more and more of a longshot (i.e. Blockscape, Castle Story, Spacebase DF-9).\n\nI've managed to sample every voxel sandbox game I can get my hands on and for a time now, my favorites have been Space Engineers and 7 Days To Die. They're both great games with great devs and communities. That was, until I found From The Depths. What is missing from Space Engineers (albeit is on the way), currently, are things to do WITH the ships and stations you've built (a campaign) and a block-based AI system and AI factions to assign ships to so you can fight, create fleets, etc. Well, those are the things this game has in spades. The AI isn't perfect yet, but I must say it was very impressive to see how diverse and powerful the options for configuring the AI actually are and just how very functional it is already. Other than an issue with aircraft occasionally colliding or hanging up wings with other craft in their own fleet, I haven't seen anything else wrong with the AI at all. The tools you need to build incredibly complex, functional, and automated vehicles are all there. You are limited only by the block count your PC can display and your own imagination.\n\nThe learning curve doesn't feel terribly steep either relative to the rather deep complexity provided by the sheer number of building options you have. The game has a very well-designed tutorial system accessible from right in the relevant block selection tabs. These tutorial vignettes show you a quick reference of how to block out each of a vehicle's subsystems, such as engines, aircraft, spin blocks and rotor blades (for helicopters), turrets, custom cannons and missles, etc., so you should rarely feel confused as to how to go about implementing each in your own designs. It's really very easy to pick up, hard to put back down, and difficult to master.\n\nI also cannot speak highly enough about what I have seen from the game's creator Nick Smart either. Normally, I'd say that a game like this on Early Access is a gamble on what may be potential shovelware and probably not worth the risk except in rare cases, but I feel this game really is one of those rarities. I was really shocked by how communicative, helpful and just overall the presence he has on the official forums. After a cursory skim of the forums, I was genuinely convinced that he loves this game and it is apparent that it is so much more than just a job/paycheck to him. I would dare say that he *gasp* actually plays his own game. I have yet to come across a single instance in which he responded negatively to a request or inquiry. Surprisingly, he is very much a yes man who is at the same time capable of following through. If you have a good idea that is even mildly popular among the other forum members and it is possible to implement, it is probably going to actually end up in the game over the course of the next build or three. I simply can't assign enough value to that.\n\nThere are currently three game modes:\n\n> Vehicle Designer - The creative mode of the game. This is where most people will probably spend the bulk of their time. You can use all blocks save the couple advanced ones which must be unlocked (see Story Mode below) and have unlimited resources at your disposal. Here you can save and load any designs you've built as well as any of the massive number of designs you can download off the Steam Workshop. There are also a nice selection of designs that are used by the campaign factions and you can load them up in here to play around with/reverse engineer them as well. Spectating or participating in AI battles is possible by loading the designs and assigning them to one of the enemy factions. Every design is contained in a data.txt file that you can easily share with others without using the Steam Workshop at all.\n\n> Story Mode - Each of the enemy factions has it's own set of story missions which are unique scenarios in which you are given a task to complete (i.e. destroy a ship) and an RP (resource point) limit that you can spend to create the craft(s) to complete the task. There are currently 4 advanced block types to unlock by completing their respective missions, so new players will probably want to at least complete those 4 to unlock those blocks for use in the Campaign. Each mission has it's own default fleet, which you can (and should) customize to your liking, however, you can scrap the defaults altogether and use the RP to build a completely new design from scratch if you so choose. There are currently only a handful of Story Mode missions available, but the UI shows a lot of space for more beneath the existing ones, so I'm going to assume that many more are planned for the future. Though not very plentiful, these are highly replayable since there are just so many ways you could go about it.\n\n> Campaign - In this mode, you start out with a single Skyfortress (a floating structure/base) parked over a lone Resource Zone and one of the several enemy factions is hostile towards you. Hitting the [M] key will delight you with a strategic map of the entire planet, which shows all the other Resource Zones, enemies' bases and fleet locations, as well as all of the planet's landmasses. You are not given any set goals or required to do anything, although the one faction who is hostile will start sending fleets your way in due time to try and wipe you out, so building a vehicle with weapons to defend yourself and/or outfitting your Skyfortress with some long range weapons would be wise. The other non-hostile factions will not try to attack you until provoked, so the safest (probably intended) method of progression is to whittle each faction down one at time until you control the entire map, but that is up to you, you could also declare war on all of them if you are fond of a difficult challenge and are not terribly frightened of watery graves.\n\nTo address the issue of performance being affected by how many blocks are in play at a given time, the game features a rather clever method of solving it. Each of your fleets can be in one of two states: either in play (visble and fully interactable) or pulled from play. When pulled, fleets are not rendered or affected by physics, but can still be moved using the strategic map, and in the case of skyfortresses, can still collect resources if parked in an RZ. Enemy fleets are always pulled from play until you engage them by moving one of your fleets into range (there's a large cyan ring around each fleet to indicate this range) or they move within range of one of your fleets on their own. If all fleets are pulled, you have available two additional timescale options from within the map: 4x and 10x. This addresses the issue of a very slow fleet needing to move great distances and it not really being too fun to sit and watch at 1x. The campaign has three different difficulty sliders, each of which affects either the enemies or economy so you can fine tune the campaign to be as easy or hard as you'd like.\n\nOverall, I am blown away by just how addictive this game is.","December 11, 2014","true","77.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

But even MORE fun to pit your creations against others.\n\nUltimately this game is extremely fun for a tinkerer such as myself, considering that I not only get to build all kinds of curious war machines, but you actually get to test them against enemies as well. There are even unlockable items via story (Challenge) missions, and a RTS-esque campaign of using your custom built army to dominate a map filled with several factions of varying allegiance and attitude towards the player.\nOn top of that your charater gains levels and has equipment and skills that can be unlocked, though currently some are not implemented entirely.\n\n\nAs it stands, this game is simply amazing with its current features, and quite fun.

The software usually stands up to the test, but in cases where the devs are not involved with the community or updates come at barely a trickle or seem non-existant, I usually expect that there will be no or a poor community and and that can ultimately lead to an EA game which feels like it ever reaching beta, let alone a release build which the majority of players will be happy with, starts to become more and more of a longshot (i.e. Blockscape, Castle Story, Spacebase DF-9).\n\nI've managed to sample every voxel sandbox game I can get my hands on and for a time now, my favorites have been Space Engineers and 7 Days To Die. They're both great games with great devs and communities. That was, until I found From The Depths. What is missing from Space Engineers (albeit is on the way), currently, are things to do WITH the ships and stations you've built (a campaign) and a block-based AI system and AI factions to assign ships to so you can fight, create fleets, etc. Well, those are the things this game has in spades. The AI isn't perfect yet, but I must say it was very impressive to see how diverse and powerful the options for configuring the AI actually are and just how very functional it is already. Other than an issue with aircraft occasionally colliding or hanging up wings with other craft in their own fleet, I haven't seen anything else wrong with the AI at all. The tools you need to build incredibly complex, functional, and automated vehicles are all there. You are limited only by the block count your PC can display and your own imagination.\n\nThe learning curve doesn't feel terribly steep either relative to the rather deep complexity provided by the sheer number of building options you have. The game has a very well-designed tutorial system accessible from right in the relevant block selection tabs. These tutorial vignettes show you a quick reference of how to block out each of a vehicle's subsystems, such as engines, aircraft, spin blocks and rotor blades (for helicopters), turrets, custom cannons and missles, etc., so you should rarely feel confused as to how to go about implementing each in your own designs. It's really very easy to pick up, hard to put back down, and difficult to master.\n\nI also cannot speak highly enough about what I have seen from the game's creator Nick Smart either. Normally, I'd say that a game like this on Early Access is a gamble on what may be potential shovelware and probably not worth the risk except in rare cases, but I feel this game really is one of those rarities. I was really shocked by how communicative, helpful and just overall the presence he has on the official forums. After a cursory skim of the forums, I was genuinely convinced that he loves this game and it is apparent that it is so much more than just a job/paycheck to him. I would dare say that he *gasp* actually plays his own game. I have yet to come across a single instance in which he responded negatively to a request or inquiry. Surprisingly, he is very much a yes man who is at the same time capable of following through. If you have a good idea that is even mildly popular among the other forum members and it is possible to implement, it is probably going to actually end up in the game over the course of the next build or three. I simply can't assign enough value to that.\n\nThere are currently three game modes:\n\n> Vehicle Designer - The creative mode of the game. This is where most people will probably spend the bulk of their time. You can use all blocks save the couple advanced ones which must be unlocked (see Story Mode below) and have unlimited resources at your disposal. Here you can save and load any designs you've built as well as any of the massive number of designs you can download off the Steam Workshop. There are also a nice selection of designs that are used by the campaign factions and you can load them up in here to play around with/reverse engineer them as well. Spectating or participating in AI battles is possible by loading the designs and assigning them to one of the enemy factions. Every design is contained in a data.txt file that you can easily share with others without using the Steam Workshop at all.\n\n> Story Mode - Each of the enemy factions has it's own set of story missions which are unique scenarios in which you are given a task to complete (i.e. destroy a ship) and an RP (resource point) limit that you can spend to create the craft(s) to complete the task. There are currently 4 advanced block types to unlock by completing their respective missions, so new players will probably want to at least complete those 4 to unlock those blocks for use in the Campaign. Each mission has it's own default fleet, which you can (and should) customize to your liking, however, you can scrap the defaults altogether and use the RP to build a completely new design from scratch if you so choose. There are currently only a handful of Story Mode missions available, but the UI shows a lot of space for more beneath the existing ones, so I'm going to assume that many more are planned for the future. Though not very plentiful, these are highly replayable since there are just so many ways you could go about it.\n\n> Campaign - In this mode, you start out with a single Skyfortress (a floating structure/base) parked over a lone Resource Zone and one of the several enemy factions is hostile towards you. Hitting the [M] key will delight you with a strategic map of the entire planet, which shows all the other Resource Zones, enemies' bases and fleet locations, as well as all of the planet's landmasses. You are not given any set goals or required to do anything, although the one faction who is hostile will start sending fleets your way in due time to try and wipe you out, so building a vehicle with weapons to defend yourself and/or outfitting your Skyfortress with some long range weapons would be wise. The other non-hostile factions will not try to attack you until provoked, so the safest (probably intended) method of progression is to whittle each faction down one at time until you control the entire map, but that is up to you, you could also declare war on all of them if you are fond of a difficult challenge and are not terribly frightened of watery graves.\n\nTo address the issue of performance being affected by how many blocks are in play at a given time, the game features a rather clever method of solving it. Each of your fleets can be in one of two states: either in play (visble and fully interactable) or pulled from play. When pulled, fleets are not rendered or affected by physics, but can still be moved using the strategic map, and in the case of skyfortresses, can still collect resources if parked in an RZ. Enemy fleets are always pulled from play until you engage them by moving one of your fleets into range (there's a large cyan ring around each fleet to indicate this range) or they move within range of one of your fleets on their own. If all fleets are pulled, you have available two additional timescale options from within the map: 4x and 10x. This addresses the issue of a very slow fleet needing to move great distances and it not really being too fun to sit and watch at 1x. The campaign has three different difficulty sliders, each of which affects either the enemies or economy so you can fine tune the campaign to be as easy or hard as you'd like.\n\nOverall, I am blown away by just how addictive this game is.","December 11, 2014","true","77.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The conquest mode on the other hand is very fun as you take resources and land from warring AI factions with your own custom designed air and sea force.\n\nCompared to say space engineers, this game is much more combat focused. With mutiple weapon systems such as custom guns, Missiles and torpedos big and small, and laser weapons. Unlike space engineers almost every behavior from your craft's movement to its weapons behavior can be programed customly. You can make a craft the snipes at the enemy with cruise missiles, or charges in and smashes the enemy with huge cannon.\n\nIf spending hours building a flying Missile guided Dreadnought out of blocks sounds fun to you, this early access game is a good pick up.

Then this is your game\nDo you like to drive boats and fly planes? Then this is your game.\nDo you like RTS games? Then this is your game.\n\nBut seriously. This game will eat your life.\nYou can build anything from submarines to spaceships. I even built an ICBM launching seacrawler with LASERCANNONS!!!\n\nNow to the actual review.\nOnce you jump in the game you will immediately notice what is going on behind the menu. Those are actual ships from the game, fighting each other. At first you are locked from the campaing and only get to play around with the vehicle designer and story missions, which is not a bad thing. You will be spending most of your time in the designer anyway. Designer is more like a creative mode where you get to spend as much resources as you want and it is a good way to design ships with no fear of enemy attacking you, unless you want them to. Story missions however are small scenarios. There are a few story missions which unlock some blocks for you, so you want to do those as soon as possible. But BEWARE. Story missions are NOT easy.\n\nIn the campaing mode you gather resources, build your armada, fight the enemy and do some politics. Not much politics. Mostly bribing. But it plays like an RTS game. You select your units and move them in the map. You build radar arrays to remove the fog of war. You build fortresses which gather resources and build you more ships. You can even automate shipbuilding to some extent. I've played the campaing for 12 hours now, and I only hold 1/4 of the map, with the most dangerous enemies yet to come. So campaing will take time.\n\nIf you've read this far I have to warn you. The game has a very steep learning curve. It does have ingame tutorials, but they do not cover everything. Best advice: Read the descriptions on the blocks.\n\nAnd lastly the positives and the negatives:\n+ Freedom\n+ It is in alpha and works better than many released titles the days\n+ It doesn't really lag, it just goes into slow motion\n+ Helpful community\n+ Fully configurable AI controlled drones, weapons, ships and pretty much everything ( if your AI controlled plane decides to ram a mountain mid-battle, it's your fault not your planes.)\n+ All factions and their lore are community made. The dev chooses which ships to take from community made ships.\n+ A nearly perfect mix of building, fighting and RTS\n+ It has multiplayer\n+ Very steep learning curve (Keeps you interested, but also\n+ GIGANTIC SPACE LASER STATION WITH INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES AND A FRICKING HUGE CANNON WITH EXPLOSIVE ROUNDS AND SUPERFAST FIRERATE THAT HAS SHIELDS AND A CRAB ON THE TOP...\n\nNegatives:\n- Very steep learning curve (it's also a positive, but might scare newcomers)\n- Some content is locked behind story missions\n- AI needs better tutorials ( Again this is alpha)\n\n\nConclusion:\nIf you want a good allround game with building, fighting and strategy then buy this game. It is alpha but you don't really notice it ingame. If you get stuck and don't know what to do, go to the forums and ask. The community is really helpful and might even download your vehicle blueprint, fix it and send it back to you, all while telling what exactly you did wrong.\n\n10/10 Would let the AI ram my plane to the side of a mountain while chatting with a friend.","April 3, 2015","true","327.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Loading times are minimal.\n* Your constructions will not wobble! Even as they're being shot to pieces, flying through the air or diving across the rolling waves, your creation will not wiggle and the parts will not look like the glue hasn't dried. Once you stick it together, it behaves like a proper, solid object.\n* The physics are robust. Whether you're ramming another warship, or just trying to make one that doesn't sink the moment you put it in the water, you can rely on the physics to make sense.\n* The combat is fantastic, whether you're manually aiming a weapon or leaving it up to AI modules that don't actually suck. Imagine Homeworld's colourful, trail-filled battles with Eve's general ship control, but with the added bonus of being able to walk around your ship and man the guns yourself.\n* You will spend too much time in this game, and neglect your wife/job/personal hygeine.\n\nImportant features:\n* Comes with a huge list of pre-built vehicles, from tiny submarines to flying fortresses.\n* Weapons systems that can be customised in painstaking detail - if you want, you can build a cannon that runs the entire length of your ship, or an automated missile turret with 20 laser-guided missiles.\n* Single missions that act like challenges, which can be played with default vehicles or your own creations.\n* A campaign mode that's like one big RTS game, where all the units and structures can be designed by you.\n* The game is full of tooltips, documentation, visual examples and prefabricated components.","June 20, 2015","true","157.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cdoggy/recommended/268650/","cdoggy","[κρά]Kizz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cdoggy/","137 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is by far one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a very long time. It gives me the same feeling Minecraft did on that first day. It's packed with content and endless possibilities.\n\nFunctionality:\n\nOne of the most powerful aspects of this game is the building system. The game offers two styles for building. One is much like Minecraft, and the other is unlike any game before. You are able to quickly and easily switch between the two by hitting F3. Where one building style lacks speed, the other picks up. Building vast expanses of wood for a ship? Try using the Keyboard mode. Trying to piece together the perfect engine? Use the mouse mode to be more accurate and percise while having full rotational control and snappy movement.\n\nFeatures:\n\nAll that I have played at the moment is the Co-op campaign with my friend. We are about 15 hours in, and have built several things. The game is packed with tons of menus and features that can be somewhat overwhealming at first. As time goes, you begin to understand every menu and feature and at some point, about 10 hours in, it all clicks. Building becomes quick and easy, the battle events bring pure elation and excitement, and the laid back time between battles allows for you to truly create and expand. The game offers features for both visually focused players, and those who prefer stratergy. With an expansive and massive map, you will easily be able to put hundreds of hours into the game and still create new and exciting builds and fleets.\n\nMechanics:\n\nOne of the most driving aspects of the game is the adaptability of the physics. You can build almost any creation you wish. From submarine, to ocean liner, flying bases, planes, helicopters, airships, rockets, spacecraft, space stations... It's virtually endless. Even land vehicles are a thing. The physics allow for realistic events, like buoyancy, lift, drag, wind, gravity, and anything else which brings the world together. Building a boat takes a little planning as you must keep it from becoming too top heavy and flipping over. As well, the game tends to automatically create things like windows and various other structures based on block configuration, allowing for beautiful and dynamic builds without extreme effort.\n\nVisuals:\n\nOn the surface, the visuals are simply acceptable. As you become more involved in the game, however, they start to make sense. The islands and ships you encounter, as well as those you build will become ever more beautiful. To account for issues during battle, the game will automatically slow and present awesome 'slow-mo' events to prevent your CPU from exploding. A very clever way of handling massive ship battles and constant explosions. The art style is something like Borderlands, which actually makes the game even better. Landmasses and the world looks more realistic, with your character and ships looking more Borderlandish. This makes the game feel happy, even with the dogs of war howling in the distance.\n\nAudio:\n\nPossibly the weakest point of the game. It has sub-par audio. Engine and ocean noises are there, but fairly generic. Music during battles is great, and interestingly, there is hardly ever music during peacetime. This doesn't seem to bother anyone though, as it presents a more calm tone and allows the user to focus on building. None of the noises are annoying, even after playing for 6 hours straight. The game audio is acceptable, but should be improved as development extends, which I believe will happen.\n\nConclusion:\n\nDo you like building, learning, exploring, growing and being a pirate? Are you an engineer? Do you enjoy Minecraft but want something with a more interactive environment? This game is for you. It offers much more than just Co-op multiplayer as well. There are PVP teams, deathmatches, missions, singleplayer, design (creative) mode and several other game types. If you are looking for something revolutionary and are willing to put a few hours into learning the game, you will not be dissapointed. Whether you want to load your ships with AI and watch them rain hell, or control the weapons yourself and unleash terror upon your enemies, this game is astounding.","August 7, 2015","true","102.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great soundtrack, amazing mechanics, and fantastic enemy ship designs. I'd suggest this to all of my friends, as well as anybody I happen to meet who enjoys gaming. I built a smaller plane, installed AI, and it worked. Then, after messing around with weapons of different amounts of effectivity, I increased the max height and the AI tried to go to said max height. The jet engines on my craft stalled as they'd run out of oxygen to burn. I tried to solve this flaw by placing balloons and an automatic controller to trigger them, but ended up screwing over the AI.

You can play the ships manually making it a action game, or put AI on them and turn it into a stratigic skrimish where you send multiple fleet at once to engage the enemy.

Status of review = Early Access.\n\nGraphics 8.5/10.\nFor the game and what I believe it is supposed to be ( Building/RTS ) Things at this moment are Really well done, Everything looks fairly clean, including the water and land textures. as well as the majority of Block textures.\n\nGameplay 8/10.\nI actually want to give this one a 10/10, But a few things hold me back. The majority of ship/fortress and or constructable control is what it needs to be. Resource gathering I find is grand for this game as you just need ot provide enough power and construct the appropriate collector to get what you need ( Over time that is ).\n\nBut the shining gem that is still left in the dirt is the AI control and it's rather stunted options as to what you can do, a fair amount of ships that I have made or came across in the workshop do horribly dissapointing things. Flying/propelling directly into other constructables, Nose diving into terrain or water, or all together just blind running suicide missions into enemy ships.\n\nOverall 8/10.\nFor it's place in Early Access it is quite well done and has a lot of potential to evolve into a really beautiful game.\n\nWorth it at full Price?\nWell unless you are a supporter of Early Access and know what that really means, or have a passion for a game of this type then I personally recommend waiting to grab this the next time it is on a Steam Sale.","July 19, 2015","true","119.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A little hidden though dunno why because i was really bored before i discovered this game (when I looked at the picture i thought it was just another dumb battleship game but its not!!) and I am so glad I found it. In a sense this game is a mixture of space engineers and robocraft except you build your own weapons. You can build anything from subs to spacecraft.\n\nit is really stable for being in early access and I haven't had any game breaking bugs at all.\n\nThe weapon creation system is great you can create from a simple machine gun to a massive super cannon. You can build awesome missiles and torpedos and even build lasers!","July 17, 2015","true","118.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not that it was hard understanding the technical part, just diffucult to deal with.*\n\n*Previous review mainly focusing on some aspects that could use clearing up or clarification. I voted down because of some issues with clarification and game response (how you would know what was happening / going on / not going right). One of the devs was kind enough to reply and add a few things to the game. Hid additions have cleared up the confusion of some aspects of building.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*NEW REVIEW (Post update)*\n\nThis is a very nice game, and will be very fun and interesting for those who enjoy mechanics / auto-mechanics. This game is chock full of posibilities. Whether those posibilities be mechanics, weaponry, vehicles, or design.

Also i think this game NEEDS an in depth tutorial as i found the building very confusing and barely anything was explained. I refunded the game and i kinda regret it due to the fact they most likely will fix what needs to be fixed and add an in depth tutorial in the future. I will be keeping an eye on it for sure and maybe pick it up later on.\n\nFinal Verdict: Even tho i did refund the game i will most likely pick it up if things improve. It is very interesting concept for a game that has been executed very well however it is very confusing when you first pick it up. So i will recomend this game for people who like complex games and i would advise people who have little patience ( like me ) to wait till a helpful tutorial is added.","July 20, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
