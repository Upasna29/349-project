In my opinion, Ruzar - The Life Stone is one of them. Aside from being thoroughly competent, this game doesn't offer anything that will surprise or amaze you. At the same time, this game won't shock and disgust you with insultingly bad ideas or poorly-constructed game mechanics. This is a comfortable in-offensive adventure for you to while away the hours with.\n\nYou take the role of the champion. Due to your prowess in combat, you've been chosen to retrieve The Life Stone. This aptly-named plot-device led to the ruin of a prosperous kingdom. Why are we looking for it again? Because the temptation of adventure is just too powerful to ignore. Anyway, as is standard for the genre, you start with little more than the clothes on your... oh. But no worries, you're a mighty gladiator so you have plenty of skills that can... hm... right then. As is standard for the genre, you start this adventure with absolutely nothing.\n\nRather than use a system where you choose your class, Ruzar opts for a very fluid approach. With each level-up you can decide what stats to improve. Furthermore, after a handful of level-ups, you can start developing skills. These skills determine your class, be it warrior, ranger, or mage. Since you aren't locked to one class, you're free to spread the skill-points around. I can't vouch for the effectiveness of a hybrid class, but it's impossible to build a hero that can't finish the game. This is not only due to the myriad of helpful weapons, potions, and spells that can be found or purchased, but also the general lack of challenge.\n\nPart of the difficulty in designing a dungeon-crawler involves the mechanics. I've always been partial to games that offer turn-based battle-systems (such as Wizardry and its many clones). However, I also appreciate crawlers that use real-time elements for exploration and puzzle-solving. Real-time battle-systems though? Not a fan. I didn't mind it so much in Legend of Grimrock but Ruzar makes it far too easy. Once you have an understanding of when a monster will attack, they will cease to be a threat. Either you can continually circle around them, or you dodge right before their attack. Some attempts are made to keep combat interesting. There are a handful of encounters in monster-filled rooms. You have to keep moving to avoid getting surrounded. Unfortunately, these few and far between occurences aren't enough to keep combat from being anything more than trivial.\n\nDue to the overall lack of difficulty, the player will quickly become overpowered. By the time I beat the game, I hadn't even unlocked most of the warrior's skills. Even though new game+ offers more difficult foes, they don't have a chance of overcoming my rapidly-growing advantage. Usually in RPGs there's the short-lived feeling of invincibility that comes from finding an exceptionally powerful weapon, or acquiring a unique skill. With this game, I feel like I'll have to nerf myself to keep things interesting, like not moving at all after initiating battle. The puzzles hold up a little bit better. They run the usual gamut of switches, pressure-plates, and teleportation shenanigans.\n\nDespite the issues with combat and general lack of challenge, I managed to remain fairly entertained throughout the adventure. I suppose this can be attributed to the nature of the genre. A dungeon-crawler doesn't always have to have grand ideas. Sometimes the basics are compelling enough on their own. Exploring a dungeon, discovering treasure, and improving abilities are all things that I will never tire of. Ruzar - The Life Stone gets the fundamentals right, and maybe in time everything else will come together. For now, it's a tolerable effort.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 2","true","9.1"," 55 of 57 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","55","57","0","1"

No other compensation was given.\n\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nThe first person dungeon crawler genre has very few good offerings for gamers. The most notable of them currently available are Legend of Grimrock and Legend of Grimrock II. If anyone wanted to get into the genre, Grimrock would be a great starting point. Ruzar: The Life Stone falls into more or less the same vein as Grimrock, however it has a few changes and additions that make it stand out on its own in the genre. It's just as challenging, and just as fun.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nThe entire game plays in first person, very similarly to games such as Legend of Grimrock and Etrian Odyssey (one of my favorites in this genre, though it's not on Steam). You encounter and battle enemies in the same fashion as Grimrock. Once confronted with a foe, you hit a key to attack them, and your weapon is put on a short cooldown before you can attack again. Interacting with the environment can yield many results, including finding hidden treasure, opening doors, flipping switches to disarm traps, and many more. With games like this, oftentimes the game world is very large. Thankfully there is  amap, and on which you can leave custom notes to remind yourself of what is at a particular location. This is extremely useful when you backtrack later to go to different areas or hunt for hidden loot after obtaining a key.\n\nOne of the things with this game and with most games in this genre is the difficulty. Every step you take may be critical to your success when enemies are nearby. If you do not carefully plan your moves, you may end up in a spot where you are at quite a disadvantage in combat--such as in a corner where you cannot escape. Another thing to note is that enemies move regardless of whether you do or not, unlike in other titles where you move and they move. When you consider this, combat is a lot more difficult than at first glance.\n\nWhen you start the game you are presented with a character creation screen, but it's not like conventional character creators from most other games. Instead, it is much like creating a character for a pen and paper RPG, where you allocate stat points to improve your abilities and proficiencies. Strength, Endurance, Luck, Intelligence, etc, are all viable stats, and depending on the type of character you want to play determines what you most invest points in. Warrior type characters will want Strength and Endurance, whereas Mage types will want Intelligence. You can assign whatever name you like, and even choose an icon to represent your character in the UI. This is a nice smaller touch to the character sheet.\n\nOne of the big things Ruzar has that other games in this genre don't (as far as I know) is that it has an item storage system. Every so often you may come across a Storage Chest. To access it, you touch the small gem above it and it slides out for you to deposit or withdraw items. Another thing is the Binding Stone. I didn't get far enough to figure out what exactly it does later in the game, but I imagine it either respawns you there when you die, or perhaps you can teleport between found Bindign Stones.\n\n\nGraphics\n==========\nRuzar was built very carefully, so all the details are very sharp, detailed, and recognizable. Oftentimes when you look at a wall where a hidden button is located, you can clearly see the button (though one can argue if this is intentional or not). You never see your character, aside from attack animations. The UI does it's job, though it's a bit basic. Health bar, mana bar, etc, it's all here. The inventory screen is nice, with different slots for different pieces of equipment and useable items like potions and rocks (used to weigh down pressure plates).\n\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThe music is nearly non-existant, but when it's present it fits the theme of the area you are exploring. The sounds and ambience shine in this game. You constantly hear the weather (when outdoors) and the creaks/squeaks of dungeons when indoors. If there are enemies nearby you can hear them scuttling, scuffling, or prowling about, accompanied by moans, groans, roars, and the like. It you pay attention to these sounds, you'll know when a big threat is coming up, giving you time to prep for it and be ready. As with any game, preparation is key for any encounter.\n\nPerformance\n==========\nRuzar runs very well. On my mid-tier rig I was sitting at a constant 60FPS, with no drops or stuttering. The game didn't randomly crash at any point, so that's a big plus. Lately when trying new games I've had quite a few just randomly crash, and that's not cool. There's no excuse for that with bigger titles, but it's nice when smaller titles such as this don't have the problem...which goes to show it's totally possible to fix them.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nRuzar: The Life Stone is a great foray into the first person dungeon crawler genre. If you are looking for a challenge, give this a shot. Sure, it's a bit similar to other titles in the genre, but it stands well enough on it's own to warrant a purchase and a slot in your library. Challenging, decent looking, and runs very well, you shouldn't be disappointed if you are a fan of this genre.\n\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://youtu.be/MXGRw8EmCCE\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","July 7, 2015","true","12.2"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","37","49","2","3"

I was also a fan of the Eye of the Beholder games to a lesser extent and the more recent Legend of Grimrock games.\n\nI put off buying this game, but after a craving I thought I'd give it another look. As the developer seemed active on Steam whilst considering, adding a new option after I fed back a bad review about snow effects giving headaches. I thought I would get it at full price and give it a blast. I have only put a few hours in thus far, but I went to bed at 1.30am on a school night after getting hooked yesterday.\n\nYou only play one character but there is enough customisation to make the development enjoyable. The puzzles so far have been logical and the monsters seem to level up with you.\n\nI am still picking up some of the game mechanics like only being able to memorize spells next to a portal stone and have discovered a few minor bugs but his is still an alpha version, and as long as you save they are not game killing.\n\nIf you enjoy these sort of games and have a space in your life, this is definately worth looking into.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/366510/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","TL;DR: Its not quite as good as LoG 1/2, but its still good. Graphics and ambient sounds are nice. One thing, the female voice's "oof" when you get hit bugs me, especially when you get hit with a DoT and it "oof"s every second. MAJOR flaw is theres no alternate weapon sets, making ranged weaps useless - you actually have to go into inven and re-equip everything to switch ranged/melee, suicide since the game doesnt pause in-menu. Combat & magic is simple, the magic system is just a click to cast, instead of runes or whatnot. Still, in a genre that hasnt seen many decent games recently, Ruzar is a breath of fresh air and worth picking up. Longtime fans of the genre will enjoy it, but its also accessible to new players of the genre.\n\n______________________________________\n\nLong review in which I compare Ruzar mostly to LoG and DM- the two major standouts in the genre\n\nI was born in 1981. I grew up playing turn based and realtime grid dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder, Dungeon Master, the Wizardry series, Might and Magic, and so on. Unfortunately, with the exception of Legend of Grimrock 1/2 (which I had minor issues with, see below) the genre of realtime grid crawlers has been pretty much neglected. Not much of note coming out.\n\nRuzar, fortunately is good. Not *quite* as good as LoG, but a good game nontheless. The graphics and ambient sound are awesome. For instance, in the mountain level, you really feel like you're wandering around in a windswept lonely maze on a wintery mountain. Combat sounds are exactly what you'd expect, sword swings, spells wooshing, and a "ugh" or "oof" type sound when youve bumped into walls or get hit. Enemy sounds are cool, spiders chitter and spit, armored skeletons groan and clank about. Every enemy so far has noises that you'd expect that type of enemy to make.\n\nThe gameplay is familiar to anyone who plays RT grids, and one thing I like personally: (deserves a little bit of explanation so here goes)...You can get away with not constantly & precisely step-dancing.\n\nSee heres the issue. My left hand is partially paralyzed. My *one* MAJOR problem with LoG 1/2 was the fact that the enemies were so tough & fast you had no choice but to stepdance constantly, accurately, and quickly. Going toe to toe with most of the enemies from the midgame on was sheer suicide, even on the easier difficulties. You couldnt even take a few hits. Not so good if you are only using your index finger on a paralyzed hand without much spatial relation.\n\nRuzar doesnt have that problem. The monsters seem a bit faster tham the oldchool ones like DM but not as relentless as LoG although the AI is decent enough to do things like try and come at you from the side, and dodge out of the way when youre step-dancing. I saw people mention they didnt like the slower pace, but for me its awesome. People who really really enjoy the greuling tactical stepdance might find it not as fun, though. It does have a difficulty level, but I have yet to see if that improves the AI or just makes each monster tougher.\n\nThe story's pretty simple so far (as most grid realtime crawlers are), but not bad. There is an NPC that you can talk to with a shop (also some interesting backstory, you know who she is if you read the intro story), with a storage box nearby for all your extra gear - pay to unlock slots. First is 10 for 1 silver. Thats cool. Theres also a teleport mechanism so you dont have to backtrack all over hell and high water to get to the shop & storage. I'm looking forward to seeing more NPCs to add to the story. There appears to be quests as well.\n\nNow about the levels. They are your typical grid-dungeon puzzles  such as riddles where you have to drop an item, "run through here quick to avoid traps", walk in the correct pattern to open the door, find the secret button, put a rock on the pressure plate and so on. They are beautiful, and very large, but it seems like theres not much going on so far. Enemies here and there, and a few items. I'm expecting it to get crazier as I progress. Theres a good automap with a nice note feature, as well as the ability to move while looking at the map. Note that in Ruzar going into the char sheet or map does not pause the game, like DM.\n\nI like how the audio works, similar to LoG diferent enemies make different idling sounds. You can hear them off in the distance and know when youre approaching.\n\nSince you only have 1 PC, combat is a simple matter of clicking your weapon/cast icon to attack or your quickbar to use an item (or hotkey - thats a nice feature, theres a hotkey for everything!), and I do miss LoG and DMs 4 party/2 hands each system. Ruzar is much simpler in this regard.\n\nThe magic system is simpler than either DM (still the all around best skill/magic system IMHO), or LoG. It runs very similar to the combat, click the cast button to cast. You can switch spells on the fly by clicking the spell's icon as well. Theres a magic/melee toggle you can hit to switch back and forth (and a hotkey), they arent on the same UI. To learn new spells find magic scrolls, and you must memorize them at a "binding stone". Then you have them in your magic list. You can also unmemorize them at the stone as well if youre full up.\n\nThe menu UI could be better. My absolute biggest complaint is that you cant have an alternate weapon loadout (at least AFAIK, correct me if I'm wrong), say a) a crossbow and b) a dagger and shield that you can switch with a keypress. You actually have to go to inventory and double click the thing you want to equip. Thats fun when you've got a sword AND shield to equip and theres a skeleton 5 feet away trying to tear your face off.\n\nWhen coupled with the no-pause-in-menu, its just annoying and makes it so ranged weapons are pretty much useless, unless you want to go running ridiculously far back when youre out of ammo and then run all the way back to the fight with your melee loadout equipped. its much easier to step-dance in melee than ever used a ranged weapon.\n\nOne of  the things I didn't like  about LoG was the "static class" system. Unlike DM, fighter types couldnt use magic. No having your fighters gain mage levels by casting light over and over, or your back row chucking swords to gain ninja levels. Ruzar is more like DM, you can specialize, or be a jack of all trades. However, runs off an XP-from-kill system like LoG so just throwing stuff and casting fireballs at walls does nothing (ahh, the memories of flinging cheese all over). It does have a lightweight skill tree starting at level 5 to specialize your char more. I like that.\n\nOverall, Ruzar is worth playing. Its not quite as epic as LoG or DM, but its good and if you consider yourself a fan of the genre, pick it up!","December 22, 2015","true","73.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

This game also lacks the many puzzles that were a very strong point of older and similar games.\nAnd to top it all off the information on many game mechanics is often missing.","April 12","false","9.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I like the look, and feel of the game. The atmosphere is perfect for the style of game and the dangers that haunt the dungeons, etc... Some might say it is similar to Legend of Grimrock which is similar to Eye of the Beholder which is similar to Dungeon Master, which is... You get the idea. That maybe so only because it falls within that same genre. I like what this game does and how it does it. It has the usual features of such games, but also has some of it's own features that I haven't seen before or too often in this genre.\n\nThe devs are great. I have a bug that has caused me a slight delay in game play and I say slight because I contact the devs and they almost immediately repair my save file. The bug I am speaking about doesn't seem to have affected anyone other than me and I will try to help the devs isolate the cause so they can resolve it, IF it is a bug and not something weird happening between my computer and the game or Steam itself.\n\nOverall, I really like this game and look forward to when more content is added in future updates. Saying that I'm not even close to seeing all that is currently available, so I have a lot of area to explore and enjoy while they work on more dungeons, areas, monsters, etc... :)","September 18, 2015","true","23.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

But then I discovered a solid dungeon crawler with a nice enough story.\n\nA minor issue is that I really wish the user interface wouldn't get in the way so much: there's a few places where you are required to use buttons when you could do with a right-click or double click, and a few other small issues.\n\nUltimately I stopped playing because the (in my perception rather slow) walk speed annoyed me, I had the constant feeling I wanted to move faster through the dungeons. If you can live with that, it's a good game.\n","January 6","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Jan, 2016:\nI gave it a second chance and have been enjoying it so far.\nI would not recommend it to newcomers to the genre, simply because it does a few things differently which make it stand out among similar games:\n-you do not have a party of four, instead you have one character; if you mess him/her up you might have to start over\n-item management and UI might feel clunky at first until you get used to it\n-you have (only) three savegames\n-should you encounter problems/bugs get in touch with support, Hammer Glass Studio are very dedicated and will help you\n___________________\nOriginal review:\nSadly it seems very broken.\n\nWas looking forward to play it but:\nUpon entering the second floor of the starting area\nwith my second character the game prompts error message:\n"You have a cracked version."\n\nAs read from the steam forum threads there seem to be a lot of bugs.\n\nThis is unacceptable.","December 24, 2015","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","11"

For around the same price you could pick up Heroes of a Broken Land, Might and Magic X, and even Grimrock I-II are better than this... Would not recommend at price entry and current state!","April 4","false","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a very odd system that promotes alot of min maxing early but without really gimping you surprisingly.\n\nIt's also a solo affair, and there are quests! It's minimal, but a departure from the usual in this supgenre.\n\nGood dungeon design with alot of "locked door without a key", "key without a locked door", "keys can be used on any lock of that type anywhere in the dungeon", and multifloor shenanigans that keep one on one's toes. Puzzles also don't rely on hidden switches and one-step solving either, which is a plus.\n\nThere are problems though, most enemies are incredibly dumb and slow, encouraging side stepping and ignoring investing more than minimal armor and HP (see above).\n\nOther than that an a few little qualms, it's a solid first take from a rookie team without a lot of funds to throw around willy nilly. Look forward to their next go.","May 11","true","15.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
