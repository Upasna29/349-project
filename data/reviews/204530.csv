As such, I cannot comment on the quality of the DLC, only on the base game.  This might be important, since the DLC is active for all players, even those who don't own it, in the leaderboard modes.  I may or may not adjust this review in the future, if I re-download the game.\n\nOriginal review follows:\n-----\n\nI liked infested planet.  I bought the game on a bit of a whim when it was on sale, and it had been sitting in my gift inventory.  All I really knew about it was that you ordered people around and they shot aliens.  Which sounds like a hell of a lot of fun, really.\n\nAnd it is.\n\nThe basic premise of the levels is that you start with a single capture point, and you must destroy the alien hives which sit atop their own capture points, until you control the map.  With each point you capture you get more resources (called Build Points) and the alien army 'mutates' and creates an additional complication that you must overcome.\n\nThe game plays at a great pace.  It's always tense, and yet, when you take a step back, the gameplay actually evolves slowly.  You'll often find yourself wondering if you really need to drop a turret to cover an alien attack, or if you could just spare a single marine and spend the resources for the turret elsewhere, and all the while the lines of battle are being pushed and pulled.  It's a great feeling.\n\nAnd those choices.  Those options!  There are so many different things you can do.  There are three main 'classes' of upgrades you can spend points on: weapons for your soldiers, localised power buildings like turrets or healing crates, or global upgrades that can do all manner of things from giving your soldiers grenades to having reinforcements dropped in by helicopter mid-fight.  The best thing of all?  They're practically all valid courses of play.  Everything feels balanced and nice.\n\nI mean look; there's a building that summons robotic clones of your soldiers when they die that fight on for a while.  This means that yes: suicide missions are possible.  And sometimes they are even optimum.  If you -need- to capture that next point before the next attack wave comes in, and you don't have enough points for something to siege with, then an all out infantry rush might just do the trick.\n\nThen there's the opponent.  The alien swarm controlled by the AI.  Here's another thing that's been done really well.  While I was playing I got the distinct impression that behind the alien swarm was another player.  Or at least another thing playing its own game.  It had different rules to me, but it had to abide by them nonetheless.  Each mutation the aliens choose have a profound impact on your play and options.  You might be happily shotgunning the swarm one moment, but with the next capture suddenly the alien has consolidated its power into pseudo-human guardians, and you need to swap out your cheep shotguns for expensive sniper rifles.  At higher difficulties the AI even counter-picks you.  For example, if you invest in a lot of personnel upgrades, the aliens will send clones of them.  I hope you know how to deal with the very same minigunners that you had waltzing right back towards your bunkers!\n\nThe game doesn't look the prettiest, and the sounds are okay, but what it does well is the gameplay, and it does that amazingly.\n\nSo now we have to ask.  Do I think this is worth 15$?  For myself?  Surely.  For anyone on the fence, I can say with certainty that it is worth your time and your money.","November 3, 2014","true","25.9"," 200 of 206 people (97%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","97","200","206","9","1"

Right. Okay, what is it? It's not a traditional strategy game in the usual senses of the word. It's not an RTS in so much as that the forces are hideously asymetric, and it's not Turn Based either. I would call this a "Swarm control" game, where the concept is that you have a small number of deployable troops, as well as static defences, and from this you have to construct a working strategy that funnels a much larger force into killzones and crossfires.\n\nCombat works on scales that you don't generally get to think about in such games, your 4-7 little poxy marines will end up riddling thousands, yes, thousands of enemy aliens with holes over the space of one mission, and quickly you stop viewing the enemy as a mass of individuals, but as mentioned - a swarm, one to be controlled, funnelled, and pushed back.\n\nWhen you finally "click" with the concept, and you start figuring out how to approach the swarms and manage them, the game suddenly starts falling into place, systems and mechanics which were until then entirely unmanagable become second nature and intuitive, and you quickly fall into the habit of securing outposts, setting up turret crossfires, assessing where you can do the most damage, how to maximise your soldiers efficiency. You stop thinking in individual terms and if anything, approach the mission almost in a "grand strategy" way of things. That's the beauty of infested planet.\n\nGraphics and sound are decent, it's an indie effort, and the graphics achieve what they set out to do (you won't get confused and lose track of what's going on, be thankful), ditto for the sound, the plot too, again, servicable, but the gameplay clicks, it takes a while to get over the learning curve, because the game is so radically different from what most people will be used to, but the investment eventually does pay off. The experience is very much unlike anything else around, and is definitely worth checking out if you fancy a change of pace from normal RTS experiences.","January 5, 2014","true","4.3"," 198 of 225 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","198","225","0","1"

Despite a very flexible gameplay system and some good level ideas or even some maps that are randomly generated, overall the game can end up feeling repetitive if played in long sessions. The art style goes from excellent to just ok.\n\nNow for the rest. Infested Planet plays like a tactical game, or a light RTS (Real-time Strategy). The base construction is minimal, as there is no resource harvesting and there are no factories. The buildings just provide defense or a specific bonus. They are definitively not at the center of the game.\nHowever the distribution of the bases are an important factor of the game. Each base is actually a capture point that can belong to either the player or the Aliens according to who takes it. In general, the player starts with one point and will have to battle through the map and capture each point.\n\nEach Alien base produces a continuous swarm of creatures that attack the player's positions (and despite some minor pathfinding issues, the AI is not stupid and can change course to attack undefended point). The player then has to manage the defense against the flow of Aliens, and the offense to capture points. Capturing a point has two effects that allow the game its sense of progression: some building points are awarded to the player in order to upgrade their army, and the Aliens benefit from a new mutation (new enemy type, new defenses, new hives) that increases the difficulty. Towards the end of the map, the Aliens are very powerful but the player has a wide range of options to deal with them and adapt to the mutation.\n\nAdaptation is an important word to describe this game. First, because there are a lot of options available to the player. Different kind of weapons for the Marines to equip (Minigun, Flamethrower), or different buildings (turrets, airstrike, bonuses for the Marines or buildings). And even if it is more gamey than realistic, at any given point it is possible to remove one of these options to retrieve back all the building points that it costs and change strategy on the fly. This is really GREAT and it allows to experiment without being stuck in a specific technological branch, and to react better to situations (however, some bonuses feel lackluster in comparison to others and thus the cost of entry is not worth investing). Since I am praising this gameplay idea, I also think that the UI (User Interface) and gameplay and level design are all based on the RTS formula but with some nice and subtle improvement touches.\nAn example would be the dreaded escort mission that plagues most RTS games. Except that here, if the escort dies, it just respawns and tries again. Thus the escort feels like an additional firepower help until the map is safe enough to navigate it, instead of being a burden!\n\nWhat I like with this game is its adaptability, its polished touches that are delightful surprises, and its sense of progression and pace. Every little step won or lost to the Alien swarms can be felt by the player, and there are very tense moments. And then the overwhelming scary swarm can suddenly be overturned into a jubilating victory, until a new mutation tips the balance of power.\n\nReally a unique and interesting game that shows that RTS games can offer more than we think if they are well thought-of and if the developers are not afraid to make changes in the classic formula.","February 25, 2015","true","22.8"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","51","54","5","0"

I keep coming back to it because it's a good choice to waste 30 minutes of time, and it's so simple that you dont have to spend any time relearning the game. As others have noted, the random nature of the levels and enemy upgrades can sometimes make a particular level nearly impossible to complete, but if you surrender you get to keep all the single-mission upgrades you purchased, and you get cash for all the swarm you have killed so far, so when you try again you are in a better position to win.","November 13, 2014","true","150.5"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","35","37","2","0"

What makes it different from the rest of the genre? Well, for every alien base you capture, you get points that can be spent on units and buldings - but you can also sell what you have and re-distribute your points when needed (units respawn after a little while when they die).\n\nThis makes for very interesting and rewarding gameplay, as you don't have to start over from scratch when they start to defeat you. Simply fall back, rethink your strategy and redistribute your points if necessary. You can also browse the map and give commands while the game is paused, removing the need for super-reflexes and making it easier to deploy your tactics, however detailed they might be. The graphics and explosions are also very satisfying - you really feel you crush these nasty critters :)\n\nAll in all, a very rewarding game that doesn't require full-time dedication to get into, while continuing to provide an enjoyable experience even after the 100th game. I find myself going back to this once in a while for a game or two.\n\nThis game is a hidden gem; way better than Starcraft 2.","October 26, 2014","true","25.6"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","30","34","0","2"

During the 20 hours I've played this game, I kept wondering to myself "how did this game get 95% good reviews?!"\n\nRegardless of what you may read in the description of the game, there is only one survival mission in the story campaign. In the rest of them, you're wiping out the aliens on the map, and with more than 5 marines. Including air drops, you can easily get to 15 or more.\n\nThe campaign isn't "lengthy" as described in the store page. You can beat it in less than 10 hours without rushing it. Overall, the game can be 100% finished in under 20 hours.\n\nI was expecting so much from the storyline. It ended up being a bad rip off of StarCraft and Starship Troopers, in my opinion. Felt like the dialog and plot were written by a teenager, and the very small number of characters (4 in total) are so cliché. One of them, the "Sarge", actually talks (well, there's no recorded dialog...) like Raynor from StarCraft and basically plays the same role.\n\nIf you are used to playing RTSs, then this game is way too easy for you. Your soldiers don't permanently die, they automatically respawn. Everything you build, including units, is 100% recycable, meaning you can't make any permanent wrong decisions that you have to compensate for. Just recycle everything, fall back, and restart. You would think I need to play a harder difficulty? Well, sadly, there isn't really a difficulty option in the game.\n\nI didn't feel like the game was able to teach me about my units' strengths and weaknesses. I ended up using pretty much the same combination during the whole campaign. You can actually beat this game while only using 25% of all unit and building types at your disposal (I still have no idea what the grenade upgrade does and how to use it...). The balancing of the game is a big problem.\nSome missions are quite long to beat, yet the game lacks an in-game save feature. I've had to keep the game running in the background to not lose my progress. Music is repetitive, art is very simplistic...\n\nI think the worst part of the game is the level design. Though it boasts a "procedural map" system, all levels feel the same and can be beaten pretty much the same way. Not much diversity in objectives. The game tries to hide this fact by calling missions "raid" or "capture". But in the end it's just about killing alien Hives (another rip off from StarCraft...), the only real alien building of the game.\n\nThat being said, I don't consider this a very bad game, but just not worth the price. And I don't think it should be considered an RTS, but rather a casual game with tower defense elements.","May 21","false","19.0"," 43 of 65 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","43","65","0","10"

What it lacks in production values it makes up for with inventive gameplay that centers around “stemming the tide”. As you progress through the silly B-grade plot of the campaign - which harkens back to 90s video game storytelling - you face off against alien hives that spawn infinite enemies. Hundreds of alien grubs are constantly flowing towards your bases and marines. It’s a bit like a puzzle game, figuring out which marines to use for defense, where to place turrets, and which hives to take out first.\n\nWhen you destroy a hive, it becomes an additional base for your side and you gain “BP”, points added to a pool you draw from when building facilities, calling in more marines, or changing marines into different classes like Flamethrower or Sniper. You can undo your choices at any time to get the points back, and fluidly adapting to the situation becomes required. When you take a hive, the remaining hives on the map get a random mutation that can drastically alter the situation. Even if you fail a mission, you earn some money which can be used to unlock permanent upgrades or temporary boosts for the next mission.","September 22, 2014","true","13.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Surrounded on all sides, you must outmanoeuvre and outsmart the enemy. It's a real time strategy game. You start at a base called hive. And while you only hold a single hive your enemies hold a dozed hives.\n\nAs soon as the game starts the enemies multiply rapidly and start moving in your direction to attack. You need to protect your hive and every conquered hive and at the same time you need to conquer all alien hives. This can get pretty tricky but it's a lot of fun.\n\nYou start with a small amount of money. Money can upgrade your soldiers, buy air support, mines, mortars, cannons or healing and many other things. You are free to experiment because the game allows you to remove any upgrade and buy or build something else instead. Every time you conquer an enemy hive your total amount of money increases.\n\nThen there are mutations. The higher your difficulty level the more often the aliens will mutate. Every mutation makes things worse\n\nInfested Planet has a good story and is an extremely clever balanced game. It looks nice, is very addictive and in my opinion is a must have game. It's simply amazing.\n\nPros:\n- lots of fun\n- nice graphics\n- good music\n- good story\n- allows very different strategies to win\n- developer is very supportive and keeps adding content and bug fixes\n- weekly challenges\n\nCons:\n- a few impossible achievements","April 1","true","49.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/griffinsclaw/recommended/204530/","griffinsclaw","Fluffy Tail Toucher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/griffinsclaw/","171 products in account","I was playing one of the side missions, where every base you killed spawns an alien that runs away and spawns a new base if you don't kill it fast enough. Pretty simple.\n\n2 hours later, I'm still playing the same damn mission. There's 9 bases left, and they're all sitting in a cluster. Most of them are covered by a healing field. Every one of them has 9 powerups. I have to defend on 3 fronts from the swarms of aliens that are crawling toward my bases with no respite. Here are my options, and why every one of them won't do anything:\n\nKill the healing field: This isn't an option. I can't even get near it, and even if I killed it, it would just come back in 20 seconds.\n\nSlowly whittle away at a corner until I can get a foothold: This is flat out never an option in any situation in this game. the second you stop attacking something, all of its turrets or spawners respawn. You can only make a dent if you do enough damage to kill a base in a single attack.\n\nMass everything I have and push to take a base: Probably the best option and still utterly impossible. When I attack, 5 bases start sending dozens of kamikaze exploder bugs per second at my face. The continuous mass of ranged spitter bugs is still coming. The base I'm attacking shields itself so all my attacks tickle, and on top of that it's being healed. My attacks hurt me because of reflect, base turrets that far outrange me are hitting me and knocking my soldiers back with every shot. On a regular basis waves of assassins come to shoot my commander, and I have to blow missiles to kill them. While I do this, I'll lose my bases on every other front because I can't defend them and attack, and to top it off, the best case scenario is that it spawns a relocator that there's no way I'll be able to kill, that will just set up a new base somewhere else in the cluster.\n\nRestart, make sure I don't get into this situation: And there lies the problem. I couldn't stop it. There was a cluster of 3 here before the game started, and I couldn't defeat them without a lot of powerups. while I was taking out other bases, I couldn't stop all of the relocator bugs, because they're decently fast and very tanky, and it's impossible to follow them since every other one of the bugs that's attacking you slows you as well.\n\nHere's the issue: the game is designed with HUGE power asymmetry. you get a few troops and upgrades, and you're up against a dozen bases that swarm thousands of enemies at you constantly. every game is a war of attrition. The game feels like a chore. It's like a sailing game, where you don't sail the boat but you just sit there with a cup and bail water, but you can't plug the leak until everything else is dry.\n\nyeah, not every mission is that brutal. Yeah, there are other options, I could buy some one time power ups from farming easier missions and try again, or just skip it. Yeah, I could probably bash my face into the problem for another few hours and eventually win, because it's basically impossible to actually lose. Yeah, there are plenty of good points to the game as well. But nothing makes up for what an utter chore the game is. I'm not saying it's not fun, it is fun to an extent. I'm not saying don't play it, maybe it will be more your thing. I'm just saying that I found it a frusterating mess and I'm surprised it's rated so highly, so I wanted to throw my opinion in. If you want a similar game that's not only better, but cheaper, go play creeper world.\n\n","August 9, 2015","false","9.3"," 50 of 87 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","50","87","7","5"

But not only that. Since they're scattered across the map, they tend to re-capture undefended base and turn them back as hives. So there's a lot of micromanaging going on. Sure a few missions are manageable but as you progress, the game will encourage or even unleash your hidden strategic think-tank that's been cooped inside the core of your head for a long time and you don’t have a choice or else you'll lose the game.\n\nBut not to worry, perks like weapon modifications and support units (air drops, air strikes...etc) are in the game and usable on each mission. However, if you want to use them you have to earn money and to earn money you will have to win a couple of previous missions in order to advance and all that are in the game with no microtransactions required.\n\nSo this game is recommended to those who like RTS (Real Time Strategy) and/or wants to know how it feels like to get swarm by aliens with a few number of units to control like one of those bugs from Starship Troopers[www.imdb.com]\n\n"These are the rules.

The early stages are fun, and the shop system makes you want to keep coming back.  The targeting AI for your marines is meh, but not bad enough to ruin the game.  The first half of the story missions are of acceptable quality.\n\nThe second half of the game is a complete mess.  Later missions contain game-ending events, and unless you take an extremely specific set of precautions, you're dead.  The only way to beat some of these stages is to play them over and over until you learn the stage in advance, and specifically play to avoid the pitfalls you know are coming.\n\nThe ambush mission is a great example.  You simply spawn at the top of the map, and alien hives randomly appear around you.  You have two directions to go, but one (securing the top of the map) isn't the "correct" way, and you'll die every time if you go there.  If you try to defend your starting point (an extremely logical move), you will die because alien hives appear under you for the rest of the stage until you die.  The "correct" answer to the stage is to fall back and let the aliens destroy everything as you retreat.  If you attempt any other strategy, you'll die.  There is no indication that this is the correct answer.  And that's what makes it so infuriating.\n\nIf the level design wasn't so tremendously bad in the last half of the game, I could recommend.

Infested Planet throws almost all of that out the window. While the aliens seem to have a happy society in place, it falls on your shoulders to disrupt it entirely and establish something much more pleasing to the obviously superior human eye. Thousands of aliens will march toward you in defense of their home, but we are determined to rid this completely non-sentient planet from its infestation. It’s not a genocide! It’s liberation! Moral questions aside, Infested Planet offers extremely unique strategic gameplay with thousands of enemies marching on almost every base relentlessly. Will it colonize your heart? Or is this game a plague? Let’s look closer at Infested Planet.\n\nInfested Planet doesn’t offer a string of interlocking building or unit upgrades, and for that I am SO grateful. Instead, rewards are offered for completing missions which can be used to purchase a variety of upgrades to your units. There are grenades, to class unlocks, along with a variety of buildings which allow you to suit your ground forces to your playstyle. Are your heavy machine-gunners a bit to slow and unwieldly to hold the entire map all by themselves? Pepper in a shot-gunners and some scouts to do the legwork. As your heavies push toward the enemy bases, perhaps you will find yourself overwhelmed again. Upgrade a couple of them to flamethrowers and watch as the swarm is beat back by a wall of flame. If all else fails, build a helipad to bring in chopper-strikes and thin the horde. The options are limitless, and all equally satisfying.\n\nAside from picking how you want to destroy the hive during gameplay, there are also a ton of game-modes that allow you to customize HOW you want to play. One of my personal favorites features a time-limit and permadeath, which makes the impending horde that much more terrifying. The story mode features some aspects that constrict freedom of play, but I would argue that that’s what a game does. Sometimes there is a path that must be taken, the freedom still comes in the way you decide to take it. I found myself repeatedly playing missions to get the maximum amount of money possible in order to unlock the next delicious explosives-laden fruit from the tech tree. Not a necessary thing to do, but the randomized levels keep things consistently fresh.\n\nThe story in this game falls quite flat, and doesn’t attempt to touch on the bevy of moral questions. The level design doesn’t seem extremely meticulous largely due to the randomized nature, but Infested Planet has certainly earned its place in my Steam library. Very few games offer enemies this endless. Your tactics need to be tight and your responses need to be on point. I supremely enjoyed the mutations of the aliens throughout the different stages, and thanks RocketBear Games very much for the review copy. I am extremely glad Infested Planet came out of Early Access with such success. This is a game that truly needs to be experienced. As you pit your squad of marines against the ravenous hordes, you will find yourself cheering them on and even mourning their little pixelated deaths.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 8/10\nFun Factor- 10/10\nDifficulty- 8/10\nReplayability- 10/10\nInnovation- 8/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 7/10\nMusic- 8/10\nSound FX- 7/10\nStory/Lore- 3/10\nLevel Design- 5/10\n\nFinal Score: 74/100 for fun factor, replayability, and difficulty.\n\nSummary: An absolutely massive RTS about five space-marines eliminating thousands of aliens.\n\nVerdict: Infested Planet will please RTS fans as well as anyone that enjoys truly strategic gameplay.\n\nFull text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-infested-planet/\nFull gameplay/review video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8QEWh2vnVo","May 10, 2015","true","4.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","7","8","5","0"

You can also re-run missions to gain Steam achieves with the new technology (hence the TD feel).\n\nAgain: miniguns and flamers for win.\n\nMost of the tough spots I've found so far have been such that I can park a couple of guys next to my bases, which, after you unlock bunkers, will keep them healed while they blaze away, while you figure out what to do next... and some of the scenarios are challenging enough to warrant a wider view of the map and observation of the flow of enemies.  Most non-starter scenarios have had bonus mission award (during-mission currency, used to buy upgrades for troops or buildings) options, so you have a choice sometimes between trying to zerg back at them for a fast win, or taking the long road and wading through thousands more bodies with heavier guns.\n\nSo like I said: miniguns and flamers for win... but officers help, too.\n\nFun game, for sure - good job, RocketBear!","March 6, 2015","true","7.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","8","10","4","0"

As commander of space marines, you are tasked to wipe out whatever baddies you come across, and these guys adapt to your tactics, and will throw you quite a few surprises. Think of it more as a puzzle, than a straight combat game, and you should have fun.\n\nThe graphics are fairly minimal overhead view without fancy-shmancy 3D options. No rotation, just scrolling. The idea is simple: start with one "base" area, and you need to beat back the alien horde with your marines and maybe some sentry turrets, but you need RPs (resource points) to build them, and you can also use RPs to buy enhancements for your teams, such as medical pods (healing), grenades, shotgun upgrades, minefields, officers, and so on. Some are semi-permanent, others are single-use buffs only.  RPs can only be earned by killing alien hives.\n\nSo basically the trick is build the right stuff at the right time. if your marines got killed, replacements are sent down to the nearest conquered "point". Your marines also have some heavy weapons (think RPGs) that can be used to kill individual units. If you find some "metal" you can have it dragged back to the control points where it is added to your RPs. You can also find ammo crate which gives you back your "ammo" (for heavy weapons) immediately rather than wait for it to SLOWLY regenerate.\n\nAs you beat up aliens, you unlock more toys to play with, such as extra med pods, shotgun, minigun,  extra marines, officers, etc. But obviously, the alien horde gets better too. First it's just swarm, then alien hives gets "gunners", then they can generate their own "marines", mines, mini-spawn nodes, hive artillery, speed rush... and more. You can play either story missions or "raid" missions. Story missions advances the plot, while raid missions just earns you money that lets you unlock even more toys.\n\nSo the key is build just enough to help you take out one hive at a time and build defenses to hold the points, but there's a lot of different ways to do it... Do you blitz the hive and accept casualties, or do the turret leapfrog, i.e. build turrets to cover each other and advance slowly but surely?\n\nI've went through a dozen missions by now and there's two dozen more to go, and there are weekly challenges, and there's some updates coming soon. You can repeat the "raid" missions to earn more money for the goodies.\n\nAll in all the game is a lot of alien blasting fun as you groan at loss of each marine and cheer when you take out each hive. The game may not be flashy, but it is a lot of fun. Highly recommended.","April 26, 2015","true","34.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Here's one of the reasons why: For example, I have a team of five, one of them is a sniper.\nThe sniper knows what he's there for, which is taking out small spawning pods and turrets.\nSo, when I send the entire team to attack a hive, the sniper seems to prioritize the targets more suited for him.\n\nYou could also take control of each unit individually and micromanage, of course.\n\nOn average, each game takes 10-20 mins(at least for me).\n\nEasy to jump into, easy to stop playing. (I'm one of those people who want to play something, open the library, stare at it, and can't decide on what to play, end up closing steam and doing something else <_<.

The end result is that the game starts easy and gets progressively more difficult as the game goes on.\n\nThe game is a tactics game, not a strategy game, so there's not much in the way of resource management or base building -- it's all about efficient usage of your few marines.  The game is also pause-able, and you can give orders while paused, so there's no requirement of fast reflexes or decision-making.\n\nAll in all, the game has a very satisfying level of difficulty, where it is hard enough to be a challenge without being unfair or impossible.  It also encourages experimentation with the various options, since any resources you spend on something will be refunded if you decide you no longer want it.\n\nEach "mission" runs for 10-40 minutes or so, depending upon your aggressiveness and speed of play.  There's four tutorial missions, a campaign mode of ten pre-set missions, options for random missions of various difficulties, and a weekly challenge of four different missions with a leaderboard of who can do each one the fastest.\n\nIf you enjoy blowing up endless streams of aliens, or enjoy tactical squad-based combat, you will enjoy this game.","April 8, 2015","true","280.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

Small squad takes on infinite bugs.\n\nI find the most interesting of strategic decisions are the ones I’m forced to make after the situation changes unexpectedly. The core mechanics of Infested Planet build those situations into the game. Every success of mine as a player is met with a random twist on the part of the AI. This creates a set of situations which are at once familiar to long-term players, but also interesting even with the repetition.\n\nAlso, this mutation mechanic helps avoid the core pain of many single player RTS campaigns: these maps aren’t puzzles, but rather are a constantly changing set of challenges.\n\nThe other important bit that makes this game enjoyable: single mistakes are usually recoverable. As a player, I found it easy to create a stalemate that would allow me the space to think and breath and plan. And if I tried something that didn’t work, it was usually fairly easy to get back into that stalemate situation while I something new. Mistakes were usually punished just enough for me to know that I’d made one, but not so hard as to cause me to restart my entire attempt.

Your squad consists of only a few individuals and automated defences, and for them to defend a map's various capture points requires a great deal of strategy in their positioning and equipment.\n\nBecause the aliens randomly mutate (gain new abilities and units) the further you advance, the tactics required for every battle will be different, and the strategic situation in each battle is always changing. A single soldier with a flamethrower may be able to hold of a swarm of basic enemies indefinitely, but when the aliens mutate they may start sending ranged enemies that will eviscerate the short-ranged flame trooper, or armoured tower spawners that will make his position indefensible. A hard decision will have to be made whether to retreat, or to reassign valuable soldiers from other vital points to help him. Resources have to be carefully balanced to plug every gap in your lines. Your defence is rarely stable for long on more difficult missions, but all upgrades and emplacements are completely refundable, allowing you to continually adapt your strategy to changing circumstances.\n\nThe only real cons I can think of for this game are that the music is droning and uninteresting, and sound effects and animation arent great, but this hardly detracts from the excellent mechanics of the game, and Infested Planet's visuals make up for this by being crisp and colourful.","January 17","true","22.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

But I agree with the other negative reviews, you reach a point where the difficulty turns into a brick wall. And because you're so INCREDIBLY limited in your units and build points, and because in those levels you're massively under siege the second the level starts, there's not like this great range of creative strategies you can play with. You've got five guys - I never got the chance to build the cool stuff I kept winning, I was having to use my points to spawn emergency troops to defend my ground - upgrading to shotgun troops was a luxury in those stages. And because you're so limited, yes, it feels like there's exactly one strategy and one build order that has any chance of working, and that if you take a wrong turn early you'll wind up with an unwinnable level (with nine alien colonies all stuck together, defending each other with turrets, making even a one-by-one assault impossible).\n\nThat's just not enjoyable for me in a game of this genre, where I'm just randomly trying different things until I stumble across the exact perfect sequence the developers want. The difficulty truly feels cheap, like I'm just not being given any options.  By that point in the game I should be starting to feel powerful, with lots of cool options I can whip out against an overwhelming enemy.  I never felt that in this game.\n","March 28","false","9.3"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

Instead of just another indie title, it's a full, polished and compelling single-player campaign with some nice little extras like weekly challenges. While it's great in terms of gameplay and campaign, it's also fairly shallow overall, and can get repetitive after you've explored all the tech and research, but it's still very much worth at least a single campaign play-through, which clocks in at a minimum of around 6 hours, and a great game overall.\n\nHighlights\nWhere this shines above similar titles is the simple, refined and fun gameplay. It's not the deepest strategy game around, and the focus is on units here, rather than structures as in traditional RTSs'. Rocket Bear have cleverly added the strategy elements here, and worked on the mechanics like quick queueing of unit orders, quickly selecting and switching between units, intelligent prioritization based on weapons, and plenty of little things that make strategy and micro-control matter more as the game gets harder and fuller and you progress through the campaign. It's a nice switch of focus from traditional RTS, and it's done very well.\n\nThe difficulty has been optimized well too, and this game can generally be played very casually, with a focus on brute force and repetition for those who don't want to think or micro too hard, but at the same time it doesn't take away anything from those who do, and even encourages faster times for completion which means getting smart, fast and learning to hot key and micro really well will be rewarding for you in a way many other titles don't offer.\n\n* The soundtrack too, is pretty under stated and very good at keeping pace and mood while also being fun tracks. I found myself humming along with the title screen and in game a few times. The artist and a couple of demo tracks can be found here[helpcomputer.bandcamp.com]. It's just a shame there are so few tracks.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nThere are a few annoyances and perhaps mis-steps here, but they're mostly unnoticeable and overall don't harm the game in any big way. The most encompassing problem I kept running into was the lack of solid tutorial/guide elements which meant that I'd continually reach a stage in latter maps where I didn't know what to do to get further, and only by experimenting over and over with new strategies til I found something that worked on different parts of the map could I move forward. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in most strategy games, since the player is expected to learn to progress, but even with the few intro missions, there are so many aspects of this game that you often don't have any clue on possible strategies as a new player and may simply hit a brick wall over and over.\n\nThe other thing worth mentioning is that the menu system is somewhat discombobulated and annoying. Units, for example, are listed on the top left in a bar, the unit buy/sell select at the opposing side, and the structure/research menu trees and further option/triggers to the bottom right. This means that unless you're 100% familiar with the hot keys then you'll continually find yourself staring at opposite corners of the screen to view information and select options. Add in the game options being in a middle menu, the progress buttons being further down on title screens, the screen swap selections being in another location on different menus and other strange placements and things get even more erratic. It's a strange albeit minor issue that could easily be refined.\n\nRecommendations\nPriced at £10.99/14.99€/$14.99 and £13.59/17.99€/$17.99 for the Deluxe Version (which includes the DLC) at the time of review, Infested Planet does seem a little steep on price, especially when compared to competitors. Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal, for example, is cheaper and offers near countless re-playability and content. However, clocking in at around 6-8 hours for the campaign and at least double that for completionists and when considering the harder difficulties and skirmish mode and weekly challenges, it's still good value for money if you're likely to sink a lot of time into it. For everyone else I'd recommend waiting for a sale of -50% or lower to make this a fantastic deal.\n\n* The Trickster's Arsenal DLC is priced at £3.99/4.99€/$4.99 and a worthwhile addition, adding a level of difficulty with new enemies and mutators, and new weapons and abilities that mix up gameplay. However it's also quite small in terms of content and since the price of the base game is already a contention issue, I feel the content should have been included in the game, or reduced in price. If you've played through the campaign and want to sink more time into Infested Planet, it's a great buy, for anyone else, it's worth waiting.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/204530/\n\nUnedited review notes 19/09/2015 for Infested Planet:\n\n-Annoying menu system, and no way to start a new campaign?\n-Lack of on-point tutorial elements\n+Under stated and fairly good soundtrack\n+First time I've seen an option to select amount of CPU cores in a small game","September 19, 2015","true","8.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has elements of tower defense, Creeper World, and occasionally evokes classics like Syndicate or Cannon Fodder with its small squad mobile combat.  Resource management, area control and denial, timing, and concentration of force versus surface of defense - these are the sorts of challenges this game is about, and although it tackles them simply, there's enough going on that it's not simplistic.  Although this is not a huge game, it isn't asking for huge game money, and what's there is well put together.  The campaign has slightly above-average video game writing and characters; not worth playing the game for, but skippable, and I didn't skip all the dialogue so it must be doing something right.  Mostly it teaches you how to play the game and introduces some fun scenarios to test yourself against.\nWhere the game falls down is in its repetitiveness on higher difficulties; it's very easy to fight yourself into a stalemate where you don't quite have the resources to push.  You'll gain ground by inches over tens of minutes, and then lose it again in seconds.  So this game can feel pretty sisyphean at its toughest, which some players might enjoy, but I found sometimes frustrating.  I also wish there was more to the game - the high level techs offer you a decent number of options, and many of them are useful, but it often felt there was either one clear way to deal with a situation, or no good way.  Some more scenarios would be nice - the randomly generated missions are great, but more varied objectives and scenarios would greatly improve replayability.\nStill, there's something strangely compelling about the experience, and it has a certain old-school charm.  Certainly not without flaws, then, Infested Planet delivers on its promise with craftsmanship and conviction, and at a very reasonable price point.","January 13","true","22.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I jumped back into it the other night after finishing it way back in a much earlier stage.  Found that the dev had added many more story missions as well as 2 random mission paths (one timed with bonuses, the other untimed with straight payout).  I disagree with the rant on the graphics.  They are decent and good gamplay always trumps eye candy in my opinion.  Especially when I have few laptops of varying graphics capabitilities that I tend to switch back and forth depending on the situation.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, the difficulty increases rapidly with the new updates (not sure if what I had played previously has changed), and your standard marine becomes obsolete very quickly with each mission.  This brings me to my main suggestion for improvement (according to myself).  Your BP is a bit too low at the start of each mission for my tastes, and because of that, along with how weak the standard marine is in the mid to late game, I spend all my BP points earned throughout the game on upgrading my starting marines as well as the few reinforcements I get (and the occasional turret).  It would be nice to have enought to dabble with some of the buildings and other structures as well.  Maybe have unused BP at the end of each mission carry over to the next?  I don't know.  Just a thought.  Seems like that would promote getting the most out of what you start with (which is what the game does already) as well as rewarding you for doing it well.\n\nAnyway, the game is easily worth it for the 50% you get right now.  It is a bit rewarding when it's all you can do to hold the line on three fronts, wondering how you are going to get the upper hand, and then you figure something out that ends up in victory.  I do enjoy that.","December 27, 2013","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The basic premise is that the enemy has infinitely spawning alien bugs, and you have infinitely spawning Marines. Your job is to slowly advance your territory, conquering enemy hives and turning them into bases. More bases gives you more resources to summon more marines, or to equip them with bigger weapons, or build enhancements on your bases.\n\nOf course there's a catch: Every time you conquer a hive, the enemy gains a new bonus, such as more armor for its insects, the ability to spawn new types of insects, longer ranged attacks, or whatever. This essentially means that as you're gaining more resources, you also need to spread your forces thinner to protect all of your bases, and the enemy is also getting stronger, so the match gets more difficult as it goes on.\n\nIt's not a very difficult game. I found it to be a fun challenge for me and I beat the story campaign in about 7-8 hours, but I'm really bad at RTS games. A seasoned veteran of Starcraft and similar games should probably steer clear, because it will just be too easy for you.","June 27, 2014","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Lots of gribblies to shoot, lots of fast-paced on-the-fly squad tinkering (you can swap out weapon loadouts instantly as you are playing between squad members) It seems silly in terms of realism, but given the pace of the game (particularly once you get to later levels or try some of the more advanced skirmish maps, which you can make as hard or easy as you want) you'll understand why. You roam the map taking down alien hives, every few you kill the enemy gets a random mutation to make things more difficult, some are awkward, some are devestating, some are pointless without other mutations, but it keeps things fresh figuring out the tech buildings you need to use or the equiptment you need to take in order to counter the new mutation.\n\nHighly recommended, i'd dearly love to see a sequel to this, preferably with an even larger and more varied tech tree to unlock with my hard earned cash - it seems a bit too easy at the moment to just grind mid-level repeatable "search and destroy" missions to unlock everything pretty fast.\n\nAbsolutely worth your time, highly recommended!","March 4, 2014","true","22.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I love "marines vs aliens" games, and I found out about this game accidentally. In the beginning I was dubious to buy it because of the below-average graphics. In the end, I decided to go ahead thanks to other gamers' reviews, some specialized magazine impressions and that it was on sale for half the price. And what a good decision it was, as Infested Planet is a joy to play. So far I am about 10 hours played, and still having a blast just like the first time.\n\nLet me speak a bit of what this game is about: It is a blend of RTS and Tower-defense genres, though instead of TD's typical waves you have to face a constant stream of dozens of thousands aliens. The key in this game is to control the huge constant flow of enemies with a handful of marines, with the help of quite different loadouts (sniper guns, shotguns, flamethrowers...) and the support of several buildings that add various passive buffs (like health regeneration, grenades for your marines, so on) and active abilities (aerial support, different turrets deployments...).\n\nIn order to win, you have to conquer all aliens' nests, which act like some kind of hardpoint bases. Once you destroy one nest, and conquer it, you build one of your bases on top of it. This act gives you points that you can invest on upgrading your marine's arsenal, build support facilities or deploy turrets/mines. These variation lets you try very different tactics and approaches. However, the aliens also gain "evolution" perks when they loose one nest, making them tougher to win. These perks vary from match to match (like the map, which is randomized), but include faster creatures, more range for their turrets, improved poisons and so on.\n\nThe difficulty is challenging but fair, and the first campaign's missions make it easier for you to catch the ropes of the game.\n\nThere are a few game modes. The first one is the campaign, where you advance by winning somewhat-varied scenarios. While you advance, you will find side-missions which are randomized but belong to three different modes: "Domination", where you have to overcome all nests against difficult odds, "Survival", where you have to survive for a period of time, and "Go-Go faster" where you have a limited time to capture the next nest.\n\nIn spite of the campaign looking short so far (I think I will beat it in about 15 hours), there is a lot of replayability, thanks to the different game modes, and weekly challenges where you can compare your performance against other players.\n\nIn summary: If you can forget about the graphics, and like "marines vs. aliens" games, you will find in this game a precious little gem that can keep you entertained for 20 hours or more.

Controls, graphics, animations, etc are all great.\n\nMy only criticism is the wording of the "single mission use" unlocks - these actually appear to unlock a "single upgrade" for use on any mission - making them much more valable than what I understood them to be (I thought it was use it and then lose it).

The graphics are very good for the style of game it is (indie, clusterf*ck of aliens, etc). The gameplay is functional, with a unique resource system. In my 14.6 hours (as of writing this review), I found myself amazed at how they handled difficulty throughout the campaign.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of how the difficulty scaling works throughout the campaign:\nBefore you have many upgrades, the game feels really simple. Enemies are relatively easy to deal with at the beginning, with little to no challenge.\n\nThen in the middle of the game, things start to get a bit tricky. At this point, you need to develop a tactic that works for mostly any situation.\n\nLate in the game, the difficulty SPIKES AND DOES SO VERY HEAVILY. The attack and defend style of gameplay becomes frantic, and you ABSOLUTELY MUST KEEP DEFENSES EVEN WHEN RUSHING ATTACK! I can't tell you how many times my progress was completely negated because of the enemies recapturing points I've taken.\n\nThe beginning draws your interest, the late game becomes the style of interest similar to games like Dark Souls!\n\nFor those who haven't played Dark Souls: the fun and interest in it comes from finding out how you need to set up to effectively beat a certain area/enemy. While it's never 1 enemy in Infested Planet, the similarities are more than there.\n\nSummary: If you like RTS games, but would like the ability to have a more flexible playstyle and be required to do so, and would rather have a resource system that's more consistent and engaging, GET THIS GAME NOW. Adaptability is key in this game, and the resource system allows you to change out your tactic on-the-fly. I can't say much for the story (I don't play games for the story, and didn't pay attention over half of the time), but the rest works BEAUTIFULLY.\n\nFor an Indie game: 9.5/10\nOverall rating: 8/10\n\nAlmost forgot: The way the different units are handled is quite nice. While the game may tell you that the heavy gunners are the most fierce fighters or something like that, you quickly find out that even they lack in certain areas. All of the troops have their purpose, and you won't win a mission with just 1 type of them later on. Knowing your troops is just as important as keeping track of your other upgrades/buildings.\n\nEnd note: I do have the Trickster's Arsenal DLC. It says on there that it improves the campaign (along with adding other tools at your disposal), so I don't know what the game is like by itself. It's all of an extra $3 to get the Delux edition, so definitely go ahead and get that while you're at it. It's worth it. :)","February 3","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are very good for the style of game it is (indie, clusterf*ck of aliens, etc). The gameplay is functional, with a unique resource system. In my 14.6 hours (as of writing this review), I found myself amazed at how they handled difficulty throughout the campaign.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of how the difficulty scaling works throughout the campaign:\nBefore you have many upgrades, the game feels really simple. Enemies are relatively easy to deal with at the beginning, with little to no challenge.\n\nThen in the middle of the game, things start to get a bit tricky. At this point, you need to develop a tactic that works for mostly any situation.\n\nLate in the game, the difficulty SPIKES AND DOES SO VERY HEAVILY. The attack and defend style of gameplay becomes frantic, and you ABSOLUTELY MUST KEEP DEFENSES EVEN WHEN RUSHING ATTACK! I can't tell you how many times my progress was completely negated because of the enemies recapturing points I've taken.\n\nThe beginning draws your interest, the late game becomes the style of interest similar to games like Dark Souls!\n\nFor those who haven't played Dark Souls: the fun and interest in it comes from finding out how you need to set up to effectively beat a certain area/enemy. While it's never 1 enemy in Infested Planet, the similarities are more than there.\n\nSummary: If you like RTS games, but would like the ability to have a more flexible playstyle and be required to do so, and would rather have a resource system that's more consistent and engaging, GET THIS GAME NOW. Adaptability is key in this game, and the resource system allows you to change out your tactic on-the-fly. I can't say much for the story (I don't play games for the story, and didn't pay attention over half of the time), but the rest works BEAUTIFULLY.\n\nFor an Indie game: 9.5/10\nOverall rating: 8/10\n\nAlmost forgot: The way the different units are handled is quite nice. While the game may tell you that the heavy gunners are the most fierce fighters or something like that, you quickly find out that even they lack in certain areas. All of the troops have their purpose, and you won't win a mission with just 1 type of them later on. Knowing your troops is just as important as keeping track of your other upgrades/buildings.\n\nEnd note: I do have the Trickster's Arsenal DLC. It says on there that it improves the campaign (along with adding other tools at your disposal), so I don't know what the game is like by itself. It's all of an extra $3 to get the Delux edition, so definitely go ahead and get that while you're at it. It's worth it. :)","February 3","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No one strategy will always work, as the enemy aliens always evolve differently for each battle (giving them new abilities). This forces you to consider your options and adapt your fighting style.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MontyFang/recommended/204530/","MontyFang","Jelrin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MontyFang/","154 products in account","I bought the game during the Winter Sale. And I am not disappointed in the slightest. Infected Planet sports deceptively simple controls and mechanics. You shouldn't have a problem learning how the controls work if you're familiar with any kind of RTS. Seeing your squad march against seemingly endless hordes surely brought a smile to my face as they carved a path of Alien blood to their goal. And you're sure to get worked up as men fall one by one and you're forced to make a full retreat to your nearest bunker and hold the fort until reinforcements arrive.\n\nYou start off fairly simple, spawning into a Map with a Squad of five Riflemen in the opening level. Here you get a basic rundown of entry controls for commanding your unit and attacking. As well as how to complete objectives. Which mostly consist of taking all the control points on the map from alien hands. Other times you will have to protect several bases, or take the fight to them and kill as many of them as you can before time runs out. Capturing, or destroying a base (in the case of Raid missions) yields you BP which you use to switch up units in your squad, add members to it, create various turrets and defenses, or create structures that grant passive bonuses to help you out in the fight. The fun really begins when you start mixing and matching unit types, via upgrades you purchase in between missions with reward money you get. And you don't need to worry about not having enough money for them either. All the missions are infinitely replayable for farming or just to see how fast you can wipe out the enemy.\n\nIt isn't without a few flaws, however. At times you will lose track of your units, or be completely overwhelmed by a sudden increase in enemy difficulty via mutations. This may make some of the more casual players shy away, as you will have moments where a Tug-of-war situation suddenly falls into the enemy's favor after a long stalemate. Some minor improvements could include refining how you keep track of units. Maybe an at-a-glance color coded minimap could help if applied correctly. Overall, these minor gripes don't take away from the overall gameplay, and you can easily lose track of time as you watch your squad cut through endless amounts of aliens for hours on end.\n\nThe game is still in it's Beta Stage, but I'm already seeing tons of promise with the game's Skirmish mode, where you can play preset maps, or tweak several options and create your own unique mission. From the number of enemy hives on the map, to how long they spawn alien waves, right to the mutations and amount of funding you have at the start. This shows amazing potential for being a far deeper custom map generator using simple options. I've had my eye on Infected Planet for while, and I can say that if you're interested in trying it out, you should buy it and give it a try.","December 26, 2013","true","27.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There does appear to be multiple strategies in solving most maps, but some are better (or more rewarding) than others.\n\nI've played since early beta, and Alex has made tremendously good changes to the game over the past 6-8 months.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MontyFang/recommended/204530/","MontyFang","Jelrin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MontyFang/","154 products in account","I bought the game during the Winter Sale. And I am not disappointed in the slightest. Infected Planet sports deceptively simple controls and mechanics. You shouldn't have a problem learning how the controls work if you're familiar with any kind of RTS. Seeing your squad march against seemingly endless hordes surely brought a smile to my face as they carved a path of Alien blood to their goal. And you're sure to get worked up as men fall one by one and you're forced to make a full retreat to your nearest bunker and hold the fort until reinforcements arrive.\n\nYou start off fairly simple, spawning into a Map with a Squad of five Riflemen in the opening level. Here you get a basic rundown of entry controls for commanding your unit and attacking. As well as how to complete objectives. Which mostly consist of taking all the control points on the map from alien hands. Other times you will have to protect several bases, or take the fight to them and kill as many of them as you can before time runs out. Capturing, or destroying a base (in the case of Raid missions) yields you BP which you use to switch up units in your squad, add members to it, create various turrets and defenses, or create structures that grant passive bonuses to help you out in the fight. The fun really begins when you start mixing and matching unit types, via upgrades you purchase in between missions with reward money you get. And you don't need to worry about not having enough money for them either. All the missions are infinitely replayable for farming or just to see how fast you can wipe out the enemy.\n\nIt isn't without a few flaws, however. At times you will lose track of your units, or be completely overwhelmed by a sudden increase in enemy difficulty via mutations. This may make some of the more casual players shy away, as you will have moments where a Tug-of-war situation suddenly falls into the enemy's favor after a long stalemate. Some minor improvements could include refining how you keep track of units. Maybe an at-a-glance color coded minimap could help if applied correctly. Overall, these minor gripes don't take away from the overall gameplay, and you can easily lose track of time as you watch your squad cut through endless amounts of aliens for hours on end.\n\nThe game is still in it's Beta Stage, but I'm already seeing tons of promise with the game's Skirmish mode, where you can play preset maps, or tweak several options and create your own unique mission. From the number of enemy hives on the map, to how long they spawn alien waves, right to the mutations and amount of funding you have at the start. This shows amazing potential for being a far deeper custom map generator using simple options. I've had my eye on Infected Planet for while, and I can say that if you're interested in trying it out, you should buy it and give it a try.","December 26, 2013","true","27.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You command a squad of 5 or so marines that try to accomplish certain objectives, usually capturing alien bases, as you capture bases or capture resource crates you can upgrade your marines to different attack types or build upgrade buildings (equivalent of researching upgrades).  It was a lot of fun figuring out the mechanics of the system and how to manage your resources, then trying out different tactics to capture the alien hives (bases).  As you progress in the game, the aliens 'mutate' different abilities to keep you on your toes. If you are not paying attention that 'burrowing hive' ability may have popped up a hive behind your front line and is now in ur base killin ur barracks.\n\nIf you get really stuck, you can buy upgrades to start with for a single mission with in game money. I kept playing after I finished the story campaign to knock out all the acheivements. All in all roughly 25 hours of play, including farming money to tackle the last 'Raid' mission acheivement.\n\nA few quick tips for the later levels after you read the guides.\nTry to always attack hives with at least one Flamer in the group\nOne officer and a minigunner are REALLY handy for tackling late level raids/missions where hives are clustered 3-4 at once. Keep moving one to the next. Keep the mini focused on the hive, it will eat through any shielding easily, while the flamer distracts the towers, and the marine(s) protect the mini.\nDon't be afraid to switch your classes around, change them to scout to sneak really fast to a spot (Like back to defend a base), then switch them to minigunner or whatever.\nKeep an eye on your map and the mutations in play. Be ready to defend against burrowers, or tower spawners, or if you see a squad of clones/mimics be sure to change one of your people to a sniper (for Minigunners) or scout.\nLife support > Medic pod. Medic pod only heals ONE person at a time near it, Life Support for only one or two points more heals EVERYTHING (buildings) and everyone.\nMarine>turret. If you need to defend a spot, try to use mines. They never run out, and are effective against almost EVERYTHING.  If not, use a marine, they are much more versatile.  Turrets are expensive and die quickly in middle/late levels, you better have Engineering to autorebuild it by then.\nEngineering is a tactician's dream. You can pop offensive mines, build or recycle anything, anywhere on the map.\nIn EVERY game mode other than raid, take advantage of the fact that the hives won't mutate until you start capturing. Go sneak a scout and steal all the crates, kill defenders with grenades, if you die, keep inching the crates in and then switch your scout to something else before you begin your attack.\n","July 14, 2015","true","33.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

With you micromanaging a team of units to go kill towers that spawn enemies continuously. You upgrade your guys and build things to make the killing go  easier. I honestly wasn't expecting too much from such a cheap game but the final few missions were very difficult.\n\nAfter getting past the somewhat janky interface to move your units the gameplay blends pretty well. I wish there was a minimap so that I could get a proper birds eye view of the battle field rather than needing to zoom out.\n\nThe game does have its issues though, Money is not all that important once you've purchased all the upgrades since you would only spend it on consumables. The shotgun is also exceedingly strong and works for pretty much every situation so there was little desire to go beyond officers and shotguns when deciding your team buildup. The enemy also gets random mutations which make certain fights easy and certain fights tedious.\n\nHowever despite all the issues the game is solid and if it was on sale for as cheap as during the steam sale definetly look into buying it.","January 16","true","6.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fathottopicdiva/recommended/204530/","fathottopicdiva","bobert awful (F+)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fathottopicdiva/","690 products in account","I'm convinced that most real-time strategy games shouldn't bother with an actual lore and storyline. The ones with better storylines usually crib their source material from conflicts in history, and I usually gloss over those because there's a sense of THIS IS ROOTED IN HISTORY, IT'S LIKE I'M ACTUALLY THERE via gameplay (what I like to call the Saving Private Ryan approach). Beyond that... oh Christ. The Dawn of War series comes to mind as my first go-to answer for why RTS games shouldn't bother, largely because Warhammer (40K and otherwise) is a gigantic batch of poorly written juvenile ♥♥♥♥ with all the depth and appeal of a moody teenager sitting in a dark room slapping the dolls from all of his Collector's Edition video games together. ("Anything by Blizzard" is an immediate runner-up, mainly because Blizzard rips off Warhammer lock, stock, and barrel and any attempt I've made to read any lore for one of their universes made me wish I hadn't.). Infested Planet ALMOST sidesteps this.\n\nInfested Planet is a wonderful distillation of the real-time strategy genre. It pares the structure of a typical RTS down to a few buildings, a few soldiers, and the ability to instantly change your soldiers and abilities on the fly. The enemy is entrenched and reacts to upgrade itself, and sometimes you'll find that the strategy you're employing won't work at all in the face of shielded buildings and mimic squads that copy your squad exactly to kill your own soldiers. And even if the enemy succeeds in kicking your ♥♥♥ and taking your bases, you can refund your previously built kit and try a new strategy. The enemy captured your siege cannon? No prob, just switch a grunt from a sniper to a scout and have that scout weaken the building while the rest of the squad puts lots of bullets in it. Want to destroy a series of hives and then set up an area to protect your new base of operations? Go with an officer and four minigunners, kill them all, then switch to shotgunners and flamethrowers and spend the rest of your resources on defense encampments. It's a wonderful game that allows and forces players adapt to unforseen developments (and there are plenty of those that the enemy is willing to pull out in order to destroy your dumb little squad of soldiers).\n\nIf you're going to play it, however, I recommend that you play the campaign up to a point, because that's where the game keeps the 'random' missions. The campaign is almost where I fell out of love with Infested Planet. Not just because I have to play something I don't want to play to unlock features inside the game, but also because the campaign's learning and difficulty curve moves up too slowly, and it also keeps taking away the focus from the free-wheeling dance of terror with a plodding story about an army that invades a bug-infested planet and then the planet fights back and then the bugs kill the army and then the stranded sexy female scientist pulls out a bioweapon and the big bug hivemind is destroyed in the last mission and it is told with the same amount of care and excitement employed in this run-on sentence. A lot of the included campaign is boring and stifles what makes this game great. Infested Planet doesn't need a campaign mode and a cast of characters talking over soldiers shooting alien bugs to 'flesh out the lore' (but if the developers insist, get someone who can actually write this sort of thing). Infested Planet's magic lies in its skirmishes and random missions.","August 9, 2015","true","11.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I will, however, keep it on here as a reminder of how far along Infested Planet has come.\n\nInfested Planet is a top down RTS game that combines mobile tower defense with a king-of-the-hill aspect. The development team has come a long way in a short time (a few months) since my last post. They have been doing a lot of hard work to create a challenging and fair environment for the players.\n\nThe later missions are very difficult, putting your knowledge of the various units to the test. In order to complete them you will have to combine a number of different tech buildings and unit types in order to overcome the various enemies.\n\nIn-game unit details are not amazing, but they are informative. When you hover your cursor over a tech it will give you generalized information on what the unit does, including the hotkey it is assigned too. For instance, the officer unit tells you that after 'destroying a hive units gain %200 attack speed' but it does not tell you how long the buff lasts. You'll just have to become familiar with the units yourself, knowing their capabilities.\n\nWhen completing missions you will be awarded cash/credits/money based on a set value or a number of factors including how well you did. This cash is used in the out-of-game shop menu in order to purchase different tech/units to use in game. The shop also has additional units or unit buffs for the next match you play, increasing your chance of winning by giving you more/better units.\n\nSkirmishes are now balanced and fair for the player. The new code checks the map for specific variables which gives the player a fair start. This allows for a challenging experience from beginner to master.\n\nOver all, Infested Planet has come a long way since its beta period.\n\n8 out of 10.\n-Kamlyn\n\nOld Review: Infested planet is not a bad "flash game" because that's basically what it is. You play top down and control a squad to defend points and take points, much like king of the hill meets mobile tower defense. It's not bad, but I honestly think it needs some balancing. The randomized skirmish maps can easily make completing it a piece of cake, or a two hour long slug fest which results in a loss. I find a lot of the "Research/Tech" buildings to be completely useless, costing too many bonus points in a match to really be able to build unless your steam rolling in which case you don’t need them anyway. Without purchasing "Free Buffs/Units" from the shop the later levels are extremely difficult to complete which is good if your looking for a hardcore challenge. Infested Planet is regularly patched but is considered a final release, so small things will change here and there. IMHO, I also think the "Free Buff/Unit" shop purchases need to be removed. Maybe an experience bar instead of a cash inflow to unlock your research, this way there would also be no excess "money".\n-EDIT: After additional playing and reading of others reviews and partial guides (aka. better explained unit abilities, which I think Infested Planet needs a complete page for itself. Properly explaining units and there abilities full effects) I conclude that with proper use of units and strategy can lead to a satisfying result (A win, or a "did-your-best" loss).\n-EDIT 14 Jan 2014: There has been a change in the unit lineup. Your all useful medic has been removed, and this techno box thing with medic capabilities (which can be towed by a unit) has replaced it! The Medic Box costs 5 BP instead of 6BP, making it cheaper, but I find that it is: much easier to destroy, increases micro required, and even further decreased my enjoyment of Infested Planet. The medic was replaced by the officer upgrade, and I find that it seriously lacks. The officer inspires your units to do better by moving faster. he only increases your units rate of fire IF they KILL A HIVE. Why doesn't he just give a passive bonus since he's inspiring them? If you cant tell this is a bias edit. I really enjoyed the medic as a unit and now I'm left with this easy to destroy thing.\nFIXED-BUG: Don't forget to change your hotkeys otherwise you won't be able to quickly build the Medic Box. Even after setting my hotkeys I couldn't easily build it, and was FORCED to left click the buff...\n-EDIT 28 Jan 2014, Patch 14: With the new patch 14 out it gives me some hope. Although I have not yet had the time to play around in patch 14, it looks as though it has fixed a few issues I had been having with the pervious partial patch. Will update post when I've had a chance to play.\n-EDIT 20 March 2014: So I took a vacation from Infested Planet in order to allow the Dev's time to implement a lot of patching instead of one or two and ranting on a small change. As a Dev has so graciously posted in my review I would like to go over the recent changes which has made me enjoy Infested Planet more than I previously did (See beginning of review).\n\n8 out of 10 stars,\n-Kamlyn","December 31, 2013","true","19.3"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","25","49","0","0"

The struggle to match the alien mutations and suprise attacks can take a long time.\nBut the game does not punish you too hard if you lose a lot of ground, often you can regroup, recover what you lost and still score a satisfying win in the end.\nReminds me a bit of Starship Troopers.

When I finally saw it was on sale, I got the Deluxe Edition right away.\n\nOh boy, it is fun!\n\nI think the closest comparison to how this game feels is the film Starship Troopers. The core of the game is as follows: on each randomly generated map, there are several capture points. One of them is yours, and the rest are the aliens'. You have to send your small team of marines to capture these points. However, there is a hive to destroy on each one, protected by automated defenses, not to mention the ENDLESS stream of bugs that will go after you. By capturing points and collecting some crates spread around the map you get resources that you can spend on more marines (dead ones respawn), new weapons for your marines, turrets, robot medics, global abilities and more. However, since these resources are limited, you will have to decide and eventually recycle your buys because...\n\n... the aliens aren't static either. For each point you capture, they will get a permanent mutation according to your strategies. For example, using flamethrowers might cause their poison turrets to have a knockback effect, or have a much longer range. Their hives might start to spit acid themselves. Their critters and spawners might enter frenzy mode after you capture a point. They might start to spawn hardened critters, living bombs or even clones of your marines! As the aliens adapt, you'll have to adapt as well, by recycling upgrades (for 100% of their cost) and reconsidering your strategy. There are a lot of mutations and upgrades, so the game never gets old.\n\nThe game has a campaign, random skirmishes and "weekly challenges" where you compete with other players for a place on the leaderboard. The campaign is quite varied, and serves both as an introduction and as a way to play special missions, like escorting a convoy or testing a new lifeform. You'll earn credits by completing these increasingly difficult missions, which you can spend on unlocking all these cool upgrades for your marines (I guess in Skirmish mode all of these upgrades are already unlocked). The story is cliché, but enjoyable.\n\nI highly recommend getting the Trickster's Arsenal DLC. It adds new toys for both your marines and the aliens, among other stuff, giving some nice additional variety to an already varied game. If you can, get the Deluxe edition!\n\nI must mention the dev is making another DLC that adds a conquest-like campaing, where you would be capturing regions of the planet via regular missions, and unlocking upgrades as in the current story campaign. Since he announced he was working on it on March, I'd say we can expect this new DLC to arrive soon...\n\nFinally, the simplicity of the graphics means it will probably run super smoothly on the vast majority of computers. Units and effects are simple but pretty, and retain a lot of detail if fully zoomed in. It does look and sound nice to me.\n\nOh, and one can't review this game without mentioning the HUGE bodycount. On the post-mission summary, it's normal to have killed tens of thousands of aliens and having lost tens of marines. A nice reminder of the scale of the battles!\n\nTo finish my review: a game that is genuinely fun to play, that will make you think to overcome the AI's reactions to your own strategies, with a lot of ways to play, and space marines vs bugs, plus continued dev support. Do I recommend it? Hell yeah!","June 2","true","13.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's really easy to pick up, and is a lot of fun. I'd thoroughly recommend it for full price. If it's on sale, it's an even better deal.\n\nI've been reworking some of my reviews, to be slightly better. As you can see above, my original review was pretty uninformative.\n\nSo when I think of this game, I think of it as a Starcraft Lite. What I mean when I say this is Starcraft is a very skill heavy RTS game; it has kind of a high skill floor. Infested Planet does not. It's a top down RTS that's very simple.\nYou start with a base and a few marines, and some money to spend on the marines or your base. Your objective is to capture all the points on the map (usually, campaign stuff varies). You'll have to kill the bugs in your way to do that. To do this, you can upgrade your units via indirect upgrades (buildings that upgrade your marines) or directly upgrade your marines. You can spend money to change your starting marine from a marine to a flame trooper, or a scout, or a shotgunner. From there, you can send your marines to their death, just to have them respawn in roughly 10 seconds. Your army constantly replenishes. If you have 5 marines, and they all die, they'll respawn at the nearest control point after a short timer. They keep their classes and everything. So marines dying really isn't that big of a deal. If you also decide you don't like building A, and you don't like that the one marine is a flame trooper, you can refund both, and get all your money back. The game is very flexible, in regards to what you can quickly do to change your strategies.\nThere are also commander abilities you can use by using commander points. Commander points slowly come back, or you can pick up items in the game that refresh it. The abilities all do different things, like a helicopter strike. All of them can be incredibly useful, depending on your end goal.\nThis game also has dlc that adds some more abilities for you to use. I bought it for $2.50 and it was totally worth it.\n\nIf you want a simple but fun RTS, I'd highly recommend picking up this game. It's a good bargain at the price.","February 25","true","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Requires a bit of strategy but it isn't very intense. It is sort of short and it can be repeditive nothing really changes but it doesnt really need to be.\n\nI would suggest waiting to get it on sale as it isn't a GREAT 10/10 game that you need now, but I also have no regrets buying it.\n\nThe game itself is very simple, and i did not encounter any bugs or glitches but in the later levels if you don't do things very quickly and in a certain way it can be impossible to beat, as the enemies get really powerful buffs that can be smothering. but that is my only real critique of the game.\n\noverall I would give it a 7/10","May 21","true","19.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are thinking about buying this game late in the night, just wait until tomorrow morning and make your decision then. You are better off that way.\n\n--\nLonger review\n\nI had the strong craving for a new strategy game and came across Infested Planet. Initially I was skeptical of the game, primarily due to the poor graphics, however I did not want to spend more than $20 tonight, read a few of the reviews and also looked at the gameplay... and thus I bought it.\n\nThe beginning of the game reminded me of some flashgames over at armorgames.com, only that I am not playing the game in the browser. I went along with and played a few of the missions, which were fairly easy until the levels substantially increased in difficulty. I don't dislike difficulty... unless that is the only thing that drives the entire game! Granted, you have some buffs and upgrades, but every mission is the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing. It's like playing skirmish, while increasing the difficulty of the AI every time you win. The story itself is rather uninteresting and after reading 2 of the messages, I just skipped through the rest of them, as they just became a nuisance.\n\nUltimately, I would only recommend this game to those who... screw it, I don't recommend it at all.

Now the computer has a fresh flame thrower.\n- Same thing goes for turrets/siege towers\n- Double costs of towers, you pay for the tower, and then there's the privelege of paying to use the ability of the tower.\n- Grind, grind, grind\n- If you're crazy enough to beat it, there is ZERO replay value.\n\nThe difficulty ramps up on each mission the closer you get to completing it.  You destroy part of the enemy base and the enemy gets a mutation that makes the mission more difficult but it stays somewhat balanced, however at times the computer goes into cheap mode and spawns a whole lot of crap out of nowhere.\n\nOn the final mission there is no such destroy mechanic.  The computer gets mutations based on time, so the first one at 10 seconds, next at 20 seconds, and so on and so forth meanwhile you are barely getting by until eventually you become overrun at which point you need to grind previous missions to get money to give youself extra resources for that final mission.\n\nAll of this translates to frustration and a huge waste of time.  I loved the game, but that last mission alone turned me off so much that I have digitally "binned" this.","July 30, 2015","false","13.3"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

Most people online from what I read gave up on the mission 'preperations' I myself barely beat it bercause the monsters go berserk and gameover in like 10 seconds if you dont have turrets up. another bad point of the game is something called mutations after you capture some enemy points the aliens (Locals) get mad and zerg you or recieve some other buff. with all their buffs on they can be unstoppable. I dont think they get any weaker as they recapture their hives either so its pretty much game over if you werent ready in advance. If it werent for these flaws I would easily recomend this game to friends.

The worst of them is the dead scroll keys at random times.

Also, the game would sometimes lag probably due to too many enemies spawned. This should not be happening with this type of game at this level of graphics.

This can often lead to situations where the game is over ten to twenty minutes before you finish it. Not so in Infested Planet.\n\nEven as you capure Control Points, gaining more resources to bring more upgrades and units to bare on your foe, they similarly mutuate and upgrade, developing new abilities that often force you to reassess the stratagy you're using. On more than one occasion I have been sweeping across a map, when suddenly I realized I had pressed too hard too fast, and the combination of mutations the enemy had developed threatened to undo me!\n\nEven later in the campaign, when mission paramiters diverge from the standard "Kill all aliens" model, things stayed interesting and tense. The game really captures the feel of an endless horde barreling down on a few desparate defenders.\n\nThe fact that you can always pause the action to assign move or build orders makes micromanagement possible for those who like it, while the more macro-focused can experiment with a plethora of functional build combinations between upgrading your own troops, building defensive emplacements, or contstructing buildings that enable global upgrades to your entire side. The game is great for casual dips once you've completed the campaign - I usually play a quick game or two every day as a break between other things.\n\nDis game? 10 outta 10.","December 5, 2014","true","55.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortuantely, it has a bug problem.\n\nInfested Planet adds what most tower defences lack; actual strategy. Surprisingly well balanced, this game isn't going to punish you, but it's not going sit down and take it either.\n\nThe 10 to 15 min missions and forgiving nature make this a very agreeable "I only have a little while" title.  You can even surrender a mission at any point and still walk away with a little of your merc pay. Some of the missions don't even need you to progress to make cash. It's a case of not dying.\n\nSo what do you spend your merc pay on? Well, for a start, upgrades. The odd thing about them is that while many games do the same, the offerings here really give flexibility. It doesn't truely matter WHAT you unlock, but rather what you build on map. Even if you buy an upgrade you didn't want, no worries. You can't undo it, but you're not cockblocked.\nYou can also purchase one-shot additional mercenaries. You'll never run out of things to spend cash on, nor missions :)\n\nMy best tip : minefields are often a better choice than a turret if you can use it in a chokepoint.","March 14, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is aesthetically pleasing, though symplistic, but takes a slightly different approach to the normal RTS style game. While it is fairly light on story it has a solid single player campaign and a good multiplayer which is very challenging. The campaign isn't a push-over either as the later levels and even some of the challenges  within the campaign (side missions) make it difficult to proceed/profit. Even after you acquire enough money to purchase your upgrades, which they make easy enough so that you can progress without banging your head against a wall, you can play previous missions again but even with your fancy upgrades they scale with you maintaining a challenging design.\n\nWhat I was probably most impressed with was how they managed to change what I was used to seeing as an RTS into a completely different kind of play style but still make it really challenging and satisfying to accomplish when you finally push through! My longest game took me nearly 40 minutes from having to sit there and hold back the alien hordes while attempting up to seven different strategies all with limited resources as you have to keep pushing forward to get more resources and thusly allowing you to keep pushing forward.  Instead of building up a base and collecting resources to create your military units this one gives you some units and your buildings are only created to aid in their mission. Beautifully designed.\n\nI purchased the game on sale but this game is really worth the full $14.99, in my opinion.

You see so many easy tower defense games but this is so easy level 1-5 but later your going to have a pain with this but totally worth time spending and coming up with a good plan.\n\nGenre: Tower Defense and Strategy.\n\nWhen to buy: Well a sale is great but 15$ for this game is honestly worth it completely :)\n\nNow for a personal review: First I wanted to say that this game is very good but i still have yet to beat everything cause it is quite hard.  There are trading cards and achievments for those certain people and the achievments are easy to get for the most part though. But back to the game itself you look at this and it look slike an FPS but then you actual play the game and your like woah wait what am I playing. So you have a squad of 4 men who are able to be upgraded into differnt classes and you are able to build stations to improve your bases quality. So your goal is to take your squad and invade aliens bases. Over time the aliens gain perks which are very annoying for the most part which makes this part of the game the planning part. For most story missions there are set levels where you have to play on but there are also side quests where every time you do it the level is randomly generated which is also another plus. So you take over bases build turrets and you have this thing called BP which is pretty much how you upgrade things and your squad of 4 may be increased using BP. You may also redo any missions to gain more money for perks. Some perks last forever and some are a one time mission only. Now for the two side quests you may do. There are two types the first type is command and conquer and the second part is time limit destruction. In command and conquer you must pretty much take over evrey base you see, you have infinite time but let me warn you as they will gain perks the longer you play. There are 3 majoy difficulties which are where the achievments come in. Now for time limit destruction you must destroy all of the bases within a time limit. For every base you destroy you gain more time. This also has 3 majoy difficulties just like command and conquer. So overall this game is worth getting for anybody you can grasp the concept easily you might rage later on but you won't regret this buy :)!!!!!!!!\n","June 28, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its mechanics are fairly simple, equip your marines and use them to take over enemy bases. The maps are quick, usually 10-15 minutes depending on how you are doing. I've rather liked what I have played so far. My one caveat is that the game seems to easy. You have points to spend on each map, but you can keep changing their allocation as you play through the map.

It was listed on flash sale, briefly checked what's the game about and it was marines vs hordes of aliens in a rather simplistic top down view. But don't let the looks fool you. The game is really fun, has lots of depth and tactics. And who doesn't want to decimate thousands of aliens. It's a proper Serious Sam inspired 2D shooter with a very interesting approach to strategy gameplay.\n\nAnd now that i've played several skirmish battles and also progressed deeply into the campaign i must say it's a pretty damn good game. I've played many strategy games and none has pressured the player so much to continue and fight off aliens as this one does. For example in C&C qames i usually use the steamroller tactics. First you fortify your base, gather enough resources, make huge army and steamroll over enemy. Here, while you sometimes can do that, killing the wrong hive can re-route enemies differently to parts you thought were secure without turrets or marines and it can flip the entire fate of the battle. Limited resources also mean you have to use them carefully to build turrets, upgrade soldiers and buy new abilities and also pressures you to kill more hives to progress and gain more resources.\n\nIf you love strategy games and you want to kill seemingly unlimited swarms of aliens, this is the game you want. It's unique, original, runs well even on older computers, yet it actually looks pretty nice (not that you have time to admire anything else but massive swarms of aliens :D ). And the reason why we play games, it's good old fun. Highly recommended!","June 25, 2014","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This time around you get small squad of tough guys and need to fight thousands of insecoid aliens. The closest thing I can compare it to would be perhaps Terran vs Zerg in Starcraft, but taken to extreme.\n\nThe game mechanics are very well designed, missions are tough, especially later in the campaign, when aliens play all the tricks in their arsenal and you reallly need to adapt your strategy as the situations changes.  On the other hand you can make your life easier by playing some optional missions to earn cash. You can do it as many times as you want and then spend the cash on bonuses that will help you beat the campaign. An extra flamethrower or even additional rifle marine can be priceless. What is great about the game's design is that it allows you to recycle the resources you spent. This means you can try different things and if you make a mistake or circumstances changes in a way you couldn't possibly expect, you can still correct it. Well, you can at least try :-).\n\nThis is an indie game, done by a small team, so don't expect fancy graphics. What you'll see is clean & readable. For me that's perfectly fine.\nThe only real problem I have with this game is that it crashes to desktop on my Mac  from time to time.

The best part is that you can redistribute your points at any time: this means that if a tactic is not working, you can fall back, reclaim everything, redistribute your points and try again.\n\nThe game has a 30 level campaign (17 story missions and 13 random missions); 5 weekly challenges at different difficulties, where you can compete with other people to get the fastest time; and a random map generator where you can change almost anything: from the number of Hives, the powerups (mutations) the enemy has, how much resources your team has, the difficulty and many more.

Did not understand the concept even after reading a couple of Reviews but after about 2 min of playing everything becomes clear.  From there you get a Mix of Strategy and Tower defense.  What is awesome is that the mutations really change up the game to the point that one strategy will not work consistently throughout the game or throughout the mission.   It is the first game where I have really found myself painted into a corner barely holding on testing multiple different strategies just to be able to push them back.  It also flips fast where you think you will have them beat and then in seconds everything crumbles and you are falling back trying to contain them.  Great game.

The end levels are basically impossible to complete without repeating them a lot just for the extra money. I mostly ran the marines into hives, capturing as many as I could before dying, then surrendered, and repeat.  Then I bought enough buffs to actually complete the level, costing more than the reward of completing it. Buffs stay until you complete a level. It's stupid that you need the buffs to do it. They should just give you the needed resourses in the first place. Although this was a 200,000 reward level, on one of the ends, and it is randomly generated which can screw you because of bad placement.\n\nThe main story line missions (blue titles) are not randomly generated and can be done on the first try, if you know what to do. Otherwise you will need to repeat the level until you fiqure out how to beat it. These levels can be done without the buffs, unlike the other ones.\n\nThe endurance levels are kinda dumb. You just hold out as long as you can until the waves become too much. I don't think you can fail, unless maybe you die on the first wave lol.\n\nPros:\n-Solid RTS mechanics\n-Fun game play\n-Good graphics even though its just 2D\n-Killing tens of thousands of bug-type aliens if you like that\n-Varied weapons, troop classes, buildings, and enemies\n-Weekly Challenges for more replay value (did not try these)\n\n\nCons\n-Game crashes in long matches\n-End game is more grindy than RTS\n-Controlling units can be a hassle and micro managing individuals is too tedious but needed in some missions\n-End levels are extremelt difficult without grinding for buffs\n-Too few main story levels (most enjoyable imo)\n-Too many things use Ammo, a resource, which I became too dependent on when pushing and taking nodes. The "out of ammo" message was nonstop for me when I was playing and annoying as I waited only to push when it re-filled.\n-Sometimes a random upgrade is greyed out as if you didn't buy it yet. I had to restart the level to fix the bug.\n\nNice game, but not going to keep your interest unless you are a hardcore RTS fan. Felt like it could have been a little longer for the kind of game.

You see so many easy tower defense games but this is so easy level 1-5 but later your going to have a pain with this but totally worth time spending and coming up with a good plan.\n\nGenre: Tower Defense and Strategy.\n\nWhen to buy: Well a sale is great but 15$ for this game is honestly worth it completely :)\n\nNow for a personal review: First I wanted to say that this game is very good but i still have yet to beat everything cause it is quite hard.  There are trading cards and achievments for those certain people and the achievments are easy to get for the most part though. But back to the game itself you look at this and it look slike an FPS but then you actual play the game and your like woah wait what am I playing. So you have a squad of 4 men who are able to be upgraded into differnt classes and you are able to build stations to improve your bases quality. So your goal is to take your squad and invade aliens bases. Over time the aliens gain perks which are very annoying for the most part which makes this part of the game the planning part. For most story missions there are set levels where you have to play on but there are also side quests where every time you do it the level is randomly generated which is also another plus. So you take over bases build turrets and you have this thing called BP which is pretty much how you upgrade things and your squad of 4 may be increased using BP. You may also redo any missions to gain more money for perks. Some perks last forever and some are a one time mission only. Now for the two side quests you may do. There are two types the first type is command and conquer and the second part is time limit destruction. In command and conquer you must pretty much take over evrey base you see, you have infinite time but let me warn you as they will gain perks the longer you play. There are 3 majoy difficulties which are where the achievments come in. Now for time limit destruction you must destroy all of the bases within a time limit. For every base you destroy you gain more time. This also has 3 majoy difficulties just like command and conquer. So overall this game is worth getting for anybody you can grasp the concept easily you might rage later on but you won't regret this buy :)!!!!!!!!\n","June 28, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got about 4 fairly enjoyable hours out of it but I think I'm done. Reminded me of my experience with Defense Grid where it was enjoyable for a bit until you find out that it forces you to only use one weapon.\n\nSo this game is pretty much a realtime strategy version of top down shooter games like Crimsonland or the classic Smash TV. There are alien hives spawning endless waves of enemies and your marines have to mow them down, eventually gaining enough ground to take out a hive which will respawn unless you capture the point. Aliens can recapture points for the hive to respawn. You get more money for each point you capture, BUT the aliens also get tougher and receive some kind of upgrade (the crimsonland monsters get perks!). Buy enough stuff to capture all the points before the alien numbers and upgrades overwhelm you.\n\nWhat I like is that there's no mechanics of lost resources. You can sell or unequip anything at any time for a full refund. Destroyed buildings refund their full cost. Killed marines respawn for free. You're free to change up your entire strategy at any time.\n\nSO HOW IS THIS NOT THE BEST THING EVER?\n\nThe unit selection is sluggish. You can drag to select fine but that's about it. Selecting individual marines is way harder than it should be. You cannot double click to select all marines of the same type.\n\nThey needed a better visual design. It's too hard to tell marines apart. Shotgun marines have an angular helmet. Officers have a slightly shorter gun (not a problem since they're useless and you'll never buy them). Snipers have a slightly longer gun. Notifications will pop up about new alien mutations and the text box will take up the entire top half of the screen, effectively blinding you for 5 seconds every time it happens. The amount of alien upgrade icons gets very cluttered and they eventually start poking out too far to obscure visibility.\n\nThere are about 20 different upgrades, marine types, and buildings, but you'll only use 4 of them and you'll be buying the same two first thing every single map. This is mostly due to the prices being out of whack. You can give one marine a shotgun for 4 points, or for 6 points you can construct a building that gives all marines an overpowered grenade launcher (can fire 360 degrees on the move) in addition to their main gun. For 7 points you can construct a building that gives you a delayed air strike every minute, OR for one point less just give your all your marines the overpowered grenade launchers for the same amount of firepower every five seconds. 7 points and you can place one turret to guard one capture area, OR for 7 points you can construct a building that gives all your capture areas a free turret, armor, and a healing aura. For 5 points you can construct a building that respawns all dead marines back into the fight instead of back at base, OR for 5 points you can build a portable heal bot that makes it impossible to die in the first place. 6 points gets you one officer who triples your damage for five seconds after killing a hive (useless). 8 points gets you a sniper who is only good against turrets. 7 points for a flamethrower that is only good against short ranged weak enemies. 4 points for a shotgun that is only a moderate upgrade over the standard rifle. OR 14 points for a minigunner who clears out swaths of enemies at any range, obliterates turrets and buildings, and has a shield which makes him virtually immortal. It's like they just picked random numbers for the cost of upgrades because they're totally disconnected from how effective they are.\n\nEvery single map it's grenade building, capture point turret building, portable heal bot, then keep buying minigunners until you win. Maybe one fast moving flamethrower to respond to distant hotspots. That's it. Keep winning.\n\nThe other major thing that drags it down it the accursed random number generator. The aliens get a random upgrade for every capture area or two you take. Some of the upgrades are MUCH deadlier than others. The counterattack upgrade gives aliens a super speed boost every time you cap a point, overrunning everything you have unless you're prepared with a bunch of ♥♥♥♥. If the aliens get that upgrade early then you might as well restart the level. A lot of the upgrades just further reinforce "grenades + healing minigunners" as the mandatory strategy because eventually all aliens and turrets will come with shields that only grenades and miniguns can punch through in reasonable time. Snipers are only good for one-shotting turrets at long range but the turret shield upgrade make them useless and another upgrade gives turrets a longer range than snipers. And so on and so on for everything in your arsenal except grenades and healing miniguns.\n\nProvides a couple hours of amusement. Campaign takes too long to unlock more than just shotguns.\n\nEither buy it on sale for an afternoon distraction or skip it.\n\n\nEDIT: For proof that spamming mini guns is the most effective, but boring strategy, check out my rank on the leaderboard. I tried the weekly challenge and got #9 in the entire world on my very first attempt, without bothering to pause for maximum micromanagement effeciency. I simply ordered my guys to walk up the every hive with concentrated fire, and (after the grenade and robotics buildings) did nothing with my money but upgrade everyone to mini gunners when possible. If I had used the pause feature I probbaly could have micromanaged to split up for fastre completion and cracked the top 5. It's just a shame the game forces you to use the same straight forward strategy over and over again. It would be great if you had to constantly reconfigure your forces to respond to mutation threats, like different mutations required different setups to counter. But no the answer is miniguns every single time because no other weapon can break through the shielding mutations and no other marine can tank the increased damage.","September 23, 2014","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Did not understand the concept even after reading a couple of Reviews but after about 2 min of playing everything becomes clear.  From there you get a Mix of Strategy and Tower defense.  What is awesome is that the mutations really change up the game to the point that one strategy will not work consistently throughout the game or throughout the mission.   It is the first game where I have really found myself painted into a corner barely holding on testing multiple different strategies just to be able to push them back.  It also flips fast where you think you will have them beat and then in seconds everything crumbles and you are falling back trying to contain them.  Great game.

Menus, character portraits, and icons are all expertly made.\n\nPerfect UI.  You can zoom as far as you want.  Everything has a shortcut, they're visible in-game, and they're on the left of the keyboard.  You receive appropriate alerts, and the range and orders of every unit can be seen.  Everything about the UI says "oh, they thought of that too".\n\nMutations and upgrades keep things fresh.  Try random missions or continue with the story.  There's a "daily challenge" I haven't tried yet.  There doesn't appear to be an "easy" or optimal strategy.  Use what works in different situations.  Use the generous money you get from missions to buy new technology.  This game is excited to get the goodies in your hands.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid.  You might be losing, badly; that doesn't mean you can't regroup and win.  Everything can be redone in the middle of a mission and early mistakes can be recovered from.  It's hard as hell and it can be frustrating.  But persevere and you'll break through.\n\nVery impressed with this game.  Paid $15 and have been absolutely delighted.","March 14, 2014","true","55.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like the Starcraft missions where you lead a few marines into swarms of melee-only zerglings, and the marines mow them down right & left while trying not to get overwhelmed.\n\nLikes:\n-- No diddling with resource harvesting: There are some resource & ammo crates, but otherwise resources come from capturing the enemy bases.\n-- Death is temporary: If a marine dies, they get resurrected after a delay.\n-- 100% refund on recycled buildings: Recycling one turret and adding a new one closer to the front has a net cost of zero.\n-- Small numbers on resources: 12 resources means one fixed turret and a soldier upgraded to shotgun. Once you get a few more resources, do you recycle that shotgun to build another fixed turret?\n\nThis combination means you're constantly considering what the current situation needs and where to apply your limited resources. Which is nice.\n\n\nDislikes:\nReally my main dislike is that unit subtleties aren't clear: it badly needs a unit encyclopedia. Is a normal marine effective against one of those bigger beetles with spiky armor? No--this is a useful fact to know, but the game doesn't make this obvious. There's a science/exploration theme to the campaign, so an in-game encyclopedia would fit.\n\nThe tougher missions would be more palatable if I could regroup and figure out where I went wrong...but without knowing unit strengths & weaknesses it's tougher to figure out.\n\nOverall: worthwhile, totally worth the sale buy.\n\n","June 20, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wouldn't call it a tower defense game though.  Although you do place some turrets at times, the game is more mobile and you keep moving from area to area clearing out bug infested buildings which you take over slowly turning them into bases to win the game.\n\nAt some point in the game after purchasing the buff, you can heal at each base.  You do not go inside buildings, just around them.  They all look the same and server one purpose.  To become another healing point for you once cleared.  You must clear every building to beat the map.\n\nThis is like other reviewers have pointed out.  It is a very basic, repetitious swarm control game.  You are constantly controlling areas and trying to destroy the spawn points around the small maps as fast as you can.  As I said, the game is pretty basic and get repetitious fast.  One reason for this is that you will play the same maps over and over again to get money to purchase perks.  Some perks are permanent and some are one time use.  It is somewhat a grind-fest!\n\nThe maps are different.  One reviewer stated it was the same map the whole game and that is not true.   They just look the same as the textures are not all that different.\n\nAt one point I found it harder to pass the same level than before and it was pure strategy.  I had lost my 3 shotgunners….  If you lose the soldiers that got the good weapon drops, they respawn with basic weapons again and makes it hard to pass beat the maps sometimes.  Don't lose them!  Heal them!\n\nThis is just my first impressions and I might change or update this review, but as I said, the game is fairly basic and gets repetitious, but does have that Starship Troopers feel of being overwhelmed by aliens!  The game seems solid, polished and made with love of the genre.  So far I recommend it to RTS die hards only!","September 26, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Menus, character portraits, and icons are all expertly made.\n\nPerfect UI.  You can zoom as far as you want.  Everything has a shortcut, they're visible in-game, and they're on the left of the keyboard.  You receive appropriate alerts, and the range and orders of every unit can be seen.  Everything about the UI says "oh, they thought of that too".\n\nMutations and upgrades keep things fresh.  Try random missions or continue with the story.  There's a "daily challenge" I haven't tried yet.  There doesn't appear to be an "easy" or optimal strategy.  Use what works in different situations.  Use the generous money you get from missions to buy new technology.  This game is excited to get the goodies in your hands.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid.  You might be losing, badly; that doesn't mean you can't regroup and win.  Everything can be redone in the middle of a mission and early mistakes can be recovered from.  It's hard as hell and it can be frustrating.  But persevere and you'll break through.\n\nVery impressed with this game.  Paid $15 and have been absolutely delighted.","March 14, 2014","true","55.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are certain weapons and structures that make winning significantly easier and there are certain mutations that make winning almost impossible.\n\nGetting the wrong combination can turn any game into an un-winnable stalemate. I've rarely lose a game but there have been a number of games where we reach an impasse because I don't have the tools I need to win and they can't break my defenses. Maybe that speaks to my lack of skills but it does make the game a bit frustrating because I know I need to reroll the scenario and hope for a better combination.\n\nI like the game; just realize that this is a game meant to be played, not to be beaten.","March 27, 2014","true","41.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The missions are quite easy in the beginning, but they get challenging soon enough.\n\nWhat I like:\n\n- Excellent mix of big strategy and small-scale tactics.\n\n- In most other RTS, there is a tipping point where you know the AI won't recover, so the rest of the mission (often a big part) is just clean-up duty. In this game, however, the aliens get stronger and more vicious the more you advance, so it stays interesting until the end.\n\n- You get a full refund for salvaged *and* destroyed buildings, so you can experiment and adapt during a mission. (Think "control/supply points", not "money".)\n\n- *Lots* of alien carnage - alien kill counts in a mission are typically >10.000 :)\n\n- Great music + sound effects\n\n- Overall, a very well thought-out game and UI\n\n\nBefore buying, I was a bit sceptical whether I'd like the visuals, but they actualy work out quite well in-game.\n\nThe only downside is that there are only few actual campaign missions - 16, I think, including some very easy ones. But there are various random missions (at different levels) and weekly challenges that are a lot of fun on their own, so there's enough play time as it is.","June 20, 2015","true","96.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reminds me of older RTS games as far as gameplay, except less building of units. It's more about outflanking. Campaign seems like it is done well. On lower levels you can storm through anything, but later levels, whenever you take out an enemy structure, another structure starts puts out more enemies, which means their pathing is different, so you have to figure out how to outflank them again. It's not very difficult, but it is a lot of fun. I'd definitely buy it if you like RTS games.","July 9, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though the visuals aren't exactly top-notch, the gameplay itself is quite visceral. The way you destroy huge groups of endless alien creatures is well done. Using the equipment you develop feels like it is actually useful and trying to use what resources you have effectively is challenging but far from impossible. The difficulty both from scenario to scenario as well as within each piece is reasonably well-done. If I was to criticise this game for anything it would be that there isn't the ability to hotkey squads like in a standard RTS so you have to be a bit more careful about splitting your troops up, but most of the time you bundle up and attack move anyway. This leads to a bit of potential oversimplicity for some, although I like the straightforward nature of the game.\n\nOverall an enjoyable experience and well worth it having picked it up while it was on sale.","June 26, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wouldn't call it a tower defense game though.  Although you do place some turrets at times, the game is more mobile and you keep moving from area to area clearing out bug infested buildings which you take over slowly turning them into bases to win the game.\n\nAt some point in the game after purchasing the buff, you can heal at each base.  You do not go inside buildings, just around them.  They all look the same and server one purpose.  To become another healing point for you once cleared.  You must clear every building to beat the map.\n\nThis is like other reviewers have pointed out.  It is a very basic, repetitious swarm control game.  You are constantly controlling areas and trying to destroy the spawn points around the small maps as fast as you can.  As I said, the game is pretty basic and get repetitious fast.  One reason for this is that you will play the same maps over and over again to get money to purchase perks.  Some perks are permanent and some are one time use.  It is somewhat a grind-fest!\n\nThe maps are different.  One reviewer stated it was the same map the whole game and that is not true.   They just look the same as the textures are not all that different.\n\nAt one point I found it harder to pass the same level than before and it was pure strategy.  I had lost my 3 shotgunners….  If you lose the soldiers that got the good weapon drops, they respawn with basic weapons again and makes it hard to pass beat the maps sometimes.  Don't lose them!  Heal them!\n\nThis is just my first impressions and I might change or update this review, but as I said, the game is fairly basic and gets repetitious, but does have that Starship Troopers feel of being overwhelmed by aliens!  The game seems solid, polished and made with love of the genre.  So far I recommend it to RTS die hards only!","September 26, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Science fiction themed, the game takes place on a new planet that is being colonized by space fairing humans who encounter another sentient form of life on the planet.\n\nThe Good: This was the best example of an indie RTS I've ever seen!  It is almost impossible to compete the complexity (and the limitless budget) of games like StarCraft or Company of Heroes but this little indie title did an excellent job of giving us a simplified and streamlined RTS that didn’t "simplify" the fun out of playing the game.  There a light research tree, single mission unlocks for the extra tough missions, a weekly challenge for those who want more and just enough story and music to be fun but not get in the way.  The units seemed balanced and everything you unlock (almost) has a purpose and is useful in the right situation.  The game is also delightfully challenging; it’s by no means a push over but you’ll lose a few mission before ya get it right!\n\nThe Bad:  At least for me, the chopper air-strike and the ammo facility combo seemed really (Really!) good, that may need a small nerf but really you have to use it at an opportune time or the bugs just swarm back over the area.  Also, and this is always a sideways compliment, the game was a bit too short.  I beat it and all of the (non-weekly) side skirmishes in ~14 hours but hey, there's always endless/challenge mode if ya want more.\n\nThe Funny:  Nothing really ... all action and fun, no bugs, nothing crashed.  I was too busy kicking ♥♥♥ to laugh!\n\nSummary: 9 out of 10, this is everything an indie game should be.  It didn't try to say, "We're better than AAA titles," (nor did it price itself as such).  It just brought a fun, action packed arena in a familiar but still unique package.  At the time of this writing the game is ~4 bucks and since most movies cost ya $18ish for 1.5 - 2 hours of entertainment I'd take a game like this over any movie night.  This game is great and I'll definitely buy from this group if they put out more stuff.

The large amount of technologies available to unlock allow for alot of options and the shop allows you to purchase tempory buffs that last until one mission win, which makes getting stuck on a hard level bareable. The last couple of missions both random and story can be very frustrating. The mutation system causes the aliens to counter your tactics and can easy turn the mission un winnable. Earning money and keeping my buffs on surrendering helped negate this, but they were still a bare.\n\nThe DLC adds some cool powers to use with ammo, but I feel its a little too much for what it does.

Very simply put, wether you are a fan or not of RTS/Tower Defence/Tug-Of-War genres, do yourself a favor and get this game, I cannot recomend it highly enough.","July 8, 2014","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was listed on flash sale, briefly checked what's the game about and it was marines vs hordes of aliens in a rather simplistic top down view. But don't let the looks fool you. The game is really fun, has lots of depth and tactics. And who doesn't want to decimate thousands of aliens. It's a proper Serious Sam inspired 2D shooter with a very interesting approach to strategy gameplay.\n\nAnd now that i've played several skirmish battles and also progressed deeply into the campaign i must say it's a pretty damn good game. I've played many strategy games and none has pressured the player so much to continue and fight off aliens as this one does. For example in C&C qames i usually use the steamroller tactics. First you fortify your base, gather enough resources, make huge army and steamroll over enemy. Here, while you sometimes can do that, killing the wrong hive can re-route enemies differently to parts you thought were secure without turrets or marines and it can flip the entire fate of the battle. Limited resources also mean you have to use them carefully to build turrets, upgrade soldiers and buy new abilities and also pressures you to kill more hives to progress and gain more resources.\n\nIf you love strategy games and you want to kill seemingly unlimited swarms of aliens, this is the game you want. It's unique, original, runs well even on older computers, yet it actually looks pretty nice (not that you have time to admire anything else but massive swarms of aliens :D ). And the reason why we play games, it's good old fun. Highly recommended!","June 25, 2014","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game doesn't penalize you for trying something new, discovering it doesn't work, and selling the weapons and structures you made in pursuit of a certain tactic.\n3. The overall feel.

It takes me back to my childhood and the golden age of gaming when fun but challenging gameplay was more important than flashy visuals and effects.

It starts out simple and gradually makes becomes more complex through a well thought out campaign system. At times it can be very challenging and it forces you to think on your feet, but personally I like to be challenged! I love to turtle in RTS games and this game really appeals to me in that respect; you often win territory inch by inch, forcing back waves of aliens until you can get close enough to do some damage to their bases. The way the enemy mutates and adapts to fight back is a great concept.\n\nI'd love to see more games like this and sincerely hope the creator will take the basic format of this game and run with it!","January 29","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kind of like playing Starcraft against the zerg. I appreciate that there are different strategies that you can play, and there is no one set way of playing the game "right." The AI mutates, which means you have to change your strategy on the fly, and you are able to do so because you can change character class, and buildings on the spot. The game is fast-paced, and there's no resource collecting.\n\nSome problems with the game though is that it can be rubber-bandy. You take over one spot and another one gets taken over. You retake it, and the enemy regroups somewhere else... Another problem is that the 'tidying up' phase can be a bit drawn out. Not so bad that you're looking for one peasant hiding somewhere in the fog of war, but there's a point when you can say: "I won already, c'mon..."\n\nPros:\nVarious strategies work equally well.\nFast-paced.\nGood variety of buildings and character classes.\nFeels good gunning down waves of aliens.\nNo grinding or other time-consuming activities.\n\nCons:\nThe game is a bit short. But it has decent replay value.\nGraphics could be better.\nControls are not as precise, or snappy as I would've liked.\n\nExcellent game, worthy of it's price tag, and an even better deal if on sale.","February 2","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well it is basically the Starship Troopers films and animation in a nutshell. Your objective varies for each level; either being destroy all alien hives, survive, or escort. You, the player/commander, are given points (BP, the purple currency) at the start of each level and gain more for destroying hives, recyling buildings and units, and capturing boxs. The tools vary from support buildings or automated turrets. Your opponents, the alien scum, is well pretty dang mindless. They attack you on a path and can be stopped with ease. The basic ones anyway. They do adapt just so you know, I'll let you find out.\n\nPros:\nCommiting genocide on alien scum\nOrdering your men to their immediate doom\n(But no in all seriousness)\nGood unit pathfinding <--- A+ (Is a must game developers, do not ignore this!)\nUnit variiety <--- units can be upgraded with different weapons and behave differently depending on weapon\nStrong replayability\nCompetent enemy AI <---- may not appear it but they are.

And the thing about it is, the gameplay changes so much on the fly. A mutation of the enemy creatures will change the dynamic of the level, or suddenly they start sending a huge attack towards a lightly defended area.\n\nYou also have a certain amount of 'credits', don't remember the actual term they use in game, that allow you to buy soldiers or powerups on each level. Because you can cash in units for a full refund at any time, that means that you also can change strategies mid-level when you see that a plan isn't working like you'd hoped. That is, you can sell cheap soldiers and equip your existing ones better, buy turrets with the extra money, or any other variety of different approaches.\n\nThere are a lot of indie games on here with great concepts that suck because they have terrible execution. This game is the opposite - a concept that doesn't sound like much, but it's executed perfectly.

Overall I am happy with my purchase. That being said lets begin with the review.\n\nThis is a very strategic game where even slight mistakes equals instant failure. You play as marine mercenaries fighting a war against a alien bug spiecies. In the campaign you acquire money from playing missions even failing them. You can then use this money to unlock upgrades to marines, structures, and abilities which you can then use in game.\n\nOvertime in the games, with moderately challenging difficulty, the aliens tend to mutate to the point they just steam roll right over your heavily deffended base. This being said if played correctly you can as the marines do the same to the aliens.\n\nI bought the DLC as part of the sale so some of the following may regard to it. The in game set up is very well done with well planned hotkeys it is very easy to manage upgrades are abilities quickly. Although you can beat the campaign and most of the random missions in under 8 to 10 hours the actual campaign missions are very replayable. If that is not enough for you there is also the ability to play skirmishes where you choose the map and difficulty. In addition you can also change the skirmish settings giving you pratically infinite resources for a easy fun game where you can screw around,\n\nAll this being said it is still a strategy game. So if you don't like losing over and over to what seems to be an unwinable struggle against the alien bug race then this may not be the game for you. However if you like a challenge and strategy games I highly recomend this game. Thanks for your time!","March 31","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's the kind of game that I wanted to play for a long time but everyone would always over complicate things or it would be a glitchy mess.\n\nNo glitches found so far, you tell a unit to build, walk and attack, walk, or carry something. Every unit can do this, groups are surprisingly easy to work with and everything is nice and basic. There's no money, you have points that you can spend on buildings or troups that can be refunded, you can't lose these points, but you can gain points depending on the mission. Story mode was a joy to go through with interesting situations, the escort missions were done right (They draw a path and tell you when they plan to start moving, just clear it out and secure the bases around it, done!) Basic but interesting situations with adapting hives that change constantly to keep them interesting (Counter attack mutation always made things slightly awkward when capturing a new base, slow down poison made my army of flamethrowers struggle to get to the fight etc).\n\nIt's a simple game, but it doesn't need to be any more then that.

No high-tech aliens, no tanks, just a bunch of marines taking on a horde of aliens. You start the game with a squad of 6 marines huddled around your only bunker and have to progress through the map, taking out the aliens' hives one at a time. As you destroy hives and other buildings, you gain points that you can spend on upgrading your marines' weapons, build new buildings, or research new techs. But as you destroy the hives, the aliens also mutate, making the rest of the hives stronger. Ironically, however, the marines are far more adaptable than the aliens. Every upgrade you buy can be sold to regain its full cost, and this means that you can adapt your strategy to the kind of alien you are faced with. And this is where the game truly shines. I used over three quarters of the various options that were available to me on a regular basis. Almost everything has a use, the various strategies are pretty well-balanced off of each other, so you can really figure out how you want to play, but you don't wind up re-using the same broken strategy again and again, because you have to adapt to the aliens.\n\nThe only part where the game falters is the campaign. The writing is incredibly poor and had me rolling my eyes at the game almost continuously. There's quite a bit of variation in the missions, but they do tend to boil down to mass destruction. A little bit more creativity there could've done the game wonders. The best part about the campaign is the slow introduction of the various options, which is very good for new players, as the amount of options would otherwise be a bit overwhelming.\n\nAll in all, though, this is an easy recommendation. It's a great strategy game that rewards micromanagement without requiring it, that gives a player a significant amount of options and then lets them choose which ones to use without forcing them into it.\n\nNote: This review includes the Trickster's Arsenal DLC.","May 16, 2015","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Best part is that these points never run out, even if the land is lost, or if the building you create is destroyed.\n\nFor completing missions you get currency that allows you to either buy new abilities or one time use enhancements. I try to avoid using enhancements, but starting out with two extra troopers loaded to the teath with heavy weapons sure is awesome. I never really noticed the grind, and failing a mission still gives you some cash, granted a smaller ammount.\n\nThumbs up, great game.","October 4, 2014","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You, the player/commander, are given points (BP, the purple currency) at the start of each level and gain more for destroying hives, recyling buildings and units, and capturing boxs. The tools vary from support buildings or automated turrets. Your opponents, the alien scum, is well pretty dang mindless. They attack you on a path and can be stopped with ease. The basic ones anyway. They do adapt just so you know, I'll let you find out.\n\nPros:\nCommiting genocide on alien scum\nOrdering your men to their immediate doom\n(But no in all seriousness)\nGood unit pathfinding <--- A+ (Is a must game developers, do not ignore this!)\nUnit variiety <--- units can be upgraded with different weapons and behave differently depending on weapon\nStrong replayability\nCompetent enemy AI <---- may not appear it but they are.

It feels like a warcraft 3 map with only heroes. You have a team of 3-9 soldiers that will go against thousands of  enemies, literally. The enemies are simple melee at first but develop much deadlier abilities later in the game or even later on the same map. To counter this your team can change skills on the fly to adapt to any situation. Because of this the game now oddly feels like a first person shooter where you can change from invisibile assassin to close quarters shotgunner to sniper rifle and then to flamethrower in just 3 seconds leaving behind assassinated enemy heroes, dozens of dead spitting aliens a destroyed tower and a burning building including the enemies in it. There is no limit to the changes you can make, marines can change an unlimited number of times, buildings can be recycled getting the full resources back, research and upgrades can be sold back as well. The only limitation is that except plain marines everything else uses resources and thus the number of upgrades that you can have at the same time is limited. Thus it is very important to determine which upgrades you need at a certain point in time and establish a strategy before you jump into combat. The game also features a pause button which I rarely use as i prefer real time strategy over turn based mechanics.\nYou gain resources for captuing enemy points and dragging resource crates back to the bases you own. You do not lose resources when losing a point so while the progress may be slow and incremental, you definetly can try new approaches if you get pushed back after a point capture.\nThere is definetly replay values with random generated maps and a ladder system that shows how well you did on a map as compared to other players. There is also a weekly challenge and a nice story mode with additional mechanics.\nI definetly recommend the game.","January 1","true","33.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So the real question becomes "is this worth the price".  That really depends on what you are looking for in a game.  So let me try to enumerate what I've found playing it so far.\n\n\n\nGame Scale:\n\nThere are roughly 20 offensive mechanisms to choose from at varying prices that become affordable as new bases are conquered, and items can be salvaged back for a 100% refund.  That's the basic gameplay mechanic.  It's not very deep, but it is somewhat satisfying.\n\nYou are defending against -- I'm guessing -- no more than 15 different types of units, which show up as mutations occur for every base conquered.\n\n\nGame mechanic:\n\nOnce you set up a stable defense, pretty much the board is stable and you've got all the time in the world to figure out your strategy.  The bugs might change direction, and there might be race-conditions that show holes in your defenses, but generally a stable defense buys you infinite time to figure out what to do.\n\nThe interesting part of the skirmish game is mapping out a strategy for a randomly generated map.  For example, attacking the nearest base might not make any sense as it may trigger units you can't afford to defend against yet.  So you have to find some alternative that is easier to take down.\n\nI also like the mechanism for pulling resources from out of heavy fire.  That's fun.\n\n\nThere's also a campaign, which is mostly a tutorial, but other reviews seem to imply it is worth trying out for some difficult final boss battle - I haven't gotten that far.\n\n\nGame saves!\nThere are no game saves, but in skirmish mode you can replay the current board!  At least that feature is in beta as of this writing.  So that's great!\n\nPricing:\nOn sale this game goes for $5 which is overpriced.  If your budget is tight I would NOT recommend this game at this price.  There's better gameplay out there from indie developers that might cost a little more, but are more feature rich (Factorio comes to mind even though it's a different genre, and also people have compared this title to Creeper World).\n\nPersonally I wanted to study the gameplay mechanisms to see if there was something new here.  Unfortunately, really there is not.  Will I keep playing?  Maybe, but not very much, and I really hesitate keeping the title around when it doesn't even let me save the game.","September 17, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reminds me of older RTS games as far as gameplay, except less building of units. It's more about outflanking. Campaign seems like it is done well. On lower levels you can storm through anything, but later levels, whenever you take out an enemy structure, another structure starts puts out more enemies, which means their pathing is different, so you have to figure out how to outflank them again.

Though the visuals aren't exactly top-notch, the gameplay itself is quite visceral. The way you destroy huge groups of endless alien creatures is well done. Using the equipment you develop feels like it is actually useful and trying to use what resources you have effectively is challenging but far from impossible. The difficulty both from scenario to scenario as well as within each piece is reasonably well-done. If I was to criticise this game for anything it would be that there isn't the ability to hotkey squads like in a standard RTS so you have to be a bit more careful about splitting your troops up, but most of the time you bundle up and attack move anyway. This leads to a bit of potential oversimplicity for some, although I like the straightforward nature of the game.\n\nOverall an enjoyable experience and well worth it having picked it up while it was on sale.","June 26, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wouldn't call it a tower defense game though.  Although you do place some turrets at times, the game is more mobile and you keep moving from area to area clearing out bug infested buildings which you take over slowly turning them into bases to win the game.\n\nAt some point in the game after purchasing the buff, you can heal at each base.  You do not go inside buildings, just around them.  They all look the same and server one purpose.  To become another healing point for you once cleared.  You must clear every building to beat the map.\n\nThis is like other reviewers have pointed out.  It is a very basic, repetitious swarm control game.  You are constantly controlling areas and trying to destroy the spawn points around the small maps as fast as you can.  As I said, the game is pretty basic and get repetitious fast.  One reason for this is that you will play the same maps over and over again to get money to purchase perks.  Some perks are permanent and some are one time use.  It is somewhat a grind-fest!\n\nThe maps are different.  One reviewer stated it was the same map the whole game and that is not true.   They just look the same as the textures are not all that different.\n\nAt one point I found it harder to pass the same level than before and it was pure strategy.  I had lost my 3 shotgunners….  If you lose the soldiers that got the good weapon drops, they respawn with basic weapons again and makes it hard to pass beat the maps sometimes.  Don't lose them!  Heal them!\n\nThis is just my first impressions and I might change or update this review, but as I said, the game is fairly basic and gets repetitious, but does have that Starship Troopers feel of being overwhelmed by aliens!  The game seems solid, polished and made with love of the genre.  So far I recommend it to RTS die hards only!","September 26, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Science fiction themed, the game takes place on a new planet that is being colonized by space fairing humans who encounter another sentient form of life on the planet.\n\nThe Good: This was the best example of an indie RTS I've ever seen!  It is almost impossible to compete the complexity (and the limitless budget) of games like StarCraft or Company of Heroes but this little indie title did an excellent job of giving us a simplified and streamlined RTS that didn’t "simplify" the fun out of playing the game.  There a light research tree, single mission unlocks for the extra tough missions, a weekly challenge for those who want more and just enough story and music to be fun but not get in the way.  The units seemed balanced and everything you unlock (almost) has a purpose and is useful in the right situation.  The game is also delightfully challenging; it’s by no means a push over but you’ll lose a few mission before ya get it right!\n\nThe Bad:  At least for me, the chopper air-strike and the ammo facility combo seemed really (Really!) good, that may need a small nerf but really you have to use it at an opportune time or the bugs just swarm back over the area.  Also, and this is always a sideways compliment, the game was a bit too short.  I beat it and all of the (non-weekly) side skirmishes in ~14 hours but hey, there's always endless/challenge mode if ya want more.\n\nThe Funny:  Nothing really ... all action and fun, no bugs, nothing crashed.  I was too busy kicking ♥♥♥ to laugh!\n\nSummary: 9 out of 10, this is everything an indie game should be.  It didn't try to say, "We're better than AAA titles," (nor did it price itself as such).  It just brought a fun, action packed arena in a familiar but still unique package.  At the time of this writing the game is ~4 bucks and since most movies cost ya $18ish for 1.5 - 2 hours of entertainment I'd take a game like this over any movie night.  This game is great and I'll definitely buy from this group if they put out more stuff.

I've passed 20 hours now, and still enjoy the dynamic challenge.\n\nInfested Planet has the base and resource management of an RTS mixed with a tower-defense, the micro skills of a MOBA, and the low-cost (and fast action) of a cheap date. Again I cannot recommend this game more highly.\n\nTo the creators, I applaud you.

Reminds me of older RTS games as far as gameplay, except less building of units. It's more about outflanking. Campaign seems like it is done well. On lower levels you can storm through anything, but later levels, whenever you take out an enemy structure, another structure starts puts out more enemies, which means their pathing is different, so you have to figure out how to outflank them again. It's not very difficult, but it is a lot of fun. I'd definitely buy it if you like RTS games.","July 9, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like a warcraft 3 map with only heroes. You have a team of 3-9 soldiers that will go against thousands of  enemies, literally. The enemies are simple melee at first but develop much deadlier abilities later in the game or even later on the same map. To counter this your team can change skills on the fly to adapt to any situation. Because of this the game now oddly feels like a first person shooter where you can change from invisibile assassin to close quarters shotgunner to sniper rifle and then to flamethrower in just 3 seconds leaving behind assassinated enemy heroes, dozens of dead spitting aliens a destroyed tower and a burning building including the enemies in it. There is no limit to the changes you can make, marines can change an unlimited number of times, buildings can be recycled getting the full resources back, research and upgrades can be sold back as well. The only limitation is that except plain marines everything else uses resources and thus the number of upgrades that you can have at the same time is limited. Thus it is very important to determine which upgrades you need at a certain point in time and establish a strategy before you jump into combat. The game also features a pause button which I rarely use as i prefer real time strategy over turn based mechanics.\nYou gain resources for captuing enemy points and dragging resource crates back to the bases you own. You do not lose resources when losing a point so while the progress may be slow and incremental, you definetly can try new approaches if you get pushed back after a point capture.\nThere is definetly replay values with random generated maps and a ladder system that shows how well you did on a map as compared to other players. There is also a weekly challenge and a nice story mode with additional mechanics.\nI definetly recommend the game.","January 1","true","33.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kind of like playing Starcraft against the zerg. I appreciate that there are different strategies that you can play, and there is no one set way of playing the game "right." The AI mutates, which means you have to change your strategy on the fly, and you are able to do so because you can change character class, and buildings on the spot. The game is fast-paced, and there's no resource collecting.\n\nSome problems with the game though is that it can be rubber-bandy. You take over one spot and another one gets taken over. You retake it, and the enemy regroups somewhere else... Another problem is that the 'tidying up' phase can be a bit drawn out. Not so bad that you're looking for one peasant hiding somewhere in the fog of war, but there's a point when you can say: "I won already, c'mon..."\n\nPros:\nVarious strategies work equally well.\nFast-paced.\nGood variety of buildings and character classes.\nFeels good gunning down waves of aliens.\nNo grinding or other time-consuming activities.\n\nCons:\nThe game is a bit short. But it has decent replay value.\nGraphics could be better.\nControls are not as precise, or snappy as I would've liked.\n\nExcellent game, worthy of it's price tag, and an even better deal if on sale.","February 2","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall I am happy with my purchase. That being said lets begin with the review.\n\nThis is a very strategic game where even slight mistakes equals instant failure. You play as marine mercenaries fighting a war against a alien bug spiecies. In the campaign you acquire money from playing missions even failing them. You can then use this money to unlock upgrades to marines, structures, and abilities which you can then use in game.\n\nOvertime in the games, with moderately challenging difficulty, the aliens tend to mutate to the point they just steam roll right over your heavily deffended base. This being said if played correctly you can as the marines do the same to the aliens.\n\nI bought the DLC as part of the sale so some of the following may regard to it. The in game set up is very well done with well planned hotkeys it is very easy to manage upgrades are abilities quickly. Although you can beat the campaign and most of the random missions in under 8 to 10 hours the actual campaign missions are very replayable. If that is not enough for you there is also the ability to play skirmishes where you choose the map and difficulty. In addition you can also change the skirmish settings giving you pratically infinite resources for a easy fun game where you can screw around,\n\nAll this being said it is still a strategy game. So if you don't like losing over and over to what seems to be an unwinable struggle against the alien bug race then this may not be the game for you. However if you like a challenge and strategy games I highly recomend this game. Thanks for your time!","March 31","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It runs smoothly, there is a reasonable variety of both soldiers and aliens and you certainly won't be short of a challenge.\n\nThe graphics style fits the gameplay and keeps things simple enough to help keep the hardware requirements lower.\nThe animations look clean.\nThe options menu is sufficiently complete.\nThe balance between units is mostly reasonable progressing both through the campaign and during individual missions via "mutations".\n\nI'd recommend it if you are looking for a horde mode RTS.","May 10","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's only $5 right now. You'd be foolish to pass it up - solid entertainment\n\nANNNND that's what I said at first....\n\n\nRead the other negative reviews and you'll see something mentioned over and over = the difficulty ramps up from easy, to fun and challenging, then all of sudden "procedural" - meaning, if you dont do things a certain way, your game is screwed and over. Period. And you have to keep playing the level till you figure it out and its just a stupid waste of time at that point.\n\nI'm very glad I got it for $5 - good game, just the latter half and near end-game are just...very pooly done. A shame, the early half of the game is fun. Then it just gets dumb af.","April 3","false","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The funds accumulation system means that practicing for a hard level rewards directly through the collection of extra resources and indirectly through the experience you gain.

The game features high use of real time strategy and is quite challenging when you have to deal with multiple sources of invasions and you're trying yourself to take charge of your enemies' bases.
