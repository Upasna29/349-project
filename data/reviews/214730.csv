Damned good at being multiple games, and succeeding at it.  Turn based space combat, real time space combat, text quests, real time strategy, other games would settle on a mere one or two of these, but Space Rangers HD: A War Apart is essentially the swiss army knife of space gaming.  With its consiterable polish from the previous versions, and new content, this game is a must have.  It is a perfect entry point into the game if you've never played it before.  That said, if you've played previous versions of the game, you might consiter waiting for a slight discount.  Even still, it's a bargain at any price, and will keep you entertained for literally hundreds of hours.","November 25, 2013","true","47.6"," 220 of 226 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","220","226","0","4"

Well it is one of the best games out there. Good game is a game that has a "soul" or somethign that captivates players and  make them think about it when they are at work, at camping, eating hot pockets or sitting in the restroom.\nThis game is very unique and will bring you much joy, due to its diversity. Strategy, great  loot, well written and logical text quests. Even unbalanced 3D planetary fights make you think and try new angles. The game is like a fresh breath in the age of action games with big booms and big boobs.\n\nThink about it as game that was polished by almost indie developers. If you can't wait for all these new big space games to come out, give this baby a shot. You will be surprised what it got for you.","November 23, 2013","true","200.6"," 158 of 162 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","158","162","0","0"

Flying around, playing space, getting rich via capitalism -- it is all here. You can go to Venus and buy drugs. You can get a sailor-themed prison tattoo.

There are arcade-style shooting minigames that kind of suck but it doesn't matter because they are all optional. I started out as a wussy trader who got picked on my space pirates non-stop.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrathinside/recommended/214730/","wrathinside","Wrathinside","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrathinside/","21 products in account","This is the kind of game that, had it received proper financial support, marketing and translation back in the day - could now compete on the market with such titles as Grand Theft Auto and Sims. Or, at the very least - with X-com, for the top TBS. The reason is that the game is purely unique - not only in its gameplay that has no analogue, but also in the mixture of genres that together present a picture of indescribable detail. Sure, the game is pretty much old 2006 version(which was old even by that time), because that's the best fans and SNK can do with their resources, but its value is not in the shiny graphics. Well, what can it offer?\n\n1. Turn-based RPG\Strategy Space combat. Advanced character development system, both focusing on polishing your ship and your skills: many ways to customize and affect your gameplay with acryn items, stimulants, artifacts, micromodules etc. Various settings to influence space environment - from total sandbox to hardcore survival. The only probable downside(which is also a "trademark" of the game) - is the reverse difficulty. Most RPG\Strategies give you an easy headstart. Enemies are simple, you just walk over them. Even if not all RPGs get difficult in the end, the case of Space Rangers is that the enemies and survivability is hardest in the beginning, and is gradually made easier as you advance. There are ways to balance it, either with custom settings or cheats, but for those who had troubles beginning or look for endgame diversity... you might be a little disappointed.\nEdit: As noted in the late-written section below, there is now Advanced Adjustment, which does help you establish a harder and more intense gameplay. There are also new enemy ships to offer some challenge. But my point remains - the game isn't about "endgame grind and bossruns", for better and for worse.\n\n2. Magnificent text quests. Yes, this is something of the Stone Age of PC\console gaming - the process of READING to entertain. And what's worse - with all due respect to translator team, they could only do so much. There is a a big gap between feeling the linguistic marvel of text quests in russian and english versions, and it is something that should've been worked on by translators from Blizzard. But nevertheless, translation is understandable, humor is interpreted - and for a person that doesn't get off on constant graphical action - adventuring through certain stories and solving quest puzzles will provide hours of relaxing and thrilling entertainment. Even if you take a break and return, it never gets old to drop laughing at something that got you unprepared some time in the past.\n\n3. Real-time robot strategy battles. Although there are many guides and even basic strategies that allow to pretty much faceroll most battles, for a beginner that doesn't want his game spoiled, deciding how to outfit your robots and how to control their stupid-a** AI to win the *very rewarding* mission - will be something to put your nerve into. Graphics aren't catchy, but it's as much as needed for 3D gameplay, all the while keeping the game low-standard.\n\n4. Arcade hyperspace battles. Now that's something even more "oldschool" than even text quests. If you are a battered veteran of arcade games of 80ies - this little game mode will be met at least as a pleasant surprise. For anyone else - it's totally optional and changeable in settings to make it easy as a cake if you so desire. However, for more hardcore blokes, especially previously mentioned veterans, there are many bonuses that can make or break the game as well as ways to utilize your weapon to survive even a certain death scenario. A properly adjusted arcade battle isn't one easy bite.\n\n5. Record Table and hardcore replayability. There used to be a tremendously big russian forum dedicated to the game, with so much community, brainstorming and theorycrafting that could rival even those of Blizzard. Why do I say it? Well, because some people could never stop making strategies, finding shortcuts and exploits, glitches and tech. details of the system and code - and they needed a place to post it all. With system revamps and time, both many of such "glitches" and the forum are gone(archived), but the idea of hardcore replayability, as well as Record Table are still up. While it is still purely single player, if you can devote hundreds or thousands of hours of grinding in any other game - perhaps you will be interested in researching this game's nature to it's fullest.\n\n\nWhat can be the downsides? Well, if you are a more casual PvE gamer, like me, who enjoys mostly boss-encounters and casual gameplay - you won't find that much endgame or replayability here. However, I've played this game for over a decade, from the very Space Rangers 1(which was fatefully introduced to me by a classmate) to this HD. And even if the game remained similar, this is the game that you will always remember and keep getting back to... just to submerge into this universe, a universe that could be as big as modern standards allow... but that is forced to remain Indie. Oh, and of course, if you don't prefer to pay for singleplayer games or just have too many friends to spend your time alone - this also isn't a game for you.\n\nOne thing I can say for sure: this game totally fulfils it's modest price of 25$, if you meet at least half of above-listed quotas. With all the beta accesses and indie game market, this isn't triple A. This is an old legend that has been released in HD for modern systems. It's a historical game that you are allowed to explore.\n\nEdit:\nI'm glad that my zealous review has helped some people, and I've got a request to post differences from Reboot. So now I am addressing not only aspiring new players, who are not afraid to play indie games, but also english-speaking veterans, who had the opportunity to play Reboot back in the day.\n\nMain difference, which is widely announced - is the introduction of pirates, a side-faction. What should be understood about them - is that they aren't a faction per se. They aren't quite the coalition that you can play. If Coalition loses, so do you, and they are unable to build certain bases. Their addition is virtually a different(or additional) path for you to advance in you space contest, and it comes with a vivid questline, taking players through various types of gameplay... and having quite spectacular rewards.\n\nAnother addition, which was patched in after the release - is reworked weapon customization. New weapons, brand new weapon effects - new ways to perform beautiful 2D combat. Hulls have received resistance types, so you'll have to be ready to adjust your choice of opponents.\nWhat's more - there are new Dominator ships. Long have people asked for something really tough besides Brain Centers, so now you will have to think twice before rushing with AoE weaponry.\n\nWhat can be better than that? Advanced game Adjustment! Want dominators to be even more aggressive and scale better? Want Coalition to hold to their undies for the majority of the war? Want pirates to be almost nonexistant? Or even want to skip all the technological progress and jump in the middle of high-tech galactical war? All that and much, much more. One downside, games with Advanced Adjustment are invalid for leaderboards.\nTo top that off, modding has been greatly expanded, thanks to Evilcoward, so enthusiasts can finally tweak the game for their own likes. Unfortunately, I don't know how modding works for english community, and I doubt that russian mods were localized, but SNK team knows English, they can at least get you in touch with russian modders and maybe think of something.\n\nOf course, more planet battles, quests, government missions - that doesn't have to be mentioned.\n\nPersonally, I'd say the changes are worth a try, especially the Advanced Adjustment for those veterans, who always wanted harder endgame or even more intricate sandbox.","March 10, 2014","true","258.4"," 98 of 99 people (99%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","99","98","99","0","4"

Really addictive, if you liked FTL, buy it. If you didn't, buy it anyway!\n\nI must say, this game is great! I've had tons and tons of fun with the previous installments of this little franchise and the newest one, A War Apart is definitely the best of them. The basic gameplay which will make up most of the time you play is a top-down 2D turn-based RPG, although the turns can run smoothly without a pause unless something happens or you chose to change the course of your spaceship or the unfortunate target of your weapons. It offers a great variety of weapons, equipment and ship hulls both you and the AI can use. You can upgrade and enhance every piece of equipment you have and alter its stats using rare items called micromodules.\n\nThis variety also brings a great number of different playstiles, you can trade, complete missions for governments of different planets, be a pirate (ARRR!) and rob trading ships for money and goods, be a warrior and slay hundreds of pirates and aliens or chose any combination of those and others. Anything goes! You can also literally do nothing, just sit back and watch as the universe goes on without you, every ship pursues its own goals regardless of player's actions.\n\nThe standard quests are pretty dull, either it's a parcell delivery, guard star system, kill this one guy and so on. The quests are quite silly and can contain nice little references. But they pay you in much needed cash and some rare items, if you get lucky.\n\nThen there are two kinds of special quests. Planetary quests bring up old-fashiond text quests which are really nice and fun, every single one of them is different and it really is a time machine that brings you a few decades back.\n\nThe other kind is the RTS strategy "minigame" that lets you test your strategic skill against one to three AI armies of robots. There are resource factories you can capture and even destroy. Those can be protected by 4 kinds of deffensive turrets. The units you and the AIs control are modular robots. You can customise every single robot you make, you chose the hull, chasis, head and weapons. All these have different characteristics like speed, HP, damage, range, resource cost and so on. You can also take manual control of a robot you created and move and shoot with it as in a third-person-shooter. But I'm bad at RTS games and always get my butt kicked by the AI so I never really appretiated this game mode.\n\nOn your journeys through the universe, you can also stumble apon a Black hole (should be called a wormhole, though). Going through it lets you a play an arcade top-down minigame where you fly your ship using arrow keys in an arena-like area, pick-up power-ups and shoot enemy ships with your weapons. After you deal with the ships that are inside, you get a random, usually rare item and appear in a different star system. The minigame is quite fun and is a nice, simple addition to the game.\nBoth the graphics and the GUI are a bit outdated and lack customization options, and some stuff gets too repetitive pretty fast. Same thing with the soundtrack. While the soundtrack is quite good, every single track is very distinctive and in a game that offers a great amount of playtime, it all gets very repetitive and a music mod would come in handy.\n\nThe developers updated and balanced the game after release and the game turned out to be pretty balanced and additional content can bring the veterans of the franchise back to play and actually offer something new to the old players, which is really nice and I hope that one day, Space Rangers 3 will see the light of day.\n\nTo sum this up, once you get into it, it's a lot of fun and you can spend hundreds of hours with this game. There are some issues but the good qualities prevail.\nI give this fun little russian game 8 bottles of vodka out of 10.","October 18, 2013","true","226.6"," 97 of 103 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","97","103","0","0"

If you're used to the older games I think some things you may find frustrating, but it's a good frustration not a bad one.

Only after that I played Space Rangers 1, both of which I have on steam. And yeah, the older Space Ranger parts were once on steam, but for some reason they've been taken down from sales. That is if you already bought them you can still install and play them from steam.\n\nStrictly speaking Space Rangers HD is a remake of Space Rangers 2. It started out rather similar, but with time I feel that HD has really become a new game. There is a HUGE lot of more content than in Space Rangers 2.\n\nPros:\n-Intrinsicate and tactical space combat\n-Massively varied hulls and equipment\n-The general difficulty, primarily space combat, ranges from easy (the galaxy will eventually mostly fix itself) to nightmare (the galaxy is totally doomed unless you are constantly there to protect it)\n-The difficulty can also be adjusted very precisely\n-The galaxy is truly alive, and nothing centers around you, unless you get the power to make it so, but even then life will always go on, whether you're there to witness it or not\n-Great and emotionally immersing music (this is obviously subjective, I've also seen reviews that claim the music is subpar, something I'd never agree on)\n-The addition of planetary battles, black hole arcade battles and text quests makes the Space Rangers universe feel much more complete and immersive, and you're mostly not forced into either of them\n-The devs are still active some 2 years after the game has been released and it is very polished, I guess I don't have to mention that this can't be taken for granted nowadays\n-Interesting story and you're not forced to approach it in one single way, do whatever you feel you have to do\n\nCons:\n-Planetary battle difficulties range from almost impossible to lose to almost impossible to win, some of the maps are so hard I don't see any casual gamer ever winning them (not without like 24 hours of practice and/or guides at least), and here you have no say in the difficulty of the maps you get, except for taking more resistant bots or more reinforcements on hard maps, which reduces your rewards\n-The AI behaves mostly intelligent and acceptable, but there are some exceptions, military ships will sometimes pick their targets so badly they can't even kill one enemy before dying, and your robots in ground battles are in constant danger of committing suicide if you're not there to prevent it\n-The devs thought that having ships simply shoot and destroy wares in space is a good way of keeping sectors clean, so you see something really valuable in the system, you're on your way and you see a civilian ship flying by? You can almost certainly expect it to shoot down your loot, the same counts for military ships when you fight dominators, always keep a save handy in case some of the military ships decide it's important to shoot down your most valuable drops (ships will start shooting wares after there are 7 objects in the system... which happens very fast because even the passing asteroids will easily litter 7 mineral pieces into the system)\n\nI might've descibed the negative points in details, but don't let that fool you, the pros vastly outnumber the cons. Is it worth getting this game? If you like turn based space RPGs the answer is: Hell YES!","May 12, 2015","true","522.4"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","44","47","0","2"

You can go do whatever you want. Trade between planets, star systems, explore, help the Rangers, help the Military, help the Pirates, help yourself, whatever. The game world goes on BY ITSELF. You can Hail any ship, recruit other ships, or raid and loot transports, liners, whoever. You're on a 2D map while a 4X game basically goes on without your help. Help or don't. Up to you. You can do 3D RTS style missions. Or text-based/Choose-Your-Own-Adventure type missions. There is even a shooter-arcade type mode.\n\nSR:AWA fixes a few things, adds higher-res, and adds a lot more stuff.\nStuff? What stuff? That is what I always wanted to know.\nBut no one ever would say. They'd be like "they added a few things".\nOK, like what?\nWHAT?\nNot even the game developers explain all that they have added.\n\nSO HERE IS THE JIST OF IT:\n-You can join the Pirates FOR REAL.  Before, you would be a pirate by ACTING like a pirate. You can be a good guy or bad guy and land at their bases. They didn't care. NOW, you can still do that, but now you can OFFICIALLY join them.\nSo you are a Ranger but you can join the Pirates. To advance, you have to ACT like a pirate, earning pirate "points" for doing various nefarious things (attack transports, get them to give-up cargo, extort money from them, or blow them up, etc.).\n\n-In the Pirate faction, there is a "rank" system, like the Rangers have. Once you earn enough pirate points to reach the next rank, they don't just give it to you. Rather, you will be given a quest to complete. This can be a frustrating chore. Given Pirates are "take no kraaap!" types, you have to take it from them to complete a quest to "rank-up". One quest, I had to land on a planet and do something, but since I'm a pirate, and the planet hates me, I get captured right away and they try to throw me in jail. LOL. The only way out is to pay $$$$$ in fine (racks up as you raid/destroy ships to rank-up in the Pirate faction) or destroy a bucket-load of Dominators (who are they? Imagine if Skynet from Terminator built spaceships to conquer the galaxy). SO, what are really "non-pirate" activities, that must be completed, really make the Pirate-rank-progression thing a real buzz-kill.\n\n-Destroy stations. The Dominators in the other games could do it. Why couldn't you? NOW YOU CAN. So when you go "full-Pirate-aggro" in the past games, all civilian ships, military ships, and some Rangers are hostile to you, and you can battle them to all you want to blow them out of the stars.\n\nNow you can blow all their precious space stations out of the stars too.\nI always wanted that in the game. Stations always have a huge impact on a star system, and the ability to drastically alter a system, So are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the Rangers? The Military? Scientists? Medical? Business Centers? Etc. BLOW THEM UP. You can take out any station now.\n\n(Maybe next they should add planets? lol.)\n\n-New ships models/types, new weapons, new devices/ship-parts. This is the best. SR2:Reboot always needed MORE stuff. More gear is better. You always reached a point where you're like "This is all?" and hoped there'd be mods or something that added new stuff. The game could seriously benefit from a Diablo/Drox Operative-type loot system, in my opinion. They developers tried to expand on this as best they could without ruining the game. They split up ship's abilities into Energy, Shield, and some other thing. Unfortunately, it's never really explained, you have to go online to figure out what "E:" "S:" and stuff means. Pretty stupid. But it's not imporant. What you look at is the item description and what it will do for you and your ship. "This weap will do 10-20dmg and has range of 300". That's pretty much all I need to know.\n\nA bunch of fans of the game are REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at the new changes to items/weapons.\nI'm sure they had a "routine", to start-up, progress, and which ships/items to go for, with each game they play (or just used to same game. On SR2:Reboot, I've been playing the same character/game for like 4 years. lol.).\nSO, the developers coming in and changing things, "messes up" the routine.\n\nOverall, I didn't find it that drastic or distracting. It did seem to make progressing a bit harder, and drawn out.\nThe game is a "long game" in that sense anyways.\n\n-New ships for Dominators too. I like have they might have a command/flagship in their fleets now sometimes.\n\n-New songs (not too many though)\n\n-High-Res available, and new graphics/effects. There are new combat-FX which look better than SR2/SR2:Reboot. Not THAT much, but it's more fluid and more tight. A very welcomed change. As for the HD/High-Res....FORGET IT. While the game runs great maxxed-out, everything looks too small anyways. Like watching beetles zap each other all over the screen. NAH, I'd rather be able to actually see the ships closer than this, and not with a magnifying glass. You can adjust the font but it looks stupid when playing at max res and each letter is the size of an ant's behind.\n\nStill, if you have a really humungous monitor, it would be better suited. Even with lower-resolution settings, the game looks great. It always did before so why should it not?\n\nIt seems the whole "high-res" just really serves to make everything "smaller".\nIt doesn't appear to me that they tightened the graphics at all, but rather, made it to where you're more "zoomed out" and slapped "HD" on it.\n\nSeriously, if you play on highest SR2:Reboot res, the game looks totally the same.\nThat's not a bad thing. Like I said, the "high-res", is really just the game more zoomed out and not suffering from graphical anomalies as best I can tell.\n\n-I can't remember anything else that stood out as different. Tons of small improvements here and there, like stations do a better job shooting down asteroids passing by, that spawn more minerals.\n\n-ONLY SERIOUSLY BAD THINGS: I hate that ships run away super-fast, if they are losing a battle. The game still has problems with "targeting". Like, you can't target anything outside your weapon range, but you can fly within range once the "turn-based/simulatenous-real-time" starts. So why not be able to set the ship to fire automatically at a designated target? If you use the default option to "attack target", the ship flies moronically.\n\nYour ship will fly away from the enemy, because the enemy might be flying on a path to where doing that manuever will put your weapons in range.....BUT IT DOESN'T WORK HALF THE BLEEDING TIME.\n\nIn SR2:REBOOT, this happened, but it actually appeared to work effectively 75% or more of the time. Now, it'sl ike 40% of the time. That's REALLY frustrating.\n\nOH YEAH, and while I appreciate that ships "realistically" try to flee and land somewhere to get away and repair, when this happens though, they have some sort of magicaly "turbo-boost", where they fly off at "cheat" speeds.\nThey land.\nThey know if you are camping them.\nOnce you fly far away, they will launch, and attack, or fly away.\n\nSo you play a ton more of "cat/mouse" in AWA. They ran away too in SR2:Reboot, but not with some super-turbo-boost like that. So it really ruins combat in the game, drags it out endlessly, in fact.\nI seriously believe they need to release a patch that nerfs this.\n\nOVERALL:\nPersonally, I'd want to recommend SR2:REBOOT instead.\nThat was the best of the SR series.\nBUT...AWA streamlines the game and adds stuff, and despite its issues--they aren't much, so I'd have to go ahead and recommend SR:AWA. If you play SR2:REBOOT, and then play this new one, you'll be like "Dude, this has more stuff to do, more things? Why didn't you tell me? WHY?!"\n\nNow you know! :D","December 11, 2015","true","11.5"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","44","50","3","1"

Despite it's faults, I really enjoyed the game and put a lot of hours into it. A War Apart adds new content and some bugfixes which makes for a better experience. The Pirate clan added to the game gives it more depth and makes it much more fun to be an actual pirate in the game. You may join them, or you may use their territory as a safe zone. The original game made it very difficult to pirate efficiently. Still, the Dialog remains a little on the dodgy side, not much has changed there. If you played the Reboot and enjoyed it, this is a recommended purchase. For someone new to Space Rangers however, this is a solid game with quite a few modes of play. Whether your quests can take you to do an RTS section or a Text adventure, you aren't forced to do them if they're not your cup of tea.

One of the best space shooter-trader games around. A sandbox in essence with voluntary random quests and the main goal to fulfill sooner or later. Although it is 2D and turn based, its combat is really thrilling and you need to plan your moves well. What is more, even looting is thrilling, since competing NPCs may steal what's dropped off your precious kill. You can do the same to their loot too, luckily.\nTrade in this game works great, unlike in most other space shooter-traders. You can get more and less subtle hints from planetary profiles, galactic news, business centers.\nPlenty of options what ship hull to buy and how to equip it. Oh, and checking on shops for ship equipment is fun too, because these items are semi-random, ie. random within their class range.\nAnd then, there is this heaps of subgames. Y'see, we have this Czech saying, "It's like, as if a dog and a cat baked a cake together.", but this is not the case. It all fits together nicely. It feels refreshing. The wormhole arcade battles in realtime, the 3D RTS battles (those are real tough), and the most marvelous greatly designed text adventures for all you retro fans out there.\nWant an alternative to the common good guy plot? Playing a pirate has equally fine options here.\n\nI've already finished old SR1 and SR2 and keep coming for more with this HD gem.","April 14, 2014","true","501.9"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

A few new weapons and gear variants set this expansion/revamp apart from its predecessor, which allows you to give your ship a bit more flavor.  Being able to search for gear more effectively makes it INFINITELY easier to track down that better engine you'd otherwise spend hours planet-hopping to find. My only complaint is that they added a bunch of new planetary robot battles that were poorly thought out and wildly unbalanced.  These were my favorite part of space rangers 2, they were wildly lucrative, and with a careful hand, completely winnable.  This is not the case in the expansion, several of the maps i've played in (that i dont remember from previous playthroughs) are unwinnable in my opinion/experience.  You start out with absurdly limited resources and no defensible positions, or the map setup is such that what should be a free for all with 3 or 4 opponents ends up being everybody bumrush the PC.  Dealing with that kind of onslaught (30+ robots vs your max 8 or 9) early in a match isnt an issue of skill, its just poor design/planning.  Additionally, it seems to me that robot AI is even poorer than it was before the revamp; these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s cant fight their way out of a wet paper bag.  You cant depend on them to attack targets effectively, and they either stand around and refuse to help your controlled robot, or charge off and engage the enemy 2 screens away.  The kind of situation not conducive to keeping ones blood pressure in check.  Also, i feel the new pirate faction (which was an awesome idea) are very overpowered.  You can build a ship that can waltz into a dominator controlled system and "liberate" it solo, its not easy to put that ship together, nor cheap, but it IS possible.  The same cant be said for a pirate held system (in my experience so far, this could change) damn near every pirate ship comes equipped with missiles that will knock out all of your electronics (repair droid, shields, targeting, etc.). Obviously this makes killing anything a wee touch impossible.\n\nOverall a great game, but i feel that the revamp lost some of the polish of the original, and has some significant balance issues which, while avoidable, are detrimental to gameplay","November 25, 2014","true","43.3"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

Membership in the pirate gang has no advantages, though the hull as a present is really good (at the start of the game). But it's interesting.\n\nAnd. .. That's all. Yes, all new features are pirates, new text quests and new hulls. In all, this is the same Space Rangers 2. In 2013, with a good graphics and new content, but still the same. If you have never played SR/SR2, you must have. This game is worth the money. But those who have played in the second part can miss this. It'll be better to come back to the second part. The main thing is to run it on your computer. To honour of game, HD-Publishing has no problems with compability.\n\n7.0","November 26, 2013","true","106.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","1"

While the actually quality of the minigames are medicore, RTS ground combat is simple and the text based adventures can feel as if it turns into reading a novel, the ability to have have over the top adventures breaking out of prisons, searching for subs, piloting a fallin craft into orbit etc can make up for it.\n\nThe game has a semi-serious with a decent amount of comedic events and references, as long as you don't require someone to tell you what to do being adventurous can allow many hours of gameplay with your selfmade goals created from the spur of the moment.\n\n\n3.5 out of 5 chiliwigs","May 26, 2014","true","3.8"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

It looks pleasing to the eye even nearly a decade after its first release without making your GPU catch on fire or applying seventeen layers of bump mapping to every object. It lets you be all you can be and it never puts an invisible fence in your way. Its universe lives and breathes, not merely pretends to do so. Its gameplay manages to be complex without being complicated, intuituive without being dumbed down and have amazing variety without devolving into gimmicks. It's genuinely funny, it's endlessly replayable and it's increasingly more customizable.\n\nSpace Rangers is a relic from the silver age of video games that reminds us all that the backing of a soulless juggernaut of a publisher, budgets larger than those of an average central African country and obsessive pandering to the vocal minority of the week do not make a great game. Talent and passion do. And Space Rangers, despite having been in the hands of no less than three different groups of developers, never had a shortage of either.","January 11, 2014","true","147.2"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenixfeiren/recommended/214730/","phoenixfeiren",".//slayer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenixfeiren/","379 products in account","I still remember the day when I first heard of the Space Rangers series. It was 2002, the first chapter of the game came out just recently, and my school buddy and I spent days upon days discussing the weapon loadouts, strategies and ways to earn money. He even succeded in getting his father into it, and the old man became quite a prolific trader (unlike us, two 13-year old hotheads who saw piracy as the only valid way to play). Good old times... And ever since, in every patch, every expansion and the sequel, Space Rangers did their best to improve on the well-established formula.\n\nThere isn't much to be said that hasn't been mentioned in the previous reviews already, so I'll just tell you why I love this game so much and keep playing its iterations even now, 14 years later. Space Rangers manage to be many things at once without donwgrading into mediocrity. The turn-based top-down space RPG is the "main" part, and there's enough diversity there already - it boggles my mind just to think of all the possible paths you can take, be it an explorer, a trader, a mercenary for hire or a nasty pirate. But there's also so much more to it than that! Arcade style combat in hyperspace, text-based quests that will make you grind your teeth trying to solve all the logical challenges, 3D real-time strategy with high-octane action and the ability to control your own individual units, turning the game into something akin to a third-person shooter... None of these constituents feel unpolished, none feel rushed or out of place. Add a good chunk of humour, magnificent music, gorgeous space sceneries and an insane variety of components, spaceships, artifacts and other neat little customization details, and you've got yourself a game that can be played forever without becoming boring.\n\nOne final thing I'd like to mention is how SR2 (and all the rest of SR games, really) manages to be "mathematically precise", so to say. The galaxy you live in acts and develops in a very specific pattern - randomized every time, for sure, but still governed by procedural rules. I saw strategical geniuses who lured various factions of enemies into pre-determined sectors by the clever use of the in-game technology and formed a "defensive" belt around their inhabited systems by putting less-aggressive fleets closer to them. I looked in astonishment at how the great tactical minds of SR2 managed to free entire segments of the galaxy from aggressors while armed with nothing but a bunch of missile launchers and a small yet maneuvrable ship. I witnessed with my own eyes how experienced players figured out the procedures responsible for generating the quest rewards and comprised the "schedules" of the artifact rotation - something that allowed you to know exactly where to go for that particularly juicy reward when you need it.\n\nAll in all, it's a great game and great concept, one of the reasons that I think so highly of the Russian gaming industry. It might be old, but it doesn't show any signs of aging, and with its high customization and astonishing variety it's a solid investment of your time and money.","April 7","true","15.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

I have the original store bought versions of Space Rangers 1 and 2, I think I got them back in 07 or 08. And the game is now in the best shape it has ever been. Regualery updated and new content shows up every so often.\n\nIts immersive and expansive and can be severely difficult if you choose it to be so. Space Rangers HD is just.... Unique. You will not find another game like this anywhere, nor, will you find one as well maintained.\n\nThere are text based quests, there are RTS based missions, there artifact hunting via scannable planets and moons, theres a living enviroment that moves on its own and interacts with everything around it.\n\nSpace is alive and unexpected things will happen when you leave your planet and attempt to make your way to defeat the threat of AI controlled robot race that was to destory everyone. They capture their own systems, and will wipe you out if you let them.\n\nYou could just choose to ignore them too and go about your buisness trading, and pirating or whatever Hans Solo attitude suits you.\n\nIf you want an immersive space themed game with lots to do and customizable ships and weapons, then get it.

It provides much more value than any other title in the same price range. (especially if it's on sale).\n\nGameplay varies greatly:\n1) Fighting (Turn based space combat, arcade black hole skirmishes, RTS planetary battles)\n2) Trading, albeit not very complex is still pretty decent for a quick buck here and there (and can be used to advance yourself further without firing a single shot). There's also a possibility of getting into jail (quite an adventure) for peddling banned goods.\n3) Questing like everything else in the game is optional and mostly consists of your usual fedex/kill/escort bs, but on occasion you can get a Text Quest or two, they are very well made and add much needed variety to the stale formula.\n4) World feels alive for a change. NPCS are not relying on you to win (not completely anyway, though at harder difficulty things might get tricky) and can (and will) wage war on each other and dominators, succesfuly conquer systems, build bases, colonize worlds and such. You are just one of the rangers (there are many more roaming around, doing same things you do).\n5) Some light rpg elements are also in (though i guess it depends on what you consider to be an RPG, but w/e), xp, skills, promotions, various gear, usable limited items.\n\nStill looks good, even though its fairly old. (Planetary battles on other hand are not very pretty, but you can opt-out of them whenever you want).\n\nDon't look at my 'hours played'.

Also, sell your starting shields (if your ship has any) because they are complete crap that takes up too much space at the beginning. Shields in this game only block percent damage, and starting shields block next to nothing. Missiles/frag cannons are very good weapons early to mid, though missiles must be manually reloaded. Finally, find a pirate base and join them for a free, VERY good ship. It doesn't matter if you don't want to go pirate, you can always go grab the ship and just fight dominaors for pirate favor/backstab them and hunt them down. Ironically the one segment of the game that is the most obviously advertised, space combat, is also the most infuriatingly obtuse to figure out without the help of a guide or google.\n\nStarting tips aside, the trading in this game is dynamic and well done. Planets each start with governments/econmies that are geared towards importing/exporting certain goods, and events such as famines, pandemics, or a change of government will occur that shake up prices. One can make a fairly good amount of money by keeping check of the news and moving large quantities of goods in a freigher. you can own multiple ships, so if you have a fancy fighter you can just park it on the planet.\n\nSpeaking of which, in the lower left tab quests, assets, and any news blurbs you flagged are kept there for your future reference, making it easy to keep track of assets you store on different planets/stations, or where you were supposed to ship your cargo hold full of medical supplies.\n\nQuests are offered at government centers on each planet, and are by and large FedEx delivery missions. Asking for easier/harder missions only affects the amount you earn and the amount of time to complete the delivery. You are paid whenever you complete a delivery, making it very easy to simply FedEx you way into riches (if you have the patience)\n\nSome quests end up turning into text adventures (and are usually indicated rather obviously as not your standard delivery). Judging by the ones I've played, the text adventures are rather well done and fair. In the event of player death or failure, you are rerolled back in time to try again/give up whenever you want.\n\nThe RTS segments are somewhat simplistic, with the complexity coming in purely through how you choose to build your combat units. Simplistic doesn't mean bad however, and for the most part they were rather fun. With the glaring exception of several missions that are hellishly difficult.\n\nWhat I find most attractive about the game is its sense of immersion. Events happen around the player, and it is up to them how to respond. The Coalition, Pirates, and Dominators will all launch attacks/defend star systems, other Space Rangers will fly around doing their thing, more Rangers will be recruited to expand/replace losses. Research into better technology will happen (and can be funded by the player), militaries will build new ships/garrison systems (can also be funded), and overall it gives of a good sense of "Hey, you aren't the only hoshot out there getting things done". Heck, on the easier difficulties, the Coalition (the rather obvious good guys) can very well defeat both their enemies without any player intervention. (It will be a VERY long game, with the player doing absolutely nothing in the mean time)","August 2, 2014","true","11.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The universe is huge and the new additions of the HD version make the game a lot more interesting. The game is however, nothing for graphics junkies: Spacebound action looks okay, nothing special, its perfectly playable, but dont expect much. There are also a lot of text-based quests. They are really a great and at times hilarious read if you give them a chance, often they are also really tricky and demanding.\nThe real strength of this game lies in its incredible strategic depth. You will have a great fun upgrading your equipment, searching for new weapons etc. If you are not a fan of this, you should reconsider, as you will spend a lot of time doing exactly that. The game also has a unique sense of humour, that however doesnt degrade the atmosphere at all (for example a quest where you have to deliver an old MS Windows Version to some planet). Combat is turn-based and in my opinion incredibly well done, as it allows for a lot of tactical possibilities, while being fast paced and satisfying aswell.\nAlso the world is extremely open, you can choose from five races, you can be a pirate, a merchant, a fighter, whatever you want. You can visit any planet you want, you can look for secret equipment on unpopulated planets with research probes, you can explore black holes, which throw you into an oldschool arcade shooting style world, IMO great fun.\nYou can defeat the different dominator races in a multitude of different ways, you can support the governments in many different ways. You can be a lone wolf, or you gather the strongest rangers you can find under your command. Theres just so many ways to play this game.\nThe only two drawbacks that I can think of: The pirates are somewhat overpowered if left on normal pirate aggression. I recommend tuning them down a little in the advanced difficulty settings (thats right, the game allows you to adjust the difficulty of pretty much anything in it seperately). They are more like some super-well financed, organized cyber-rampage crew, rather than a bunch of outlaws.\nThe second problem is that you now have to repair dominator weapons with nodes. This is on one hand really annoying, on the other hand somehow fair, because they are really, really strong.\nThe game has a steep, but fair learning curve and a lot of replayability value. I highly recommend it.","December 20, 2014","true","38.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I've never touched a space sim in my life, and boy, did this game opened my eyes. From charting uninhabited space to getting bullied by pirates, and finally one-upping them and at last facing against the three mighty AI's bent on civilization's destruction: this game rarely disappoints and bores.\n\nAnd it's not just a space sim: there are text quests which are quite entertaining. The one I've really enjoyed was the bathysphere quest. There are also RTS quests, but I'd rather say it is quite underwhelming, probably the weakest aspect of the game for me.

Every other coalition/pirate ship out there follows similar rules as you. Think they are being overpowered? You can do that, too! Their hull, their equipment... it is all highly varied and customizable.\n\nIn short, you start out a nobody in a galaxy with tier 1-2 gear available. You run some measly errands or try to make a profit with goods until your equipment is up to par with the latest tier currently available (increases over time up to 8, one of the wonderful things of this game) after which you can start picking fights. Note that on higher difficulties progression is VERY hard, with the coalition losing ground rapidly (because all Rangers lack the experience/gear to fight Dominators effectively until around tier 5+). The few negative complaints I have seen mostly revolve around either the lack of information when starting out (read the tips at the bottom bar!) or because they cannot win alone against 5+ ships following similar rules as yourself (doh!). But the fun part is, that there is almost always more to discover, some mechanic you did not know about, some option you did not try... Just remember the game auto-saves every time you leave a planet/station, and you can load this (bottom save) when you screw up and get your ship blown up. You know, for all those times you think you can take on that wretched pirate that tries to rob you ;)\n\nDespite some minor issues with English, I'd still give this game the full 10/10.\nEspecially since it's relatively cheap, but then you don't exactly get the latest in graphics either.","April 11, 2015","true","267.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

There is always something to do, and all playstyles blend nicely together for a complete and satisfying game experience.\n\nThis game has a living and breathing world, where every NPC has a purpose. Traders carry goods from one planet to another, pirates try to convince them to offload those goods to them, diplomats and transports fly between planets doing diplomat-y and transport-y stuff (gameplay-wise, they are either used by pirates to extort money, or fight the said pirates). There are also rangers, like yourself, who can be pirates, or traders, or warriors, and who behave accordingly. Each of these NPCs is persistent, which means they don't just disappear forever when you leave their star system. In fact, you can use the in-game search functionality to track any NPC across the galaxy, by simply typing its name (you could even play it as a stalking simulator).\n\nI want to mention that Space Rangers have a very flexible game difficulty setting. On the lower difficulties, your enemies don't control many star systems, so you can freely fly across the galaxy, trading and completing government missions. On the highest difficulty, the enemies control most star systems, and you are left with half a dozen (or less) systems that you can visit without getting annihilated by a swarm of enemies within a minute. This adds a kind of "fighting a losing war" desperation feeling, when you must fight for the very survival of your species, which I personally find enjoyable.\n\nIf you are not averse to the idea of turn-based space battles occuring on a 2D plane, you should definitely give Space Rangers a try. And even if you are averse to 2D space battles, Space Rangers HD offer the option to play text adventures, planetary battles and arcade fights separately from the main game, so you can buy it just for that. Speaking of additional content, this game also includes a MP3 soundtrack (no DLC necessary) with 33 awesome space-themed tracks - you can find them in the "Soundtrack" folder in the game's installation directory.\n\nP.S. "Space Rangers HD" is actually an updated version of "Space Rangers 2". If you, like me, prefer to play games and watch movies starting from the first part, there is also "Space Rangers 1", which you can probably find somewhere on the Internet (it's not on Steam, sadly). It's a bit rougher around the edges than the second part, but it still possesses the same qualities that make it a great game.","January 9, 2015","true","290.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

As you get more advanced, the search feature in this game becomes very useful, you can search out rare equip, or prices on goods, etc. This is a redone version with added content, added equipment, quests, etc. It also has added graphical features, and more. NOTE! Seriously, the RTS part of this game just plain sucks. Which is why they allow you to skip it. I believe all RTS elements in the game are skippable, or you can decline the missions with them. You will hate the game if you play the RTS part. Thats NOT what this game is about. Try a single RTS mission if you want to see, but don't judge this game from the RTS part.\nGreat game overall.

Looking from the retrospect i can say that Space Rangers 2 made a great progress. A lot of new things were added, at least new equipment, battles on planets, an ability to choose any of the game's text quests for re-passing, the coalition of pirates and even an ability to choose any side of the opposition. Its graphics is simple, but well designed, so it looks very nice. Your eyes will have a rest while looking at it. I liked its musiс set very much too, and it doesn't differ from the 1st part very much - i've noticed just some changes in tone and that's all. But it doesn't mean that some new pieces of music were not added. I should mention its manner of text presentation. While reading just try to stay calm, because the texts are composed in a humorous way. When i was trying to play its text quests for the first time, my sister wondered what had happened and i asked her to come. We, two adults, were laughing as children. The humor is really Russian, but this humor is simple and it will make you happy. The only thing which makes me melancholy is the critics' rate of this game, though it has a lot of positive recalls, given by the players - much more than some modern "best sellers of the game industry". Do you need a game, which will make think how to earn your living? Do you like space? Do you want to have a good time?

Most of 1C games lacks polish or efforts to just make it right. All great ideas, very poor execution or QA to some extent. However, Space Rangers HD is a gem out of the failed attempts. It's really good and when it drops on specials like "right now" it is completely worth it. The game is hard and you'll get into situations where it's basically game over, nothing you can do... Still, when you do get through these hard challenges, it is satisfying.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jppurkis/recommended/214730/","jppurkis","jppurkis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jppurkis/","128 products in account","The main reason I am not reccomending is for two reasons. The first is that pirates and the weapons Lirecron and Esogapher are completely OVERPOWERED. After spending 60 hours in game with the best ship possible I am still UNABLE to defeat them.\n\nAs things stand the only way to combat the pirate threat since you can't engage them yourself is to fund the construction of warships. In other words you need to take it upon yourself to construct the military fleets of the ENTIRE UNIVERSE since the creators of this game had the brilliant idea of creating weapons that can shut down all of your systems.\n\nYou've created the best defensive ship in the game? A few hits from the lirecron will shut down your shields and negate your cladding.\n\nYou've got the most offensively capable ship in the game? A few hits from the lirecron will shut down your weapons radar and scanner. You are now unable to shoot weapons.\n\nMaybe you've got the fastest hull in the game. A few hits from the lirecron will shut down your engines leaving you dead in the water for pirates to prey upon.\n\nIn my current game pirates have taken over the vast majority of coalition systems and I am powerless to stop them despite having the best ship in the game\n\nWho's IDIOT idea was it to give the pirates a weapon that negates every possible in game advantage. This is not even mentioning the Esophager which has similar negative effects.\n\nFurthermore the additional content is fairly horrible. It consists of a few more text adventures and a few more hulls. The new text adventures are needlessly opaque. I was trying to take the direction that would allow me to get rid of the pirates but ended up becoming their leader and helping them win against the coalition.\n\nPirates are the most OP faction in existence for reasons mentioned earlier. In Space Rangers 2 reboot eventually you would be able to take out entire military fleets by yourself but the advent of the Lirecron makes that impossible.\n\nThe second reason I am not reccomending this game is that the creators have nerfed all end game content. Space Rangers 2 reboot had 3 beautiful unique ships obtainable in the end game. If you enable these ships in Space Rangers HD you are unable to get achievements.\n\nFurthermore they have nerfed all end game content. Shield generators now have a maximum of around 50-55 percent whereas in Space Rangers Reboot you could have 87 percent. The default version of the game does not include the unique ships from reboot which are infinitely better than any of the new hulls.\n\nThe third reason I am not reccomending this game is that all of the problems that existed in Space Rangers Reboot exist in Space Rangers HD.\n\nRepair costs are still way too high and nothing is done to negate this. With end game gear expect repairs to cost 300000 credits which is a small fortune. The only means of earning enough money in the end game to offset these costs are planetary battles which is a trial in and of itself. Every time I a planetary battle mission instead of seeing it as an opportunity to earn 10+ million credits I see it as an extreme annoyance especially since so many of the maps are poorly thought out.\n\nGood micromodules like Universe and Shell are still impossible to get leaving intact the previous crappy system of getting micromodules. Furthermore the good micromodules like Panzer and Broing have been nerfed and instead of giving 16 cladding the Space Rangers HD equivalent of the panzer now gives only 8 cladding.\n\nGood points:\n\nThere are some good points to Space Rangers HD. I like the idea of weapon modifications. Also some of the new gear is decent like nanobrolite engines or upgraded shield generators.\n\nI like the new bertor dominators since dominators were ridiculously easy in space rangers reboot. Now they have adequate difficulty because of the new bertors.\n\nHowever in spite of some steps forward the fact that Pirates are totally game breaking is a major leap back. There are three versions of this game. Space Rangers 2, Space Rangers 2 Reboot, and Space Rangers HD. The one I would recommend is Space Rangers Reboot.\n\nFixing this game so that it would be the best of the three is easy. Just get rid of the Lirecron and Esophager or give the player some means of defense against these weapons. As things stand pirates are way too OP. They can shut down all of your systems relatively easily and the coalition can't stand against them without regular investments in new military vessels. These issues NEED to be fixed.\n\n","February 17, 2015","false","117.0"," 32 of 58 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","32","58","0","3"

I loved the entire Space Ranger series as a whole and used to play it non-stop. I loved the game so much and I still love it to this very day.\n\nThe soundtrack is simply masterful, especially the Human theme which just rings of glory and sadness at the same time. I used to spend hours just docked on any Human colony world just listening to that theme song, refusing to take off even to defend the system from Klissans, Dominators and Pirates.\n\nNow, the game itself is based around a group of non-military volunteers called ''Rangers'' who are tasked with defending the Interstellar Coalition of Five Races (Humans, Gaal, Faeyans, Maloq and the Pelengs) from any threat that may threaten their security. The Rangers are each their own general, their own corporation or bank and can hire other Rangers to work under their command. In this game, there are tons of ways to improve your combat capabilities, and also tons of ways to just play the game. You can be a Warrior, a Mercenary, a Merchant, a Corsair or a Pirate and just play for as long as you want in a single playthrough. They're literally unlimited.\n\nIn the end, this game would probably get a 10 out of 10, but the overall lack of variation between planets and the top-down gameplay is severely lowering the score, HOWEVER, it doesn't impact on the overall game as it's still a perfect space sim of its time and for those who want to await a better one similar in style to this one, but without the top-down limitation.","February 8, 2015","true","15.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

The only REALLY GOOD Space game that 1c has ever put on steam.\n\nThe Summary You know... OUT of ALL the 1c games I bought from their space fi bundle... This made it worth it. The universe revolving around you... watching as a reaper like menace is taking over your galaxy, the universe has about a million npcs floating and moving about, conducting trade, business, pirating, looting, and fighting. You can be really what ever you want. Want to be a fearsome pirate? Be one. Want to be a heavility protected Transport? Be one. Want to be a science ship looking for life in the galaxy? You can do that ♥♥♥♥ too... ! The game's multiple civilizations have their own personalities for each planet, and conduct their own research against this alien invasion from another galaxy (Sort of like mass effect, again) and you or well, everyone else in the galaxy must unify to stop this threat. (Once again, like mass effect) You of course, don't have to actually help, and watch your galaxy eithier being dominated, or liberated.\n\nPROS: Galaxy feels alive, simulated economy, faction wars, new research always being discovered and generated, every ship in the galaxy has it's own task, and personality. +++\n\nHistory is always being recorded! Watch as the galaxy news, or just NPC's converse about the recent events in either the local area, or how the Reaper menace's situation is currently going. Hear about the lastest news that the Galaxies biggest fleet was just annihiliated in an attempt to push back the aliens forces! +\n\nYour not Commander Sheperd! Your just another speck floating around in space! Will you be a soldier aiding against this reaper menace? Or watch the galaxy slowly be consumed? It's your choice. +\n\nExploration is kind of fun, does feel a little dull... +\n\nMultiple random text adventure games brought through quests, like going to prison. ++\n\nRTS mode, though a little basic, it's still lots of fun! ++\n\nNeutral: Soundtrack is pretty generic..?\n\nCONS: Ugh, Ship combat. ---\n\nTrade Grinding, though optional, can quickly make the game too easy. -\n\nWould've liked to have seen some voice acting, so I don't have to read walls of text each time I conduct trade, get missions, conduct research, etc. --\n\nConclusion? 8/10. One of my most favorite Space Sims.\nSpace Rangers HD is a well-done Space Trading, pirating, researching, president running, planetary RTS, prison shanking, reaper menace filled game that is full of potential, and has been getting updates occassionally.

The Clissan race (smart machines, that came from nowhere) attacks and destroys EVERYTHING on their way. They have no fear, they have no mercy, they take no prisoniers. The Union of 5 races is loosing solar system one by one...  When there's no hope left, the United Government decides to make a risky step and make a new army, army of SPACE RANGERS. The idea is a complete success and soon, the threat of Dominators has been forgotten. All the living creatures thought it is the end and they can sleep well from on those days....\nNow it is year 3300 and galaxy faces new war. War with another machines. Who are they? What do they want? Maybe... they are connected with Clissan race somehow? Why did Pirates decided to  Unite their forces, make revolution and set a new goverment exactly now? WIll Rangers save the situation this time? Or will they help Pirates instead? All of these questions must be answered by you, young Ranger! Do what you want - grab, kill and destroy everything on your way, for the sake of victory! Or help poor, fight the bandits and complete awesome text quests! Hire other rangers and make a perfect team which will retake any captured solar system, work with both, pirates and government to get the best equipment and make diversions under enemy camouflage or... just stay away and watch... The universe has it's own forces and you aren't the only hope for it's survival. Custom difficulty level (you can change EVERY POSSIBLE ASPECT OF THE GAME), 5 sides of the conflict (you can join only pirates and the official government tho), open world sandbox game, meaning every game will have completely different result. The mobile Universe that is different with every new game you start... What else... Isn't it enough for a good game, eh?","October 17, 2013","true","66.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Now I do not blame you for not knowing about an obscure Russion top down roguelike in space... but if you do not buy this game and play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it right this very second then I just feel sorry for you.\n\nIn the mid 2000's there was an explosion of highly creative game development that came out of Europe. S.T.A.L.K.E.R and The Witcher are the two that made it big and everyone has heard of. The other two amazing titles of the time that did not make it big were The Guild, and Space Rangers. Due to being far more niche in their appeal very few people know about the latter... which is a shame because they are fantastic.\n\nSpace Rangers truly is like 4 games in one. The main game is a top down Sci-Fi Roguelike very much akin to Star Control. If you fly into a blackhole you go into a bonus arcade stage that works much like the Maze levels in Sonic the Hedgehog. You can choose to take missions on some planets and space bases which then send you on a wild text based adventure the like of which Steve Jackson would be proud of and finally there are RTS levels where you take control of an army of Mechs and have to destroy the enemy base to capture a planet or take control of it away from the enemy faction.\n\nThis may sound like a mix of mini games splattered into a Roguelike... However, these other game types are anything buy mini. They are highly detailed, well formed, engaging with a huge amount of varied content that adds a ton of variaty to a main game that actually manages to deliver on a living universe.\n\nIf you enjoyed Star Control, Space Pirates and Zombies, Sins of a Solar Empire, X-Series, Elite or any Roguelike or Space Opera title... then you owe it to yourself to play Space Rangers.","October 18, 2013","true","5.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That game and its sequels was awesome and I poured hours into it.\n\nSpace Rangers is like a modern, even more awesome (if possible) take on EV. It is hands down the coolest top-down space game Ive ever played. There is something for all sci-fi lovers. Trading, fights, arcade sequences, RTS, combat, story, dynamic worlds and planetary movement (youd be surprised how many top down space games have stationary planets). Everything. I haven't played the originals, so I cant compare the two. The only thing I dont like is that the Pirate faction seems kind of OP, but you can turn their aggression down iin the fully-customizable difficulty and game-play menu. That is an awesome feature, being able to control nearly every aspect of the gameworld -  alien behavior, planets (types, how many) enemy faction behavior, trading behavior and so forth.\n\nI love in-cockpit space games too, but theres just something fun about the top driven ones.

I didn't like the way they changed some of the art and was, until recently, praying for them to add an option to switch with vanilla art as it seemed a tad more immersive.BUT! the studio behind this is still developing free upgrades for this game!! Since its release, content progressed quite a bit. I don't care for the large portion of it but thats only the oldschool conservative fool in me talking. All in all, the resolution upgrade alone makes it a worthy purchase, especially if ur'e a fan of the series as I am. (a huge fan) I might have spent over 1000 hours on the original + dominators before this came up. REPLAYABILITY POTENTIAL IS THROUGH THE ROOF\n\nP.S.

Not only that, but it also contains arcade-style battles and even text-based adventures.  This game offers a bit of everything.  Considering the price, sci-fi space fans should find at least something to enjoy about this game.\n\nThough I have never played the original, this game has really captured my interest and I recommend it to others who enjoy games of this genre.  My only disappointment so far has been the lack of manual zoom during space flight and the tutorial could stand to be a bit more interactive/useful.  The controls are not necessarily intuitive, but not overly complex.\n\nDespite those few negative aspects, I have really enjoyed the game so far and recommend it to others.

To make matters worse the way the game does ship maintainace, it is a percent of the value of everything.\n\nAfter a while just flying around and having normal wear and tear lead to huge expenses.\n\nIn the end, I just got bored of doing the same thing over and over without completing the main story line.  I could never "solo" sectors of dominators and trying to find one where other NPCS we helping out seemed like blind luck.  I just got bored of it all and put the game down.

I know you're going to say how Can Ranger Ponyhare say this with only one hour of  game time.   I can  say this because I have spent seemingly countless hours playing this game with the Steam Client in Offline mode.  I'm trying to keep this review brief and make it as helpful as possible, so I'm only including thoughts about the Pirates.  First there are basically two pirate factions, Independent Pirates that are out for their own ends, but are willing to follow you if you have enough Leadership Skill and Cash.\nSecond is the Pirate Brotherhood that will take Systems from the Coalition and Defend the systems they have but who will never follow you.  At least they didn't follow me and I made the Rank of Capo in the Brotherhood.  Offending planets controlled by the Brotherhood is not like offending Coalition Planets.  You can't Bribe individual planets into good relations.  Better relations are only accomplished at a Business Center if you Build a Pirate Base and at a Pirate Base if you change your identity or Join the Pirate Brotherhood; or leave the Pirate Brotherhood and Rejoin the Pirate Brotherhood.  Playing the Pirate Story line quests also adds some unique adventures but I'll  leave that to you the Reader to Discover when you play Space Rangers HD!","June 11, 2014","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So this is more of a first impressions review.\n\nIts difficult. Very difficult. One of those games where you need to learn the system to get over the difficulty hump. There's so much to learn it feels overwhelming. However! I like what I am seeing. A strange mish-mash of cross/ multi genre styles all blended together. Arcade fights. Turn base space fights. Light polotics. Trade. Space simulation aspects. RTS and FPS gameplay. TEXT ADVENTURES!!! and much more! Seems like a very tactical game where I need the right ship/ tools to do certain things correctly. I need to invest time and fail a lot to learn how to play well. But from what I am seeing I love the scope of what the game offers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mkey82/recommended/214730/","mkey82","mkey82","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mkey82/","345 products in account","What can I say about Space Rangers?\n\nWell, my first contact with the game series had been established sometime in 2003/4. I played SR1 a bit and quickly moved on to SR2, which was not an actual sequel but an update. A fact which remained true for every following "sequel," didn't know that at the time.\n\nI played SR2 quite extensively over the years, one of two games to which I returned quite often, the other being GTA SA. Once I got a whiff of SR2 Reboot, English version of which trailed behind the Russian release, I grew impenitent over obtaining a copy. Finally it came around on Stardock's Impulse service where, after some proxy shenanigans, I managed to obtain a license of the aforementioned software, leading to quite a lot pleasurable game time.\n\nOf course SR TWA was supposed to be played with burning passion as well. Burning indeed.\nThe game has been extensively updated (both in content and regarding technical aspects) over the years and made even more interesting. To those players who may be inclined toward this type of games.\n\nWhat type of game is it, you ask, impatient reader? Well, it's an SF roguelike RPG space trader sim riddled with textual quests and packed with arcade and RTS battles. It basically covers all known game genres, with possible exception of triple x rated games, FPS shooters and sports sims. No, you can not play football in SR universe, sorry about that.\n\nOf course not all of these components have been well executed, but that's just how the cookie crumbles. Imagine if the RTS battles didn't suck, the game would be even more attractive and demand even more time. That would just suck. You realize, something has to suck.\n\nPros:\n- everything excluding what's listed below\n\nCons:\n- I wish the devs had access to more resources so that they may translate ALL the game content into English, instead of having to opt for leaving a part of it out. The game is Russian centric, but instead of seeing this as something negative, one should take this fact for what it is - an excellent opportunity to learn Russian\n\n- as it has been mentioned a number of times, RTS mode sucks. However, it's completely optional, which one doesn't get to see in modern games that often. If at all. These missions can be challenging and rather rewarding, but most of them are quite a chore due to incredibly bad controls and pathing issues\n\n- some consider the arcade black hole mode to be bad, but I personally disagree. While arcade mode is nothing extra super special, it can be a nice way to obtain some otherwise unattainable equipment and provide a break of standard space faring. My qualm over this are possible balancing issues, since you can get quite expensive gear out of the hole fairly early in the game by investing next to nothing into it. Another thing that sucks a bit is the fact that all those weapons which are great in the hole are otherwise useless. And vice versa, so having nice end-game weapons can make the hole problematic to complete. Maybe this was intended by design, IDK really\n\n- I can live with the game being random, however some bits are simply not random. You're practically being cheated now and againg.\nTwo examples:\n1. some micromodules are not (to the best of my knowledge and experience) attainable from Ranger Centers. There are a few modules (Universe, Broing, Strongster (which may not be in the game anymore, not sure)) which you'll get to see on about one out of three playthroughs. In ten years playing various versions I got something like 2-3 Universe modules, Broing probably only once and Strongster definitively only once. Not nice, especially since you can regularly come across (usually) pirates having half a dozen of these\n2. some dominator gear simply won't drop while using distress signal. I typically check what do they carry before engaging, usually looking for the holy grail of SR (namely the Vertix weapon fixture.) Once I find one that's type H and below 160 weight I spam that dominator with distress signals but the item in question is simply not jettisoned. I understand that obtaining such a powerful weapon too early may pose balancing issues, but that item is quite heavy and expensive to maintain, so it's really not nice to have something like that pulled on an unsuspecting Ranger. Not nice indeed\n\nRoom for expansion:\n- one thing I can't understand is why (after defeating the dominators and before actually finishing the game) existing races stay friendly instead of simply having a showdown, with petty feuding, consorting and what not. That would provide for some after-game entertainment and it would be quite logical conclusion\n- RTS components in actual space. Something like: "I have more credits than common sense and want to render this and that system dominator/pirates/coalition proof by means of heavily armored battle stations, private combat ships and what not)"\n- a unified node account so that your Ranger node account can be used to draw required resources for all your needs, including upgrades and maintaining equipment. It seems silly and cumbersome to lug around 1200 nodes to the nearest science stations to have something upgraded. Seems almost like a bug instead of a missing feature\n\nI think that's about it. As for the sheer size of the world and content, I have to say that even after ten years there's new stuff (not something strictly related to the latest expansion) and game mechanics I encounter from time to time.\n\nNine out of ten. It took so much time from my life I simply can not rate it any higher than that.","January 3, 2015","true","145.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I take them since they most well paid and medals you may get for those are awsome\n\nAnyway I do reccomend this game. it may be old but still story, free world, Economy, upgrade system of ship and tech advancing is one of its kind. its like a game where you can be a single pilot and nto do anything in war effort and war goes on itself and other rangers evolve as well.

Take it for what it is.\n\nStory and setting concerning the dominators is pretty good, most other things are quite generic.\n\nEarly in the game you do missions for governments and it's either:\nBring object A to location B, within a set amount of time.\nKill guy in ship A, last seen in system B, within a set amount of time.\nGo to location B, do a text quest/puzzle.\nGo to planet B, do a ground mission to kill faction C.\n\n^ That's it. You essentially do the same over and over but with different words.\n\nHowever, you need only do 10-20 of these missions until you can get good enough gear to start hunting dominators, and that's where the real profit is.\nAll dominator parts are sold for max price (and sometimes double) to Research stations.\n\nNow you've come to the stage where you grind, grind, grind and grind more dominators, preferrably luring them in and kiting them one by one, so not to get clusterf#¤(ed up the bum.\n\nNow wash, rince and repeat this for 30 hours and you win the game! Huzzah!\n\nThe game has it's charm, it has options, you could be a trader, but really.. fed-ex'ing crap across the galaxy gets old pretty fast.\nIt's pretty decently priced and it'll probably get you anywhere between 15 and 40 hours depending on the rate you go at.\n\nAnd you'll want to be fast. If you're slow, dominators will conquer the galaxy. If you're fast, you get less hours out of the game.

It tries to be a Myst-like adventure series with little short, interactive, branching stories, then tries its hand at being a space sim where you fly around a little and barter, and finally it tries its hand at arcade shooting and RTS style gameplay. It has variety, being a jack of all trades, but it doesn't master any of them. On the other hand, it doesn't fail horrible, save for the reading portions where you can be screwed by RNG, especially when you're on the clock. Don't buy this game unless you're sure you want any of those, or you're a fan of the series. If you are a fan, it does exactly what you want and it runs without issue.

Admittedly, the RTS side of the game has ridiculous AI, but it is still kind of fun, even though you just end up completely exploiting it.\n\nThe game is difficult to get started with.  It took me five tries to start out and not get absolutely slaughtered by the first pirate that looked my way.  But once you get going, it is a whole lot of fun.

This game-concept allows the player to become a pirate in opposition of the Coalition. If that is your thing, then you will most likely enjoy this game more than me. If you despise pirates then this game will infuriate you.\n\nPirates arrrr over powered (OP) even on Normal difficulty.  Some have speculated that pirates have to pay for their repairs, equipment, missiles and MM's. Inconceivable! They rarely if ever pick up loot. They cannot possibly get enough from extortion. They always have the best equipment and MM's. And 9 times out of ten they are doped up, improving their mad skillz.\n\nIt is possible to ignore pirates, allow them to conquer Coalition systems and then land on "their" planets. If your relations with them are good, then they will leave you alone... except for independents. And maybe that's how to be less frustrated.\n\nNewSo this episode added a new Race/Faction, the pirates, its HD... some new weapons (which pirates use effectively in packs), Steam achievements, supposedly some new quests and perhaps a few more things. The ship defense design was changed to segregate Energy, Fragmentation and Missile weapons. The lower the score the less damage your ship will take in that class, e.g. M:80%.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where the game becomes unbalanced. There is one hull class in the game that consistently has the lowest defense scores, ergo the best defenses, the Dumbo class. Like it or not this is the single/sole goto choice for ship hulls.\n\nOldThe devs did not correct the: Superfluous grammar and typographical errors, e.g. It's not "Sale", it's "Sell".\nIt may be HD, but the display area is the same.\nCannot zoom in or out on the tactical map (system travel)\nThe minimap is fixed. You can go beyond the edge of the system but you will not be able to see your location or other objects on the minimap.\nThe equipment reliability system has not changed and this is the greatest problem with the series. It's not the poor equipment reliability that is so irksome; there are two in-game mechanics for controlling that. It's the exorbitant cost to repair that is so poorly designed and unbalanced. A design that relies entirely upon recovering and selling Dominator equipment to science stations (full value). If there were no doms, then NO ONE could afford to repair their equipment. The design is ludicrous, frustrating and very aggravating... in other words NOT fun! This problem is compounded when fighting pirates. They rarely drop anything of value and the overall effect is just to wear out your equipment. IMO they also don't pay for their repairs.\nAll quest and related dialogs force you to find the destination in the text but readily remind you of the "Customer". A simple "Destination/Target" heading would have been nice.\nNo turn management improvements, e.g. everything requires an entire day to complete, e.g. landing, taking off, jumping, etc. Days (the turn) could have been divided into, oh I don't know, hours and allow the turn to be stopped at any point. The turn/hour progress indicator could easily be shown on the HUD. And if the time requirement to jump is 12 hours then at least you won't have to just sit there and wait a full day for all those missiles to catch up and blast you to pieces.\nJumping still requires the ship to travel to some obscure location at the edge of a system. For instance, if you are at the outer lower edge of a system, you may have to travel to the top edge to exit, etc. More often than not this behavior is senseless and annoying, especially when being chased by...\nBirthday gifts, etcetera, are scattered all over the galaxy. No easy way to collect them all. Attempting to manage this loose inventory consumes too much game time. Time that your enemy is using to their advantage.\nThere were no improvements to the trade/mercantile system (it's not just overly simplistic but senseless and boring)\nThe planets in the Sol system are orbiting in the wrong direction\nStations... they spend all that money to build them but can't afford to equip them?! This is supposedly left to the player... who can't afford to repair his own gear let alone another station. The pace is aggressively fast, unbalanced. There is no time to enjoy other aspects of the game like quests... let alone collecting gifts and selling. It's pretty tedious. The game can be fun but get it on "sale" at 50% or greater.","February 15, 2015","false","230.4"," 29 of 59 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","29","59","2","0"

But everything else they changed is bad:\n- Stupid spaceships with disabled slots. Anyone ever bought ship without weapon slots?\n- They just killed design of SR1. Now everything is ugly. Weapon does not look like weapon, radar does not look like radar etc. Why change everything? And worst part - they kept equipment names.\n- Limited amount of artefacts you can use\n- Useless business and medical stations which just break balance\n- No battles when you jump to other star\n- Acrylic equipment? It's like garbage. Bad design, stupid features. You have nods system. Why add 1000 types of equipments?\n\nSo all this 'features' are really bad. Game is good if you never played SR1, but SR1 is much better - 9/10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnHadley/recommended/214730/","JohnHadley","John Hadley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnHadley/","985 products in account","Space Rangers HD is a very niche open-world turn-based space trading and combat strategy game that I think many people will find rather frustrating.  The game is improperly balanced so that the player has a very narrow path to success and a steep learning curve.  There's a lot of different ships and parts you can use, but many of them seem not to be viable and will lead to your death.   Not enough firepower?  You die.  Not fast enough?  You die.  Not earning enough income to pay off pirates or repair your ship after fighting them?  You die.   Not enough fuel make a hyperspace jump to run away?  You die.  The learning curve and narrow path to success reminds me very much of the game X3: Terran Conflict, another more-complex open-world space trading and combat game which I would recommend over this.  If you are able to find the path to success then you may enjoy these games greatly, but if you fail to find it you will die again and again without making much progress and probably give up the games without experiencing what they have to offer.\n\nIn this game you are supposed to try to control the pirate threat but you aren't powerful enough to kill pirates early in the game, only fast enough to chase them around and sustain a lot of damage fighting them only to have them land on a planet and fully repair their ship most of the time.  Before you know it the whole universe starts getting overrun by pirates and you have only been able to kill one or two strays.  You start to get jumped by more pirates than you can afford to pay off or hope to kill off, run out of money, then die.  Prepare to save and reload often in this game as that seems to be the main path to survival when you don't know what you may encounter before entering a black hole or a sector or taking a quest.  Death is going to find you, so be sure you have saved before that.\n\nSome of the planet battles in the game are difficult and frustrating and will require many restarts in some cases before you randomly end up with the right plan and conditions that will allow you to succeed.  You can skip them if you want to as the game does have an option to do that.\n\nThere is some gaming population that will find games with narrow success conditions and an abundance of options, many of which are superfluous or serve to hide the narrow path to success fun to play.  These players enjoy overcoming difficulty and pride themselves in their ability to analyze a situation and find a way to succeed.  They will find the way to exploit weaknesses, recognize patterns, and filter out what doesn't lead to success.  They require a certain amount of failure to make victory worth achieving.  If all or even most players succeeded, then the challenge would not be great enough for them.  If this sounds like you, then you may enjoy this game.  If that doesn't sound fun to you, then you probably should pass on this one.","June 12, 2015","false","329.9"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","11","26","0","0"

Every improvement in this game over the original SR2 release is overshadowed by the fact that the Pirate faction is more powerful than all the other factions COMBINED. Playing on normal and I see systems with 20 pirate ships, all firing missiles, meaning unlike Dominators that you can kite and wear out slowly these guys will annihilate you in just a few turns. Why even call them Pirates? Why not "Scourge of the Universe"? So horribly unbalanced and frustrating. Seeing system after system fall to the pirate swarm is just plain idiotic.","June 17, 2015","false","128.7"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","2"

It looked so nice. But no, there are too many major flaws.\n\n> FIRST HOUR\nLet's start from the beginning with the tutorial. Got killed by a pirate who had more defense, better weapons and faster engine. GAME OVER!\nSince i could complete the tutorial later, gues it was just a random encounter.\n\nStill, in the beginning you cannot really fight. If you happen to be stronger then your enemy, he just escape to next planet, repair his ship or just wait. You won't get any exp, loot or bounty. Just a bill for ship repairs.\n\n> MISSIONS\nThere are different missions available, each reward some cash and exp.\nWith a trader ship you can take on transport missions. But they are near impossible at the beginning, since your engine is way too slow for the set timelimit.\nLater you get engines with 40 parasec hyperdrive. You just jump to your target and the missions get really easy.\n\nThere are even assassination missions.\nSome targets have escort. Impossible to beat them at the beginning. Other targets just escape to the nearest planet. If they get arrested - BAD LUCK. Mission failed.\n\nIt has some text adventures too. Reading them is getting bit tedious on HD screen with text using ~80% of the displays width. Smaller columns would be easier to read. Could be worse...\n\nThe worst missions? Planetary battle. You land on a planet and play a RTS game against up to 3 cheating AI enemys. They have unlimited resources and can wipe you in the first minutes since you only have enough resources to build 2 units to defend against an army of 10+ units.\nIf you get lucky (spam restart), the enemy decide attack each other and you can just watch. Your own units do stupid things like enganging enemy in melee even if you have long range weapons installed. Repairbots tend to go the frontline too. Some sommands are just ignored, like conquer enemy base or retreat from the battle.\n\nSo why just don't skip the mission? They are painfull, but they yield about 5 times the cash and exp any other mission do. If you skip them, you have to grind for much much longer time.\n\n> BLACK HOLES\nYet another type of minigame. Black holes appear at random and can be entered for fast paced 2D scrollshooter. You get BH-tier equip upon win, which is good endgame stuff.\nToo bad the minigame has issues too. If you move forward and shot, you hit yourself. You can kill yourself that way... GAME OVER.\n\n> ENDGAME\nWell.... i'm not there yet.\nYou gonna start fighting against aliens. In one game I had aliens in the next sector. Without feul to jump back, they attacked me and... GAME OVER.\n\n\nI really like the game, but in the third installment they still have lots of issues. Frustrating issues.\nIn this stage, i cannot recommend the game. Maybe they will do things better in the fourth version.","September 19, 2015","false","101.1"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

As it stands though, you HAVE to do at least one of each of those to finish the game, and those two aspects were poorly implemented and annoying. I thought everything else was great, and it boggles my mind how they could snatch failure from the jaws of victory.\n\nFlying around the universe was a LOT of fun up until I hit the brick walls, at which point I pretty much quit out of frustration. This is probably one of the few games ever to make me do that. Fingers crossed that if they ever do another, they'll just focus on the good and drop the bad.","December 7, 2015","false","112.6"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

It defeats the selling point of being able to control individual 'bots - since you have to constantly order reinforcements to advance and can't afford to spend time in the cockpit.\n* Pirates are ridiculously overpowered, even on normal difficulty. Coalition can't stand ♥♥♥♥ agaisnt them, and it effectively disables assassination missions, too. Just take a look at the forums.\n* Hyperspace battles only exist in black holes - so you can't farm for XP and equipment when jumping between systems anymore. One of the most memorable features of Space Rangers has been effectively removed from the game since black hole might as well pop up in a pirate system (see above).\n\nTo wrap it all up: they took the most interesting features of the previous Space Rangers game, smashed them to pieces and replaced with them with junk.

It has a huge open map, randomly generated every time, which is nice. In the time I had, the only quests I found where sometimes given from planets for me to go to a different system, where I would get blown up in a few seconds (not exaggerating) from hostile ships looking the same as the friendly ones. I picked a warrior-type ship and character and couldn't even last 10 seconds against one ship. And last time I checked, 400 is less than 450. In this game, a ship with a speed of 400 can catch up with you on a straight line even if your speed is 450.\nNumbers, how do they work.\n\nFighting on a planet is fun for the first time but you have to use the ability to control a robot completely otherwise your "force" will get destroyed. I tried their commands (your robots that you create can follow a distinct path and execute an order like: attack everything) and they are worthless. sending in your troops in one long line will get them destroyed not only, because all their robots wait on one position and can fire without problem but also because your bots will try to shoot through your other bots, making the flamethrower a complete waste and some other stuff too and I am not even talking about the pathfinding issues where my robots will split up making it even easier for the enemy to destroy not one large group but two small ones.\nI have to admit, I only ever played the tutorial on fighting on a planet, because every other mission I received was for a system I could never be able to stand my ground in. I even tried evading the enemy but, as I said: 400 > 450.\n\nOn top of that, in my short playing time, I started once in a place where nothing interesting (or money creating) happened to far away from other systems (had to restart), only got rewards I couldn't use (besides the money) and found the opportunity to harvest ore extremely tedious because of the time it takes and the many miss-clicks.  It would even help if you could set a waypoint when on the planet, because all your robots start on the lower end of the map even if you are on the top. Maybe it is in there but after trying several times and keys and still not finding anything makes me not want to look it up but kick this game off my computer.\n\nI will feel like one hell of an idiot if  this game is more than what I experienced and I was just impatient and stupid but right now, this is the game I wasted money on and I am disappointed.","May 14, 2015","false","4.7"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","3"

Go for it. Fancy easy mode with uber-guns and steamrolling through hordes of enemies? Go for it.\n\nAbove everything else, have fun playing the title.\n\n\nNope, not here.\nSpace Rangers is a very difficult game and very time consuming. Unfortunatelly quite imbalanced too.\nAny attempts at using build in cheats or cheat engine will flag your game as 'cheated' and you will get no achievements, no score ranking etc.\n\nKeeping that in mind (you might think it is not a big deal, after all) I have to warn you that by playing this game you are in for a quite of a boredom unless you get the mechanics right - and quite a lot of dying as well, so save often before engaging in space combat.\n\n\nNow onto review:\n\nGraphics: 3,5/5\nIt is colourful, eye candy, outdated 2006 graphic style ported into 2013 that will wear you out quickly.\nGame is not bad looking and there are no graphical issues I can speak of, but it is missing the immersivenes of other space themed titles - colourful nebulas, detailed planets, cool ship graphics - it is not there, do not expect it, don't look for it, don't wait for it. What you see in your first system is all there is.\n\nWhat you see in your first land battle/black hole is also all there is.\n\nGameplay 3/5\nPlanetary quests are hand drawn, text based, old school adventures of choices. They are in some parts very random and you are advised to save prior to starting one. Some of these (like this game of one pawn against 4) require few tries to complete due to random AI movements. Others require you to familiarize with quest first in order to understand it's mechanics. (A warning. Don't dig down in sex-change quest for a Peleng IF you play as a Peleng).\n\nPlanetary quests are the most difficult part of the game and the most enjoyable. Each is different and unique; this is the only part where Space Rangers really shines.\n\nThe RTS battles are sometimes simply impossible to win (you will see) and require constant activity (non-stop production and attacking) and are very crappy, but they pay quite well.\n\nSpace battles and generally things you do in space fall into 2 categories:\n- making money by scavenging stuff from space/planets, performing easy quests (package delivery, get a quick ship, get all those quests and earn tons of money), or by so called trading (use trading centers to figure out best deals)\n- running into or away from combat. This is where this game falls flat on it's face and moans in agony. You will need few deaths to get used to general turn-based combat system, targeting, and generally understanding why you do not do any damage.\n\nIn difference to the original game there is this pirate faction added into the title, but they are just 'meh'.\nYou can either bother yourself with antagonizing pirates (meaning, every system will have a hostile pirate fighters) or going against Coalition (meaning, every system will become hostile), which is just as stupid as it sounds.\n\nThere is no storyline to speak of. You are a ranger, who wants to become THE Ranger, there are some evil guys (rouge machines) that will shoot you on sight, there are some good guys (basically anyone else) that you can interact with. You either destroy the evil ones (oddly, you can join them, but it is game over with some info that you destroyed good guys) or they destroy everyone else, plain and simple. No twist, no immersion, no nothing. Just us vs them.\n\nUnless you cheat in money(and you don't want to in HD edition, as mentioned), you will have to spend first few(or more) years of the game just getting enough to buy a decent ship and components (and by decent I mean the one that lets you fly through dominator's systems and live) and upgrade them with micromodules to the point of usefulness. The real game starts then (you will get a ton of exp/badges by the time you will be ready for combat) only for you to discover that either:\n- evil ones are too strong and you will have to reconquer dozen of systems (gets very boring very soon, especially since they fight back trying to instantly recapture the system) just to get a chance to get to their homeworlds and destroy bosses\n- they have been reduced to just a few systems and there is no one left to fight (game will end in next few years)\n\nMusic 1/5\nI will give this poor rating for what have been done in HD edition.\nIn original game, music was in .dat format, you could listen to it outside of the game and with some tinkering replace the few poor track with something better. This is no longer the case in HD edition - everything is packed into pkg file.\nTherefore you are forced to listen to few very good tracks and then be interrupted with few really, really crappy.\nThere is simply nothing you can do with that, as touching game files is out of the question.\nIt's either turning the music off altogether and playing it out of soundtrack (really, a soundtrack was added as a standalone?) or suffering it while you will be pulling your hairs out during some intense (and by that I mean hundreds of missiles aimed at you) space combat.\n\n\nIt's 2014 and steam workshop is alive and kicking, yet devs of this game are becoming increasingly paranoid about anyone who buys their stuff actually trying to get more fun out of it by cheating/modding.\n\n\nAs such I can't recommend HD edition to you.\nGet yourself SR2:Reboot, play it, cheat the most annoying parts of it (and there are many), have fun.\nYou won't have much fun here, once you will understand how little profit you can make by trading/missions and see the price tag for decent equipment and how shockingly imbalanced SR really is. This game simply becomes a grind for gold way too soon and stays that way until almost the end.\n\nAlso some difficulty settings are no longer available on start - they have been moved to 'advanced settings' and using them means your score will not be posted (WTF, really?!). Yes IT IS THAT STUPID AS IT SOUNDS!\n\n\nSo in conclusion - there are other titles for you to play for 18€ that you will enjoy much better. This one is not worth that much money.\n\nFor less than a 5€ however you might give it a go, just don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.\n\nYou are warned.","December 28, 2014","false","4.5"," 8 of 37 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","8","37","0","4"

Game design has come a long way in 20 years, and this doesn't really stand up to the test of time.\n\nAlthough trading and quests are part of the game, and mildly entertaining, the only real long-term solution is violence, which is very unsatisfying in its mechanics.\n\nIn friendly sectors, you click on a pirate ship to lay in what is supposed to be an intercept course, and set which guns to activate. What actually happens is you face away from your target while he chases you, making all your forward firing missiles take forever to double back and hit your enemy. Then, when he's at half hull, he breaks off and afterburns to a nearby planet to escape destruction, leaving you with nothing to show except a damaged hull and a bunch of empty missiles.\n\nIn hostile sectors, you get swarmed and die. And don't even mention the RTS surface battles. They should have just cut them—I thought Empire at War's planetary battles were superfluous...but boy were they a treat compared to this.\n\nTo summarize, the controls are too poor to formulate any consistent tactic, and you're forced to constantly reload to get lucky enough to kill anything. All this time, you're draining your bank account, making it about as hard to get ahead as in real life.

I started a game by choosing at random in a load of what seem to be pointless options. The game proposed me a tutorial after read about a dozen wall of texts. The game even lampshades it's being annoying by doing so. I hurt my eyes looking at the small print everywhere. Then I bought some probes, when to explore mercury (sounded like a good idea) and when outside of mercury, some pirate asked for twice my total money otherwise it kills me. Then a second one joined. Now I can't leave the planet - not that I could beat the first one. After a half hours of tests I managed to kill them (with the help of random military ships in the system) but 2 more joined... and I spend most of my money repairing my ship. It feels like endless grind. I didn't even play 2 hours.\n\nApart from the obviously bad balancing in this game (really ? getting camped in the STARTING SYSTEM ???), combat done in the tutorial feels VERY bland, just point in a direction and shoot automatically if you didn't forget to ask it to shoot. Inventory is very small, there seems to be about 8 things possible to trade, repair costs are prohibitive, mini-games... uhg. I started the "robot war" thingy. Ok, it kind of does allow for infinite money in the main game at the cost of not playing the main game. It's about as fun as the "just before space" war in spore with the Fun part taken out of it. Oh wait, there is no fun part in that phase of spore... and this is even worse. Trading is... trading. Mining is shooting at ships and waiting for more asteroids to come. Exploration consists in loading probes and clicking "end turn" until it's done - and mostly you can't take everything beause inventory is sooo small. And the walls of text in very small print which hurt my eyes on top of it.\n\nI imagine that some of the defects I speak of are alleviated later in the game, but the start did such a good job in disgusting me I can't even think of going to look.\n\nI can't recommend this. It's game like that which keeps the space games down. I'm glad I got it in a sale for 5 euros, but it's not even worth this low amount of money.\n\nPS:\nSadly, this game shows the limitations of the review system in Steam. When a game has a "cult" following a load of hardcore fans flock to the game, block bad reviews, and flood the store with "good" reviews. Don't be fooled, this game is fully deserving of the low reviews it deserves on metacritic.","November 18, 2014","false","2.0"," 13 of 85 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","13","85","0","0"

However, after playing over the tutorial and the early game for almost three hours I had absolutely nothing to show for it.\n\nFirst I had to dig up the manual to find out what the races and personalities meant. Then, after playing through most of the tutorial I repeatedly died to a training drone (!) because my starting ship was not cut out for it. Then I realised that the game had left my starting equipment on the station without telling me I had to equip it before leaving and managed to beat the tutorial by repeatedly docking to repair mid-combat. Finally, I got into the game proper and can find no indication in the game or in the manual as to how to make enough credits to even keep up with the cost of repairs.\n\nI desperately wanted to be able to get into the 'rhythm' of this game so that I could enjoy what appears to be a cornucopia of varied content, but it fought me every step of the way.

No, I REALLY wanted to like this game.  It reminded me of another space exploration/ combat/ merchant game I used to love to play called Escape Velocity.  This was slightly different, what with the turn based movement/ combat and a RTS-type aspect with the ground combat.  But I thought that would just add to the enjoyment.\n\nMy biggest problem with this game (and the reason I uninstalled it) is that they tell you nothing about anything.  You are thrown to the wolves from day one.  They do have a minor tutorial that "instructs" you how to play.  It took me dying 5 times in the tutorial (THE TUTORIAL) to realize that most of the useful information is displayed as a microscopic toolbar down in the bottom left of your screen.  After I saw that, I actually managed to make it past the tutorial only to die promptly thereafter to a random pirate (this wasn't in hard mode, mind you).  Also, there are so many little markings and symbols that don't have a description.  These things should be helping you, but instead just make me ask, "Why give me descriptors that are in no way descriptive or helpful?"  There are 2 very different combat modes (one of which they don't bother explaining at all).  All-in-all, this game was just massively frustrating.\n\nThis could be an AMAZING game.  All they would have to do is help you understand how the game works.  Instead, they throw you the (incomplete) Dummies guide to brain surgery and say, "good luck, sucker."  I will gladly pick it up again if I learn that they have added an actual descriptive explanation of how to play the game.","April 18, 2014","false","2.4"," 15 of 121 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","15","121","0","8"

This is all just one single quest:\n\nI'm playing a kind of scumbag ranger, smuggling contraband and generally being sleazy. At one point I took an escort mission, when the other ship and I were in deep space with no one around I opened fire on them until they surrendered and offered me credits to stop attacking them, which I accepted, I then flew to the originating base and told them I had successfully escorted the ship and got paid there as well - that kind of thing.\n\nI'm flying around looking for opportunities and I see a big collection of ore and mineral, just floating around. I fill up my cargo bay and head to the nearest inhabited planet to unload my haul, but I wasn't really paying attention because I was an outlaw on this planet and the police caught me as soon as I landed. I was sent to prison where I was given the option of serving my sentence or attempting to escape. I chose to serve my sentence, and it turned in to a prison simulation where I had to survive 75 days in prison while balancing relationships with the prison officials and the other prisoners.\n\nLuckily I'm fairly rich on the outside and access to my credits was not cut off in prison. I first ran in to an old prison veteran who gave me prison survival tips for a few credits each and he kept basically telling me that if I was going to be a "good boy" and suck up to the guards and be a model prisoner, the other inmates would grow to hate me. He also mentioned a cafeteria where I could get food which would make my life easier, but if I spent too much money at the cafeteria, the other inmates would start to get jealous.\n\nThen I went to the Cafeteria and spent a lot of money to buy food for every inmate. This instantly bought me the respect of all of the prisoners, but the guards got suspicious and started keeping watch on me. On my way back to my cell I smuggled a fork and a spoon, but when I got back to my cell someone had raided my locker and stolen some credits. I figured I would need to beat someone up over this, so I went to the gym to get ripped, but dropped a barbell on my foot instead, so I had to go back to my cell, where some shady inmate wanted to sell me a tape recorder. I bought it without any idea why I would want it and went to bed.\n\nThe next day the prisoners were holding a fist-fight championship, so instead of going to work or the gym or the library, I went to the fight. When I got there I found out that the prison warden loved these fights and he was in attendance. I requested to become a participant in the hopes of gaining respect from both camps. The first fighter came out hard and strong and I was forced in to a defensive stance and couldn't get any hits off, the guy eventually pummeled me so hard within a few rounds that local newspapers were reporting on how I "took it in the face".\n\nWhen I woke up, I decided to use my spoon to start digging a tunnel out of my cell. After a day of digging I had only made it 7m, so I gave up and regretted not working out at the gym instead. The next day I decided to play it straight and went to get a work assignment, but they wanted me to paint a f**king fence which is bullls**t so I refused. The guards beat the s**t out of my and threw me in solitary for the night. When they brought me back to my cell the next day, I was confronted by a group of inmates. See, when I first went in to prison and I bought respect from the inmates, they took a real liking to me, in fact they liked me to much that I was named "the prison Don", and they... disposed of the old Don. However, I was f**king up too much, now things were ruined, and they regretted escalating me to Don status. They brandished some shanks and metal pipes and pretty much told me I was dead unless I paid them off. I also had the option to fight, but between the fight I lost earlier and the beating I took from the guards, I figured it was a bad idea, so I paid them off.\n\nI really wanted to go to the medical center, but today was another fight day and it was closed down - f**k. I went to the fights and decided to participate again, in my already weakened state. My opponent was a little scrappy guy but I guess he knew what he was doing, because he knocked me out, then picked me up and threw my body straight out of the ring, godd**nit. The papers made fun of me again and I went to bed.\n\nI checked the calendar. I've only been in here for seven days, and I have another 68 until release.\n\ne: On day 10 I decided to get some prison tats and ended up tattooing my entire back with Masonic symbols","November 11, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet 2 people found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't let that minigame look fool you this game has a $60 worth of content . It has somewhat of a sandbox feel to it because you can progress through the game by fighting dominators,trading,doing quests or just being a pirate .\n\nThe main menu has a very nice custom gameplay options which you can use to make it harder or easier on yourself . Also you can get much better starting ship at the cost of some races hating you which is a risk vs reward option .\n\nProbably the most important part of this game is just the fact that it is so visually uniqe and the soundtrack is amazing . It may not be a 3D space game but it still creates very immersive atmosphere .\n\nThere are several gameplay types that may appeal to different players . You have a turn based space combat, RTS style ground quests where game completly changes the way it plays , Text Missions for people who enjoy puzzles and twitch space combat inside black holes .\n\nLast but not least is the element of random events. Sometimes you pilot can get a sickness and then you will keep getting money each month as donations from organization fighting that disease.\nEach time you play the game you may run into a different problem . Sometimes some of the big bosses can come to your system location and kill everyone , forcing you to flee and adapt new tactics .If you set game on hardest diffeculty you can actually loose entire galaxy to pirates & dominators .\n\nIt really is a solid game in all aspects . My only complain is that I prefered Dominatos (robots) as main story villains and not Pirates in this expansion . The pirate faction has some issues though because you might get a quest to protect all ships in pirate system which is kidna dumb because its just nearly impossible to do without some serious luck .","October 14, 2015","true","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That isn't to say they did a bad job, because the worst that could be said is their writing was a bit difficult to understand.\n\nThe rest of the game is a veritable gem. And it's a game that's still getting polish, because it's still getting updates and content that add depth to the game. I first bought the game ages ago and enjoyed it then and recently came back to discover that they'd added a great deal without me having paid a penny for it.","November 9, 2015","true","181.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

English version has only 27 text quest's when russian version has 71 of them, that is a gaint bumer, people who dont speak russian not gona enjoy one of the best things this game has to offer.\nOther then that? Backstory, yeah, same issue as the one abowe but you cant realy fix it, you see, a big part of the dialogue is telling us abbaut some one called "Rachehan" and somthing called "Machpella" (sorry if i spelled it wrong).\nRachehan is a greatest pirat the universe has ever known and Machpella was the danger that fallen on the universe but you probably dont know that, as you probably dont know that this is actualy a SECOND installment in Space Rangers franchise, originaly it has been called "Space Rangers 2: Dominators" and latter was "Space Rangers 2: Dominators Reloaded" then there was a fan addon "Space Rangers 2: Revolution" and then it has become "Space Rangers HD: Revolution" as an official release, and then "Space Rangers HD: A War Appart", so when you reding this right now and you never playd Space Rangers 1 you might say: "Where can i get this game? Im intrested in this game but i dont want to go in it without backstory", tough poop its not available, its not on steam, and there is no stores that sell it from what i know, CD with it are probably still alive but you will have issues running it on new PC.\nBottom line, it would be better if it was 100% transleted, other then that, i spended over 800 hours playng it back when i was yong, and its still... AWESOME!\ni r8 10\10 M8\nYEAH!","November 5, 2015","true","40.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely the best RTS/space-strategy game that I have ever had the pleasure of playing. You can tell this game was made with passion and  careful consideration and is a gem for any steam library. I wish it was being ported to mac but that's probably way too much to ask. I'm very surprised to see that a game this old and this niche is still receiving updates. It just goes to show how the devs put their heart and soul into this game.

I recommend getting if it's on sale.\n\nPros\nLots to do (Missions, Trading, Text Quests, Planetary Battles)\nOpen World\nLots of upgrades\nWorld feels alive\nCan command a team of rangers\nPiracy is fun\nPirate route is interesting\n\nCons\nLack of Player impact\nPlanetary battles quite weak\nText quests can be annoying\nFighting dominators can be a pain\nLack of options when investing in projects\n\nOverall I have had a lot of fun with this game. I first played it back in 2006 when i read a review on some game site. While the game is fun with lots to do, it can be frustrating at times. You really can't affect the state of affairs in the galaxy. While you can invest in projects and purchase fleets and stations, these have little affect. If they had allowed you to build a fleet and have more control over building up the coalition and which systems to attack it would have been a much better game. Planetary battles are just not that fun, the play control and the design of the minigame is just a bad RTS. I just skip these, but unfortunately you lose out on a lot of potential income. Hopefully another similar game will be released that takes what is good about this game and gives it more options so the player can affect the game world more directly.","March 10","true","196.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The reason i do not reccomend this game (fullprice) , is because some of things that were added that worent in the game originaly are just bad , had a text mission (there are a few of those) where the translation was god awful , the choices made literaly no sense, and i had literally no idea what was going on (mostly because everything that was written was nonsencical , picture something translated from chinese using google translate....). The pricing of things in game is kinda wonky , and i dislike the pirate faction mechanics... Anyway i would reccomend getting the original , it still works (and if it doesnt there are fixes).
