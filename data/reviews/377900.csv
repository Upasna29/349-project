"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReverendD/recommended/377900/","ReverendD","Reverend D","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReverendD/","155 products in account","I'd like to preface my review with a disclaimer; my reviews are typically written and intended for older gamers like myself. If you are looking for a competitive management sim with defined objectives, it is a game you will want to try. If you are looking for more freeform play as with previous tycoon titles, you may want to wait until a more suitable mode is included. Having tried and failed as a programmer myself, I respect anyone who can complete a project and follow through.\n\nI've added suggestions as an update to provide a more constructive form of criticism as I had previously stated: There are many things I like about this game. Just because I don't recommend it doesn't mean you wouldn't like it.\n\n"Not really what I'd consider a "Tycoon" namesake, far too linear and defined. The game is very rigid and instead of allowing you to mold a channel for a specific audience, it forces you to cater to a random viewer-type each hour. About the only thing I was actually able to customize about my channel was it's name, and which of 3 avatars I wanted running it.\n\nThe economics seem well designed, and progression was available; however, after a few days I realized my MTV-Squared channel was only playing romance and anime to cater to the women and children that were tuning in. If I had been able to pick my content, and draw an ever-increasing target audience, I'd still be playing it... but the way it's delivered is far too unrealistic (afterall, how often does lifetime cater to frat boys?)\n\nThe graphics, music and character movement were all enjoyable, and I really appreciated the programmers sense of humor and references to movies."\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone looking for a management simulation with strict defined goals... but a tycoon? Imagine Dino-Park tycoon with a pre-built park, and you need to add the dinos the current guests want to see. An actual tycoon game allows for a lot more freedom, typically does not have a hard ending in which you win or lose, and is less competitive in game (more about staying in the black, and ever-expanding your business/park/etc.)\n\nUPDATE: I would like to point out that I didn't dislike the current game mode; quite the contrary. Multiplayer in this style game is actually a very cool concept. I'd also like to expound a bit on what I think would make this a better tycoon.\n\n1.) Dynamic Crowds/Custom Stations Example: A player buys the game wanting to make a specific-style network (ie. TNT, Nickelodeon, Lifetime, Sci-fi Channel, Comedy Central) but is immediately burdened with the fact they cannot legally purchase several titles within that genre. The player goes to set programming, but the audience is random throughout the day (great for the initial arcade style mode, not so great for cultivating an audience in your personal sandbox.). The player starts airing only one Genre, over and over, and eventually the audience adapts (people stop tuning in when they hate the channel, and make more of an effort to find time when they love it.)\n\n*Granted... the math behind this one may be a challenge with the current system.\n\n2.) Custom Touches, The Little Things: Minor aesthetics go a long way, the ability to set your office decor (maybe a handful of movie posters for the wall, or genre-styled pieces for display). Anything to make the office seem more the players creation and less a defined element.\n\n3.) Office Design/Building: While not entirely necessary to feel more like a tycoon, it would be highly liberating to be able to design your TV Station building to some degree. If a single play/endless style mode were introduced, it would be beneficial to have a smaller overall building to ease navigation and\nbe less overwhleming for a player to decorate.\n\n4.) More defined identity: Add some additional content for stations that pursue a specific style. (ie. Bonuses/Perks for players who specialize in ads, directing their own films, or broadcasting pirated material.) Reward players for adhering to a specifc discipline or for balanced approaches.\n\nMore to come.","October 21, 2015","false","4.7"," 273 of 340 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","273","340","4","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meckus/recommended/377900/","meckus","Meckus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meckus/","373 products in account","Designed to offer its user hours of entertainment, Empire TV Tycoon is a game that tells the player to get people in front of their screens, while the game has that very same effect on the player. It’s hard to know when it’s time to stop.\n\nTelevision is a medium of entertainment which permits millions of people to listen to the same joke at the same time, and yet remain lonesome.\n\nT.S. Eliot\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Empire TV Tycoon.\n\nGameplayThe game gives the player a simple goal: to be the best channel.\n\nAs you learn the basics, you’ll soon discover that being the best doesn’t always mean having the best programs, or the best comercials deals, or the most cashflow. Sometimes, it doesn’t even mean having the highest audience.\n\nTo be the best - and to win the game - the player needs to achieve a certain number of points, “Fame” as they’re called. These points are obtained each time block, depending on the game mode, as well as your channel’s position when compared to the rival channels. Simply put, the channel with the highest audience wins the most points. However, points can also be obtained by winning some awards, with cerimonies happening every two days, and the player can choose to participate by submitting a movie, self-produced, of a certain genre. Not only are these awards a good source of Fame points, they’re also a good revenue source.\n\nNow, here’s where the real fun, and management starts. There are eight kinds of audience, and twelve program genres - thirteen if you count “Live Events”, so, as you can easily guess, not everyone likes the same programs.\n\nHowever, you must also consider the overall picture when you have more than one kind of audience in a time block, which means you’ll have to find the best suitable program for all of them to like, or at least have a positive likeability average.\n\nOnce you’ve used a program - there are four different types - it loses its freshness, meaning you won’t be able to use it, at least not efficiently, anytime soon. This is where the actual managament comes in to play, as you’ll have to juggle between what is available to you, what the vendor has and what your scriptwriters/production office can put out. Let’s not forget the pirate copies, but piracy is wrong, right?\n\nTo help you get more viewers, you can use some marketing features, of which there’s a total of five available to you. This will help you to get that tiny, tiny number of extra viewers you need to finish that one ugly commercial contract you need to comply with, unless you want the penalty hammer to come down on you.\n\nProducing your own programs can be very good, or very bad. Some can be quite expensive, and unless the resources are properly distributed, you might end up with a poor program, while a better one could have, most likely, been obtained for a much cheaper price at the vendor.\n\nAs the player’s Fame points increase, new upgrades for the channel will be made available, from an improved movie library, to a wider broadcast, and even better actors, they’re all very good, and important to get that extra edge.\n\nRunning a TV channel is a hard thing, and doing it alone is even harder, and that’s exactly why you can hire up to four workers to help you. This sounds extremely sweet, until you’re faced with the available options, all of which have their advantages. As the Rolling Stones have said many, many times, “You can’t always get what you want.”\n\nWho would have thought that something that looks so simple could, in fact, be so complex?\n\nI almost forgot. References! There’s a bucketload of references in the game. From movies to series and even music. I found myself giggling a couple times due to them.\n\nWhat to expectTrue to its description, Empire TV Tycoon allows the player to manage their own channel, competing with other channels in order to be the one with the highest audience.\nFrom setting the correct program genre to the correct audience, or by choosing the best available, taking into consideration the blocks available, as well as the freshness of the program, it’s up to the player to run a successful channel.\nI’d also like to mention that the development team was, and still is, very interested in improving the game, and making sure it’s what everyone expects it to be, and more, while quickly fixing some errors.\n\nWhat not to expectUnless you misread the description, or someone gave you the wrong idea, do not expect the game allow you to build your own office, or set up your own studio or set special contracts with actors.\n\nVerdictWorth Purchasing. With a couple changes and a few additions, the Empire TV Tycoon has all it takes to be the best within the sub-genre, for years to come. Don’t be surprised to see my verdict change as new features are added.\n\nNoteFor those that want some sort of comparison, imagine Mad TV with a much more appealing look, as well as an extremely engaging atmosphere.\n\nReview copy provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.","October 20, 2015","true","20.5"," 101 of 127 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","101","127","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirCabbage/recommended/377900/","SirCabbage","sir_cabbage_the_green","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirCabbage/","617 products in account","Wow- when I first saw this game pop up on steam I thought to myself "huh, a MAD TV clone". How very very...right I was. This is exactly what I expected but so much more. Empire TV recreates the game and updates UI without taking away the charm which players would have came to expect. In Empire players fight against AI opponents to make their channel #1. Everything works very much as you would imagine- players plan their days, negotiate advertising contracts, research new tech, buy/steal/create new TV shows and movies to run on their channel... It has three difficulty modes and three gameplay modes. The best mode seems to be the custom mode- which allows you to have a longer competitive game where you decide just how easy or hard it is. With promised mod support down the line and so many different options I really can't wait to see where this game goes.\n\nBut what really gets me is the apparent dedication of the devs to this title. This is not just some quick cash in on player's nostalgia, the devs really seem to give a damn about their game. When this title first popped up on steam it did not have any gameplay after the base mode is finished, it completely ended at the end of the game. This turned me away at first and I did not check back until just recently. What do I come back to when I notice the game on sale this time round? Endless mode... lots of changes and additions in content... and even a custom game mode. The forums even have a transparent plan for what they hope to acheive patch wise in 2016. These developers care about their game and it shines through.\n\n","December 27, 2015","true","17.3"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","53","57","0","0"

But here are the reasons I've quit playing for now:\n\n-Viewership seems to be genre based only (and some of it doesn't make sense).  The plot and other aspects of the show mean nothing.  Lovers don't like Sports movies.  So if you program a sports movie for them, they won't tune in, even though it's a love story too.   I haven't seen a change in Elderly viewership based on when the movie was made.  The elderly don't like comedies, but they wouldn't tune in for a Laurel and Hardy movie?  And what's up with guys not liking comedies?\n\n-Multi-hour films have no effect on viewership.  A huge audience of lovers will watch the first hour of a romance film, then just leave in the middle of it.  A geek will sit down to watch a 3 hour Sci-Fi film after 2/3s of it is over.  Good marketing should bring in viewers early.  A good film should keep some viewers engaged for its duration.\n\n-The necessity of moving to different parts of the building is annoying to me.  I get that it's part of the time-management mechanism, but when I am browsing ads or movies, I'd really like to see my schedule and the viewers for upcoming time slots. As it stands, you have to memorize your day's schedule to make the trip to the other floor productive.  My guy doesn't have a PDA or a printer he can use to take the schedule to the movie vault with him?\n\n-Purchased advantages give no advantage.  The developers acknolwedge this in the forums.  When you buy tech from Doc Brown, the AI players get it at the exact same time.  So there's no advantage to purchasing them.  The developers state they may change this, but by doing so will either make the fame game extremely hard (when the AI gets tech and you don't) or easy (when you get it but the AI doesn't have the fame yet.)  This leads into the next item.\n\n-Tech jumps are far too steep.  When I got the 'streaming' tech recently, my viewership jumped massively.   It's such a steep change, all the ads in your queue that haven't had a block filled are removed from your list, and those that you can finish are ridiculously easy.  There needs to be more upgrades to purchase that provide smaller boosts.  It would add to the strategy of the game, while diminshing the tech gap issue in the previous item.\n\nOne of the tech gap issues revolves around the library of available films.  If you get the tech that gives you higher rated movies and your opponent doesn't, you could really outpace them on fame.  This is why when you get it, the AI gets it too.  It's a dumb mechanism.\n\nSo with all the flaws, I'll be putting this game on the back shelf for a while.\n\n","November 18, 2015","false","11.2"," 84 of 106 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","84","106","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/377900/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","NOTE: This has been provided to me for free for review purposesOverview:Empire TV Tycoon is the self-evident title of a TV Channel simulator. You are in charge of managing almost every aspect of your broadcast. You can set the program, choose which ads will play, write your own scripts, hire actors, create your own shows, accept different contracts and manage the finances! Overall this is a very detailed simulator, worth taking a look at if micromanagement simulators are your thing.\n\nThe Pros:In Depth - As I've enumerated above, there are lots of aspects that you can manage about your channel, and it really feels like you are in control, and you are basically the only true employee.\n\nGreat UI - Every production has its own "thumbnail" and music that plays on the mini-tv in the lower left corner that shows a live preview of what your (and your competitors') channel is broadcasting. Alongside is a couch on which can sit up to three demographics that are watching TV at the time. Analyze your audience and plan your schedule accordingly. Speaking of which, is a very nicely laid out spreadsheet with sortable blocks of content!\n\nTons of References - There are a lot of movie titles, actors' names and characters that make cameos in this game, (eg. Walter White as a movie librarian and Doc. Brown as the upgrades guy). Try to figure out what is referencing what. Also, we have the overly stereotypical audience members, like fat, bald males, rockers that take their guitar to watch tv, and more.\n\nProduce your own Shows! - I like the many details put into the making of your own productions. You get to choose two actors to play, decide the type of product (tv show, movie) as well as the length, and then distribute points that accurately influence the rating of your thing. For example, have low nudity and great realism in a documentary, or great costume design and post-production in a sci-fi movie. You can even submit your creations to the in game equivalent of the Golden Globe!\n\nCustom Modes - You can choose how hard the game will be, how large your budget is, how many audience types is, whether or not you want the game to have an end, and so you can play however you want, at your own pace.\nThe Cons:No Automation - You can only plan your schedule one day in advance, and have to do it each day. This is a bit time consuming, and I would rather have it so that I can choose what blocks contain, and have the game randomize it. For example, between 19:00 - 00:00 pick high rated movies, at 18:00 play the next episode in the season of a TV show, etc. I would want to be in charge of the catalog of shows my channel offers, not being the timekeeper.\n\nMoving Around - Your company has three floors in which you conduct your activity. One one, you can admin your schedule, on one you manage employees, and on another you manage your personal productions. The only downside is that you have to move (using only one elevator that is shared with the two other competing channels, who for some reason operate in the same building) to a location in the building in order to do things. This usually takes time and I would prefer being presented with tabs somewhere on the screen to bring up the menus.\n\nA bit repetitive - After you get a hang of the ropes, you will find the game begins to be a little monotonous.\nConclusion:This is a game that is great only if you already are into the genre. It feels solid, has character, sufficiently in-depth to feel realistic, and overall is an entertaining experience. Simulate away!\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","January 30","true","13.1"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","46","53","2","6"

A minor annoyance at worst but it's there.\n- A bit more information about the underlying features would be nice. Sometimes it seems even a perfectly planned out program chart leads to 2nd or 3rd in the ratings with no obvious reason why.\n- Some programs don't fit their respective genres or audience groups. Children like Brother Bear and The Last Legion just as much, and Elders like Nymphomaniac simply because it's a Drama.\n- Men don't like Masters of the Universe. -1 for realism.\n\nOverall, the game has a lot of bang for the buck. Plenty of features and replayability already, and with future updates it should have even more so. If you're a fan of Mad TV or tycoon games in general, I highly recommend you pick this one up.","October 25, 2015","true","28.9"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","30","31","5","0"

It was released on October 20th, 2015 for $12.99. A press review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels.\n\nEmpire TV Tycoon is a unique member of the tycoon family style of games. It is inspired by Mad TV and Game Dev tycoon according to it’s development team and I agree with that statement wholeheartedly. The first session I played after knowing the full scope of the game was extremely addictive and fun. The aspect of managing the marketing and advertising for best viewership is challenging and though provoking. My station produced many movies and TV shows, and won awards for them. You do this all by hiring writers, actors, and production assistants to help your cause.\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\n\nManagement time – My first completed game for 300 fame felt like it took an hour and a half or so. I was streaming live at the time and as it happens it was closer to four hours of non-stop TV station management. It’s always a good sign when I can lose myself in a game, clicking and planning was more pleasant than I initially expected. The option to speed the game up only gives you a slight push as you’ll need to stop and film new movies or shows, deal with viewer requests, and update your library. Each day adds new challenges that cause the player to adapt their strategy often.\n\nCulture shock – The amount of cultural references (mostly pop culture) in Empire Tv Tycoon is borderline obscene, which is perfect. You buy your movies from one of two iconic characters, Walter white from Breaking Bad is the legal seller, and Silent Bob from Jay and Silent Bob sells the bootleg goods. You buy your ads from Mad Men’s Don Draper, your tech upgrades from Back to the Future’s Doc Brown.. The level of detail to mainstream television is absolutely perfect, this aspect helped sell the entire theme very well.\n\nReruns – The replay value here is astronomical, you can play an arcade mode to a set number of fame, or play endless mode and see just how far you can take your station over lengthy campaigns. There are a number of various events which give each replay a fresh feel. Producing movies and TV shows to compete in various awards shows also changes from game to game so you never know what you’ll be producing next.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nInformation request – The biggest flaw with my experience was that certain genres seem to miss certain viewers that aren’t always logical. I programmed the Sopranos for a one hour block with male viewers to complete a male targeted car advertisement and they not only didn’t hit the numbers but turned their TV to another station. I did fins that fantasy movies were good for kids, and sci-fi good for nerds, but there should be some way to track what genres are working with certain viewers.\n\nSee it to believe it – The portion of the game where you have scripts written, hire actors, and film productions is fantastic. The problem I have with it is that you get a numerical rating afterwards and little else. It would be an amazing addition to see some scenes from that movie or show, or see your product in a form other than a numerical rating. This is more of a wishful addition than a complaint, but I often felt that my station worked hard to make the movie, we should get to see at least a funny scene from it or something of that nature.\n\nThis was a surprising review for me because at first glance I was somewhat apprehensive to play Empire TV Tycoon. The tycoon style of game often feels bland or boring for my taste but this game really is quite enjoyable. The pop culture references made me giggle often through my game, and certain film or TV shows displayed in the game are childhood favorites. Theme is important and this game delivers it in droves, you’ll really feel engaged and challenged while trying to run your station. For me this was a clear reminder not to judge a game by it’s cover, as this game is an instant favorite in my library.\n\nScore: Buy it now","December 7, 2015","true","10.2"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","1"

(Fortunately, these two aims usually coincide.)\n\nI have to say I ragequit a couple of times after botching a few ad contracts which left me deep in the red from the penalty clauses. This is what happens when you show gory splatter movies in the early morning to "Children" and "Lovers".\n\nSo it's not always easy to get the audiences you need to fulfill your advertising contracts (your main source of cash), as you have to take care to match the program genres to the audiences. You can buy movies and shows (including many real titles) from the library in the basement (or alternatively from the guy selling pirated shows outside, which carries its own risks).\n\nAs well, you can hire writers and actors to produce your own productions - you can also enter this original programming to contest awards, which can provide a nice amount of cash and fame as well. If the show you've just produced is just too terrible to air, at least you can hock it off for some spare change. Another source of income are the optional special requests to show a particular style at a certain time - you have to judge whether these conflict with your advertising priorities.\n\nThe art is low-bit and low-rez but adept enough to give you the feel of running your own TV station, whilst the UI is generally well polished with the occasional quirk.","October 21, 2015","true","7.3"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","14","14","2","0"

Especially one that has a real "Code Monkeys" type vibe. The concept is simple, you own your own studio in the Empire TV building where you schedule tv shows and movies with varying "freshness" and "quality" ratings (generally the highest) in an attempt to become the most successful channel on cable. You have the ability to buy new movies/tv shows (or pirate them) while also selling old stock to keep an influx of fresh content rolling on your channel. You're also able to schedule ad blocks to supplement your income and you can even purchase advertisement which will boost viewer numbers. There are an assortment of other features in the game from Award Shows, Studio upgrades, making your own movies/tv shows based on a point system and so on. You will be doing all of this while competing against 2 other players (AI). Be sure to move fast though, the AI players are incredibly efficient and will not make your rise on the Silver Screen, easy.\nSo what do I think of the game?\nWell, it's simple, addicting and all about managing time and money in an efficient manner. Despite it's simplicity, Dreamsite managed to include a pretty decent amount of depth and things to do in the game, so you will never be "waiting" around for something to happen. The TV business is constantly rolling and if you even think about slowing down, you will be left behind. It would've been nice if the dev could've gotten more music, it seems like there are only about 2-3 songs in the game that play on loop but honestly, that's just a minor issue. Aesthetically, it's your usual pixel based game... personally, I love it because it makes me think of G4's Code Monkeys! What it does, it does well and it even has time to throw in a lot of Pop Culture references such as actual movie titles; Star Wars, Back to the Future etc and even features TV/Movie characters like Don Draper, Silent Bob and "Doc" Brown. So, I think it's pretty clear that I very much enjoy the game.\nGameplay Footage and Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzXUGXl6cnQ","October 20, 2015","true","4.9"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","18","22","6","0"

TV. From MUD they have taken the social groups and the rest from MadTV. But is it fun? Yes,yes it is. It is an awesome take on that game and if you liked MadTV, you will like this one.\n\nThe main difference is, that you really need to be on the edge about making your next move on the programming schedule, because of how social audience discovery works. You also need to be very careful about what ads you sign, because the penalites really sting.\n\nYou turn every script in either a TV Show with multiple episodes, a TV Film (1 hour) a standard movie (2 hours) or a Blockbuster (3 hours). You then need to distribute points, which kind of works like in GameDev Tycoon. An action movie benefits more from special effects, than e.g. a Drama. So you need to find out the best combinations, which adds some depth to it.\n\nOverall, I really like the game.","October 20, 2015","true","1.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","8"

This game is a must have for movie buffs who also like tycoon games. You make money from advertising.

This adds to the immersive side of Empire, and it can be quite fun (if not diabolical) to plan a day's tv viewing based on your favourite films... or least favourites...\n\nYou can hire staff, including a scriptwriter which is pretty key if you intend to do the optional portion of entering the aforementioned film festivals and award shows. The scripts themselves don't really make sense, which is a bit of a shame overall, and you end up just looking at the script rating before deciding to tear it up (with the rather satisfying sound effect) or keeping it to make the film.\n\nMaking films is pretty straight forward, as you have a studio floor where you hire stars (spoofs of actual stars or iconic movie characters) and decide on the format for your script - tv movie, tv series, feature big budget, etc. You can enter these films in the festivals and then sell them later on after you've screened them on your channel.\n\nYou can fill the world with John Waters tributes, or cringe-worthy game shows. Or Meryl Streep performances - the world is your oyster. You call the shots.\n\nOverall gameplay is simple - after my second play through I had already "won" the default game, and had moved onto custom and setting up harder win options. Some people have complained about the AI getting upgrades when you do, but there is a way to uncheck that in the custom options. Others don't like having to take the elevator all the time, but given this isn't Tower Sim or Hotel Sim, using the elevator doesn't really take away that much from time or game play. In fact, it probably adds to the immersion... running a TV station involves a lot of running about.\n\nAnother important aspect of the game, are the game devs. In the beginning of 2016 a checklist of new content and improvements have been announced, and within the forums, the devs are very active. It bodes well for the longevity of the title and replay value, especially as they will include Steam Workshop and Mods over the coming year.\n\nShould you buy it? A bargain during a sale, I say yes.","January 1","true","21.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

That night I stayed up until 3am playing it.  It's definitely one of THOSE kinds of games.\n\nIt plays a lot like a cross between Game Dev Tycoon, The Movies, Sim Tower and few other classic tycoon games. It's got a very charming art style and sound design to go with it. Lots of brillaint audio and visual cues play out to keep you constantly aware of what's going on as the game progresses.\n\nA playthrough roughly lasts about 3-4 hours and there's easily a lot of re-playability here with a few different difficulty options available and a competing AI to keep you on your feet.\n\nI really like a lot of what this game has to offer and was incredibly impressed with it from the get go, there's an interesting level of challenge in place as you try to figure out the best show/blocking combination based on the audience that's watching and what your best opportunity is to make money from advertisements at the end of each block. I was constantly trying to figure out if I shoul aim my ads at a specific group that's currently watching, or save that slot for later when I might get more views. Games like this really excel from learning curves, it's what makes them great. I failed my first game, I knew fairly early on that I wasn't doing amazingly but I wanted to continue to get to grips of all the systems.  There's a good amount of information delivered to you in tutorials, but the game doesn't hold your hand too much and encourages you to experiment with it and I really respect that in games like this.\n\nI think the only real problem is that the game could benefit from a continue option once the game is over. (Though I think that's coming in a later update). There's something about just trying to fill and programme your schedule that's addictive enough, I didn't really mind that I'd lost and wanted to continue doing that. So just be aware that at the minute once it's game over, you have to start again.\n\nIt's games like this that make you realise just how brilliant the indie scene can be when a developer really loves their product and tries to make something fun and interesting, it really shows. So if you're like me and love tycoon games or any of the games mentioned above I'm sure it's something you'll also enjoy and I'd highly recommend picking it up.\n","October 20, 2015","true","4.1"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","30","49","5","14"

It combines Game Dev Tycoon when you start getting into the movie creation, as you have to assign points to aspects of the film (scenes, makeup, special effects). All of which can have a big impact on the rating of your movie after it is finish.\n\nThe game keeps it fresh by throwing in random events where you have to make decisions regarding things that happen during your movie production, special events and even live TV. The negatives is that it can be a slow when moving around the station, the random events often have bad outcomes or just make you spend money, the audiences are RNG so your ads might fail and you go broke because Rocker only popped up twice in 2 days when you have to show it off 4 times.

I love the concept and the variety of titles. If you enjoy little studio management sims like Game Dev Tycoon, you will love this game. Being the old-school young woman I am, I would prefer if this game were menu based... I'm not sure what the point of the whole tower interface is, but it's very intuitive and easy to get used to. Just wish I could interact with the ad man while viewing my program guide and so forth. If this game were multiplayer, I could see the benefit of an "open office." That would be quite cool, actually.\n\nI feel like there's a lot this game could expand upon to make it even better. Firstly, give us a reason to have access to other studios' rooms. A bit of corporate sabotage could be interesting. Also, I'd love if the demographics were a bit more dynamic... it'd be cool if themes influenced demographic appeal, rather than genre alone. For instance, Friday Night Lights should appeal to both lovers and athletes, and elderly people shouldn't go crazy over a Justin Beiber doc. I'd love to see that layer added to the game, as well as the audience shifting based on loyalty, but perhaps that would make the game much too easy. Remove the win conditon, and then the "ease" isn't a problem (freestyle mode, please!) Also, it'd be nice to see the employees do something other than provide buffs.\n\nThe game does not track or give you hints as to which demographic prefers what, and what the proper point ratios are when creating films. I personally don't mind writing stuff down, but it could be cumbersome for many. Admittedly, keeping track of point allocation and success rate is a chore and I have yet to pinpoint what makes a highly-rated film, especially because the point system is either bugged (won't let you allocate all points) or there's something I'm failing to understand. That said, there are a few bugs and typos in the game. It's nothing entirely gamebreaking, however.\n\nAll in all, this is a fun little sim that I just sat down and played for 7 hours straight. Considering how hard it is to hook me these days, that's fantastic. I would love to see this concept elaborated upon, however.","October 28, 2015","true","10.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Being an avid fan of Tycoon games, this is a really a good one. Everything about this game can be said by the trailer and screenshots. Being able to set the schedule of Movies/TV shows is very fun and it doesnt get that much boring with the other things in the game. One thing I have to be happy about is that the Movies/TV shows are actually real shows in real life and there were mostly no 'fake' names being used. The only gripe about this game I have is that there isnt a sandbox mode and that the two AI bots that are your competitors don't really change with each playthrough. Hopefully the Devs might add a sandbox mode. 8.8/10\n\nP.S.

It adds a bit of a puzzle and fast-thinking element to the game, and I feel if you could just choose one particular audience type the game would be far too easy, since you'd only have to worry about one type of show and ignore everything else. The whole point is to build a library of shows and movies for a diverse audience and try to grab the largest market share possible away from the competition.\n\nIf you're wondering why the competing stations are in the same building as you, it's because that's exactly how Mad TV worked. It creates some interesting and frantic situations where they can block you from getting to a destination in time, buy a movie or take an ad contract before you, or you can do the same to them. You can see the competing program directors scrambling around just like you, and it's helps foster a little bit of rivalry feeling as you pass them in the halls. I believe, also, that the developer has said something about sabotage in a future update (which was also in Mad TV), so you'd need to be able to visit competitors' offices and such to do so.\n\nThe tutorial could probably use a little work, but because I had played Mad TV before, and the game works basically the same way, I'm not exactly sure if I am the best judge of that. The game has a few rough edges here and there, such as a couple of typos in movie descriptions, but overall the polish is pretty solid for a small indie team of 2 people.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is easily worth its modest price, especially if there are a few more add-ons in the plans.","October 22, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

(Like Sim tower, but it's not like that).\n\nInterface/Menu/Settings\nThe main menu music is very good.\nIt has stats.\nIt has Fullscreen and window mode.\nIt has some Resolution sizes.\nYou are able to choose from some different languages.\nYou are able to slide the Music and Volume with % based. (10%, 20%, 30%, etc)\nYou are able to choose a character, However they do not have disadvantages or advantages. Just the color.\nYou are able to choose a difficulty.\nThere is Endless mode, Custom game mode and Arcade.\nYou are able to choose what theme you want. (Horror/Comedy/love/drama ETC).\n\nAbout the game.\nThere is a Tutorial in-game.\nThere is a variety of music, however it does keep looping over time. (unless you speed up in-game time or turn off).\nThe game could be very confusing at the start. But COULD be easy to understand rather quickly afterwards.\nYou are able to buy videos or sell them.\nHire workers or fire them. Same for Actors.\nYou must listen to the audience to win the game.\nIf you have chosen a theme, you get more points then other video theme's.\nYou can make ur own movies.\nYou can add ads or commericals.\nYou can win awards or events to win extra money.\n\nOther things.\nSadly there is only 1 Save file. You can't create more save files or multiple save accounts.\nThe game is addicting.\nThere is a captain america shield on the library floor.\nThere is an elevator going up and down to each floor, if a contestant or you take the elevator. Then the other one has to wait.  However the elevator is quick.\nIf in need of money. You can ask a loan at the Restaurant floor.\nYou are able to buy illegal videos, They usually have high rating but a high penalty too. Since you basically stole it.\n\n-------------------\n\nLet's Try Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_CK2715jYs\nLet's Play Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkSbQ6WHVhk\n\nI Give this game a 8/10","December 28, 2015","true","11.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There's enough nuance to make you start a new game again and again, but the game is also simple enough you could win your first playthrough on normal difficulty. I see a lot more challenge in the custom gameplay settings, giving the ability to ban certain audience groups and adjust other game parameters to make the game more challenge and interesting, or even a lot easier.\n\nMy one quibble is that there's no way to scroll to the parts of tower that are off screen without going to the elevator.

(I've had a masterpiece from a level 3 in drama but crap with level 8 in sci-fi. There is just no rhythm to it.)\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the audience demographic will completely change right in the middle of a "blockbuster" movie. One minute you're trying to get that last advertising block completed for the genre the movie was made/purchased for and the next you're struggling to find an advert to place in the slot. Why?  Because mid-movie, instead of "women" watching your major league romance production, it's a bunch of old men.  That's not how the demographic works.\n\nThis was a very poor design decision imho and given the whole game revolves around what is shown and when, so that you can get the advertising revenue you need to expand, you end up losing 10's of thousands of dollars because you can't complete an advertising block.\n\nIf it's cheap, it's a good bit of fun but if you're looking for a half decent, replayable sim, sorry, this is just not going to cut it.\n\n6.5/10","December 23, 2015","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Fame is won by streaming the right block at the right time, winning movie awards, sending reportages and completing quests.\nThis game is designed to have a lot of fun managing a TV station as a theme. IMHO they did a well job to priortize fun over realism. Especially the audience groups which are randomized are a great example of this. Instead of having same groups at the same time each day. They decided to mix things up because it leads to more dynamic gameplay. Also for balancing reasons they decided to let tha AI get some rubber band mechanic so that the game is always challenging.\n\nBut there is also a downside,  sometimes the audience is to mixed and only one blocker match the taste of the audience which is not so funny if a day has nearly no 2 blocks with same audience groups.\n\npros dynamic audience groups\ndesigend for fun not realism\nactive developers\nhommage to MAD TVcons sometime audience groups are extremly random","January 24","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your ai opponents aren't restricted to the same measurements that you are, where you can only do certain things once you've reached a certain level of fame, I noticed that the ai was more or less using my fame level to determine what they could obtain and do. Such as placing antennaes for expanding your audience, and the higher quality movie library.\n2. Get used to the option to speed up time. Without it, you'll feel like you're watching paint dry.\n\nThe first one is a big annoyance, the second one is more a warning to use the buttons to speed things up if it seems like it's mind numbingly slow.\n\nIf you're looking for pro's - here's a few.\n1. You can make your own tv series or movies. You do it by hiring a script writer. They make a script that has a certain quality, you can give it a title of your choosing, then you can hire two actors (lead and supporting), and then produce it where you assign production points to topics in order to try and influence the movie quality.\n2. You've a variety of staff you can hire. Max you can hire four staff members from what I noticed, although there are more than four 'jobs' - so choosing the four types that you hire is a strategy based on your play approach.\n3. It's intersting trying to find content that meets certain viewing groups desires, although some groups are defintely easier to please than others. Alone, you can quickly figure out what they like, but when you've 3 groups together, such as kids, elders, and rockers, and suddenly finding something they'll all tune in for gets a bit trickier.\n4. It's not rocket science. I'd say it's a step past casual and just short of complex in regards to figuring out what you need to do in order to be semi-successful.\n","May 27","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Women like Romance Movies, Kids like Fantasy and so on. Showing movies to the wrong audience results in lesser viewers and a bad reputation.\n\nIt is not realistic, that you have to plan your Movie Schedule based on the Viewers at a specific time. But nonethenless, it gives the game a nice twist. In the old MTV, you simply put the best movies you could get in your Schedule, and the viewers watch whatever you show. Now you have to think hard how you can satisfy Elders, Women and Kids at the same time. I like that.\n\nHere are some things, i dont like:\nBetty Botterblum is gone. Ok, i always ignored her until i had enough money to buy the gifts. But without her, something is missing. Also, the hoaxes you could play the other opponents are gone. No elevator signs you can change.\nNo Boss, no office.\nOverall,this wasnt so important, but it added some atmosphere.\nNo antennas. You upgrade directly to satellite. (Will be changed in future update)\nThe Animations are bad also, the original is far better.\nNo Live Footage, like superbowl. Ok, sometimes you can send a small live newsreport, but getting big sport events on my channel were always a highlight in MTV.\n\nGood:\nMovie Production and Rating for the competition. Having points that you can distribute around the movie production is cool. That make you really feel a little like a producer. Would be cool it this feature will be enhanced.\nAdvertising and employees.\nThe gameflow is good and you can custumize the game.\nQuests. But instead of rewarding with money which is unrealistic (why does my mother pay 400K that i show a movie??), you should have other advantages (or avoid disadvantages).\n\nI could write more, but i prefer to play it now ;-)\nSo, if you like Mad-TV, give Empire-TV a chance.","December 30, 2015","true","31.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In some aspects it is even much better than the original. The audience groups are a nice extension and the possibility to influence them with the news-block is an interesting feature.\nProducing your own shows is not an endless shopping tour as it was in Mad TV (where you needed to buy each actor for each episode of a series. However, it would have been nice if there were more different actors per movie and not just two.\n\nI also miss the map where you could buy stations to expand your audience. This has been reduced to simply upgrading your entire station to e.g. satellite. Also, the ads do not really change. There are a few per audience group and that's it. Only the numbers (viewers, money) change, but there are no new brands in the late game.\nThe amount of movies is pretty high though, and also the scripts for the movies you produce yourself are really funny to read.\n\nIf you liked Mad TV, you will also like Empire TV Tycoon. Even if Mad TV did a few things better, it's great to finally have a new and shiny game that is just as much fun.","January 6","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love that we finally have a game tycoon where we can finally manage a TV production company. Although I have only played 0.7 hours, it was enough for me.\n\nI figured the game out quickly and was able to be the number one channel. I think as the game updates, it will be more interesting. But this type of game is only good for about an hour or so. The channels and the people we see watching those channels are hilarious. I love that. And when the Mayor asks to do a cameo in one of your films. Pretty awesome. The side gigs (in the emails) are great. I love that I can make some extra cash and the depth in how much we should invest in making the film with the skill points. From Costume Design to Stagesets to Eroticism.\n\nThe economic system is pretty good. I spent on buying movies and TV ads and was able to get a hang of the system. Pretty easy learning the game and was impressed.\n\nI hate that the competition shares the same building as me. I get what the developers where doing, but I would get confused when I would use the elevators.\n\nI also love that feature where we get to create our own movies, hire actors and hire screenwriters and name the movies that is created. That was a huge plus for me. It would be awesome if a movie game was as awesome as this.\n\nThe awards are another plus. The award shows are awesome. It encouraged me to keep making my own shows/films and I would feel great when I won.\n\nOverall I would still recommend this game. I thought it was fun for about an hour, but that's it.

I've enjoyed Tycoon games ever since I were a kid. The concept itself is amazing. Running a TV company! I fell in love with it after playing Game Dev Tycoon. The problem is I fell in love with it over advertisement. I got a steam card for christmas and bought this! After 20 minutes of playing I realized this is not as good as other Tycoon games. I jumped in and the tutorial confused the crap out of me. After playing for about 20 minutes I immediately requested a refund from Steam. This game should NOT be getting good reviews!\n\nPros\n--------\n*Amazing Idea\n*Nice Variety\n\nCons\n--------\n*Difficult to learn\n*Tutorial sucks\n*Elevator takes forever to take you around\n*Can't make own company or CHARACTER!? (More on this below)\n*VERY.VERY.Tedious\n\nThis game is extremely tedious. I feel like time goes really fast. I truly wish there was a way to pause time in this game. I'm trying to plan a schedule and it's going by way too fast! Also why do you share a building with your rivals? It sucks, because they are constantly moving up and down stealing the elevator from you. Oh my god the elevator. This thing is slower than an elderly lady going backwards on escalator.\n\nI also think it's stupid how you can't make your own character or company! Why on Earth can you not do this? They give you 3 generic companies to take over. I wish you had 3 rival companies, so you can create your own. Games like Game Dev Tycoon give you the freedom to make your own character and company. It makes you feel like an individual. What's the point of giving us a choice? It's either generic company 1, generic company 2, or Walter White. I know it's not a big deal, but it will pisses me off how you can't create your own company or character.\n\nIf you're reading this, then try Game Dev Tycoon. It's not a TV studio, but it's a game making studio. It's extremely fun and addictive. Trust me. I would rather buy game dev tycoon a second time, than buy this game (Since I got a refund).\n\nTl;dr: Good Concept turned into a terrible tedious and confusing game.","January 3","false","0.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

(TL; DR at the bottom)\n\nYou schedule programs (during the same day people are to be watching them!) based on knowing what type of people (rockers, elders, et cetera) will watch it? Shoulden't it be that you schedule programs weeks in advance, and that you get viewers based on what you air?\n\nYour ads should reach a set percentage of viewers? Shouldn't it be a set amount of viewers? Upgrading your antenna, making you reach more viewers, just makes you have to show the ad to more people without getting a bigger reward. What is the advantage? (EDIT: Simply put,after having played this game for almostr 15 hours, I still don't understand the mechanics involved.)\n\nYou play in an environment with two other companies, sharing an elevator, but you can't play multiplayer? (This will be added in later, says a developer)\n\nThe formula for which audiece groups likes which shows is not random for each game, meaning it is possible to make a chart and use it to schedule the best shows for the given audience groups. Which means that 1. you learn this eventually and 2. replayability suffers greatly. (EDIT: you can change this in settings, apparently) It would be better if this info was given from the start, in-game, and your job was to try to air shows that will cater to as many audience groups as possible while getting your ads contracts done. Also, you could try to cater more to certain groups, and thus getting acces to special shows and events, while accepting that you have a smaller viewer base and thus get less money from ads.\n\nTL; DR--> this game is totally backwards.

The game itself has a great base but there is no new challenge when going through the different phases from small TV to mayor broadcaster. It is a rather repetitive game with few surprises.\n\n- Technology upgrades are there only to be there and don't add to the gameplay. They only help managing the game progress.\n- The walking in the building is kind of annoying and somehow doesn't add anything.\n- You have to have a pen & paper to properly play (This could be solved by adding indicators for already achieved stats. So for example once I made a Horror movie the numbers that finished A+ could be coloured green or simmilar)\n- The audience is sometimes a bit illogical in their preference (But that is subjective)\n\nSo generally I would love to see this game evovle in the second and third stage. Right now it basically only adds a 0 in the viewcount number and finances. 100.000 -> 1.000.000 -> 10.000.000. Something else should add to the game.\n\nSo yeah generally a good base that needs a lot to justify the price for me.

It just isn't what I was looking for. Look at a Let's Play on Youtube or just give it an honest hour or two try. It should help you know if it is for you- and if it is give it a thumbs up.\n\nI say this because just because it's not the game I thought it would be doesn't mean it is bad. It definitely deserves a fair chance with any tycoon fan out there.","October 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 15 of 38 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","15","38","0","0"

Now combine that game with some references to iconic movie/tv characters, sharing an elevator with your rivals, and finding yourself always waiting on said elevator.\n\nPros:\n\nIt's a tycoon game\nRunning a TV channel\n\nCons:\n\nBoring\nSharing an elevator with your rivals that you can count on waiting to reach your floor all the time\nThe game does eventually come to end so if you enjoy playing a game through all of time, no no no no no no no\nAlso I don't think you can pause the game to plan everything out, I know it pauses when you read an email but das it.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt's meh. If I had spent under a dollar on this game I wouldn't feel bad, but I spent 9. I'm going for a refund. I pay 9 dollars for what is no enjoyment? That sort of thing ain't my bag baby.

Here is my review:\n\nPro:\nUses names of real world films and shows.\nInteresting concept.\nMade me laugh when my competitors where showing Fifty shades of Grey to elders.\nVery indepth look at the workings and managing of a Tv channel.\nCool that you can see what is playing on your channel and the ability to switch between yours and your competitors.\n\nCons:\nI don't understand why your competitors share the same building as you.\nThere isn't enough information about the shows to allow optimal selection for your audience. (Well there may well have been but i can't see it.\nVery hard to learn if you are new, as the tutorial explains everything in 1 go.\nManaging channel ads, ads and shows all at the same time can very confusing and will annoy you.\nTime passes too slowly for a tycoon game of this scale. (Even when speed is on fast)\n\n\nHere is how my first 30 mins played out:\n\nFirst appeared in the building.\nRealised you control a character via mouse clicks. (Which in my opinion kills the pace of the game, moving with wasd or having the main character stationary and using the mouse to access the required areas would have worked better in my opinion.)\nCreated my tv guide, based on what i could deduce about the audience. (Worked only for 1 show)\nContinued tutorial, lack of pause feature meant that the next show started before i was certain i wanted to broadcast.\nTutorial attempted to explain hiring, movie making and advertising. Before i had grasped how to buy and sell shows.\nBought two adverts for my channel.\nAudience said "Wasted 2 hours of my life"\nQuit game\nCame to write this review.\nLeft recommendations about how to improve this game.\nPlayed for 5 more mins.\nContacted Steam to get refund\n\nLook i think this game has great potential, but i think it is too complicated for a first time user to use. And by the time you have gotten used to the game (and you may not be enjoying it), it would be too late to refund.\n\nMy point is, if you like tycoon games? Get this game while it is still cheap and give it an hour or so, if you don't enjoy it then you can get a refund or wait for a couple of updates to pass before trying again.\n\nI had to choose no, because i can't recommend a game that i don't understand, but that doesn't mean that someone else won't!\n\nI wish the developers luck for the future and i am sorry that this game wasn't for me.\n","October 20, 2015","false","0.4"," 12 of 43 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","12","43","0","0"

The software i used does this. Sorry. :(\n\nNow Listen, Before We Begin I Want Everyone Reading This To Know, That I Strongly Believe This Game Has STRONG Potential. I Will Be Listing The Pros And Cons Of This Game So I Can Give You A In Depth Look Into The Game Before You Buy It.\n\nPros:\n1. Good Concept\n\n2. The Game Uses Real Life TV Channel Names, Movies, And TV Shows Which In My Opinion Makes The Game Even Better.\n\n3. It Gives You A Good idea Of What Happens Behind The Scenes Of TV Channels. (Showing How Hard It Is To Run A TV Channel)\n\n4. Controls Are Excellent, Point And Click\n\nPlenty More, Except I Don't Have Time To List All Of Them.\n\nCons:\nMAIN PROBLEM: There Is No Sandbox Mode. There Is No Mode Where You Can Play For Fun And Retry If Your Studio Turns Out Bad, Like Other Tycoon Games Like Game Dev Tycoon. This Game Feels Like A Party Game Where You Have A Set Amount Of Time To Complete Something That Takes More Time Than You Have. If This Game Implemented A Gamemode Where You Could Play with No Deadline, This Game Would Be Fine, And I Would Come Back Here And Instantly Change This Review To A Positive One. - Dreamsite Games, For God Sake Add One, I Believe In You.\n\nAlso Im Going To Say This, I Do Not Believe You Should Refund This Game Either, I Think They Will Fix This Game And Make It A Fun And Enjoyable Experience.\n\n1. Confusing As All Hell When Your First Starting Off.\n(The Tutorial Helps Very Little, It Takes You Through In One Go, No Going Back.)\n\n2. Theres No One Telling You What To Do (Which Can Be Helpful) While Your Playing. You Have To\nFigure Out What To Do And Find Strategys On Your Own. (Which Some People May Enjoy, I Don't... Sadly)\n\n3. The Amount Of Time It Takes To Be Able To Show The Same Movie Or TV Show Again. I Found Myself In Situations Where I Had To Buy A Whole Bunch Of TV Shows And Movies And Not Being Able To Buy Any ADS Or Marketing To Go Along With Them Without Going Bankrupt. I Needed To Sell Loved TV Series/Movies Just To Help My Company Stay Alive.\n\n4. Kinda Goes Along With My Tutorials Problem, But I Feel Like There Is A Lack Of Information Telling You How To Do Something? I Found Myself Not Even Using The Tools I Was Given, Such As The TV At The Bottom Right, Useless In My Opinion.\n\n5. It Is VERY, And I Mean VERY Hard To Get Started And Run A Successful Studio. I Was Buying Ads That I Wasn't Able To Reach The Requirements For, Which Made Me Go Bankrupt. Like Who Am I Trying To Please? The Damn Nazi's?\n\nOnce Again, Im Sure Theres More, But Sadly Im lazy.\n\nFinal Views: This Game, I Was Actually Excited For. As Soon As I Got Home From Classes, I Got Straight On Steam And Bought This Game. Overall, After Playing For A Good 45 Minutes, I Got Bored, And Felt Sad That This Game Didn't Turn Out How I Thought It Would. I See A Bright Future For This Game, But Sadly Right Now, Not So Much.\n\nGoodluck Dreamsite Games.","October 20, 2015","false","0.8"," 5 of 34 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","5","34","0","2"
