The whole aim of the game is to kill people without being caught by security guards. Use five star weapons to have the most stars out of other players or bots and win your match. There are in fact game modes as well, only a very little though. There are really good guns. I mean if you like assault rifles or sniper rifles this game has it. How about syringes for people who want to be a deadly doctor/nurse? What about a katana for those who wanna be one of those samurai's or ninja's? How about the flamethrower or flare gun for those who want to be a pyro? Or rocket launchers and TNT's for those who wanna be destructive?

Do I recommend it? Well... sort of.\n\nFirst and foremost, what all potential buyers need to realize is the game never really finished development, may as well be considered 'dead' in terms of the online play (though there are a few groups that do planned game nights), and is far from perfect.\n\nThat said, it can be a very enjoyable game to mess around with now and then, as it does have bots for singleplayer experiences. Is it the ultimate in difficult or varied gameplay? Absolutely not. Is it stunningly beautiful with some kind of mind blowing story? Hardly (though I'm quite partial to the graphical style). But CAN YOU HAVE FUN IN A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE? YES.\n\nI think most folks that bought BGT initially were expecting a much more expanded experience from the developer's previous game: The Ship. However, the development was prematurely ended. They had *no chance* to make this a game that would meet expectations, so complaints about that should be summarily tossed out in my opinion.\n\nWhat the game DID end up providing was a framework that is fun to play, unique to experience, and a base of inspiration for future developers.\n\nSo here's the low-down:\n\nGraphics\nPretty good (I'm a huge fan of the style, personally, but I'm kind of weird :P). Nicely stylized and well-themed. Not AAA standard, but who cares about that nonsense.\n\nSound\nAnother "pretty good". Not a lot to say here, as it's a pretty straight forward game that doesn't have a whole lot of chances to show its chops.\n\nGameplay\nI REALLY like the gameplay, and while it could have definitely been expanded upon, the version available isn't all that shabby. There is a good amount of weapon variety, map layouts, environmental traps, game modes, etc. Certainly not infinite potential, but a fair amount (depending on price). The bots aren't exactly the smartest AI in the world, but if you intentionally prevent yourself from exploiting their shortcomings they can be quite fun.\n\nDifficulty\nThis is kind of a toss-up. It really depends on how you play and how much you exploit mechanics that will *never* be fixed. Basically: you can have as much fun as you allow yourself to have... if you get greedy and elitist, you'll find that fun-factor and difficulty plummeting quite quickly.\n\nMultiplayer\nAgain, the game is 'dead'.... but if you have friends at a LAN party or whatever, this can be an absolute blast to play. Just don't expect to find any random pick-up games outside of dedicated Steam Groups that hold organized game nights.\n\n\nOverall I'd say the game is fairly good if you're looking for something new and interesting to mess around with now and then. If you have friends that you can play with, the game can be freakin fantastic.. but bot play will work in the short term (though will definitely get tiring after awhile). But hey, depending on the price it may be worth it for something you can install and play a few hours every now and then (like I do).\n\nIs "The Ship" better? Yeah, most likely... but BGT is quite a bit different in theme and style, so it's hard to compare. If you want the ultimate in 'murder party' experiences, go with The Ship... if you want a more deathmatch-y, ridiculous setup go with BGT (or just go with both and have all your desires satisfied).\n\nThis review makes me wish Steam had a "sort of" recommendation option, because it really is kind of a 50/50 chance that you'll enjoy it.","April 25, 2014","true","7.3"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jnor/recommended/2450/","jnor","Silent Hunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jnor/","968 products in account","Bloody Good Time is a spiritual successor to The Ship. The best way to describe it is as a murder party FPS set at a movie shooting location. There are several game modes (Hunt, Elimination, Deathmatch...), but the goal is always the same in the end: kill the other actors. The player has a vast array of weapons (katana, revolver, exploding remote-controlled mouse, flamethrower...) and tools (gluegun, lullaby sheep...) to help him in this task. However, I think the game really shines when it is played against other human players rather than the AI and unluckily there is almost no one that still plays the game.\n\nThe game uses the Source engine, so it'll run on most computers. On the other hand, it isn't particularly good looking though the cartoon theme is well done and matches the game's athmosphere. As for the soundtrack, it is decent but forgetable.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game if you enjoyed the Ship and/or if you have friends to play it with. Its humor is greatly decreased when played against AI.\n\nIf you want to read a more thorough review, check out my blog post[gaming.jlcdk.com].","January 14, 2014","true","10.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoktorHaus/recommended/2450/","DoktorHaus","Doktor haus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoktorHaus/","232 products in account","TL;DR:\nThis is a simplified, faster-paced successor to The Ship. If you're not familiar with that, think of it as a cartoony, multiplayer Hitman game for 8 players/bots on small maps. It can be a Bloody Good Time, but unfortunately, it has just 3 maps and suffers from dumb bots, a lack of instructions and some cheap weaponry.\n\nFull review:\nBloody Good Time is a simplified, faster-paced successor to The Ship, which isn't surprising because it's from the same developer. The meat-and-potatoes of this game is called "the hunt", a gamemode requiring you to murder a different target each round, all while avoiding guards, cameras and your own hunter. To do this, you can pick from a large roster of weapons spawned throughout the map, each with a randomly-assigned star value which changes every round. This means you have to pick up new weapons often in order to stay on top of the scoreboard. Whoever has the most stars at the end of 12 rounds wins the game. In addition, you'll find "murder aids", which do just what their name implies; they can either be used to assist you in a murder or to defend yourself in a bad situation. There's a glue gun to freeze someone for a few seconds, a holographic decoy to mislead your hunter, even a camera to steal stars. You also have to take care of your "needs" - sleeping, pooping and eating, respectively - and if any of these gets too low, it lowers your speed, defense and strength. You're pretty much defenseless while taking care of these needs, but when fully refilled, they give you an added stat boost. There are also traps littered around each map and while difficult to pull off, the reward is high.\n\nYour target moves all around the map during the round, indicated on your HUD's mini-map by a red crosshair if they're off-screen or a flashing yellow area if they're in proximity. Each gives you an indication of the area they're in, rather than an exact position. This is another important thing the game fails to explain. Also indicated on the map are weapon spawns with different colors indicating star values, and when one of your needs is low, places to take care of them also pop up there.\n\nEvery few rounds of "the hunt", the director throws in a random mode to mix things up. "Scene stealer" grants you stars by holding an award and you're defenseless as the other players try to take it from you. "Hunt the leader" pits everyone against the 1st place player in an attempt to level the playing field again. "Infection" is like a game of tag where the infected must bump into a clean player to pass on the disease, then avoid the same happening to them. "Deathmatch" is a free-for-all - also a gamemode of its own - allowing you kill anyone for stars; just don't get caught by the guards or cameras. Besides "the hunt", you have the aforementioned "deathmatch" and "revenge" gamemodes. Revenge first assigns you a random target, but the more you kill, the more will be pursuing you.\n\nThe graphics are cartoonish and fitting and the characters, maps and weapons all adhere to that style, which works in BGT's favor. But not all is well in BGT. It took me two sessions to actually enjoy start enjoying it and it seems I'm not alone. It has a "how to play" section, but could have really benefitted from a tutorial level. Far too little is explained, resulting in confusion and frustration for new players. It does explain how certain weapons and murder aids are used when you first equip them, but fails to explain things like when it's ok to kill someone in self-defense, which is a massive oversight.\n\nThe bots are dumb; even when I played on hard difficulty the first time, not really trying to maximize my stars, I ended up beating them by a stretch. The main problem is they seem to pick up whatever weapons they stumble across, not caring about their value. Therefore, this game is best played with friends.\n\nBut despite that, getting killed by bots often feels unfair, thanks to a plethora of unfair weapons. The bat, frying pan, tazer and more freeze you in place once hit and though they take several hits to kill you, there's no window of opportunity between them for you to retaliate. Bots also activate traps with literally no one in their proximity, ruining your chances to actually make use of them because they need a moment to recharge.\n\nThe game also suffers from having too many controls and not explaining how useful they are. FYI, you only need shoot, use, draw/holster, switch hotslot, change weapon and change murder aid.\n\nI've had a lot of fun with Bloody Good Time, but a fair amount of frustration as well. The lack of maps is a big obstacle to its replayability, but that could have been added as well as some balancing changes. It's too bad Outerlight Ltd went under because both The Ship and BGT did some things very well, pulling off unique, yet flawed visions of multiplayer murder mayhem.","April 4, 2015","true","50.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I really love this game, this has a special place in my game collection and is a very big fan of this game. Biggest problem with this game is, this is an unfinished game.

Otherlight is faumos by making the game The Ship which is one my favourties too. I know what Outherlight wanted with this game. But they were not able to do it and the company is shut down. Now Ubisoft got to own Bloody good time and do not put any love in this game because they believe this game wont earn anything.\n\nI am pretty sure that if this game, got more love, time, make it less glitchy, levels and more challenges, they can earn alot.

Basically you play an actor that needs to kill the other actors in the movie so you can be the star.\n\nAlthough there are a few game modes, the core is The Hunt - you have one opponent to kill, while someone else is tasked with killing you. So essentially you have a FPS version of Chompy Chomp Chomp and you rush about collecting weapons and items to help you, heading to where your target is on the minimap (or you get regular notifications when they move to a new area of the map), while trying to avoid traps and other people who might be out to kill you themselves.\n\nThe learning curve is pretty steep - you really need to know the maps intimately, including what each area is called, and what the quickest routes to get there from where you are is (there are usually dozens of routes as there are ladders, stairs, doors, corridors - pretty much every room/area has 4 or 5 ways out, and many have 10 or more. You also need to know where the weapons and traps are and how to use some of the more esoteric weapons like the rat bomb (and when to use it), and how to best use the bonus items which can be game changing when properly applied. Plus you need to know where all the traps are, and critically where they can be triggered from so that you know when it is safe to pass through. And then you need to track which weapons are currently good to use, as well as knowing the ins and outs of the different game modes, which will be switched every few minutes.\n\nThe weapons are not really balanced, but this is kind of as designed - this is mitigated somewhat by the scoring system - the good weapons usually get enough use they rarely ascend to a being a high scoring weapon after the first round, but in practise getting an easy kill for average score beats a strategy of trying to successfully use every awkward weapon in a cycle as they get to 5*. Another issue is the Blood Money round, which basically scores way to highly, such that most of the rest of the game often becomes a tie breaker between the people that did well in that one round.\n\nOnce you have the hang of it, and have some friends who also do, things finally click and you will probably start having a Bloody Good Time, but I can see plenty of people deciding that getting to that point isn't worth the payoff, as even then this game is quirky, flawed and not particular well balanced.","October 30, 2014","true","4.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The rules are simple (kill or be killed), and the gameplay is easy to pick up on and fast-paced. There are several game modes with varying levels of difficulty, but I tend to play Deathmatch most often. Basically, you're an out of work movie actor/actress looking for a part in a new film by the hottest horror movie director in Hollywood. This director demands bloodshed with style; he will constantly critique your kills and advise you on your techniques. You can choose to kill any way you want, and whomever you want. However, if you don't pay attention to which murder weapons are considered "hot" at that time, you won't earn as many points per kill. Your true goal is to become the director's darling, after all.\n\nAs far as weapons go, the variety is as fun as playing in a more twisted version of Tom & Jerry: there's anything from katanas, axes, syringes, stun guns, flamethrowers, frying pans and more at your disposal. There's also a multitude of "murder aids" (like mines, lures or lullaby-inducing sheep) that can be helpful. The environments themselves can also be used to your advantage, with plenty of creative traps to use on your victims. Another fun mechanic is the fact that you have to pay attention to your current state of energy, hunger and...need to use the bathroom for lack of a better term. It will effect your speed and performance, so be sure to catch up on sleep, eat, or use the toilet when needed...just don't be surprised if someone catches you in a moment of weakness.\n\nFrom the characters to the settings, the game itself is a parody on the horror genre, and a throwback to all the ultra gory and cheesy b-movies I love. There's nothing deep to this game, nor should there be. It's a guilty pleasure kind of game, satisfying and simple.","March 29, 2014","true","32.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

You may ask, the level of stars you get when you kill other player with them, again, more stars, better for you.\nThere are also traps wich you can use to even get more points (let's call them points from now on), sadly a lot of the traps don't work nearly as well as some may expect, but it's a minor complain in such an enjoyable game.\n\nI must say that i was pleseantly surprised that i enjoyed my time with this game as much as i did, i wasn't expecting it to be a joy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpieced/recommended/2450/","unpieced","Qt Alix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpieced/","356 products in account","This is a spiritual successor to Outerlight's previous title, the Ship and because of that, I will be doing a comparative review. There are a slew of differences but some of the first things I noticed are how much the game is simplified compared to the Ship and of course how wacky and silly it is. The 8 stereotypical slasher victim characters are generic and cheesy for comic relief, the weapons are more diverse and creative, and the graphics are much more colorful and vibrant. In a nutshell, The Ship is much more serious and realistic, but it was preciously this fast-paced crazy chaotic play in Bloody Good Time that made it so enjoyable to me. I'll elaborate.\n\nBloody Good Time has 21 different weapons, while The Ship has a whooping 44. The weapons in TS are more typical items that focus on melee weapons like a hammer, knife, crowbar, ect. The weapons in BGT however are more unique like a flame thrower, a futuristic laser, a remote control exploding rat, and a powerful taser with one hell of a shock. However, a lot of the weapons in BGT need ammo, and they come with very limited ammo (four, in a lot of cases) causing weapons to quickly become useless. You now also have things called "Murder aids" which don't do any damage but have helpful affects. To give examples, there is a dart gun, glue gun, hologram decoy, pills to temporarily boost stats, and there is also what's called a "Lullaby Sheep" which causes everyone in the surrounding area to doze off. There are more traps in this game, and they are much more noticeable and useful, compared to the few discreet out of the way traps in TS.\n\nThe security in this game has fewer consequences and is less punishable. While you were immediately apprehended in TS upon sight, fined, and sent to jail with your entire inventory wiped out, in BGT you are now given the chance to run away from security guards. If you can get out of their line of sight for just ten seconds, they will give up their search. If you are caught, only the weapon equipped is confiscated. I felt like there was also less security in this game but there was one map, Las Vegas, where security seemed very unbalanced compared to the other maps. It later got very frustrating after repeatedly getting tasered and having one of my weapons confiscated while in the middle of trying to kill my quarry only to watch them get away. However, I feel that may have been intentional since it's set in a fancy ritzy place with rich casinos.\n\nWhile TS has 8 different needs, you now need to only worry about hunger, exhaustion, and using the bathroom. This may sound like a huge difference in gameplay, but it actually isn't. In TS the needs decrease far too slowly to get in the way much as long as you didn't allow them to pile up and have to treat them all at once. In BGT, the rate is much quicker (an average of 3 minutes or one round), but with only three needs to look after, this was easy and not a big deal.\n\nThere is no story mode this time around, and there are only four different modes (Hunt, Death Match, Elimination, and Revenge) compared to TS's 9. You are compensated however with different "scenes" within BGT that give a break from the usual gameplay and to keep things fresh. These can not be selected and will occur randomly after a match. It's a round of a new gameplay type with a different objective such as murdering the leader with the highest score. My favorite scenes were Infected where certain cast members who chase after you have an infection you need to avoid and Scene Stealer where you have to nab a golden statue. Everyone will be gunning for you and unable to attack while holding it, you have to run away and try to survive as long as possible with the statue in your hands.\n\nBeing rewarded with money (in TS) has now been replaced with Fame (the new point system), where each weapon is assigned a number of stars (up to 5 stars) that give you fame instead of each weapon being assigned a money figure upon kill. Since there's only 5 stars, there are more weapons in each category. This means you don't have to search high and low for a high-scoring weapon.\n\nThere's only 3 maps instead of TS's 12, and when it comes down to it, that's exactly why I got bored in the first place. I logged ten fun packed hours into this game, but I can't help but feel that I would still be playing if only there were more maps. They were also much smaller compared to the massive maps in TS with no secret passageways, false walls, or hidden secrets to discover.\n\nIf you're anticipating the multiplayer in this game, don't because it's extinct. The servers are completely dead, but as added knowledge, they would only house up to 8 players, compared to The Ship's ability to hold 32. I unfortunately never had the experience of playing in a BGT server but I will say that I was impressed with the AI. It's greatly improved from what it was in TS (which was poor). I ran into very few hiccups with it, and it did a pretty good job of emulating players.\n\nThere isn't nice tutorial to show you the ropes like in TS but instead just 15 pages to read through that doesn't even elaborate upon things it really should have. I found myself learning more useful tidbits from the pop up tips on the loading screen than from the instructions.\n\nI should also warn about a big glitch. Steam never registers that the game is shut down, and so it's impossible to play another game or even close Steam until the computer is reset.\n\nIt definitely shows that less work went into this than did The Ship, and that's easy to tell from a vast array of things. There's a handful of features missing that were once in the preceding game. In TS, you were able to customize your character's outfit instead of choosing from pre-made characters. There was a money system with banks and ATM's sprawled across the map in which the currency could be used to buy soda, pay for medical treatment, or to purchase wardrobes from boutiques and outfitters. There was an entire sick bay where you could visit doctors or physicists when injured or ill to heal. There were NPC's aside from security guards like restaurant and bar staff, sailors, engine crew, and innocent cruise passengers. When caught by security, you were sent to jail. BGT has none of this, and I miss it, but at the same time it allows you to jump right into the game with very minimal confusion. Going from over whelming complexity (in TS) to the simplicity (in BLT) was both comforting and lovable. Due to the lack of previous content and extra features, BGT is more laid back and quickly to adapt to. The biggest differences between this and TS is that this game is less complicated, easier, more wacky, and faster-paced. Everything is simplified, from your inventory to more importantly the HUD that used to be cluttered with tons of icons, indicators, and information (in TS) which I considered to be an eyesore and hard to keep up with. The screen in BGT is now more organized and clean, displaying only the necessary details, and the map is much easier to read.\n\nAnd for those of you who haven't yet played The Ship and are thinking about getting it, I actually suggest playing BGT first. Since The Ship is more complex and intricate, BGT is a really good starting game to first get you used to the gameplay and how things work. And being that it's only five dollars, it's a good way to see if you'll like this type of game. If it's something you enjoy, then you can upgrade to The Ship later on. To end my review, I do recommend Bloody Good Time. It's an amazingly fun game, and I've had a great time playing it.","January 25, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So after a quick download (as it is a rather small file) I was thrown into a pixar-esq world high on the promise of comedic violence...\n\nDoes it deliver?...\nkinda...sorta... not really\n\nThere isnt really a dedicated tutorial, you are left to piece together a basic control scheme through a quick "loading screen button mapping" picture and through occasional tool tip pop ups\n\nBut even when you get past the awkward controls you find that most of the budget for the game was put into the weapons (that dont come with instructions). There is a good assortment of weaponry ranging from the several generic melee weapons, all the way to the esoteric "sleep sheep" (that you will have no idea how to use, or even what it is)\n\nThere are 3 maps total, and they feel too big... and at the same time too small.\nThey feel far to big to only have 8 people max playing at any one time, and you will find yourself lost pretty easily.\nBut they feel so small because you keep backtracking to the same spots over and over again to spam a deathtrap or to pick up a weapon that doesnt require you to be right next to your victim\n\nThe characters are full of life and their own personal charm, with nobody feeling like a reskin or palate swap of another. Thats  a two edged sword as it makes it INCREDIBLY easy to find your prey... but also makes evasion boil down to "bring bigger weapon against your attacker" or "run in hopes of losing them"\n\n\nSo between an awkwardly specific cast, confusing weapons and set designs, as well as a totally dead online, I cant in good faith reccomend this game\n\n````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````\nTL:DR Version\n\nDid you like The Ship?\n\nIf yes, you will probly hate this game, because it is only like its older brother in premise alone.

Bloody stupid game is more like it. Funny thing is that even my anti-virus software didn't even like this game. The themes of this game are set-ups and don't get caught on the crapper. What? Really? Yea, really. The boobie traps in this game are pretty much boobies in themselves and this game tries to act like a Sims crossed with a First Person Shoot with stragity blended in. What you get here is a miss that's a mess to play. This is one game I won't re-install through Steam. Steam should do everyone else a favor and pretend that they never got this game. Even if this game was a free-be, don't bother. This game should be downloaded as a top ten game example of how not to make a game.

Finally transitioned to PC and it's still just as good, way forward ahead now in 2014! This game is fun. It's interesting. It's fresh. Essentially it has a murder-mystery-esqe "Clue" feel to it, with it's sneaking around and killing only certain people (in the main gamemode, DM and other gamemodes are also available). The exuberant art design is almost similar to the newest Bioshock (Infinite), but a little more zing to it. It also has over-the-top, British style comedy - i.e. being a pothead stoner, being able to eat food, sleep and take sh*7$ in the game, and even fart on the corpses of people you backstab. With various awesome weapons, from frying pans, sleeping darts, katanas, to .50 cal sniper rifles - the tools are available to you to hunt your prey. This cartoony murder-spree simulator will leave you wanting to come back, even if you play with just bots. 10/10 buy this now.","November 24, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each weapon has a star value that changes though the match and it is the most stars earned rather than most kills. Also some modes have give you one target and you only get stars for killing that target. There are traps and you need to eat sleep and pee, which leaves you vulnerable. Once you get used to it does provide a different and enjoyable gameplay experience. There are only three levels which is a shame but since knowing your way round the weapons and traps is they key to winning this means there is less to learn.","January 18, 2012","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The addition to adding the guards is an interesting feature you could lose the ponts you got from the kill if a guard sees you and tases you, but you can alway go put on a diquise, or hide out of their site for enough time to where your clear...  Even with the lack of maps the gameplay is pretty fun and differnt game modes are cool as well.

In this game you're an actor who is cast in 1 out of 3 movies by a director who, in 1998, was charged with killing his actors. The case was dropped because there was no evidence. Present day he goes by Director X and is making 3 movies, as previously mentioned. You can play as 8 different characters, including a Goth, Clown, and Surfer. The story is original, as well as the game. A factor in this game is the meters. There is one for eating, sleeping, and pooping. Yes, pooping. The only complaints I have are there are no servers, and not a lot of maps, which is okay for a $5 game. What would I rate this game? 8/10.

The addition to adding the guards is an interesting feature you could lose the ponts you got from the kill if a guard sees you and tases you, but you can alway go put on a diquise, or hide out of their site for enough time to where your clear...  Even with the lack of maps the gameplay is pretty fun and differnt game modes are cool as well.

The premise of the game is like a sims game and a free for all game. The sims aspect stems from the fact that you must constantly watch your hunger, sleep and "peepee" bar. When even one of these fall short you begin to weaken i.e you dont hit as hard or you are slower. And it's a free for all with 8 different archetype horror movie characters such as the stoner the jock the clown but the characters themselves are just models that do not impact the game in any other way. It is a great game that I recommend, but there are some negatives I wish to point out. The online is kind of dead but there still is a single player mode that is quite fun. My main problem with this game is that there are only three maps with 0% chance to ever have a new one, but that is not to say that they are not fun.\nFInal rating 8.5/10","November 1, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He is notorious for going overboard to get the results he wants. You plus 7 other hopeful actors are in the running to get the role of a life-time, if you have what it takes to take on/out the competition. This is the abridged version of what is written on the store page for the game.\nOne of the game's listed key features is , "Be a deceitful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Flush your enemies in the toilet, crash their heads on their plates when they eat, do whatever it takes to maim and kill other competitors in nasty and unexpected ways! "\n\nAfter reading all of this plus watching the trailer, I'm stoked. I assume I'm going to be getting a game that's somewhere between The Haunting: Starring Polterguy and Tecmo's Deception. The player must decide the most inventive, zany, creative ways to kill off the competition. You're given the option to use environmental executitions OR just go at them with whatever weapon you find lying around.\n\nWhat the game actually is:\n\nThe humor and story of the trailer is no where to be found in the beginning "cut-scene" as you are treated to a 30 second text and still-image intro. No dialouge yet. It tells a vague story of a director who made movies so graphic that they HAD to be real. Do you want to be a star? This is where I started to get concerned.\n\nI'm taken to the main menu, trying to figure out my options as an annoying as F**K voice over spouts taglines on repeat. Think Spider-Man based on the 2000 film "Did I hurt your tusky wusky", except more frequently.\nAfter messing around with the various game modes in Arcade mode I realize that the game is nothing more than a "theme shooter". There is no story mode, no plot or linear gameplay. It's either join a fps server or play fps with bots. The entire "plot" is just to flavor the character choices, weapons and stages. It's completely superficial.\n\nThe "deceitful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥" feature you might be wondering about refers to different traps that populate the level. You literally camp by a button, wait for someone to walk over the "white X" on the floor and then activate the trap. That's it.\nThe graphics have a nice style to them and the levels are well designed. However, the music is annoying, the sound effects are obnoxious and every once in a while the "director" shouts a stupid catch phrase.\n\nI'm sad I'm out $3.24 but I'm thankful I didn't spend any more than that on this empty shell of a game.","June 3, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finally transitioned to PC and it's still just as good, way forward ahead now in 2014! This game is fun. It's interesting. It's fresh. Essentially it has a murder-mystery-esqe "Clue" feel to it, with it's sneaking around and killing only certain people (in the main gamemode, DM and other gamemodes are also available). The exuberant art design is almost similar to the newest Bioshock (Infinite), but a little more zing to it. It also has over-the-top, British style comedy - i.e. being a pothead stoner, being able to eat food, sleep and take sh*7$ in the game, and even fart on the corpses of people you backstab. With various awesome weapons, from frying pans, sleeping darts, katanas, to .50 cal sniper rifles - the tools are available to you to hunt your prey. This cartoony murder-spree simulator will leave you wanting to come back, even if you play with just bots. 10/10 buy this now.","November 24, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In my opinion it is a fantastic little game that offers a nice variation of weapons to use in order to kill your enemies. However I did think it offered only a limited amount of content, such as there are only 3 maps and 4 gamemodes available to play (Not counting the short version of the hunt). I love the star rated weapon system where every round you earn more or less stars by using a weapon with a higher or lower star rating to kill your enemy, these ratings change every round based on how many kills were made during the previous round with that particular weapon.\nWould definitley recommened this game as it can keep you occupied for hours on end.

In my opinion it is a fantastic little game that offers a nice variation of weapons to use in order to kill your enemies. However I did think it offered only a limited amount of content, such as there are only 3 maps and 4 gamemodes available to play (Not counting the short version of the hunt). I love the star rated weapon system where every round you earn more or less stars by using a weapon with a higher or lower star rating to kill your enemy, these ratings change every round based on how many kills were made during the previous round with that particular weapon.\nWould definitley recommened this game as it can keep you occupied for hours on end.

He is notorious for going overboard to get the results he wants. You plus 7 other hopeful actors are in the running to get the role of a life-time, if you have what it takes to take on/out the competition. This is the abridged version of what is written on the store page for the game.\nOne of the game's listed key features is , "Be a deceitful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Flush your enemies in the toilet, crash their heads on their plates when they eat, do whatever it takes to maim and kill other competitors in nasty and unexpected ways! "\n\nAfter reading all of this plus watching the trailer, I'm stoked. I assume I'm going to be getting a game that's somewhere between The Haunting: Starring Polterguy and Tecmo's Deception. The player must decide the most inventive, zany, creative ways to kill off the competition. You're given the option to use environmental executitions OR just go at them with whatever weapon you find lying around.\n\nWhat the game actually is:\n\nThe humor and story of the trailer is no where to be found in the beginning "cut-scene" as you are treated to a 30 second text and still-image intro. No dialouge yet. It tells a vague story of a director who made movies so graphic that they HAD to be real. Do you want to be a star? This is where I started to get concerned.\n\nI'm taken to the main menu, trying to figure out my options as an annoying as F**K voice over spouts taglines on repeat. Think Spider-Man based on the 2000 film "Did I hurt your tusky wusky", except more frequently.\nAfter messing around with the various game modes in Arcade mode I realize that the game is nothing more than a "theme shooter". There is no story mode, no plot or linear gameplay. It's either join a fps server or play fps with bots. The entire "plot" is just to flavor the character choices, weapons and stages. It's completely superficial.\n\nThe "deceitful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥" feature you might be wondering about refers to different traps that populate the level. You literally camp by a button, wait for someone to walk over the "white X" on the floor and then activate the trap. That's it.\nThe graphics have a nice style to them and the levels are well designed. However, the music is annoying, the sound effects are obnoxious and every once in a while the "director" shouts a stupid catch phrase.\n\nI'm sad I'm out $3.24 but I'm thankful I didn't spend any more than that on this empty shell of a game.","June 3, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
