The graphics are very beautiful and seems inspired by games such as MapleStory. Gameplay consists of managing a roster of heroes during battles and swapping them out of tactical necessity when needed, as you can only have 4 on the battlefield simultaneously.\n\nThe heroes attack automatically, and you are in control of item/spell use and switching out heroes when needed. In between battles you spend the gold and stars you earned from killing monsters on buying healing items, technology/spells, and upgrades for your heroes. Unfortunately, there are no skill trees for heroes which was something I would have liked to see and thus upgrades are completely linear.\n\nStory-wise, the game was a bit on the weak side (you apparently have to read the plot from the menu?). Additionally, some heroes seemed more useful than others (the “thief” class hero doesn’t do much damage and only helps steal an inconsequential amount of gold per attack). However, I did enjoy the art style in this game and the animations were very smooth. Some levels were very challenging, including the first bossfight. I also enjoyed the soundtrack of this game. Overall, I did enjoy the game for the few hours I’ve played it and would recommend picking it up on a sale or when more content/updates get added.\n\nDisclaimer: Key was provided by developer for a review. This did not influence my review in any way.","February 21","true","4.5"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","15","20","2","0"

This is far from the truth. The game is actually a clicking game in the clicking genre. If you have played any clickers such as: clicker heroes, sakura clicker, etc, you will notice the resemblence. It was a nice marketing tool to get me to buy the game because it said JRPG, but I will be asking for a refund.\n\nPositive:+ New spin on a clicking game and innovative in the genre\n+ A lot of different characters\n\nNegatives:- Story is very bland, there's not much story anyways, it's just black screen with text on it; think star wars\n- Gameplay gets old after 20 minutes\n- PRICE. This would make a good mobile game for $0.99, but $8.99 is wayyyyyy too much. I would maybe pay $1.99 because of the trading cards.\n- The only non clicking screen is the screen that looks like a mobile phone. This is where you can by items, look at team, etc. 90% of the game is spent on watching characters attack mobs without much interaction besides changing characters out\n- Sound is terrible, the first boss especially\n- Character customization is limited to just leveling them up, no weapons, armor, etc\n- Artwork is very mobile style gamed as well, it's ok at first but as you progress in the game it gets very repetitive and bland. The characters you get are bland as well.\n\nPretty Poor Game: 3/10\n\nOverall, this is game is a 3/10 and a one word description for it would be: BLAND. It would make a good mobile game and is definitely not worth $8.99. I'd probably buy it on sale for $0.99 for the trading cards, but I doubt it ever gets that cheap.","February 18","false","2.7"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","22","36","2","10"

Don't go into this thinking it is a JRPG like Secret Of Mana, Final Fantasy, or classics from the Playstation era, it isn't like that. Think more Advance Guardian Heroes, but remove the dialogue and talking, and make the battles completely automated so all you do is switch characters around to keep the team alive. It is fun, but only if you know what you are expecting. This is more of a real time Strategy game than a JRPG. If you know what to expect, than go ahead and get the game. I would recommend buying it during a Steam Sale if you decide to buy it.","February 25","true","9.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The visuals seem odd. The menus look like a mobile game port. Yes it is indeed 4:3.\nIf you past all of this you will find a neat game worth playing to forget all the little things in life. Such great examples being; Pain, misery, doubt, and most importantly why does the game look like a mobile game. Look past such things and you find a nice treat in a sea of endless dissapointment.\n\nPros:\n>Gameplay is pretty neat\n>Cute visuals reminicient of Maplestory without the cringeworthy xXNaruto_SauskeXx names everywhere\n>It runs\n\nHit and miss:\n>Sound\n>HUD and menus are without a doubt cheap looking meant for giant fingers to press except this is a PC game\n\nCons:\n>4:3\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, 10 bucks can be spent on games that look promising and end up being bug ridden garbage. Take a dive once in a while and you'll find yourself swimming in a jello pool(It's pretty sweet).","February 18","true","11.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

The combat system is rather fun, but it can get hard and very unfair at times, but with a bit of luck and the right strategy, you'll find you can get past most battles. I still haven't beaten it yet, but I'm determined to do so, as it's a lot of fun.","February 29","true","15.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Boss fight is not easy and sometimes can be pretty challenging; therefore, you may have to grind and level up your characters before continuing further through the game. There are tons of character to recruit, and so many ways to form your favorite team party. Just try it, if you have played Final Fantasy 13 and could get along well with it's battle system, you may find this game attractive.","March 2","true","1.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The menus and animations are all smooth and organized.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is fun and requires some strategy. It uses a turn based system with you managing switching players in and out. It's a little diffirent from a traditional JRPG, but it is challenging and fun.\n\nMusic:\n\nThe music is really good, it has a fast paced feel that really gets you into the game and ties it all together. It's soundtrack worthy in my opinion.\n\nOverall:\n\nWanderjahr is a fun turn based JRPG that I would recommend to fans of the genre.\n","March 24","true","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
