It's partially procedurally generated, you can collect some (not superbly interesting) loot, do "kill all orcs" and "clear the dungeon" types of quests, level up some basic stats, push some levers in dungeons, and teleport back to the base village to sell or stash your stuff. The price for it is right, it isn't badly made, I don't hate the graphics and I actually enjoyed the music and sound design. But there is little really interesting or novel here, and the gameplays is frankly eh... dull.\n\nSo yuh, I don't feel like these devs did enough wrong to deserve a downvote. But in a world where you can regularly pick up Torchlight and even Torchlight II for the same price tag, I just don't see why you'd choose this game instead.","December 17, 2014","true","4.5"," 55 of 67 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","55","67","4","1"

It has really inconsistent balance (scenarios 1 and 2 are really easy, and then scenario 3 killed me a whole lot, for instance) and a bunch of mind-bogglingly bad design decisions, too, like the Halls of Challenge not giving any XP at all.\n\nIn the end this is a game I can't really recommend to anyone! Go play a good loot-driven RPG (see: Titan Quest, Torchlight 2, Diablo 3, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing), a good turn-based RPG (Avadon or Avernum), or a good roguelike (ADOM, Tales of Maj'Eyal) depending on what made you look at this game.\n\n(EDIT: Version 1.7 added the ability to get XP in the Anti Babatula area of the Halls of Challenge, and quite a lot of it. This makes hitting level 35 much more reasonably possible by running through the Anti Goblin Cave a few times, if you're really determined to do that.\n\nIt still doesn't fix most of my problems with the game, but it was worth pointing out.)","June 13, 2014","false","16.9"," 70 of 97 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","70","97","0","2"

Don't put very high hope for this game.\n\nOn Steam review I can only choose Yes to recommend and No to not Recommend. But sometime like this game i would love to have an option "Neither".\n\nThis is not a terrible game but it's just too simple. It's simpler than the old Windows 3.2 Game Castle in the Winds. Which i played over 20 years ago.\n\nThe graphic is decent for indie, The Combat is very simple and there are not much choice for spells and ability.\n\nBasic you build up your character and use ability to cover the short coming in order to get though tough fights.\n\nYou had to save and exit many times to level up and get items to win the tough fights.\n\nI have just played 1 game of hardcore to get achievements and 22 hours later, right after I get the last achievement that require me to play hardcore I died on the last floor of Brutal challenge room.\n\nThis means i have to start over. But since i already achieved over 60% achievements and all the rest ones are just more grinding of exact same content over i don't think i will play this game for a second time.\n\nOver all I would rate this piece 5/10.

It reminds me alot of diablo (I think the background music in the town of Babatula is intentionally similar to the in-town music in diablo), but is a deeper game with its own unique style and character. There is a lot of loot and great variety of ways to build your character, Rick. I like the 2d, almost cartoonish character graphics and the art in general. This is some of the best turn-based hack and slash you can get for 5 bucks.\n\nI also bought this game on Xbox Live in 2012- btw, shame on xbox for their shoddy support for indie games - I owned my xbox 360 for 5 years before I even realized there were indie games available.

It is a combat-based action RPG in the style of an older Diablo game with a focus on straightforwardness, simplicity, and an absurd, lovable, and cartoonish style. The main character, Rick, is a melee fighter that you can augment by choosing different stats and items to wear.\n\nLike Diablo, the fun of the game is in beating things up and finding items.  Rick accomplishes both of these by slamming his knife into enemies until they die in Rogue-like fashion. The strategy comes how you plan ahead by choosing what to wear, what to carry, where to stand, etc. rather than the actual combat, which is mostly just your stats comparing with the monsters and deciding how to use your consumable items. You also have a special meter that can be used to give yourself a boost for a short time. It's easy to understand and enjoyable.\n\nOnce you finish the game, you can try again with a different character and a stat focus. There are 9 or 10 special abilities you can pick as you level, some of which are passive. You can have up to 4, but some of them won't be relevant for the way you're playing. For example, I wouldn't choose a power like Flash (which uses your special meter to teleport you) on a character focused on Strength and Speed because I would never have enough Willpower to use it consistently. Or similiarly, I wouldn't choose Eagle Eye (which raises your attack rating and critical hit rate) on a character with a high Dexterity because I would already be hitting everything accurately and it would be redundant. You can choose a special ability to focus on one path, use in an emergency, or to balance out a weakness. There are enough different combinations and achievements to play through the game several times if you want.\n\nIf the store page appeals to you and you're looking for a light, enjoyable game, I recommend this. It's exactly what it looks like and it has enough depth for me to enjoy 90+ hours.","November 25, 2014","true","94.7"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","24","33","0","0"

The gameplay is more simplistic than Diablo, however, with precious little in the way of special attacks and skills. Loot doesn't appear as randomised as it could be - there seem to be a lot of dupe weapons and armour. And my biggest grievance is the movement system - you can only move up, down, left and right, not diagonally. At first it's not an issue, but becomes a big pain when you're trying to kill a bunch of those #*&%@ ranged attackers. And I haven't come across any ranged weapons myself, which would have greatly appreciated. Battlepaths is still fun and rates a purchase, especially when it's on sale or as part of a bundle - just know what you're getting. NB. it's probably not massively replayable either.\n\nPROS:\n- fun, simple and addictive slashing and looting\n- nice and clean art style and some good music\n- loot is always great in any game\n\nCONS\n- loot system could afford to be deeper/more randomised\n- very simplistic combat system may put off some\n- control annoyances - can't move diagonally\n- no ranged combat?","October 10, 2014","true","9.3"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","0"

Also, each time you attack, a Special bar will refill of a tiny bit of it length; when the bar is full you will be able to use a special attack.\n\nThese are the main features of this game, there is no more depth than this, and what will keep you playing for hours, will be decided by how much you like this simplistic gameplay. Other than this, it's the classic Dungeon Crawler, comprehensive of the usual Hardcore mode (where if you die the character you made is gone for good, and you have to start over), its need for a better gear, +%Magic Find builds or +%Special Ability builds or +%Physical Damage builds... Clean the dungeon, slay the boss, get the drops and repeat!\n\nFor a better and more detailed overview of Battlepaths' gameplay, I recommend you taking a look to this guide, written by a developer, will help you to know anything you may wish to know about Battlepaths' characteristics.\nWhile it may look like I'm linking this guide out of laziness, I find it an easier way to inform you only about what you want to know, keeping the review short for a fast reading while enclosing anything you may want to know about the game.\nYou can find the aforementioned guide here:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=265362424\n\nThe game plays quite well, being balanced enough to let you reach the end of it without much struggle, given that you'll be carrying few dozens of good health potions with you along the way.\n\nHowever, I did find the game excessively grindy, especially when it comes to get more gold to buy more potions to explore the harder levels, and even more grindy when it comes to reach the top level or the maximum skill level for the weapon you're using. It literally takes dozens of hours of grinding, and I found this obnoxious, therefore why I'm not going to recommend this game.\n\nRegardless of its bland graphic and the mediocre sound department, this game doesn't stand out among the dozens of dungeon crawlers out there.

In fact, it's the only Jon Arbuckle game where you whack and smack, it would make Garfield puke its guts out.\n\nThe game as a rogue-lite sometimes adoringly looks similar to the pen and paper version of Dungeons and Dragons, where you meet your friends, play with basic card cutouts of heroes and villains and battle maps, and in general have a grand ol' time. Other times though, Battlepaths' simplicity of combat and looting serves to a fault filled with frustration and eyes rolling.\n\nGraphics are simple and funnily-cartoonish 2D fare that looks okay and functional overall, with enough color and variety, Animation however, is almost non-existent. You move like a cardboard cutout (meaning you don't move at all, you just spawn to the next spot) and only move a hand up and down in the air, which represents either an attempt to fight or a fist-shaking at the game creators for giving everyone no animations whatsoever,\n\nAs for the story, there is none: You play as Jon Arbuckle which for some reason in this game calls himself Rick, a would-be adventurer. You make a character, choose a level of difficulty, you start with the first zone, pick up the most generic quests possible, whack stuff that moves, you level up, and finally as you grow stronger, you unlock new area with more dangerous stuff that needs to be whacked some more.\n\nThere is music and sound... which are completely unobtrusive and forgettable, that you'll soon turn a podcast and do some multitasking.\n\nThe battle system, which is a bread and butter for all rogue-lite games, in Battlepaths is very simple where you have only one attack until you unlock up to four, very simplistic special combat moves and effects, either passive or active. Which is fine and even kind of a relaxing, until the game decides to put some effort to it, and introduce enemies with gazillion hit points, or ranged units that have a chance to hit you three or four times in a row per your move. Yes you read it right, you move one block at a time, while enemy ranged units stand from several blocks away, happily filling you with arrows and ice/fireballs while you can do squat. Meaning, in later part, the game uses cheap and annoying tricks to increase the difficulty.\n\nYou can call upon beasts from the bottle to fight at you side, which is a cool idea, except they are weak and have next to zero intelligence. They are fine if you spawn them right next to your enemy, as they attack them, but if an enemy is a couple of blocks away, chances are your summoned beast is only going to give them a threatening glance as they refuse to move or attack.\n\nLooting system is a bit more complex, with enough variety to satisfy that inner crave to bogart everything. You can also upgrade loot with augmentation stones which give random benefits, as well as cancel upgrades or re-arange upgrades with appropriate magic stones.\n\nOverall, Battlepaths is a solid, if uninspired game that is going to offer you 5-10 hours of average fun. And for a price it's asking, you could do far worse.","June 3","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's all about upgrading and leveling up in order to progress and complete the game. This game has great controller support, decent top view graphics and a nice upgrade system. There are 3 Realms to fight through with different enemies in each, and a Hall of Challenges Mode. I'll give this game a good 7 out of 10, for the fact it plays well, has a lot of items, and a good difficulty level.\n\nIt does get repetitive however trying to complete the Achievements. The Realms only take about 10 hours to complete, and another 20 for the other Achievements, and then much longer if you get into the Hardcore Achievements. Still recommend this for anyone with a gamepad, looking for Achievements & Cards and just something new for their Library.","June 4","true","35.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Was expecting an ARPG or something like it. First off, you run around in blocked movement patterns set to the arrow keys first (yes in this day and age). Apparently the game was not made for computers, as it doesn't work at all. You don't use your mouse for basically anything. Movement, picking up, etc. For combat you stand next to someone and you each get a turn attacking in real time. You have to keep pressing the movement button that corresponds to where they are at for each attack. You miss a lot and it takes a while to kill someone. So yes this means hammering the movement button, which is annoying. The combat seems boring and not very intuitive. Then there is the items. Things drop but you can't pick them up by clicking or anything else. You have to first press your show items button to see what it is and if there is something for you to pick up, and then you still can't click on it. You have to get in the perfect position until the item is highlighted and then you have to press the use/interact key and it picks it up. Yes you have to do that for EVERY item, another poorly done thing.\n\nThen there are quests. you don't have a button that brings up quests. You have to press the inventory button and then press tab multiple times to go to quests, which you must do each time you want to see quests, yes as dumb as it sounds. Then there is the map. It is super broad and unhelpful, not specific to your territory. It also doesn't tell you where your quest destinations are or what is around. Many items you can't interact with. I walked into a cave and started getting auto hit from across the area by a bat somehow, as I couldn't dodge and there was nothing I could see coming at me or I could do. Then there is equipping items. I equipped a club and a knife still showed up on my character as what he was holding (how can you not even get this right?). I equipped a bandana and it didn't show up. Lets see a wonky poorly done real time turn based rpg that doesn't work for computer input, with poor weapon interaction and nothing shows up on you, with poorly described/indicated quests.......couldn't they get SOMETHING right? Oh and the spells are super boring and generic, basically buffs. You can't even allocate starting ability points, just choose from preset ones. No classes. Game starts windowed and you have to wait and be playing the game before you can change it from the pause menu. There are no graphical or resolution settings. Really seems like a high school programming class project titled "my first game". 4/10.","June 29, 2015","false","20.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

Save your few dollars for some fast food.\n\nI traded for this game and was initially interested in the concept of the game, however, I came out with a very unsatisfying experience. I tried hard to give this game a chance, I really did, but there are just an endless amount of better alternatives out there. I've written a lot of reviews, and one thing I always try to focus on - especially after following YouTuber Totalbiscuit's videos for a while - is whether or not a game is worth your time and investment. Unfortunately, I sincerely believe that this game is not worth your time and resources. Play Diablo 1 or even some free flash games on gaming websites like Kongregate or Newgrounds. I will add that I most likely have a heavy bias in critiquing this game, as the game I have played the longest in my entire life was Diablo 2. I also have invested a considerable amount of time in Path of Exile. The action-RPG genre is one of my most favorite, and I have played many turn-based ones on websites like Kongregate, almost all of which have been more fleshed-out and polished than this.\n\nIf you like casual gameplay, 2D turn-based combat, and light RPG elements, then you may end up liking this game. I would still advise you to consider other alternatives.\n\nThe aesthetics are average - the detail and variety in the backgrounds and character models is decent. I understand this is an indie game, however, one thing that bothered me (I am a big aesthetics ♥♥♥♥♥) is how none of the equipment you use appears on your character. Instead, you will periodically upgrade how your character looks as you progress through the game (until you get the golden armor and sword). I have played basic flash games that have this aesthetic feature, so I think something that costs this much should at least have a few aesthetic features available.The sounds and music are nothing fancy, I muted everything within an hour of playing and used my own music. The story and quests are very bland and follow Diablo's basic formula of "go here and kill x." The variety of loot is very large, however, it again feels insignificant to me because of the lack of visual feedback.\n\nThe controls are very simple and the learning curve is minimal. There is enough feedback given to make sure you do not get lost during your playthrough, and the levelling up system is very, very basic. When you die, you can respawn at the cost of a small percentage of your gold and experience. There are a number of realms you can travel to, each unlocked as you progress through the story.\n\nDuring gameplay, you move around in a grid-based world. When you encounter enemies, each time you move/do an action, all enemies will respond accordingly - completing one "turn." If you open your inventory and drink a health potion, for example, you will use up your turn, allowing enemies to move around. To attack, you just have to move your character in the direction of an enemy to attempt to hit them. Combat is very bland with basic combat animations and sound assets. Depending on the weapon you use, you will also gain weapon mastery experience, and each level grants you bonuses to damage and attack rating (chance to hit). You can not use magic in this game.\n\nOverall, the game offers a very mediocre experience, and I implore anyone interested in this kind of game to research alternatives, since there are a lot of better ones available (many of which are free). At the time of writing this review, the game is on a week long deal for $2.19 CAD, and I still think that is too much to spend on Battlepaths.\n\nDo not recommend.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","January 21, 2015","false","5.4"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

Nothing really stands out or creates atmosphere but nothing ever screams 'terrible' either. It is as bland as a game console menu screen.\n\nThe graphics are poor but again they do the job. A Spider looks like a spider, things in general look like what they are even if they are simple in looks and art direction.\n\nThe gameplay? Well it's like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon or Digimon World 2 (US/Japan only). Basically when you move, everything moves with you so its a psudo real time feel while secretly being a turn based game.\n\nIf the game sounds average and bland well, that is because it is as it really offers little to make itself stand out while remaining competent enough to not become the next Bad Rats. My fun with the game was small and fleeting because like Hyglide (NES) the amount of xp to next level grows stupendiously high and you really start to reel from the tedium if you were putting points in something that won't pay off till later, for example the speed stat.\n\nSlapping all my points into strength seemed to payoff really well early in the game and I recommend you take that route on your first playthrough as well because you will rapidly find yourself being swarmed early in the game and while this doesn't make the game harder (oddly enough) it does leave you wishing the game had more options for dealing wth crowds.\nI mean it does have options, but as well as having a special (think "mana") bar, abilities also have cooldowns on them. Personally I would rather they stuck with one system or the other, not both so the only other option is to throw gold at enemies by buying bombs but of course the gold you earn vs the gold you would spend to kill enemies would leave you out of pocket very quickly.\n\nHowever even with all that said, the game provides options and even if I don't think all the options are equally viable I do apprechiate the fact it has more options than Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. Speaking of options their is also an ironman mode as well which again is a nice little extra.\n\nOverall if you are a fan of these types of games you may enjoy battlepaths, I have certainly played worse on the Playstation (Digimon World 2!) but the game is not very exciting. It feels like painting by numbers and I felt more like I was going through the motions than engaging with the game.\n\nIf you can get into it, you will have fun but for most other people you can easily avoid this game and you are not missing anything.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","March 25, 2015","false","12.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","3"

Either you learn everything on your first playthrough and then get it while leveling up those last levels after everything is done, or you start another run for hardcore mode and get it from there... by finishing the game again and grinding a bit more so you take enough damage.\n\n\nOpening 150 treasure chests\n\n- Grinding for keys and then moving to few treasure chests to open them. Yay\n\n\nCrafting a masterpiece\n\n- Hah, good luck with that. I found 3 small chance upgrade items for it (which means 3 attempts) in my 17 hours of play... didn't get it yet.\n\n===========================\n\nEdit: This is actually a rant on both game mechanics and the achievements that don't fit a game like this in my opinion.\n\nAchievements aside, the game is sort of enjoyable at first. It keeps you playing to see new monsters, items and skills, but disappoints you in the end.","March 27, 2015","false","23.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","7"

Don't even bother getting this for trading cards. They're 4 cents apiece and I doubt people will be buying them.\n\nThe plot is skeletal and hollow, the graphics look like a child drew them, all 5 different sound effects repeat endlessly, the music is... surprisingly alright (all three tracks, anyway), and the combat is atrocious for a game all about combat.\n\nThere's no balance whatsoever: ranged enemies destroy everything, you've got endless money but nothing useful to spend it on, once you get rogue gear everything becomes trivial. Except for when it's not, then you're suddenly overwhelmed in a single turn and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. The difficulty goes from boring button mash fest to "well, guess I'm dead again".\n\nThe only reason I played so long was to get those trading cards. I figured I also owed it to potential buyers to also give it an in-depth review.\n\nTL;DR - If this was a game made by my best friend with the intent to sell it, I'd smack them upside the head and send them to the corner of shame to rethink their decision.","April 11, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, I'm not a big fan of rogue-like games. I'm not a big fan of the art style of this game either. However, the game seemed simple enough to be welcoming to people not familiar with the genre. You start in a town, accept quests, etc. It seemed like a pretty enjoyable game. There seems to be a decent sized world. So, my initial impression is that this is a decent game, but I wouldn't say it's going in the hall of fame.","March 20, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But can't. And it's not about the graphics, I'm actually perfectly fine with them. It's about the game's core mechanics.\n\nWhere to begin? Okay, right off the bat - everything kills you quite easily. Unless you have a Dextery-focused character, you can't hit anything, your character just continuously misses. Ranged enemies will hit almost every attack at you. The game puts you in the most ridiculous situations where you just have little to no chance to survive. Some enemies just take WAY too long to die, some enemies will keep you debuffed all the time. Then you think that, okay, you can survive using potions... Except potions work over time and they aren't cheap. Because potions work over time, they often won't save you and since using a potion counts as a turn, it means enemies will attack you while you're using a potion. Then maybe you can use a bomb, except they don't cause that much damage. Maybe you can use a summon potion? Except that the summoned allies are extremely weak. Oh and running away is often not an option because enemies in this game are often too fast. Then maybe you can just die, learn from your mistakes and try again - but dying takes a good chunk of your XP and money. Perhaps you'll give up on those monsters and move on until you're stronger to fight them, but you'll eventually run into a situation where you'll just end up dying again, and without leveling up and getting money, you won't get stronger to face the monsters you left behind in the first place. And like I mentioned before, potions aren't cheap. Equipments aren't either - and that's when the equipment vendor even offers anything interesting that you can actually equip.\n\nUnless you choose Regeneration as your special power, you're going to die. A lot. And even having Regeneration as your special power is still not going to do much.\n\nQuests are boring and their rewards are helpful, but uninteresting.\n\nAnd just to top it off... No magic. You only get these special abilities to use, but they're very few. There are no spells to use.\n\nI really, REALLY wanted to enjoy this game because I love dungeon crawlers.

You move around by using the arrow keys and you attack by 'walking' into enemies. There's an inventory screen, you can compare items and you can add magical abilities to items by finding the right type of loots. Special abilities can be activated by pressing tab. It looks a bit like Diablo but it plays like Dungeons of Dredmore.\n\nUnfortunately, it is also rather boring. I played on hardcore mode, died and then realised that because the map isn't randomised (only the loot is) I would have to do the exact same thing over and over. "Hardcore" mode is only fun when every challenge is different. I don't play "normal" mode when there's a hardcore mode available as I don't think dying and losing some experience in this game would in any way provide for a meaningful gaming experience. It'd just be a slow, boring and ugly grind while experiencing something that doesn't move me at all.\n\nI also gathered that you can obtain a game key for free, which makes every cent spent on it seem a poor investment.\n\nThat being said: the game is solid.

(oh, there's this guy, oh, i killed him.)\n* It sharply becomes hard.\n* There isn't any animation. It looks like it was made with little or no effort.\n* You don't have a wide selection of building your character.\n\nIt's very mediocre. But it's worth IF ONLY it's on 90% sale.","December 30, 2015","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now the item should stick to the cursor\n3) Press TAB 4 times to switch between panels. There should be 2 items now, one in the inventory (A') and one on the cursor (A)\n4) Click A'. If the item is not stackable, put it somewhere else.\n\nP.S. The game crashed 2 times while I was writing this review.","January 11","false","0.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is very middle of the road, so much so that it's not really something I'm going to come back to. After entangling with enemies until they could stand no more, or I died due to some strong enemy interupting, it just felt like the game was melting into the background as I played it. The penalty for death is negligible, as enemies are neither refreshed of health, or even replenished as a mob. It's more like a game of "How much you can stand, before you get bored."It probably wouldn't take much to finish this game; but I don't really feel like playing such a boring RPG. This game is far more simplistic than stuff I'd find on the NES, without much of a challenge to it either. Definitely not worth purchasing... If you really need something like this, I would suggest something at least challenging like Ys.","May 21","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
