Made all the more exciting when you play with a number of friends, its fast paced action and ripper soundtrack will have you and your mates saying “Come on… Just one more time”.\n\nPros:\nGame play is intuitive, making it easy to jump straight in and start playing.\nGreat variety with 6 unique visually appealing levels\n“Gauntlet” mode for a whole extra degree of challenge\nAwesome soundtrack that really enhances the feel of the different levels\nGreat “kid friendly” fun\n\nCons:\nWhere did my afternoon just go……\n","November 8, 2015","true","4.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I suspect with time this game will have some cool updates for maps, and abilities etc.\n\nI think it would be cool if they made it so you could play one of the bears and chase your friends around :)","November 8, 2015","true","2.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Thought this game is labeled as multiplayer(Online). You must have more than one controller and a person who's willing to play, because if not this game is completely pointless to have. This is the game's only downfall, I hope that in the future they will add AI players that you can compete against. Also that the moment there is a limited amount of content, but I'm sure it will be expanded upon in the future. I can't wait to see what's in store. Btw, by 9 year old niece endorses this game. :) For that I recommend this game for people who have siblings, or friends are are willing to play. When you do have people to play with, this game is a blast!","December 10, 2015","true","15.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I eventually walked away from the demo realizing I played one of the best party games I've ever seen. I've tried to keep up with it's development, but life (and my own indie studio) got in the way. A couple of us were reminiscing about Bearzerkers today at our studio and I decided do check-in on it. AND THEN WE PLAYED FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS!\n\nI'm so excited for this game and the developers, as I remember them in 2014, are great people. Please buy this game and share it with your friends. =)\n\n*An actual review*\n\nThe game has simple mechanics... you move, you kick up ground, and there are powerups. That's it. And it's all you need. You run from bears, you kick up ground to block your friends in hopes of them getting eaten, and you survive. The music is fine, the escalating bears is exciting, and the party replayability is amazing. 9/10, WILL PLAY AGAIN.","May 1","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have played many round of this with my friends, it's fun.  Problem, when the bears get angry they get close to you no matter what ability you have, it really loses the illusion of a chase, because they never touch you just get really close.  I feel like the chase mechanics need to get worked out, if the developers would like to talk to me add me on skype or email at Srobertfleming@gmail.com","April 24","false","1.3"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","1"
