Its style of game is you shoot with the mouse(point and click). this game has a good amount of flashing lights on one of the beginning levels. you do not have to play levels in any order, but need a certain amount to get the boss of that world. Overall the game was enjoyable so far and I will continue to play it.\n\nother random thoughts:\n\nits an indie game and feels well made EXCEPT when I went to select wasd after loading it up after the first time and it was still set to the arrow keys, and after it was fixed the options menu said it was the arrow keys.\n\nThe gameplay seems solid, the backgrounds on one level i noticed moved with you, similar to the original rayman,\n\nI will post screenshots of this game so more people can see more of this game.","April 15","true","0.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/270410/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","I want to be human is an action platform shooter hybrid with an indie soundtrack and a very interesting aesthetic. The story of I want to be Human describes itself as Boy meets vampire girl, boy falls in love with vampire girl, boy gets turned into a weaponised hat by evil forces trying to take over the world… wait, what? There is only one thing a vampire girl can do: go on a bloodthirsty rampage of death and destruction in a quest to get her boyfriend back!... OK\n\nThe game itself is kind hard to explain. Think a shooter like Contra, crossed with elements of a hardcore platformer like Super Meat Boy but with elements of bullet hell shooters thrown in.\n\nAs you travel through the game’s levels each award you a grade and a score by collecting items, breaking score blocks and killing things. Every time you break a block or kill something a combo meter increases which of course in turn increases your overall score. The key to an excellent score is in keeping an ongoing chain of kills and blocks going as you progress through the game’s levels.\n\nThis is easier said than done and while the early levels of the game are not difficult to get through to gain a good score is actually very difficult without repeated playthroughs.\nEvery few levels are met with a boss fight that mix things up a bit and a welcome change of pace.\n\nMechanically the game plays generally well with a contra style control system mixed with super meat boy style wall jumping platforming. There is also a dash move that was rather fiddly to control with accuracy and I felt was rarely needed except in the aforementioned boss fights.\n\nSo do I like the game… Yes... I guess I appreciate its merits but I must admit not being a massive fan of score attack twitch platformers some of the game’s charm I feel is a little lost. After completing the game’s first world I was desperate for a new gun rather than just an upgrade or some different mechanics.  While there are different worlds and themes each level looks very similar and the enemy variety is also a little lacking.\n\nVisually the game is pretty to look at but I feel a slightly higher resolution in the sprites wouldn't have gone amiss. The soundtrack of the game is excellent providing a thumping indie soundtrack including original tracks from Jimmy Urine of Mindless Self Indulgence.\n\nWhether or not you enjoy this game will largely rely on whether you know what you are getting. This is very much not a run and gun game and sits most comfortably as a Super Meat Boy, score attack game with some shooting elements thrown in. Its good I just feel there could have been a little bit more variety to keep me coming back for more but is it’s a score attack and surprisingly hardcore game you are looking for this will fit the bill nicely.\n\nTHE GAME WAS PLAYED USING A KEY PROVIDED BY THE DEVELOPER. MY THOUGHTS AND OPINIONS ARE HOWEVER MY OWN. THE PRICE OF THE GAME HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN PRODUCING THIS REVIEW.\n\nFor our video review please check it out here:  Video Review[www.thegametutor.co.uk]\n\n","April 27","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure, it’s quirky- but it's that kind of humor that’s weird for cringy sake. If you can get past the poor controls and frustrating level design, there are plenty of fun battles to be had. Sadly, I can’t recommend this game to anyone- it just feels far too amateurish, and it’s even more disappointing when I see the work this one-man team has put out before.","April 19","false","5.1"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","4","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nardio_net/recommended/270410/","nardio_net","bme85","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nardio_net/","35 products in account","Product received for free\n\nI review games for my website Nardio.net. I recieved a free promotion key for I Want To Be Human a little while ago when we were covering games at Pax East. To see the review with pictures that go to the link below. The text of the review is below. I know this is a harsh review, but this a really bad game.\n\nhttp://nardio.net/2016/05/24/want-human-review/\n\nIs I Want To Be Human worth your time?\nNo.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should I play this on?\nI played/endured this on a PC with an X-Box controller.\n\n\n\nWhat Did We Think Without Spoiling It?\nThis is a let down. I Want To Be Human is just a bad platformer that sells for a comically high price. Even if the game were free I would hate it. Seeing it sell for $14.99 on Steam is mind blowing to me.\n\n\n\nHow it Plays and Why it Fails:\nBad game design.\n\nI love action platformers. I love interesting art. I love energetic music. I Want To Be Human should be a darn insta-recommendation from me. I was really, really excited to play this game. When we received a promotional key for the game I was giddy. Sadly and honestly quite painfully, horrible level design knee caps the game. I Want To Be Human is painfully bad game all around.\n\nUgh.\n\nThis was a frustrating game to play and even more frustrating to try and like. I want to be Human is just a bad game. I know I already said that, but I feel like I can’t say it enough. The art seemed really interesting when I first started it up, but soon enough the flaws started to make themselves known. Often times foreground visual junk totally obscures the on screen action. I know this happens a bit here an there in some games, but it’s taken to an unforgivable extreme here. You just cannot see some enemies that are attacking you on the ground. You can’t even see yourself!\n\n\nIn areas like this it’s just about shooting and hoping you get the kill.  I want to be human has more problems than just foreground clutter, but that is the last thing that bugged me before I decided to uninstall the game and give up on it. I Want To Be Human has so many problems I think it patching here and there can’t fix it. This game needs to be taken down and totally rebuilt from the ground up. There is a good game in here I am sure, but it’t covered and covered in problems.\n\nLets go into some of it’s problems shall well?\n\nCheap enemy placement.\nRandomized enemy projectiles.\nBad level design.\nBad aiming control on a game pad.\nVisual clutter and bad in game lighting makes platforming and finding enemies unnecessarily difficult.\nStupid text bubbles that constantly appear from the players mouth that interfere with your view of the game. (CAN’T SHUT THIS OFF!)\nHorrible bouncing camera.\nWay to much unnecessary screen shake. (CAN’T SHUT THIS OFF!)\n\nI Want To Be Human is just a bad game.\n\n\nIt feels like I Want To Be Human is the developer’s very first game. It feels as if the dev took every new technique they learned and over used it all for fun. Then decided to sell it without cleaning the game up at all. Mechanics, enemy placement, and overall game design seems to have no concern for the player playing the game. I don’t think this was ever play tested. I Want To Be Human plays that badly.  Why are text bubbles constantly coming from the character that blocks everything underneath it? Why can’t I shut that off? Getting knocked off a cliff by enemy bullets I can’t see because my character can’t stop calling dead enemies eight year old insults is beyond stupid. This is not an issue that should be in a game that sells for this much. Heck this shouldn’t happen at all ever in any game. That is just bad game design.\n\nIf you hate screen shake you are going to despise this game. Even if you don’t have a problem with screen shake this will bother you. As I was playing/enduring this Jasmine (Who has no problem with screen shake) was watching me play and felt ill after a while. I Want To Be Human is really that painful and uncomfortable to watch.\n\nI really tried to get into it, I completed several levels and spent over an hour playing it, but it never felt fun and the level design only gets more frustrating. I got this game for free as a review/promotional copy and I hated it. This is in no way shape or form worth the $14.99 asking price.\n\nDon’t get this game even if it’s free.","May 24","false","1.4"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Yes.\nShould you buy it ? Ofc you should. But it would be wiser if you purchase in sales.\n\nFull review- http://techarx.com/review-i-want-to-be-a-human/","April 30","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
