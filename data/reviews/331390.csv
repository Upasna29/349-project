Much like the magical shoujo series I remember seeing in my youth, the quirky and fast moving story is mostly lost on me and I'm just content to relax and take in the pretty artwork and up-beat tunes driving this off-the-wall story. The plot is strange enough to keep me wondering about some of the more mysterious characters and their situation while offering just the right amount of anime cheesecake to be entertaining without overstaying its welcome, but overall where Winged Sakura really shines is the unique brand of fast-paced defensive tactical combat.\n\nThe gameplay at first glance simply resembles a more anime themed Plants vs. Zombies with player units being placed as defense on the left while enemy hordes advance from the right, however the similarities stop here as Winged Sakura takes a more complex and refined departure towards deeper RPG mechanics and unit variety.\n\nJust as you're starting off you already have three distinct units fully displaying the importance of their combined teamwork. Leapies are shielded units and will act as a defense block to gather a row of enemies while Magicats will bombard the cluster with a magical area attack, whereas the Sneaky Cat archers will pick off the stragglers with a simple arrow shot. Units both ally and enemy have their own elemental strengths and weakness, adding another bit of depth to planning your offense.\n\nWith the addition of a multitude of spells the user can cast to change the tides of battle, things can become a little overwhelming with how much multitasking goes on. Luckily this is remedied with the insanely useful Strategic Pause command, allowing even the slowest of strategists to carefully plan their next wave of defenses at their own leisure. Of course, once you get to Insane difficulty this option is no longer available forcing you to put your prior practicing to the test.\n\nWhile the basic formula of the game may be simple and easy to pick up for all skill levels, the difficulty quickly ramps to ridiculous heights often forcing me to drop the setting to Easy until I leveled my Spirits (units) up enough. It's accessibility keeps victory in sight at all times despite this challenge, and the player will always have a good idea of what they did wrong at the end of a soul crushing defeat. With each return to these frantic stages of multitasking and quick wits I was more excited than the last, picking up on new strategies and complex combinations\n\nIf you aren't totally adverse to bits of corny albeit fun anime fluff and filler this is nothing short of an incredibly deep strategy title, and one I recommend to any fan of the defense genre or games with heavy RPG mechanics such as crafting, enchanting, and stat building. The artwork is eye-catching and very attractive and the constant stream of interesting character designs keeps your attention, as does the catchy original soundtrack.","November 8, 2014","true","16.0"," 100 of 115 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","100","115","2","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladderman/recommended/331390/","ladderman","No","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladderman/","335 products in account","Although I'm giving this a negative review with the only choices being the black or white "Recommended" or "Not Recommended", I'm doing it more to give constructive criticism to the developer and inform potential buyers of some things positive reviewers might be leaving out.\n\nThe difficulty curve is extremely harsh. You have four levels of difficulty you can play at. Easy, Normal, Hard, and Insane. In the first three you can pause the game at any time in order to take your time placing units (spirits), looking at tooltips to read weaknesses, etc. In Insane you cannot pause at all. I started out playing on Normal and assumed that it wouldn't be too hard to progress at that level. Wrong. Even at Normal you will most likely quickly get overwhelmed and have to fall back to playing levels on Easy. Even on Easy you will most likely have a hard time completing progressive levels and have to go back to earlier levels and grind random rewards (Item Blossoms) and sell those rewards for money that you can buy enchanting items with from the store and upgrade your Spirits items with.\n\nThis however is another issue in my opinion. Completing levels only gives you experience that levels up your spirits and the item blossoms depending on what difficulty level you played and if you did it perfectly without any enemies making it across the end line and damaging your 10 health points. It used to give fewer item blossoms but it was patched to increase the rewards. On Easy you will get 4 random Item Blossoms (3 + 1 if you do it perfectly) from a specific pool of items that the level can give. Completing levels does not give you any money. You have to sell your random rewards to the shop for ~33% of their value that the store sells the same items for. Also, sometimes rewards consist of patterns that unlock items in the shop; aka they have no monetary value. So to enchant one of your spirits weapons up to +10 you need to grind easy levels repeatedly getting rewards such as Bows that you sell for about 33 currency or Coins that you sell for 97 currency. You might get around 200-350 currency per repeated grind. You need 400 for each level of enchanting up to level 10. I think it would be better if the game directly rewarded currency for each level completed instead of needing to grind materials and sell them for low percentages repeatedly.\n\nThe story is pretty random and hard to follow. None of the characters know why they're there or why they're doing what they're doing. The main character seems to have amnesia. It's hard to follow which character is even talking when you're clicking through the dialogue at a decent pace. When there are four characters on screen and two are named "Mindy" and "Minzy" and two are named "Nina" and "Nino" it can kind of be confusing which one is saying what. Especially when there is usually no indication of a character starting to talk besides the (very similar) name changing. Aka the character art won't change and the speech is not appearing above their head; it is always in the same place down in the center. Even when the character suddenly changes moods and says something like "What!? Really!?" their expression won't change and they still have the same smiling expression art used. And you cannot scroll back up to past conversation to check something if you missed it or were clicking through too quickly. You can usually do this in visual novels and having that feature would be great.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that there is some Engrish. It's not constant but there is quite a bit of it. Incorrect grammar, missing words, words in the wrong order. For example: one time a line said something like "Quick, we to need go now!" instead of "Quick, we need to go now!". It's definitely not impossible to understand but there are a bunch of errors.\n\nAlthough it isn't a huge deal it can be kind of annoying dealing with the different elements of the enemy mobs. They have weaknesses and affinities. The weaknesses are simple enough; a raccoon spirit enemy has a weakness to fire? Great, your fire archer spirits work well against them. The annoying thing is the affinities. If they have a lightning affinity for example they will absorb and heal from any lightning damage. There are Leapie enemies which hold shields that have a lightning affinity and are immune to all damage except any that has shield piercing on it. They're weak to wind so once you get the wind archers with shield piercing you obviously use those to kill them. But when tons of Leapies come out on all five rows it's kind of annoying to have your Lightning Mage spirit up. It will just constantly attack the Leapies and heal them. You can't even desummon spirits once you summon them. You do have the ability to pause the game and manually click and redirect the Lightning Mage spirit's attacks to another enemy (if any are there) but as soon as it kills it it will just attack the next closest enemy (probably a Leapie) and start healing them again. It's not worth constantly manually redirecting your dim-witted spirits attacks for every kill, so I just end up not using the spirit at this point. There have seriously been rows of enemies that include alternating Leapies (weak to wind) and Squirrel spirits (wind affinity, heal from wind damage) over and over. One leapie, one squirrel, one leapie, one squirrel, etc. You need to place your wind archers to kill the Leapies, but as soon as the first Leapie drops it will continue to shoot the next enemy - the squirrel - that will just block it's attacks and heal from it. You can use other spirits to kill the squirrel enemies but your wind archer spirit will continue to shoot them as well until it despawns, constantly healing it and competing against your own spirit trying to kill it. The elements can be kind of frustrating and rather than purely rewarding using the correct elements to do more damage the affinities seem to limit what you can do and punish yourself in some instances.\n\nAnother thing I hope could be changed is sometimes you try placing your own Leapie spirits to block incoming waves and if you misjudge whether or not you have enough room to place the Leapie it will just instantly delete it once you resume game because it was a fraction too close and got placed on top of the enemy. And then you are sort of screwed or at least at a big disadvantage as it goes on its 10 second cooldown and the wave you were trying to block is probably sprinting or equally dangerous. You can be very conservative in such situations and just place it another square back but having an indicator telling you that you can't place it there would be nice.\n\nOverall I think that it is a pretty fun game. It can be rather hectic and the difficulty curve does seem kind of broken as of now. I don't think it should be necessary to both drop down to the lowest difficulty and still need to grind to improve your spirits because you can't even progress on said easiest difficulty without doing so. The developer is very defensive about people commenting on this. I've seen responses with him questioning if they listened to the tutorial or are using strategic pause enough or that he sees they haven't enchanted a weapon to +10. I have done grinding to enchant multiple weapons to +10, etc, paid attention to every tip given and pause a lot (it's necessary); it's still challenging even on easy. I hope the information I provided was useful. There are many positive aspects to the game; I am simply chosing to focus on the negatives since nobody seems to really point them out. The developer seems to care about the game and still be involved in improving it. I do think it's a decent game.  I recommend picking it up.\n\nEdit: In a recent patch (you can see him post patch notes in the announcements) the developer improved the electric caster spirit's AI and increased item sell values (from 35% to 50%), improved some typos, etc. He continues to work to improve the game.","January 5, 2015","false","18.3"," 138 of 174 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","138","174","6","0"

The spirits you summon are short-lived, so you constantly have to summon new spirits to keep up with appearing enemies. You can pause the game anytime (except on highest difficulty), allowing you to plan your defense precisely.\n\nAs mentioned in the opening line, Winged Sakura has extensive RPG elements as well. Each spirit has level that increases as the spirit participates in battles, and can equip its personal weapon and an accessory from a fairly large list. Equipment’s quality can be improved by both finding or crafting higher-tier versions of the item, or upgrading existing item (and as upgrade cost raises with item’s tier, upgrading lower-tier items is often a preferable alternative to getting higher-tier items).\n\nThe story is very interesting, and cutscenes are done in anime style, with beautiful character art. Both cutscenes and battle art is very good in general, as can be seen on screenshots.\n\nI recommend Winged Sakura to all fans of defense games, doubly so if they like anime style as well!","November 14, 2014","true","68.4"," 55 of 58 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","55","58","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lishey/recommended/331390/","Lishey","Sheila","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lishey/","164 products in account","This review would most likely be classed as neutral if there were such a thing. I'm putting this under recommended on the basis that the gameplay feels mostly fun and right, and that the game is worthwhile (at least to pick up during a sale)\nHere's my thoughts and experience so far with the game:\n\nWinged Sakura: Mindy's Arc is a right-to-left tower defense reminiscent of Plants vs Zombies (very recommended game by the way, to both new players and established fans of the genre) which focuses on low-cooldown, low-duration units that you can place on the grids, making it a little more dynamic and action-based. There are enough levels of challenge to be satisfied with, and the game rewards you with more items for higher difficulties, although sometimes higher levels must be revisited after acquiring stronger skills and equipment. You unlock new summonable units and skills by progressing the story and leveling up.There's plenty of skills to get and the equipment upgrade and crafting is fun and satisfying to go through.\nUnits level up permanently, getting stronger and equipment is also permanently assinged to each unit type until you decide to change it (rarity is a thing which adds a little depth.)\n\nThe problems with this game... there are plenty. First off, the UI and game art for the most part resembles that of the average flash game and leaves much to be desired, it also has a lot of inconsistency. For example, the art on the game start screen is wildly superior to everything else in the game, like not much work was put into it. There's a few issues with the items, for example rarity is indicated purely by a colored text, which I feel like could've been more clear if ordered properly and named differently, for example all ores are "Ore" with different colors and prices, and everything is ordered from high to low, so browsing the store for items felt a bit unintuitive at first, it would've been nice to have things like "iron, copper, etc" or at least a word expressing quality, such as lesser or superior.\n\nThe writing and narrative are BAD at best, there's absolutely ZERO exposition or description of the situation, the area, or story the characters find themselves in, and you must pretty much guess what's going on from the unintelligible babbling of the characters that ranges from "shut up" to "doors 1 and 5 are under attack". You're pretty much thrown into the story without knowing what's going on, who anyone is, or why things are happening, I found myself playing 9-10 stages which took me a few hours without even knowing what a "sakura" character is supposed to be, even though it was mentioned repeatedly and is a core concept to the game. There's pairs of characters named the same and their names differ simply by one letter, and this causes some confusion as to who is talking, specially since the writing is poor to begin with. It felt like the dev liked the idea of visual novels so they tried to shoehorn something similar to the storytelling but with little effort.\n\nThe music score is decent, but it is limited, gets reused a lot and gets repetitive quite fast. Sometimes the "tension" song stops playing at any given scene when moving to a different room instead of continuing with the story, and will return to the normal "calm" lobby song when you go back, which kills any sense of urgency or relative immersion.\n\nThe strategy... There is simply none, this is the biggest gripe I have with this game so far. Basically you are supposed to do certain moves at certain waves in certain places, otherwise you WILL fail. For example, a big wave of shield-using enemies is coming, you have no option other than using your own shield-unit to pile them up and then a mine skill to take them all out at once,  that you may or not have the energy for if you used it carelessly before, making this kind of mistakes rarely allows you to make a comeback and will result in a restart/game over. The game expects you to have certain skills at certain points in the game so the skill tree gives a false sense of customization that's not there, for example at one point (quite early on) when deciding to go for the next level the game quite bluntly told me that the next stage was NOT clearable without a skill I opted not to take, so it felt forced and shallow. If unable to clear a stage and getting clearly overpowered, you're either not using the right units/skills at the right time, or need to grind for some levels and better equipment.\nTo add to the last point, there seems to be an optimal/unique way to do your skill tree. At a certain map I found myself FORCED to take level 2 in one of the skills, otherwise it'd prove impossible to clear the waves as fast the game expected me to. I think the illusion of choice is a really big problem with this game so far that and it would be nice to see that improved on.\n\nAll-in-all, it's a decent game if you're not expecting a masterpiece, the gameplay is mostly dynamic and and feels satisfying because of the short timers, but this may also not appeal to everyone. A lot of the issues may or may not be ignored in favor of fun gameplay, but I would definitely not recommend the full price.","December 24, 2015","true","4.6"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

I do, the idea of building up a massive wall of peons and watching them go about bringing destruction to the lemmings below has always been a type of game that inspired me. And my other guilty pleasure is that cute anime garbage that makes me happy. Games like Recettear and 100% Orange Juice, whereas lacking in violence, still can make you smile just from the smiles on the cute characters faces.\n\nBut wait. Those things don't mix...or do they...?\n\nThey can sure try. And here we come to Winged Sakura: Mindy's Arc: A fast paced anime-styled tower defense game by Winged Sakura Games.\n\nI'm sure I've lost you already, so allow me to clear things up now. This is not the type of tower defense game many people will be expecting. It's beyond fast paced, it's hectic, and though I've yet to actually find a need for it, the game comes with a "Strategic Pause" (This is a normal pause, but allows you to catch your breath, refill your drink, think about your next move, or run out into the rain and question your current life choices). The game is structured very similarly (so far) to the first levels of Plants versus Zombies, another tower defense game that this one, like many others, so desperately wants to live up to. Except this time around, it's cats versus....the same exact cats, and your cats are on a timer. By this, I mean they fade away in seconds, or even after they attack ONCE. So you will be constantly reapplying the towers and struggling to keep yourself from being overrun by.............cats. Oh and a chicken! And I *think* I've seen bunnies by now.\n\nThe gameplay is honestly pretty enjoyable. Fast paced is a nice breath of fresh air in the genre, and I'm always willing to try something new. So let's move onto...the...story......\nHm.\n\nIf you're looking into buying this game, or at least have read the review up to this point, you're probably an anime fan. And most anime fans have enjoyed anime on television, from Adult Swim to Toonami, all the way to Anime Unleashed by from Techtv. Think back to those good old days--remember when you'd turn it on, and it would be an anime that you've never seen before, but the story was a good ten episodes in already? But you watched it anyways, not really trying to get into the story? Mine was .hack//sign. God save me, I had no bloody idea what was happening, but I watched it anyways. Point being, that's what this story is. You get into the story, and CLEARLY, you're in the middle, but the game makes no attempt catch you (or its characters) up to speed. They all start out like they know a bunch of secrets, act all chummy, and guess what? You're not in on the joke.\n\nThe art style is charming if cliched', and there seems to be a lot to do for your characters. There's a skill tree, item crafting, upgrades, so on and so forth. I use the word upgrade despondently because Claws turns into Claws, but with a green name and a bunch of upward pointing green arrows on the stats. I would have liked to have seen the artists come up with cooler weapon and accessory upgrades akin to Drakengard style, where each upgrade looks a little more menacing. But since you only see these items in the inventory between rounds, I'm sure I'll get over it.\n\nThis game is still very recently released and Team Winged Sakura Games seems to know what their doing when it comes to patching the game. But for now, don't be surprised when you have to grind the same "rounds" (all the levels are the same) over and over again. Which is probably a good thing, because the STORY mode, a term used VERY loosely, looks to be very very short from where I stand, at just around 5 hours, grinding included. However, I HAVE NOT BEATEN THIS GAME, so this shortness may and or may not be true.\n\nEDIT: Good news. It's infact quite a bit longer than I expected! This is a good thing.\n\nThere is a neko maid added about an hour in. I am still waiting for an explaination for this beyond "because anime."\n\nAll and all, I'm still playing the game, and it knows how to keep my focus. I feel like there isn't much substance, only one level, enemies are also allies, storyline thinner than the maids blouse's fabric, and upgrades are only just so because the game tells you they are. If you like anime and tower defense, you'll probably enjoy this game. There's a survival mode that I assume becomes unlocked once you beat the game, and there are some trophies, though it seems like they'd be easy to get.\n\nLastly, the steam cards trade for this game at around 2$ a piece, and I've currently gained for. Do wih this what you will. This is Faust, thanks for reading.\n\n+Fast paced Gameplay\n+Classic modern Anime Design\n+Fair amounts of strategy required\n+Rewarding Grinding\n-------------------\n-Unappealing storyline\n-Slightly non user friendly\n-Lazy design\n-A neko maid? Really. Come on. You're better than this! And Sakura? REALLY? Didn't sakura spirits just come out? Didn't it just forcefeed us these stupid trophes? This is what is known as profiling. These are not elements that make anime. I'm sorry, but this had to be said, and you know it as well as I do, Team Winged Sakura Games.\n\nRecommended:\nTo those who want a tower defense game that is slightly different, but not outside the realms of what they've come to know and love from the genre.","November 12, 2014","true","5.9"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

But this game is awesome! The characters are adorable.  You play Mindy who faints in and out of an alter-reality, gameplay and real life mode maybe? Its your usual point and click strategy game, with timed cool downs for special actions. The game has a 30 second timer on it, but you have to right-click on the timer to reset to 30seconds, there is also  game pause so you can determine your next move. The game play mechanics is pretty good, not too easy yet not too difficult either, its a quick learn. There is a certain amount of stereotypicalness with this game, if you love anime style visual novels this i must have. As a person who really doesn't care much for strategy games, I find myself being driven to succeed to just go further in the story and see what happens. Its got really good solitaire style game play, the game itself pretty quickly paced but with strategic pauses it makes it a lot more casual. If you love stragetgy games, it may not be the deepest, but for the rest of us, its a very fun easy to learn game with a really fun cheeky upbeat tempo.

I'm not an otaku, but I know enough about anime to know that this took all the common tropes of anime, and just threw them together. This game brought absolutely nothing new to the table storywise.\n- The humor (and just the writing in general) really grated on my nerves. It felt like everything fell flat.\n- Grindy.
