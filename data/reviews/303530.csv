The menu, if you can call it that, is extremely bare bones.  There’s no in-game option menu that would otherwise allow you to adjust audio volumes and the like, though the Unity Engine does feature a separate pop-up on launch that allows you to adjust screen resolution, graphics quality, and full screen.  There are no instructions or tutorials at present, plopping players into an environment that they’ll have to figure out on their own.  I do praise the theme behind the project and would really like to see what it’ll be like when it’s officially done.  I’m giving it a “thumbs up” on the idea alone, but if you’re strapped for cash, I’d wait for a few more patches / content updates.  It’s an Early Access game, so it goes without saying that the above opinions are subject to change.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zmNGWMTz6w","August 22, 2014","true","1.1"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","2"

The color choices seem to be reasonable for someone with protanomaly (a type of colorblindness).  While you might think that placing random notes from various instruments would produce a terrible noise, the music I've generated so far has been pleasant.\n\nThe game is entertaining, but as soon as I exit a song, it leaves me with "screen spins" where I see everything on the screen as if it's twisting slowly.  I can stave this off by playing forever, perhaps.","October 11, 2014","true","0.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamsque/recommended/303530/","Jamsque","Jamsque","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamsque/","187 products in account","I played an early version of this game at PAX last year and could not get my head around it. I dropped blocks haphazardly in to a wheel, not understanding what I was supposed to be doing and not enjoying the sounds I was creating. I walked away feeling embarrassed that I had failed to 'get' Sentris.\n\nThe tutorial in the release version immediately got me on the right track and removed my doubts about this game. Within five minutes I was creating funky loops that went beyond the tunes the game was feeding me and I felt the thrill of composition that I know the designer was aiming to inspire. There is a real satisfaction in building loops layer by layer and it is especially cool to see how the sound evolves as later layers start to push earlier ones out of the loop. The way the progression of songs helps you learn what the game has to offer in terms of depth is almost perfectly executed, the only thing that I struggled a little to figure out was how to change octaves in freestyle mode (you have to climb or descend the scale to reach the octave you want to play in).\n\nI have now worked my way through all of the 'puzzles' that the game ships with (excluding one, Kentucky Fried Chernobyl, that seems to be broken) in their default forms and started to mess with the remix function, which lets you change the BPM, key signature, scale mode and instrument set for any track, and the endless random mode. There is a lot of room to experiment using these tools and although I don't think I will be using Sentris for serious music composition I definitely see myself regularly dipping back in to this game for short jam sessions.\n\nSentris is not without flaws; I would have gladly played through two or three times as many puzzle songs as the game shipped with or made my own with a level editor, freestyle mode being a face-button toggle rather than a shoulder-button hold makes the controls a little clumsy at times, and the game never gives you control over the length of the blocks you are placing even in the remix and infinite modes, although I suspect that this last 'flaw' was a deliberate design decision to force players to experiment and compose rather than reproducing tunes or beats they already know.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone, even if you do not think of yourself as a musical person I think you will be pleasantly surprised by what you are able to create in Sentris.","August 27, 2015","true","5.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Whether you are a veteran of the music game genre (harmonix fans I am talking to you), or you simply have an interest in making music, Sentris has something fun and engaging for you to discover.\n\nThe most intimidating aspect of learning to play an instrument or learning to write music is finding out how different sounds come together in collaboration to create an interesting complex whole. What makes Sentris so intriguing is the way it brings players into music creation without judgment. Players are invited to solve musical puzzles without harsh critique. This allows players to follow the game's progressive musical structure or completely deviate from the game's pre-set suggestions without negative consequence. The results can vary from being an only slightly coherent cacophony of noise to surprisingly deep melodies and rhythms that are uniquely authored by the player.\n\nSamantha Kalman may be a relatively new name to video game players, but her work on Sentris gives me hope that we will see more excellent indie games from her and her company (Timbre Interactive) in the future.\n","August 19, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I enjoy games like this.  I bought the 20 dollar version that includes all the past builds and extra stuff and i don't necessarily know if I would buy that version again.  The regular game I would totally buy again, but I think the price is a little steep for what it is.\n\nFirst Hour:\nAt first I did not understand what I was doing in this game.  I was just droppin in "booms" and "bats" on a circle, but this game is a little more than that to people who are judging it for what you see.  It is a puzzle game, and it's a beats game.  It's weird to try and classify it.  If this game were a style of music it would be Country Rap, nobody really understands it, but its kind of fun.\n\nSecond Hour:\nI finally figured out the "story" mode and helped build some massive phat beats yo.  When you get to your last piece and place it, then miss it by an inch, you will be one angry nerdy version of Lil Wayne and you will throw your lollipop in the street and stomp on it yelling, "I want my toy!"\n\nThird Hour:\nGave up on the story line, kicked out the windows of my house, set up some speakers facing the street.  Bought a strobe light from a homeless guy and hooked it up.  I bought a police grade bullhorn and i'm puttin on a pretty damn good show.  Two or three neighbors showed up and we raised the roof.\n\nFourth and Final Hour:\nCops shot tear gas into the Dope Skrilla Freestyle Rap Battle Competition.  We gave up and I turned the computer off.  Samantha, i need bail money.  Please bail me out!","August 17, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","2","2","4","0"

It reminds me of my days playing with software such as FruityLoops, but puts its own unique spin on things. I’ve enjoyed playing through the provided songs and am starting to create my own unique setups (as well as attempting to emulate some more widely-known music too).\n\n"What is Sentris in 2 Minutes?" Video:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=502221656\nOverall the game is a lot of fun, and quite a versatile tool once you get to grips with it. That said, there are a few features I would love to see implemented going forward. Primarily these are just additional expansions for added versatility when creating songs. It would be great to be able to select notes outside the standard scale that I choose, and to apply effects (such as reverb or echo) to specific instruments during remix.\n\nNevertheless, the initial offering (at time of official v1.0 launch) is a joy to play around with. When you hit upon a riff that catches your ear and develop it into something you love, it really brings a smile to your face. Whether you're smashing notes together until something sticks (or doesn't!) or meticulously crafting a pre-meditated loop from scratch, Sentris is really unique and wonderful take on musical creativity.","August 18, 2015","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While it is admirable to try to create a game that has interesting puzzle aspects as well as being a fully-functional music creator, it fails in finding a complexity balance between the two. Let me try to explain this. Great puzzle games are simple - Tetris would be a prime example here. Great music creation programs or tools are complex (I have no good example here, but I am certain of this from messing around with Audacity). To me, Sentris has awesome sounds and potential, but is not a fun puzzle game at all. It felt like work. Whenever I had someone try it, they got lost in the complexity as opposed to being swallowed in great puzzle-fun addiction.\n\nPros:\n+Very polished, and is obviously a labor of love\n+Ambitious project with two genres I love (mixing puzzles and music creation)\n\nCons:\n-Controls never felt intuitive with either controller or keyboard\n-Overly complex for a puzzle game\n-Not very addictive\n\nWhile I will continue a bit trying to find the magic here, I certainly do not recommend this game for the asking price.","August 22, 2015","false","2.4"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","10","18","2","0"

It translates aspects of musical theory into a set of simple visual cues that match with the audio to convey ideas without need for words, which is a truly impressive achievement. The level of guidance offered by the simple puzzle mechanics serves to push the player along while also leaving ample room for experimentation. The early portions of exploring the game are limited in such a way as to make it difficult to produce anything that sounds bad, but always with enough of your own creative decisions included to make the end result feel like the product of your own effort. As one digs deeper there is a fantastic amount of freedom and depth to be found and new concepts to be explored.\n\nMy time with Sentris was fun and educational in a way that I've experienced with few other games in my life.","November 25, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It's extremely vague, and unless you do a small bit of video watching on YouTube, you can only make assumptions based on what it's asking for you to do. At least common logic carried me for the first song and a half.\n\nOther than the outright confusion I experienced, this is an excellent piece of work. I'm sure Samantha is planning on adding more cool stuff, so if you got the chance, buy it now. A lot of love and dedication went into this game, and if you're like me and enjoy items like Audiosurf, Beat Hazard, Savant: Ascent, or anything in general that has in depth gameplay pertaining to music, you will enjoy this...eventually. If at first you play it and don't get how it works or if you don't like it right off the bat, I really encourage you to go watch people fiddle around with it first before you shelve it for good.\n\nAlso, be careful if you play too long. I played for a straight half hour (yeah, I know) without a break and after closing the game was promptly greeted by my vision going wonky and spinning like I had just had a few shots of vodka on an empty stomach.

I have since then changed my opinion because the game has definitely improved.\nThe new menu screen and option layout is absolutely lovely. It used to have  very  few options and settings which left the game feeling bare and unsatisfying. There are now currently 3 game modes with plenty of settings for each to mess around with.\n\nThe developer is actively keeping the community up-to-date with what's going on and responds to questions. I'm very impressed with how questions and problems are resolved and hope to keep on seeing their take on things.\n\nHowever,  it is a very short game.
