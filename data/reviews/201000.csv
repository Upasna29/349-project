This one does not disapoint. Its a great rpg, it calls for strategy not just hack and slash your way through masses of enemies. The story line is great, it is understandable without miles of dialogue to read.the quests are pretty much up to you which ones you will take or refuse. there is a lot of ability to create your character your way. Lots of skills, able to choose what stats to up, and good variety of classes to choose from. The world is pretty big. The graphics are classic swiderweb style. You dont have to have played previous games in the series to know what is going on. Its a great stand alone game. there is no lag, crashes, freezes, glitches or sound errors, that i have found. The combat is turn based. you also can choose which side you wish to be on, you are not stuck with just one side ... this has multiple endings and alot of easter eggs, hidden goodies and well worth the price of the game.","May 29, 2014","true","34.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

I slowly made my way through the rebellion only to figure out that the rebellion wasn't all it was cracked up to be. I'm sure if I played as the shappers, I would have felt the exact same way.\n\nWhen you get about 3/4ths done with the game, you start feeling a serious amount of dread because you know there are no good guys in this plot. I loved it.","May 2, 2014","true","27.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

See the other team perspective cliche. No. Just no. I NEVER wanted to be a Rebel. So this game pointed a sword at me and tried its best to made a turncoat out of me. It failed. I ended becoming a turncoat Rebel. A sworn enemy of the Rebellion.\nI feel this game is linear, that is not necessarily wrong. We are back at the continent but the free roaming options are painfully limited and to gain access to other areas you have to check plot points. In order. What I love in Geneforge 1&2 is the freedom to go almost everywhere when you feel like getting there. Climbing the mountains to chat with Trajkov, crossing the desert to chat with Barzahl and random Drakons, looting everything not nailed down. Those were the days.\n\nThings I learned:\n-Rebels are mad, really, really mad.\n-The Rebellion must be crushed asap.\n\ncontinued in Geneforge 5 review","November 9, 2015","true","45.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

I've spent 51 hours on this game at the time of review and i've only gotten 1 of the 7 endings as 1 of the 5 classes. The story of the game takes place in Terrestia, a land in the middle of a war between the rebels, and the shapers. The shapers have the power to create life, and use magic in helpful ways, but also in unhelpful ways as well. They made creations and serviles for slavery purposes, to do their work for them. After hundreds of years of slavery and mistreatment, the creations and serviles finally had enough and decided to rebel against the shapers. At the height of the war, you are called in to fight by Greta, a rebel. You take a boat to Southforge Citadel and use the Geneforge, a hidden rebel way of making someone capable of shaping and magic. You then decide what side to fight for as you make your way through Terrestia aiding the shapers, rebels, or another sect hated by both rebels and shapers alike. The end is flexible and can change, and the gameplay can change as well with the classes you can pick from. Even though the graphics are primitive, it is an indie game, so it is actually very good for just a few people. Text in-game also adds to the game by providing a description of the land that you are in, as to help with imagining it better. The sound does get a bit repetitive, but it still fits the mood of wherever you happen to be, whether it be a town, cave, or the woods. Overall, this game is an indie masterpiece, as well as my favorite RPG of all time, and i've played quite a few. A hidden gem in gaming for sure.","August 9, 2015","true","175.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I imagine it will be more of the same as previous installments, but so far :\n\n* You can play as a servile, or one of four other character classes (combat, stealth, shaping, magic).\n* You get to use the geneforge during the tutorial.\n* Light sources exist, so if something's too dim to see you can actually do something about it.\n* New graphics sprinkled in here and there!  Not only items, but for people too -- making NPC's easier to tell apart!\n* Some new creations entirely -- one per type.  Also, there are skills for shaping Drakons and Eyebeasts.  How cool is that?\n\nThe first three games were a bit cookie-cutter at times, although the level design and writing always saved it -- but this installment is going out of its way to differentiate itself, right off the bat.  I'm psyched.","December 5, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
