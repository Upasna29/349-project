"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitefox81/recommended/9850/","whitefox81","IceFoxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whitefox81/","55 products in account","CPCW is an acceptable good Tactic-Strategy game. In my Opinion a good game to play on rainy weekends with a nice cup of coffee. Details:\n\n\nGraphics - 8/10\nThe ingame graphic is awesome detailed. Enviroment looks close steps to realistic, nicely done with much love to detalis. Also the realistic reactions are nice to look at (example: Weather / grenade in forest burns trees down / ramming electricity pylons make'em flash and fall /  after some gaming time the night comes and the tanks use activate headlights,....)\n\nSound - 7/10\nSound is okay. The music is a bit monotone but fits in. Talking/responding of the soldiers is clear and good. War-Sounds are very good. You feel like inside the game.\n\nAI - 7/10\nThe Computer-Inteligence is also okay. Sometimes, your tanks or troopers dont go the way they should (example: tank turns cicles before driving ahead). It happens acceptable rare, but happens. Enemys react good. with nice tactic that gives you the "wow, could be human" effect.\n\nIngame functions - 9/10\nThere are quite a lot of functions, and I still keep finding out more. You can rotate your view from upper view to diagoal. You can tell the tanks where to aim at when they change position. You can group teams, individually. You have Maps to draw in for making plans with Multiplayer friends..... and so on.\n\ncomplexity - 7/10\nWell as someone who doesn't like the HUD filled up to much and stuff I gotta say: you should definetly take a look at the manual. Fly over it for about 10mins, make the Tutorial and I think you got it. Some things could have been easier, like Keyboard-Settings but its okay.\n\nSingle Player - 6/10\nStory is easy to follow, but could be a bit more motivating to play. Seems a bit "loveless". Campaign could be a bit longer or DLCs could have been released. Anyway its fun to play through.\n\nMultiplayer / Coop 4/10\nMultiplayer is a bit frustrating. If you wanna go "online" then you need to activate an account wich is (meanwhile?) impossible, so no online servers possible to play with. It works if you use programs like tunngle and connect via LAN function to friends. There it is easy and with no problems to connect fast and fun to play. But sadly very less maps.\n\nPrice 3/10\nWell, the game is worth buying it, but not worth the actual 20 EUR it costs. This was maybe realistic when it was released but nowadays a bit to expensive for this kind of game.\n\n\nEnding words\nYou should definetly give it a try when its on sale. for a max Price of 10 EUR its okay to buy and you wont regret it.\n","January 13, 2015","true","103.1"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

The (new?) developers of the game are clearly trying to update the game and have removed the TAGES copy protection.  Hopefully they'll resolve the crash issue.   Until they do, the game will lauch if the computer is offline.  To my mind this is better than a game that insists on being online all the time.\n\nCodename Panzers is a great series of tactical RTSs with the focus on action rather than base building.    "Cold War" introduced some elements of reinforcements (similar to Ground Control/World in Conflict) but the main focus remains on tactical action.  The graphics are good (for a 2009 game) and I enjoyed it as a slightly more relaxed alternative to Company of Heroes or Men of War.   Unfortunately the game was largely overlooked on release (as per another Atari classic RTS, Act of War) and recieved little suppport.  It's good to see that this game is now getting some developer support - and well worth picking up , especially if on sale.","April 2, 2014","true","6.0"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","31","38","0","2"

As you would expect from the name a lot of your units are armoured vehicals be they Tanks, APCS etc etc. Infanty play a part but mostly you are going to be using the Armour as a lance to the enemy.\nIt ran very well on my rig (window 10) and only once in the final mission when all hell was breaking loose did I have an issue with textures not loading quickly ( took about 3 seconds to load up the tanks skins).\nThey have removed the anti-cheat software so the negative reviews about that can be ignored.\nStory wise it was a bit generic and certainly no where as engaging as the first two games. A lot of the ingame converations take place as text by the side while you play meaning you do lose a lot of the plot.\n\nIts rather old so price wise I would not recomend it at the £15 mark...not nowadays. ( Although back in the day :D....I did buy it for £25 when it first came out.) If you see it for £7.99 or less thou?

If you played RTS before, 'easy' is too easy.\nMost difficult battle is not suprisingly the last mission.\n\nStory line (6/10) :\nYou will tackle 18 missions which are linked with each other.\nSome have an intro and/or outro cutscene, some don't.\nCutscenes can not match with those of the C&C serie (for example).\nLooks a bit amateuristic which has it's charm though.\nWestern world is pushing back the commies (USSR and China) and kicking them out\nof Europe. Sorry, for spoiling the plot.\nYou will play both sides in the single player campagain.\n\nMission objectives :\nEach map comes of course with several mission objectives.\nThe primary objective is to finish the mission.\nThe secondary objectives are optional but can you give an asset during the battle.\nThere are secret objectives which you can discover, for this you need to examine the entire\nmap (find an empty Russian tank which you can use, using a tunnel, destroy a boat).\nObjectives (except the secret ones) are displayed on the left side of the screen sometimes with additional commments of your commanders. It's not the best way to do so as you can oversee it.\nI paused the game and verified the message log from time to time\n\nMedals :\nFor completion of a mission you will get a bronze, silver or gold medal award.\nBased on which credits is not explained in the manual.\nEven after finishing the game, i do not have a clue on what it is based upon.\nIs it time related + doing all side and secret missions + not losing any unit ?\nNot really, something else, who will tell......\n\nGraphics (8/10) :\nEven today, it is still standing, detailed units, nice explosions, collapsing buildings.\nLooks fine to me and not outdated.\n\nAI (7/10) :\nSelecting a bunch of units and ordering them to move to another area can sometimes\nbe complicated. Armor units are turning from left to right and back again before\nthey move. Can happen that the units are blocking each other and do not move.\nEnemy is not too cunning therefore as said before, choose the hard level.\nMost events and attacks are scripted.\n\nSound (6/10) : the same fanfare (trumpets - horns) sound over and over again.\nUnits produces the standard text lines like yes sir.\nExplosions, gun fire and other environment noises are okay.\n\nBugs : Not encountered\n\nTo play or not to play :\nPfff, Cold War is not a must play nor it is boring.\nI found the first two games innovative during their release.\nCold War is more of the same. If you have time and game is on sale, buy it.\n\nI love the smell of Panzers in the morning\n\nPC gamer, started gaming in the 80's with machine hall games (galaxy, pac-man, gum shoe),\nAtari console (River Raid,...), Commodore 64 (Decathlon, Commando,...), Amiga 500 and finally PC (Myst, 7th Guest, Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, C&C....) and clock is still ticking :=P","April 13","true","35.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However being immersed is a big part of a video game for me and the mixture of very little cutscenes and backstory ammatuer voice acting and a very generic main character screaming about america and freedom made the game feel a bit silly. As gameplay wise I'm coming off of the COH franchise so my expectations are rather high. At the start of the game you're dumped with this blob of units than will run around the city wiping out whatever it wants while never losing a man. The sqauds themselves seemed difficult to distinguish and micro manage and there seemed to be very little benefit to cover when you could run your men in as a death ball wiping out tanks ect. I thinkt he straw that broke the camels back was when an american tank commander comes over the hill in his lightly armoured M41 Bulldogs, surveys a large force of heavier russian armour resupllying in a city and crudely yells "CHARGE!" as no more than 3 tanks charge into a russian armoured collumn. In short gameplays not awful but bit scratchy, voice acting and story's pretty poor, worth the buy just not at the price it is.","January 5","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I do not recommend it at all. 3/10.\n\nBad:\n\n1: Internet Connection.   Why would a game that requires a connection to a server have its servers shut off. Then not have the simple piece of code that requires the connection be removed or patched. Atari's answer: disconnect from the internet to play. Well Atari i should ♥♥♥♥ing have to you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\nBetter fix: block it form the internet with windows firewall - just in case you were wondering.\n\n2: Camera controls.  Poor at best, zoom levels are awful compared to other games. But even if you do not compare it to other games the fact that the units are so big and you cant zoom out enough to make you life nice and easy. And really don't get me started on the pan and rotation. Its slugish, poor and overall like trying to look around with a broken neck.\n\n3: Resolution.  This game i fell wasn't made for higher resolutions above 720p which for me is just unacceptable. I know not every game will be made for huge res but i at least expect 1080p And it probably says it supports this res but i'm not feeling it.

While it does do some interesting things, it somehow manages to look worse than the other two when zoomed in. The effects do the job, but the infantry models really needed work.\n\nLack of unit variety, and what units there are completely don't make sense in the setting (It's 1949, so naturally tanks, aircraft, and infantry units from the late 1950s and early 1960s form the backbone while more reasonable vehicles are regulated to cameo appearances). Lack of information as well - instead of being told how much damage/armor a unit has, you get an "attractive" green bar that just tells you roughly how beat up it is.\n\nWindowed mode doesn't work, and the multiplayer backend hasn't been updated like the other Codename Panzers games either. Doesn't play well with alt-tab and it seems some of the shaders don't work properly on Windows 10 since I remember it running better before I upgraded from 7.\n\nIt's pretty easy to tell this was a game hacked together halfway through development since Stormregion actually was closed down (along with 10tacle, their publisher) about halfway through development.

The third entry in a realistic RTS series, it's absolutely filled with inaccuracies - supposed to take place in 1948, it includes tech ranging from 1940 to 1970. It dismantled the fantastic headquarters system of the previous Codename Panzers games in order to introduce a Starcraft-like resource control system on the maps, which makes it seem like a cheap copy of every other RTS game on the market rather than the more unique games that its predecessors had been. Speaking of cheap, the game was obviously made on a shoestring budget, as there's no audio for in-mission dialogue (a step backwards for the series,) little music, and what voice acting they do use is absurdly bad.\n\nThen there's the story, which is so ridiculous that it becomes more painful to watch the longer you play. John Dillinger is *for real* a main character, having faked his death to defect to the USSR, and he flips wildly between his gangster and comrade personalities. The ending of the plot doesn't make any sense, partly because it's hastily wrapped up in a sequence so rushed that it feels more like an insult than a reward.","April 29","false","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
