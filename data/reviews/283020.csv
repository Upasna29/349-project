Starting September 1 1939 the game allows players to control the Germans, Polish or the Russian forces. Players have 122 turns (each representing one day) to either conquer Poland or hold against the invaders. Each of the three factions has its own victory conditions:\nGerman: Defeat Poland and Peace with/or defeat Russia\nPoland: Hold against the Germans\nRussia Defeat of Poland and Peace with Russia\n\n(NOTE the following has been fixed by the developers and custom games are now working)\nThere also appears to be the option of playing a custom game. Which gives the player the ability to decide which of the 10 countries they control and to set difficulty levels for each.  NOTE I have not gotten this option to work, getting a scenario is not compatible error. But it makes no real difference since most of the other countries play little role in the game\n\nWhile I like the game it is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. The biggest concern is lack of manual or tutorial; (NOTE THERE IS A MANUAL IN THE GAMES INSTALL FOLDER)  why the developers did not include even a short description of some of the mechanics for the game is beyond me. Luckily for those who (like myself) have played other Wasteland games the basics are easy to get. of course I still have no idea the effects of HQs and supply depots\n\nGame play\nThe game takes place on a huge (141 x 133) hex map. Players are also greeted with a large number of units; one example can be seen in the German army starting with 178 infantry regiments. With such a huge map and so many units it is a bit over whelming. And this is where I think the game is turning a lot of people off.\n\nI personally like the game but it clearly is not for everyone. You go into this game with the knowledge that you got to have a plan. Now that can be said for any game of this type but Fall Weiss takes it to a whole new level. A good part of the game is about encircling your enemies and to do this you got to know what troops you are planning to head in each direction. Without the ability to buy new units (only re-enforce losses from starting units) planning becomes all that more important.\n\nYou got to plan your breakthroughs, decide which units will go through the gaps and where they will hook up with others units (from other gaps) to encircle and cut off the enemy supplies. I am not going to lie and say it is all fun and easy but it can be rewarding to see your plans come together\n\nCONS\nNo tutorial or manual\nUPDATE: ANother player pointed out there is a manual in the games folding. It gives a little information on the use of HQs and suooly\n\nIf you play as Russia you spend the first 17 turns watching the Germans and the Polish fight while you wait to be allowed to cross the border\n\nPros\nget to play all three sides. Of course there is probably little possibility of the Poles winning\ndeveloper talking about mod support\n\nIs it worth it\nThat depends, if you do not want to try your luck at planning the battles of an entire theater of operations I say walk away now. I believe the German campaign will take around 6 hours, let's assume the Poles and Russians take four hours each; that is 14 hours of game play. Not mentioning the changing some settings like French attacking in the west. In the terms of game play time it is worth the $20 dollars\n\nFor those who may already own Panzer Corps and its DLC, feel this games a little too deep or looking for a bit more, I would suggest waiting till it goes on sale.","June 2, 2014","true","7.4"," 74 of 89 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","74","89","0","5"

Unfortunately, Fall Weiss, has a problem, a very big problem. It loves to crash on loadup. Checked the forums and apparently a lot of people have the same problem. Now, I get that some games have bugs. I love Fallout 3 and New Vegas and they are both bugged to hell. Fall Weiss, isn't a name brand the way fallout is, so we expect it to have less issues, especially when it comes to actually loading the game.  Wastelands Interactive, who put out the title, apparently hasn't bothered to submit a hotfix to resolve this issue. After almost an hour of trying tinkering and changing settings, sifting through forums, I decided this game just isn't worth the hassle. So, for the first time ever, It gets a thumbs down, simply for being a bugged out game that doesn't want to load.","May 26, 2015","false","2.9"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","33","41","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/283020/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Campaign Series: Fall Weiss is the first game from what can hopefully become a series of detailed wargames spanning all the important campaigns of WW2. Fall Weiss depicts German invasion of Poland in 1939, it is not the first game to do so, but it does stand out from the others in a few respects. Generally this conflict is seen as having two sides – Germany and Poland. Most games do not depict Soviet Union's involvement in it.Fall Weiss includes Soviet Union as one of the major players. This is a bit ahistorical, but offers very interesting possibilities. But you can even go beyond that, Fall Weiss uses the same engine as other Wasteland Interactive WW2 games, and here too you can go into advanced options. For example any country found on the map is playable.The game itself is played out on a very detailed map, while most of the action takes place on the territory of Poland it does span enough area in all the other directions to give place for unexpected developments.At first glance the game may seem similar to Panzer General and its descendants, and if you are thinking of the ease of play – yes it does. But contrary to Panzer General, units can work together and this makes a huge difference. By clicking on the target and then clicking on units around you select which units will take part in combat.The game does one original and both brilliant and terrible thing. Instead of displaying the strength of a unit as a number that shows the number of people/equipment, it displays its effective strength. So you do not have to take into account the technology, command bonuses etc. What you see is the final number, the effective strength. That's brilliant, but at the same time it can be confusing at times. So this system has both its pros and cons. The scale of the game means you have under your control hundreds of units conducting few separate smaller operations, so it is a true wargame that requires some thinking. Still, playing as Germany you really can't lose. Personally I find this game the best of all WI games so far.","November 9, 2014","true","32.2"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","0"

Think size 6 font for typical fonts in typical word docs.\n\nGerman units (ostensibly, as name suggests, and also bc it is a Panzer General ripoff, most of the game is designed around playing as the germans) are nearly invisible on the map.

Then you get wrecked from every direction and then you rage quit back to your little kiddy call of duty.\n\nThis game isn't a joke, this game isn't a fast paced game. It's a hardcore armchair general turn-based slow-paced strategy game. You take control of either Poland, Germany(Then called the Nazis, or, in aircraft terms, Jerries), or Russia (Then called the Soviet Union).  You can take control of many other nations in custom gamdemode, but they're near useless unless you mod the game, and believe me.. modding this game is unbelievably easy, finally something easy about this game. >:D. If you like really hard games, or relaxing games that make your brain think, then get it. But beware, it's a major armchair-general styled game for you to complete a campaign it's 122 days, with one turn a day. Each turn you'll be spending some 10-15 minutes. (sometimes 30 or more even) So for $25 you're going to get a lottttt of hours played. And if you mod it... even longer. Beware, playing Poland your goal isn't to beat the Axis, that'd be like Britain taking on Russia, your goal is to hold the germans off for longer than historically, say, two weeks or so longer. Germany is a more relaxing gameplay, but it's still very challenging (The AI is hella good), if you play Russia, you have to wait 17 turns (verrryyy longgg) before you can even attack poland, though, I've heard you can declare war on Lithuania and fight them in the meantime.Wasteland Interactive has been out for a couple years roaming Desura and finally each of their tactical turn-based games got greenlit. So go check out: Time of Wrath, Strategic War in Europe, and of course this game. They have a couple more on steam but they're pacific theatre so I don't have them. They're all amazingly good, especially if you like this one.\n\nNOTE: As of 8/9/2014/ you can buy the game on Groupees for $1 (though you have to choose two games so it's $1.50)\nGet it here: https://groupees.com/babmb/\n\nNow,\nPros:\nAmazing challenges\nSteam achievements\nEmotes (?)\nTrading Cards\nSteam achievements are hard as hell\nThe graphical/art style is really catchy, fits the mood perfectly\nHistorically accurate units with historical pictures\nCustom games, french invasion, change history, etc.\nAmazing AI\nIndie developer (more community based)\nThere has been talk that workshop support is coming, which all other Wasteland games have!\nJust an overall great game\n\nCons:\nLarge frame drops around 40 minutes to and hour long. You can restart it or just wait (they usually end in 1-2 minutes)\nDevelopers get pretty political on the forums (though they are really nice guys, I've spoke to them before)\nIf you play the Soviet Union you have to wait 17 long turns before getting any action\nYou can't choose to automatically fast forward the enemies turns, you have to wait and watch for aprox. 5 minutes, which gets devistatingly boring, which is another downside to playing the soviet union, or the other neutral nations.\nThe code is mostly in Polish (devs are polish) so it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ for me to edit code because I'm Lithuanian.\n\n\nIf you like this type of game, then welcome to the new Panzer General. I've been suggesting Forest Brothers for the next "campaign series" game. (check their forums to read the suggestion)\n\nGet the game, $25 is 100% worth it if you're into this kind of games.\n\n\n\n","August 9, 2014","true","9.0"," 26 of 50 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","26","50","0","0"

That in and of itself is not a criticism, but I finally sat down today to really take a full collective processing of this game to decide wether it be worth my time. I've come away a bit more wise for my struggles. For all its overwhelming scales and options, it's more or less a classic hexagonal strategy game, albeit with a lot of bizzare, unpolished choices mixed in. It's also an incomprehensive mess. Also trash. Here goes.\n\nThe first time I booted FW up, I was stunned and confused, not entirely sure what was going on or what I was doing as the AI took its sweet time slaughtering my units.  If there is a fast forward button, I couldn't find it. This continual, sluggish bombardment coupled with absolutely no context or control made me back out quickly. I exited to desktop so quickly, in fact that my haste led to Weiss locking up my entire computer leading to an intense struggle for control in which I learned to not play this in fullscreen for future reference. That was the most thrilling experience I will ever have with this game.\n\nDaunted but not defeated, I took some time away to arm myself before the war. Coming back with a knowledge that a single campaign can last upwards of 10 hours depending on your faction and settings, I settled in for the long haul, and for the first turn I really got into the whole thing. Yeah, I'll admit, I could've used just a most infinitely basic tutorial, or even a bit of context outside of a lame quote from the past, but beggars can't be choosers. Yeah, couldn't really understand why my panzers were taking more damage from infantrymen than against other tanks on a completely flat plain, or why oh why were so many unit names overlapping. Is that a photoshop of a Model T Ford? How big is this map? Is Fall Weiss really just a massive scale garbage looking and sounding Advance Wars?\n\nOh, it crashed again.\n\nOh, it didn't save anything.\n\nOh.\n\nAnd that's how I came to write this review. After reading through so many on both sides, I've come to really like the idea, it's just a shame FW fails on such a basic level. I want to like it, I want to get into it, but Fall Weiss fails to live up to any expectations it places and genuinely, wholeheartedly does not care if you play it or not. I've never played a game that felt so bored with itself. Also, just found out that there is one campaign map. One. 15 dollars, man.\n\nWhat might've had potential when it first came out 2 years ago, Weiss...sure doesn't anymore. If you're looking to get in to the armchair general genre of PC strategy, pass this one at ALL COSTS. There are plenty of superior titles, and really, this game isn't worth anyone's time. Go for Panzer General or the Front series from Talonsoft as some of the other reviewers suggested. I know I will.","March 21","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
