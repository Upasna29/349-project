Most popular are 1 vs 1 fighting mods (named after martial arts: aikido, wushu, judo etc), where you win either by disqualifying your enemy (e.g. pushing him outside the mat) or earning more points (attacking enemy vitals, or head). But that's not all, possibilities never end, you can also play mods like parkour, climbing, football and cooperate with your friend! You can even create your own mod!\n\nThe game has quite high learning curve but when you get the hang of it you want to master it and you cant stop! Toribash is one of the games I play for many years already and cant simply stop. Once uninstalled, comes back like boomerang.

I think that I should head back into my home and wait until it goes away.\n\n1 Year, 3 Months: About 20 feet in front of me, stands my opponent, sword and shield in hand, He holds his sword above his head and his shield in front of him and charges.

Opponent fell, I won.\n11/10.  Would flop again\n\nVery original yes?\n\nNow Seriously\n\nThis is a fantastic and very original game\n\nToribash is not your average fighter, most certainly not.  You have to move yourself limb by limb over a series of turns to be able to execute the move you want to do.  It's very difficult to be able to do really cool moves, I'm not even close to that skill.  Don't let that turn you off though.  It's easy enough to get the hang of and by playing more and more you will learn of course.  Plus, there are belt (rank) restrictions on certain servers so you'll always be playing with people of similar skill no matter how well you do.  It's much easier to learn that way.  You could also create a server for just your friends and play around together!   There are what seems to be hundreds of mods so even if you do manage to get bored of something, just start up a server with a different mod on it and there you go!\n\nI only started playing this when it came out on steam and don't have terribly many hours of game time at the moment, but I'm certain I'll be playing this a lot.  It really is a phenominal and unique game.  If you're looking for something to keep you occupied, something challenging, something rewarding, and most of all something insanely fun, PLAY THIS GAME.

The game is played by relaxing, holding, extending, or contracting  the various joints on the player's character and hitting the spacebar to advance time by a user-specified amount. When properly manipulated, one ragdoll will strike the other, and if enough damage is inflicted with a single blow, a limb or body part may be dismembered, or fractured.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Charybdiz/recommended/248570/","Charybdiz","Demisin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Charybdiz/","112 products in account","Been playing this game for around 5 years now, joined late 09 and have played it ever since, with breaks of course. When it comes to gameplay it's amazing, not much to say about singleplayer, you're able to maul the "antagonist" in the game "Uke". He stands still of course, but it's fun nontheless, kick his balls, rip off a leg or his had, throw your own bodyparts at him etc.\n\nMultiplayer is the real deal, compete against other players from all over the planet and get higher ranking, duel, bet or just have fun with friends in a private room. This game is really fun, but quite advanced and difficult to learn at first! Give it a week of try&fail, you'll learn! I quit because I thought it sucked, but it totally doesn't if you learn the basics and from other players! Watch replays, improvise and have a great time.\n\nPros:\n* The game is cool and original\n* There's a lot of players, never empty rooms\n* EXTREME customization options, all you need is Toricredits and you can have people make you textures or make your own. Recently added is the 3D accessories, hair-styles, shutter shades, football helmets etc.\n* Complete sandbox, do whatever the hell you want, dance, fight, slaughter, anything is possible!\n* A awesome forum full of tutorials and helpful members! (www.forum.toribash.com) Just take a look, introduce yourself in the beginners sanctuary and read the rules!\n* Adjustable graphic settings for low or high tier computers, ray-tracing, shadows, atmospheres, custom sounds, different BG's etc\n* Achievement systems, belts (white belt, yellow, orange, blue, brown, black etc.) decided by QI (Games played)\n\nCons:\n* The controls are very complicated for starters, take your time and learn how each and single joint works! Don't quit.\n* Toricredits might be difficult to earn at first, prices seem SKYHIGH, but if you get your ♥♥♥♥ together and start marketing, texturing or get really good in-game for duels or betting it's quite easy-earned. DON'T BEG for toricreds, that's frowned upon.\n* Some scammers, un-fair players and ragequitters are always around, some use easy-win moves or run away, don't get mad, just ignore and get better! If you're scammed that can be reported at the forums!\n* Sounds, some of the sounds in the game like the music are quite dull and repetetive, that's why it's good to have your own music in the back or custom sound!\n* Some people suffer lag because of bad internet and can make your character freeze (For a while, until the other guy is logged out)\n* Sometimes servers "ghost" and disappear, Game master tourneys uses to suffer from this (Temporary problem, might already be fixed)\n* Items are activated via the torishop, not in-game inventories. (forum.toribash.com/tori.php)\n\n~Fenris, art moderator and graphic designer (hobby and soon2be trade), see you at the forums or in-game!

If you are reading this, you have clearly found yourself upon the interesting game called 'Toribash'. (Before I state any more, pardon my keyboard! My grammer is great, but I cannot say so about the keyboard!), I shall simply explain the pros and cons to it, and if what I beleive might sway your decision, I am satisfied ( :D )!\n\nFirst we must put this game in retrospect and look at the optimistic view. I shall now list the pros.\n\nPros;\n* Great graphics\n* Runs smoothly for laptops with RAM and extra disk space\n* Only 272 Megabits (Extremely miniscule amount!)\n* Physics compare to real life scenarious\n* Has multiple tutorials\n* Has Multiplayer\n* Runs with multiple languages\n* Computer bots\n* Custumizable Avatars\n* Mod content\n* Texture Packs\n*  Innovative designing\n* Creative Idea\n* Thousands of guides\n* Youtube videos (more guides!)\n* Simple design\n* FREE TO PLAY! (Got to love money XD )\n\nThere sure are alot of positive things! But, alas, there usually is some sort of demise to games. Now I shall list my personal cons.\n\nCons;\n* (Alledgedly) Bugs\n* (Alledgedly) Lags out with crappy computers\n* (Alledgedly) Tutorial might be confusing and doesn't explain\n* (Alledgedly) A lack of background might confuse or bore some\n* (Alledgedly) Community can be very unfrienldy\n* (Alledgedly) Long wait times for servers\n* (Alledgedly) Tutorial doesn't explain\n* (Alledgedly) No content available\n* (Alledgedly) Overpriced customizables\n* (Alledgedly) Boring Graphics.\n\n(All of the cons were said by users, but I have had none of these issues or complaints correlating to the subject).\n\nHonestly, I rate this game 9/10 because it still has to iron out alledged bugs, but it is extremely unique and has amazing graphics. It takes up little space, runs on modern computers and allows for mod content AND the creation of it. Multiple languages are provided, along with user customizable charecters, backgrounds, textures, sound files, etc. Thank you for sparing your time to consider this work of coding genius and it is all free!\n\nHave anything you want to add?

All the negative reviews you see are from people who don't have very long attention spans.\nThis game has a high learning curve. By high I mean it's *very* hard to get good at it unless you spend a lot of time into this game.  You need to play at least 100 - 200~ hours to get a basic understanding of the joints and how they interact with each other to make moves.\nIf you want to start doing the stuff that you saw in the video (they're called madmans, by the way) right away, let me tell you this.\nYou can't.\nYep. I've played this game for 600+ hours and I've only gotten 1 madman. And it's not even that good!\nBut most players don't realize that there is a forum for this game. The forums is where the actual community lies.\nI've got many of my friends to download and play this game (I had to nag them so much) but they just didn't find it interesting.\nMost players only play it for the lols. And that's not a bad thing.\nThe bad thing is that players expect this game to be easy. And when they are surprised by how hard it is to even make your character do a punch, they just quit.\nNow let me state the pros and cons of this game.\n\nPros:A lot of replayability.\nEntertaining, funny at some moments.\nHas multiplayer, so, you can practically play it forever until the community or the game dies out.\nDoesn't require a high end PC to run it\nIt's free to play.\nA darn lot of gamemodes to choose from.\n\nCons:High learning curve.\nThe graphics are bad.\nRequires a lot of dedication and hard work to make a good replay.\nFrustrating.\n\nNeutral:\nSmall, but tightly knit community.\n\nSo that's my review for Waste your life and time with ragdolls simulator.\n\nTLDR\nDon't play if you have a short attention and are serious to get good at it.\nPlay it if you are willing to play for fun.\nPlay it if you are willing to dedicate your time to get good at it.\nAll in all, 7.5/10 for this game.\n","January 19","true","951.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/recommended/248570/","YouthOfFreedom","+ Youth Of Freedom +","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/","42 products in account","GAMEPLAY : 10/10\n\nToribash is a fighthing game mix in with some simulation controls and it execute extremely well.\n\nAs you starts off the game,you are present to a tutorial on how each parts of the body work.\n\nYou can extend,relax & contract for each part of the body and it will do certain moves depending on the body part you wish to moves.\n\nYou can perform all types of moves like summersault,hipflip,uppercut,a kick to the knee,body,head and many well-made moves you can create.\n\nFirst time player would have hard time learning the gameplay mechanic since Toribash were introduced to have a very complex fighthing mechanic which we never seen in any fighthing game before.\n\nThe game provide a in-game shop where you can buy bunch of effects,skins & colour. All these can bought by using the in-game currency which you can earn by winning numerous matches in online matches.\n\nLet explain the online matches . You can set different type of rules. Players are given at least 15-30 seconds to acts depending on the timer sets. After that,an action will perform and it will last 15-30 seconds too ( it counts very fast ) and it will pause for you to acts in your next step.\n\nGRAPHICS : 7/10\n\nYou can change too many different type of background through the settings and it a great addition if you don't like plain white background.\n\nThe characters is made by a bunch of balls ( mainly because it easier to tell which part of the body ).\n\nThe decapitation and gore is a nice touch as well as the blood texture.\n\nAUDIO : 7/10\n\nAs you play through a lot of matches,random soundtrack will play it. Though some may find the soundtrack a bit weird ( since the music is a bit random ),it actually appealing to hear.\n\nThe sound effects when you hit your opponents and the blood squemish is not bad.\n\nYour character doesn't have voice and only will grunt & scream.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 10/10\n\nYou will never get bored with this game because of how well the gameplay mechanics are executed.\n\nIt even more addicting if you play it with online people where you can see what kinds of skills they can perform.\n\nNot to mentioned,there is a bunch of mods for you to messed around as well as bots you can face against to test and improves you skills.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 8.5/10\n\nToribash shines extremely well in the gameplay mechanics.\n\nNo other fighthing game try what Toribash did and it refreshing to see something new in the fighthing genre.\n\nThere is no pay 2 win features at all.\n\nThe game require a lot of strategy and thinking too.\n\nGive it a try though since it doesn't require much of your free space.\n\nGRADE : B ( Great )","May 19, 2014","true","1.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","5"

Toribash has been out for quite a while but I never had played it untill it released on steam. Overall I think that the game is extremely simple, at least in theory. You will find yourself needing a lot of practice in the order and timing of the joints you want to manipulate, so in simple terms the game is easy to learn but hard to master. Toribash is free on (and off) steam so if you want to try it out ( your reading reviews so you at least have some passing interest in the game) I think that you should go for it, try it a while. In the end no one will hold it against you for deciding NOT to play.

Wanted to pin someone to the floor with nothing but brute force? Or did you ever want to gracefully pluck your opponents' head off their shoulders before splitting apart the rest of them with one kick? Ok maybe not the last one, but if this sounds interesting you're definitely gonna love this game. Now seriously I have never loved gore fighters. Wrestling was more of an afterthought than anything else. But there is a certain thrill you get when you're able to do a backflip and kick your opponent's arms off. This game combines the freedom of ragdoll stick figures and mortal combat in a really amazing turn-based but rapid action masterpiece.\n\nI first heard of this game about a year ago and I was interested then, but my machine at the time couldn't run it. But I got a new one and when it came out on Steam I quickly checked it out to see what would happen. The small download size was really great as I didn't want to wait long. My first experience in the tutorial made me feel almost helpless as my character seemed to have so many parts and possible actions I didn't know how I could remember all this. The fact that it was turn-based made it seem quite complex. Fast forward 1 day later and I was a Green Belt. After looking at a few moves online and trying them out, I found a couple easy to do, easy-to-remember moves which brought me success in my games.\n\nThis game is really hilarious. I mean 'drop down dead laughing' hilarious. In low belt ranks, people who don't know how to control their characters leads to one hell of a ridiculous experience which has everyone wishing for more. The wait in large lobbies can be a little tiring but most of the time I'm enjoying watching others play and I can learn from them. The wait is also great for the moments when you wanna take a bathroom break or try to memorize a new technique online.\n\nWhat makes this game stand out to me are the mods that are currently avaliable for it. Right now I can't count the number of mods that are in the list and I've only tested about twenty now. From sword-fighting to pool diving to racing, this game has it all! I could not believe my eyes when I found myself in something like a drag racer that raced down the map into the oncoming wall. Needless to say I had a very good laugh.\n\nAlready my review is really long, so I'll say this last. Download the game. Play it for even a day or two. You won't regret it. And it has a very good community, perfect for taking my mind off bad experiences in League of Legends.","May 21, 2014","true","21.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There is many gamemodes but for most of them, there is one objective: kill the opponent with what you are given in any way possible. I personally love this game because of how free it is. Theres no tutorials holding you back or anything telling you what to do; its all for you to figure out on your own. And with so many nice peopel on the servers and so many YouTube videos, it's nice that you have so many choices for this game. I I do think that the customization needs to be expanded and a lot of it be made free. And to perfect the zoom when you are spectating a match. Overall though, this isn't your average fighting game; its unique. And I like it.","February 7, 2015","true","11.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

NOT.\n\nThis game is so original, and wow. It's hard. REALLY HARD. But once you get the hang of it, it's awesome. Oh,  you hate fighting games because you can't do whatever you want, only punch? Not Toribash. In Toribash, you make your moves. From scratch, and you don't click: use move. You literally make your character do the move, by telling the body parts what to do. PECS, CONTRACT. That way, you will pull your arm in front of you. If you master it, you can become a master of the air, and pull people's  heads off, do flipkicks, your choice!\n\nAnd oh my, so many mods. So easy to access! No need of workshop, just go into game, setup, mods! And the best part: It doesn't even need to download the mods. Well it does, but it takes like half a second even with a 100 kb/s speed. (Experience)\n\nDon't like how it looks? Enable shaders the same way with mods!\n\nEpic game, definitely reccomend.

Admittedly, Toribash is a very hard game to master if you're new. But play a few times and you'll begin to get the hang of it. After you reached a certain level of skill, you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe Multiplayer is great fun. Not only because the gameplay is awesome and original and there are a ton of mods for more variety, but also because the community is one of the nicest ones I've seen. I'd really recommend checking out the forums.\n\nI have also spent hours upon hours in the singleplayer, creating replays. In the singleplayer you have much more controlability of your Tori.

But mind you that this is not a fast paced game. Anyway, you control each joint on the character's body to make them punch, kick, grab, jump or flip. Total control and flexibility. It takes time to actually know how to do it, but once you know how to, it's worth the time spent. Oh, and the game's free!\n\nNow for the cons.\nWhat I really don't like are the players who spam the same bloody technique over and over and over and over again. Even after some other guy had bonked him and his 'fighting form'. It gets really annoying and the fight will starts to feel rather bland. The learning curve in this game is really high. It's easier to practice by getting your ♥♥♥ kicked, and study your adversaries' moves.

If you've got some rudimentary understanding of both, this game will blow your mind!\n\nThis is a sandbox/ragdoll/fighting game based around the concept of manipulating your body to complete a goal, whether it be knocking your opponent to the ground or running through an obstacle course in an attempt to knab the best time.\n\nIt has a wide variety of settings to allow you to add variety to your matches.  You could change the mod and give one of the players a sword, while leaving the other barehanded.  You can edit the gravity settings to match the real world which is something I would recommend doing, as it allows you to relate your actions to those of the real world.\n\nIt has a varied community, some are idiotic, but on the most part you'll come across experienced players who are willing to help people who have less experience with the game.  That is something that I really love about this game, it really encourages experienced players to help out the ones with less experience.  It's rewarding for both parties.  The new player learns, and the experienced player sets the new player on the road to being an opponent.  Very interesting.\n\nTake a look if you're having doubts, it's free.  Find a player who knows what they're doing and have them teach you.","September 28, 2014","true","6.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It is super difficult to get into, but who's to say that's a bad thing? You have fun while you learn, you learn to laugh when you accidentally break off your limbs and you get the immediate satisfaction of doing something you've wanted, whether it is doing a certain grapple and turn in Aikido, or landing a corkscrew in tricking, or even finishing a three-hour spar, the possibilities are endless. Would definitely recommend this game, and best of all, it's free! No pay-to-win features, I haven't spent a single penny on this game yet, but you can support the dev team by buying items and stuff and getting some fancy forum features, to make yourself look the part. Overall, endless fun, endless possibilities and a whole lot of choice.\n\nI'm personally into tricking, parkour and sparring, I struggle too much with madmen and aikido.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pshyeah/recommended/248570/","pshyeah","A herd of fuckin' ugly reds","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pshyeah/","134 products in account","A fun game with a rather steep learning curve, Toribash is a game where the difficulty may deter people from an otherwise enjoyable physics-strategy-sandbox-fighter-thing.\nThe genre is hard to describe, incase you couldn't tell.\nIn Toribash you get your awesome Bruce Lee-esque ragdoll (called a Tori) to fight other people's ragdolls by adjusting the joints to allow it to move and perform attacks through a floaty physics engine that seems like you're fighting underwater. In theory, this could be clunky and not-fun. Toribash executes this concept really well, and while the learning curve is steep, as I said earlier, the large amount of flexibility in your moves makes up for this fact. Once you understand how the system and the different joints work, you can do practically any move with your Tori that you can imagine. Trip the opponent with one foot, then jumpkick their head off with the other foot. Grab them, toss them over your shoulder then tear their arms off with your feet. It's a lot of fun, with many different mods and gamemodes to extend it further. The only thing that is keeping this game from gaining more popularity is the learning curve, which has it on you more rough than Street Fighter 4. The game is free as well, so that means a good amount of fun for the extremely low price of $0.","June 20, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You control your character by contracting, extending, holding, and relaxing limbs. There's a tutorial but it's not much to go off of, I recommend to find another way to learn, either be self-tought in the ways of bashing your enemy or find a player who CAN teach you. The community is alive, but not thriving. The only thing I'd say I wasn't too happy about was the customization while again endless amount yet a small amount applies here too, TC isn't the easiest to obtain. You'll get 10 TC per win in a duel type match (none in free play, obviously) The main way to obtain TC is through tournaments, which usually have some good players. There are belt specific lobbies however the obvious con to that is that there's a chance a bored player will make another account and essentially smurf in White Belt lobbies and what not.

Fights take place in turns, with various rules according to the room you are currently in, such as number of frames per round.\n\nThe players have a certain amount of time to allocate their limb states (see above), and the move - or part of the move - is executed simultaniously.\n\nIt's really hard to explain - Toribash is best experienced first hand.\nDon't be put off by being confused, not knowing what the hell you are supposed to do - there is a fairly basic, but really essential tutorial build in, and you are free to pummel the non-responsive bot or even load in a script that makes him act a bit, all for training.\n\nAlso, don't be put off by entering the beginner rooms in the online modes - Toribash has, oddly enough for such a competetive game, one of the most laid-back and friendly communities you will ever encounter.\nI can't stress this point enough - as a veteran of quite some online games, I have never, ever had so much fun with random people.\n\nOf course, the segregation of different "status" rooms helps, and works fairly well, so that newbies are posed against newbies and so on, but a surprising number of veterans  are more than happy to provide private training sessions or give general tips.\n\nAs a low-level player (indicated primarily by the classic martial arts belts), you are free to enter any room you like - On the other hand, the higher ranks you achieve, the more lower-level rooms become locked to you. This works as a deterrent to high-levels farming newbies, and it works surprisingly well.\n\nAlso, you have the ability to create private rooms and be invited to these, further there are tournaments where you can bet in-game currency on the fighters, and so on.\n\nYou don't even have to fight - enter a room and observe, going into spectator mode. Chat with the other fighters waiting for their turn, comment the action on-screen, and generally have a good time.\n\nYes, it somehow works like a chatroom, where you can watch the fights or just goof off.\n\nToribash is also highly moddable, with countless mods already built in for fun and a change of pace. Everything you can imagine that would be fun to do with a man made of spheres, it's probably already in there. Skateboarding, parcouring, wallclimbing, swordfighting, you name it.\n\nSo how does this game stay in buisness?\nBy selling cosmetics.\n\nThat said, most things you might want to set yourself apart can be obtained by playing the game, although some items require serious grinding to collect the in-game currency for.\nStill, working for that cool force after-image color you really set your mind on is both a rewarding experience and a good motivator.\nAdditionally, you can sift through the marketplace and buy other people's redundant or out-dated colors etc. for usually less in-game currency than buying new ones.\nPlus, there are lots of different price-classes, so you can start modifying your look pretty early on with a selection of the available colors.\n\nAnd what you can modify!\nEverything from body gradients to the "DQ Ring" that sparks up when you are disqualified, from force after-image colors to head textures you can then create yourself and upload for that really unique fighter look.\n\nHowever, nothing of the above is needed to fully enjoy the game, paying real life money is purely optional and "Wallet Warriors" do not have any kind of advantage over regular/free players.\nNone whatsoever.\n\nPay what you want to support this great gem of a game, or nothing at all.\n\nI have played Toribash on/off for years, and it seems to be one of those timeless diamonds I keep getting drawn back to.\n\nTL:DR and conlcusion:\nGive it a try - It's pretty small, completely free, and once you grasp the concept, it won't let you go again.","November 29, 2014","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is extremely complicated and takes a while to get used to. So unless you are willing to invest a large amount of your time in this I would leave it alone.\n\nStarting to play this game I would start clicking on random body parts trying to kick the other guy in the face and eventually fall over onto the floor and flop around trying to get back up until I get disqualified because something other than my limbs brushed the floor like I was playing 'the floor is lava'. After I got the hang of it (to a degree) I started to pull of some cool moves and I did have a bit of fun with it. Even if I still kept falling over onto the floor.\n\nI also tried it out with my friends, which I have to say was a lot of fun. Most of the games ended up with us both on the floor swinging random body parts around in an attempt to hit eachother while trying not to get disqualified until it ended up like the least interesting game of twister ever. But in the end we had a good laugh.\n\nThere are also a lot of mods (and I mean a lot) for this game, that can change it completely and make the game a bit more interesting. I won't go too much in detail about that though as there are too many mods to write a review on.\n\nThis game is definately worth picking up especially for the fact that is free, it's definately a unique experience for the fighting genre and it equals for a good laugh with friends.\n\n8/10 :)","June 23, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Most of the game is you control your Tori, customizing him/her to whatever feels right for you. The commmunity is very kind and helpful, I found myslef digging in the forums for hours looking through challenges and overall topics about our sociaty. This game difinitely makes you feel as if you have full control over your Tori... And you do!\n\nThings I would love to see changed:\nSo the thing I found most upsetting is that the money system in Toribash is somewhat difficult. You'd have to spend hours or even weeks just to get enough for that expensive item you've been saving up for, You only get 10TC per win and 500TC or 1000TC during tournaments. Half the good items in Toribash are way to exspensive. I found myself spending actually money just to make my Tori look original. I would like to see the costs of Items go down or the amount of TC you earn go up.\n\nOverall. this game is difinitely my favourite game. I've spent over 1000 hours on this game. Half on steam and the other on the downloadable website version. As said before 10/10.","September 3, 2015","true","603.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I first started out about a year ago I felt like a toddler learning to walk, and I admit, it was a bit frustrating. Then I turned to Youtube. I learned a few basic aikido and judo (two different mods/game modes in the game) opening moves and from there my results sky-rocketted. I was flooring noobs left and right until I got to the intermediate level where (most) every player had a rudimentary understanding of how to move in the game then it was fairly evenly matched and I quickly got over myself.\nHere's some things that are just excellent about the game:\n-- IT'S FREE. TRY IT.\n-- The graphics are so simplistic it could run on a computer from the 90's, but at the same time it doesn't look bad, and when you use shaders it looks quite nice. (My opinion, of course)\n-- The game is utterly unique, you'll never play anything like it.\n-- The game can be quite dramatic and/or comical when you watch people who actually know how to play do what they do. Think of it like the WWE, just not scripted.\n-- You have nearly complete conrol of your character, which could be a bit overwhelming, but once you understand the functions of the joints you will come to enjoy it as well.\n-- The community is very tightly-knit. You seldom come across a player you just can't get along with.\n-- Being good in this game is not matter of higher level, better quipment or any of that junk. Being good in this game comes down to one factor. Skill.\n-- There are tons of events to take part in.\n\nNow, to be fair, here are some things that kind of suck about the game.\n-- Store items are a bit expensive, and it's a bit difficult to earn money. That being said you don't have to pay real money for most of the store items, and they're really just accessories.\n-- The community is small compared to other games. This is the consequence of the tightly-knit community I mentioned earlier.\n-- I said earlier how skill is the deciding factor of this game, but it can also be considered a bad thing as you have to fumble around a bit to get the hang of the game, which can be frustrating if you're the impatient type like myself.\n-- Very little will change about this game, I expect. This can be a good thing, as some games change "too much" and become ruined, but I expect this game won't change enough, as it has been roughly the same for about 10 years.","May 31","true","301.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BinarySpike/recommended/248570/","BinarySpike","BinarySpike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BinarySpike/","370 products in account","I've been playing Toribash since 2010. I have non-Qi void relax, custom head texture, and some other neat things. I have 2 black-belt accounts and a crazy library of replays. This is one of the few games I feel like I have natural talent. Making it one of my favorites.\n\nHowever, I cannot recommend this game. These are the reasons why. (Underlined content has been edited April 10th, 2016)\n\n1.  Players are queued on a server. This means the more players join, the more you have to wait your turn. This negatively affects loser and rewards winners because they "stay warm" and can easily bash people who have been afk for 3-5 games while you've won each one. I would much prefer a lobby where all players play simultaneously and then when you win or lose you spectate the remaining players till everyone has played, then you rotate.  A commenter stated that a new "matchmaking" was implemented.  This is the same old matchmaking with a new (confusing) UI.  At my skill level, most people rage quit after the first game.\n\n2. Lag affects your ability to "ready up" and sometimes angrily hitting spacebar can ready your next turn too! Not only that, if you join in the middle of a game, it doesn't catch you up, it shows ragdolls flopping around in a half-initialized state. This gets annoying when you join and the room goes "DID YOU SEE THAT!?" and all you see are ragdolls flopping around.  Update: Ragdoll states are initialized after the first turn.  However, moves made before you join are still not synced, thus you get the flopping around.  For a text-based protocol on a turn-based game, there simply shouldn't be lag\n\n3. In multiple interactions I've had with the devs, concerning real money, their customer support was terrible.\n\nServer stability seems to be better since the old days and steam release.","November 2, 2014","false","1.4"," 82 of 159 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","82","159","5","11"

I am so happy it has finally. This game will be the best fighting simulator you could possibly ever play in your life. It is very detailed and takes alot of concentration. You have to use all of the muscles in your body to either pull off some amazing dance moves or you could take it to the arena and battle it out to the death with the best gore graphics. You can brake every bone in your opponent if you felt like it. The mods can go from a really intense game to becoming really funny.

The game works by manipulating multiple joints on your character's body in order to execute movements under the timer of a turn. When done properly, the character's ragdoll (known in-game as a Tori) will be able to hit and/or grab an opponent. The player is awarded with points for sucessful hits on most of the many parts of an opponent's body. Usually, a game is won when an illegal part of a Tori's body touches the ground, or when any part touches down outside the designated dojo area, or when the match timer reaches zero and the points are compared.\n\nBecause of this, the game has a nigh-infinite variety of possible fight scenarios, although most players will find that fights tend to follow some kind of pattern as the various common strategies are countered time and again. Despite its variety, the game suffers from a high entrance barrier for most newcomers. First learning how to properly manipulate your Tori and composing your first moves can be very daunting and no doubt will turn some down from the experience. Fortunately, the community is ever helpful, and many guides and tutorials are available to help newcomers overcome this first major obstacle.\n\nI very much recommend Toribash. It's a truly addicting and satisfying experience with one of the best free to play models I've ever known. The playerbase is incredibly active and frequently engages in many competitive events that award the winner with various prizes. Even if the learning process might feel somewhat frustrating, It's all worth it when you finally get into a public server ready to kick some ♥♥♥.","June 2, 2014","true","203.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

The more you play, the more you get experience and that means you gain belts so you can fight with people who are equally skilled with you! This is not obligatory though, you can still keep fighting the most known person in Toribash, Uke. Or you can just make your own server and play there with friends or whoever you want to without the need of thinking about rankings or belts.\n\nYou can also play hundreds of different mods which players have made to make the game more interesting and awesome, there are mods like aikido and judo but there's also mods where you can be involved in a car crash or even go skiing.\n\nToribash has a very nice community, it's really fun, challenging and can keep you occupied for a long time.","May 24, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has a HUGE learning curve. Until you learn to move correctly and what muscle contraction or extension makes you swing your arm around for a punch to the face, it's rather frustrating. However, It's probably the most satisfying thing I've ever experienced when I complete a move or an exaggerated manuever that lands as a flawless success. My friend and I were playing 1v1 on a custom level where you stood on a red square platform with spikes under it and slanted surfaces on the side behind us. I punched him, he grabbed me, and I flung him behind me with the same arm with which I punched him. He locked my arm while he was being launched over my head and dragged me down off the edge. At the last second, I grabbed the platform's edge and we hung there swaying. He said to me," You gotta let me go.....I'm too heavy for you to pull up." I tried contracting my elbow to haul us up but no dice. He let go of my arm so all that was holding him there was me. He then said," Do it. I'm not scared to die." As I let go and watched his character fall to the spikes he said one last fading message I'll never forget. " I've always hated you." Then he hit the spikes, and I let go too. Toribash overall is fun, it has extremely fun mechanics when you get the hang of it, and a suprising amount of unexpected role play.....","July 11, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has taken ragdoll physics gaming to a different level by making it turnbased and allowing almost infinite controll over the ragdoll (20 limbs which can each be extended, contracted, relaxed or held still individually) each turn. Saying it is the best fighting game I have ever played would also be pointles because it is one of the only fighting games I have ever played but this is not important...\n\nIt is a hard game to get the hang of and may take a lot of time if you want to get good, but if you do not want to expend so much effort then you can have just as much fun playing the weird and wacky gamemodes on multiplayer. The selection of gamemodes spans from skiing, to icehockey and even skatebording if you think you are good enough. The variety of fighting gamemodes is just as widespread and it should not just be treated as a funny and novel simulator as many indie games (I don't really like that term) which employ new and original mechanics are. I can tell you that if you put in the hours of dedication to this game it will be worth it and you are able to achieve fame in the community if you are good enough (not that I have any sort of fame).\n\nI have written too much and I can't expect any of you to read this far but if you have I thank you and would strongly urgh you to try this game and dive into the community and the forums where you can find other player's replays as well as downloading new player-made gamemodes if you ever get bored of the preinstalled collection which come as part of the game.\n\nand again, thank you for reading.","June 21, 2014","true","420.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The more you play, the more you get experience and that means you gain belts so you can fight with people who are equally skilled with you! This is not obligatory though, you can still keep fighting the most known person in Toribash, Uke. Or you can just make your own server and play there with friends or whoever you want to without the need of thinking about rankings or belts.\n\nYou can also play hundreds of different mods which players have made to make the game more interesting and awesome, there are mods like aikido and judo but there's also mods where you can be involved in a car crash or even go skiing.\n\nToribash has a very nice community, it's really fun, challenging and can keep you occupied for a long time.","May 24, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A Free-to-play early access? What kind of ♥♥♥♥ is that?), I am happy that the now finished game has finally made the jump into the Steam library.\n\nToribash's style is turn based fighting, you get your own Ragdoll- Oh sorry I mean "Tori" and attempt to sever your opponents limb from limb until one of you hits the ground or the unlikely event of time running out from one of you sitting in a tripod while the other floats away freely.\n\nIt has a high learning curve that only the most determined of players will decide to persue, at the start of the match, you and your opponent are stood in a T pose which then you are required to execute your moves with each limb, you control all of your Tori's bodyparts, so if you wanted to do a kick, you might grab them by contracting your left pec, clicking on your hand so it initiates a grip and raising your left knee to prepare to deliver an extended kick the following turn, of course, you're doing this while your opponent is also trying to do a move on you, so it might require some wiggle room to finally execute your move, this adds some strategy to the game where you have to try and predict what your opponent is going to do and how you can work around it whilst attempting to deliver that punch into the lumbar.\n\nAs PCGamer said, Toribash shows us why Ragdolls are the best thing since...Well anything, the replays after a match are so entertaining to watch, whether it was the most awkward game of twister or observing a well made kick with several build up spins. The later belt-leagues are filled with all sorts of incredible plays, if you're at all intrested, a good chap named Les Duncan hosts the Toribash Esports Youtube page, where he commentates over several high league tornaments.\n\nBest of all, Toribash is 100% free with even more additional game modes, no pay to win elements present here, customisation is avaliable but TC - Toricredits which are used to purchase cosmetic colours for your blood spouting ragdoll - can be brought with real currency or earned through the game with each win.\n\nIf you think you can master the art of Toribashing, I would wholeheartidly recommend you download it.","June 7, 2014","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has a HUGE learning curve. Until you learn to move correctly and what muscle contraction or extension makes you swing your arm around for a punch to the face, it's rather frustrating. However, It's probably the most satisfying thing I've ever experienced when I complete a move or an exaggerated manuever that lands as a flawless success. My friend and I were playing 1v1 on a custom level where you stood on a red square platform with spikes under it and slanted surfaces on the side behind us. I punched him, he grabbed me, and I flung him behind me with the same arm with which I punched him. He locked my arm while he was being launched over my head and dragged me down off the edge. At the last second, I grabbed the platform's edge and we hung there swaying. He said to me," You gotta let me go.....I'm too heavy for you to pull up." I tried contracting my elbow to haul us up but no dice. He let go of my arm so all that was holding him there was me. He then said," Do it. I'm not scared to die." As I let go and watched his character fall to the spikes he said one last fading message I'll never forget. " I've always hated you." Then he hit the spikes, and I let go too. Toribash overall is fun, it has extremely fun mechanics when you get the hang of it, and a suprising amount of unexpected role play.....","July 11, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Replayable to a certain extent. The multiple different modes in the multi-player are fun, but you won"t like all of them and the ones that you do like, if you are there for a long time will dry up until you are the only one left there and are forced to go to a different mode. Overall I would give it a 7.5/10 just because it becomes quite repetitive after long sessions.","February 24, 2015","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's something new and I like it.\n- The mods. You know what no one says? "A mod per day keeps the repetitiveness away". But they should, though, becasue it's true.\n- At least they tag servers by player level (or belt), that's always a plus.\n- Playing with friends, Toribash is hilarious.\n\nAnd all the above are enough to make a game about fun fun. But there are indeed problems:\n\nThe baddies:\n- Try making a server to play with friends and having them find it. I dare you.\nI couldn't. Maybe it's me.\n- The community is sometimes a little bit to harsh. Kicking and such. That said, I also do that.\n- The graphics are simplistic, but only at low can my PC live. And that's without a limb or too. If you know what I mean.\n\nIf you can make it work they way it should, Toribash works marvelously. Like a Prius. If you don't drive economically, it's like any other car.","July 31, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been playing this game for a year or two now and I'm excited that it has come to Steam.\nToribash is essentially a fighting game but it is so much more. The mods completely change the way the game is played. Whether it's skateboarding, lazer dodging, or jousting, there's so much to be done. One of the most fun games I've played in a while. Maybe now that it is on Steam, the community will gain more people which will mean more mods and whatnot. Overall, it's an awesome game with tons of fun to be had.

It has a large assortment of modifications and customizations.There are millions of different attack combos, and even more players.This game is worth the short amount of time it takes to download.

The gameplay could be calm or relaxing or really tense and exhilarating. Its super fun with a group of freinds and tons of fun  playing with other people online. This game also has a (what seems like) limitless amount of customization, Your character could be compleatly unique and can stand out from everyone else. Then theres the Mods, and there must be THOUSANDS of them. You can easily get any Mod by going into the menu and just picking one, no download required, no wait time, no loading screens (btw this game has no loading screens. yay!). This game looks way more fun than it looks (in my opinion) and once you start playing you probily wont stop. The download is not even 30 seconds and you dont even need to plug in your email for it to work (I did and they don't spam you) so you really have nothing to lose.                                                                                                               P.S. This game is actually free, theres no Pay2Win/Pay2Play, You can get everything by just playing and you can do everything in the game just as well as everyone else without grinding hours awway trying to unlock somthing.","September 9, 2014","true","36.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Look at my time. 40 hours in this game makes me a reliable source on quality.\nPros-\nInnovative gameplay- Control a bleeding robot to fight your way to victory and higher belts\n100% free- Ingame currency is purchasable, but not necesary in the LEAST. Win tournaments to get big bucks.\nAwesome community- Trade items, join clans, and war it out with real people.\nCons-\nDifficult learning curve- A turn off for many new players\n\nAll in all, this game is fantastic and I reccomend it completely.

It's something new and I like it.\n- The mods. You know what no one says? "A mod per day keeps the repetitiveness away". But they should, though, becasue it's true.\n- At least they tag servers by player level (or belt), that's always a plus.\n- Playing with friends, Toribash is hilarious.\n\nAnd all the above are enough to make a game about fun fun. But there are indeed problems:\n\nThe baddies:\n- Try making a server to play with friends and having them find it. I dare you.\nI couldn't. Maybe it's me.\n- The community is sometimes a little bit to harsh. Kicking and such. That said, I also do that.\n- The graphics are simplistic, but only at low can my PC live. And that's without a limb or too. If you know what I mean.\n\nIf you can make it work they way it should, Toribash works marvelously. Like a Prius.

I've been playing this game for a year or two now and I'm excited that it has come to Steam.\nToribash is essentially a fighting game but it is so much more. The mods completely change the way the game is played. Whether it's skateboarding, lazer dodging, or jousting, there's so much to be done. One of the most fun games I've played in a while. Maybe now that it is on Steam, the community will gain more people which will mean more mods and whatnot. Overall, it's an awesome game with tons of fun to be had.

The more you play, the more you get experience and that means you gain belts so you can fight with people who are equally skilled with you! This is not obligatory though, you can still keep fighting the most known person in Toribash, Uke. Or you can just make your own server and play there with friends or whoever you want to without the need of thinking about rankings or belts.\n\nYou can also play hundreds of different mods which players have made to make the game more interesting and awesome, there are mods like aikido and judo but there's also mods where you can be involved in a car crash or even go skiing.\n\nToribash has a very nice community, it's really fun, challenging and can keep you occupied for a long time.","May 24, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A Free-to-play early access? What kind of ♥♥♥♥ is that?), I am happy that the now finished game has finally made the jump into the Steam library.\n\nToribash's style is turn based fighting, you get your own Ragdoll- Oh sorry I mean "Tori" and attempt to sever your opponents limb from limb until one of you hits the ground or the unlikely event of time running out from one of you sitting in a tripod while the other floats away freely.\n\nIt has a high learning curve that only the most determined of players will decide to persue, at the start of the match, you and your opponent are stood in a T pose which then you are required to execute your moves with each limb, you control all of your Tori's bodyparts, so if you wanted to do a kick, you might grab them by contracting your left pec, clicking on your hand so it initiates a grip and raising your left knee to prepare to deliver an extended kick the following turn, of course, you're doing this while your opponent is also trying to do a move on you, so it might require some wiggle room to finally execute your move, this adds some strategy to the game where you have to try and predict what your opponent is going to do and how you can work around it whilst attempting to deliver that punch into the lumbar.\n\nAs PCGamer said, Toribash shows us why Ragdolls are the best thing since...Well anything, the replays after a match are so entertaining to watch, whether it was the most awkward game of twister or observing a well made kick with several build up spins. The later belt-leagues are filled with all sorts of incredible plays, if you're at all intrested, a good chap named Les Duncan hosts the Toribash Esports Youtube page, where he commentates over several high league tornaments.\n\nBest of all, Toribash is 100% free with even more additional game modes, no pay to win elements present here, customisation is avaliable but TC - Toricredits which are used to purchase cosmetic colours for your blood spouting ragdoll - can be brought with real currency or earned through the game with each win.\n\nIf you think you can master the art of Toribashing, I would wholeheartidly recommend you download it.","June 7, 2014","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amooseanonymous/recommended/248570/","amooseanonymous","Anonymoose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amooseanonymous/","58 products in account","Every once in a while, there comes a game that redefines its genre, and makes older fighting games look obsolete. Where a new idea is born and stands out amongst the crowd, presenting endless possibilities for players willing to venture into the unknown.\n\nWelcome to Toribash.\n\nThis fighting game is unlike any other in design. Here, one does not simply press a button to punch, block, kick, etc. Instead they must learn to manipulate a human like avatar, aka a "tori,' to perform these actions successfully. The number of moves that can be performed are endless and gives a gaming experience that is completely new to the fighting genre.\n\nPlayers now must not act on pure reaction, but be able to analyze and adapt to the fight in real time...sort of.

Where a new idea is born and stands out amongst the crowd, presenting endless possibilities for players willing to venture into the unknown.\n\nWelcome to Toribash.\n\nThis fighting game is unlike any other in design. Here, one does not simply press a button to punch, block, kick, etc. Instead they must learn to manipulate a human like avatar, aka a "tori,' to perform these actions successfully. The number of moves that can be performed are endless and gives a gaming experience that is completely new to the fighting genre.\n\nPlayers now must not act on pure reaction, but be able to analyze and adapt to the fight in real time...sort of. There are turns where the player is allowed to change their tori's body, i.e. move muscles, grab opponents, etc. There are no combos, health bars, or cheap moves (well, a few) in this game. This game rewards those who are able to manipulate a tori as if they were moving their own body, and not those who can simply press the kick and punch buttons at the correct moment.\n\nIt's not just a fighting game either. This game features hundreds of different game modes, including sports, racing, jousting, parkour, and even dancing.\n\nAnd it's free...no, not the "pay-to-get-premium-♥♥♥♥-so-I-win-more" free. I'm talking about totally free. There is a credit system, but it is only to buy mods to customize the looks of your tori, nothing more. The mods do not affect gameplay.\n\nMy only word of caution: this game can be boring without friends who are willing to play with you. There are tons of good servers and players to play with, but fights are always more fun when you are playing against someone of your own skill level (or lower :P).","September 14, 2014","true","110.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's a great mix of learning to control your tori and pregressing through the belts as you become more experienced. it's not your typical fighting game either. The turned based aspect allows you to come up with certain moves and amazing combos that cause complete and utter distruction. You always fight people with different skill levels and you never know what's going to happen.

Do you like kicking @$$? If you answered "yes" to at least one of those questions, this game might be for you!**\n\nThe game works in sort of a stop-motion kind of way.  Adjust your joints to line them up with your enemy's knee, head, crotch, anywhere, and let that snap kick FLY! Kick heads off with style and science! SPLIT YOUR OPPONENT IN HALF WITH THE SHOULDER OF YOUR DETACHED ARM (as I've done). Just play it and see what I mean. The controls and the physics are your main enemies--trust me, I've been playing this game since late 2009 (okay, on-and-off) and I STILL suck--but you can have [LOTS of] fun nonetheless. The fact that it has multiplayer that just WORKS makes this one of the only real-time strategy games (technically) I've really been into.  It's one of those games where, if you're looking for some satisfying WHAM-BAM-BOOM punchy-type stuff, there IS no butthurt, as long as there is CARNAGE (why are you looking at me like that?).  Trust me, there is NOTHING quite like this little indie gem.\n\n**[Oh, and by the way, if you answered "no" to both of those questions up there, I don't believe you.]\n\nThis unique little purple-pink-whatever-the-f*ck-u-choose-idrc-cartoony-splashy-blood-encrusted jewel is WELL worth a try.  Start kicking your mortal opponents' heads off--you may come to like it!\n\nIf there's any part of this review that seems weird and hard to understand, in summary: it is clear thJUSTPLAYTHISGAME!eleventy-one!","June 12, 2014","true","23.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Astounding. Brilliant. The sheer fact that you have complete control makes this game one of my all time favorites, if not my favorite. The ability to warp the game settings also adds to the greatness; tweaking gravity, dismember threshold, etc.\n\nThen there's playing online with random people to close friends.
