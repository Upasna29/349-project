I heard he has since been employed on an Imperial Star Destroyer as a Stormtrooper.\n\nTo make this review "more helpful", I feel I should add that this IS a game worth buying, though missing often (and often you will) can become a real frustration - you find yourself grinning in sweet revenge when the same RNG happens to the Aliens and they miss you from from point blank range.\n\nShooting mechanics aside, the only other issues I've come across since playing are:-\n*Mission timers (which mods can fix already). Plus, this is a personal preference, it's not a fact that this makes the game worse. I actually enjoyed some of the missions when realising I had 3 turns remaining to act out the impossible. You really think about what skills you have remaining and use every resource possible to inflict the greatest amount of damage while moving forward as fast as you can. All normally works out well... Assuming you hit the target, that is! *ahem*\n\n*The occasional bug / framerate drop (which will no doubt be patched very soon). Again, this is computer specific and really, I hardly noticed it once I tweaked my settings. I had to lower a few things, but no biggie!\n\nThat's it. I see no real reason not to buy this game, especially if you liked Enemy Unknown/Within. I'm currently finding myself pinned down at times on Normal. Yes, NORMAL, and I have no Ironman, and I still finish some missions thinking "Wow... How did I get outta that one?!" I can't wait to (hopefully) survive this playthrough and crank up the difficulty to make it even more of a challenge.\n\nGood luck fellow Commanders!

People saying it limits decision making, or forces run and gun. It doesn't. What it does do is remove the old "victory through overwatch" strategy that was so popular (read: OP) in XCOM EU & EW. Yeah, I did it too. Did a run through right before XCOM 2 came out and only lost one soldier. Because I decided to (lazy/didn't care at that point). No challenge at all if you really took your time and especially if had two snipers. Given that this is a guerilla operation in XCOM 2, it is true that your team simply does not have all the time in the world. This does not limit options one bit, rather it punishes mistakes brutally. You do NOT have an extra four turns to screw around on the wrong end of the map "cleaning up" safely. You have to be accomplishing something at all times. You end up having to put people in harm's way, and make decisions that are based on the situation at hand as opposed to being able to armchair general your way through by-the-book and not lose a soul.\n\nIf you enjoy challenge and learning from failure as you would in a roguelike, buy this game.

Go play openXcom for that!\nKeep in mind the time of this writing.\nThe bad:\nOdd pauses, technical issues that interfere directly with gameplay such as:\n>Line of sight issues with visibly solid walls (why did the enemy see me through an entire skyscraper... oh no, now I'm unexpectedly being shot through the walls, too), the hacking gameplay menu information being obscured by in-game objects, the rare instance of enemies getting extra actions.\n\nBalance issues\n>Hacking is poorly weighted in favor of failure: The rewards for hacking are often too temporary and too impotent to roll the dice on when the penalties are so incredibly severe.\n>Swords are overall too risky to use either and stand only as a backup that, more often than not, complicates things by overextending and often ending up causing a new "pod" to join the battle.\n>Psionics and Meme Beacons are intensely overpowered. Think "What if ghost grenades were even easier to deploy?"\n>The AI is still shackled, and this isn't more evident than when you get used to how Sectoids' fearsome psionics are used.\n\nThe good:\nThe script source is supposedly totally open, and the mod pack is as well. Modding for the game couldn't be any more supported and who can live without Hatsune Miku hair or Stop Wasting My Time.\n\nTimers are good.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/268500/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","XCOM 2 is a turn based tactical strategy game, releasing on PC in February 2016. The game is a direct sequel to XCOM Enemy Unknown which was released in 2012. XCOM 2 was developed by 2K Games and Firaxis Games.\n\nLike the first game, game play is separated into two. A management style simulator of controlling your base, and technologies inside it, whether it be through engineering or scientific research – allowing you to advance certain aspects of your base how you choose. Along with the base management side of the game, there is also a map style function which is where you move your ship around the world to different locations, or hubs of activity. Whilst on the map you will see side missions, your main missions, scrap piles to explore for extra money, along with a plethora of other activities to take part in.\n\nThe main mechanic in XCOM is of course the tactical squad based game play.  This squad of soldiers can consist of five different classes, which again can be specialized even further by using the skills tree which you earn points in through promoting your squad members. To begin with the classes start out very much the same apart from the weapons that they use. After you have gained a few promotions with the characters you will start to differentiate the classes quite a bit with the abilities they will gain. The actual in game mechanics are very much the same as the previous version of XCOM, but just with general improvements. The game’s cover base system works really well, with some handy UI enhancements that make it easier to see how the cover affects you.  What I wasn’t too keen on was the aiming mechanic. On countless occasions I found myself face-to-face with a foe, and still my percentage chance to hit them with my gun would be around 30%. I know there is always going to be a chance anyone will miss a target, but c’mon, these are trained soldiers in point blank range, it shouldn’t be that low. This became increasingly annoying as you progress through the game onto harder enemies which make a habit of getting up close and personal with you.  Overall I found the game play in XCOM to be really intuitive and very addictive with that “oh one more turn” feel to it.\n\nGraphically, XCOM 2 is a really stellar looking title. Absolutely crisp animations of anything that moves, right the way down to the rag doll effect of bodies when they get shot (or blown apart). It just looks so fluid that it feels real. The textures and character models are also really high quality too. Normally in tactical games like this the graphical element is more skinned down on to allow for more focus on the game play but not XCOM 2. It is one of the best looking games to come out in the past 12 months and one that will really challenge your rig if you want to push out max settings.  The voice acting is top notch too; I was a little disappointed that all of the enemies have the same kind of voice, but given that there is plenty of different enemies in the game to begin with, this can be forgiven a bit. I would have liked to have seen a little extra depth used with sound in the game mechanics; there is an element of stealth to the game play, at least at the start of missions. It would have been nice to have some sort of sound meter that would trigger alarms for the enemies if you made too much sound – again just a small improvement which would of made the immersion all that more deeper.\nThe game has varying levels of difficulty for the overall campaign – this of course is down to how hard you want the game to be.  After you have finished one play through of the game you will unlock “Ironman” mode which essentially saves your game after every action you take, meaning you cannot jump back a few saves if you messed something up. You have one chance to succeed and that is it. Given that the side missions in the campaign can make a real impact on how the rest of the game pans out, I see this as a really interesting game mode that has the potential to have endless amounts of replay ability. I have been playing for roughly 15 hours so far and I have just about finished my first play through. I will for sure be trying out the Ironman mode personally to see how hard it really can be. Where you start on the world map, and the in game maps are all randomly generated, so whilst the actual objectives of missions may stay the same, where you carry out those objectives will differ from play through to play through.\n\nTechnically, I had a couple of issues. The main one being I did get random crashes. A few of these caused my graphics drivers to crash. This stopped when I configured an SLI profile for my two 970s and helped with the overall performance of the game too thankfully.  I was happy enough playing on 1080p given the high quality of the graphics on show to begin with. My rig was not capable of playing at 4k, and to be honest I think you would struggle to find a rig to play any of today’s recent releases on 4k.  Whack you’re AA up to max and you won’t really notice a difference though.\n\nXCOM 2 is by far the best game in the series so far; the graphical enhancement of the game, as well as the improvements made on the already core game play mechanics makes this a tactical turn based player’s wet dream. Apart from the technical issues I had, I have struggled to find anything major wrong with this release.  The game’s regular price tag of £34, 99 is the mark of this being a AAA release; the sceptics amongst us will want to wait for this to drop into the sales market but if you are keen to pick up where Enemy Unknown left off, XCOM 2 will definitely keep you entertained for plenty more hours with a greater gaming experience.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

It's worth noting that there seems to also be a bug now where SLI users no longer have cover icons (I use SLI and the game runs about 100% better with it, so it's staying on regardless).  For NVIDIA users, I recommend also going into the NVIDIA Control Panel and turning on Anisotropic Optimization; it gives me about a 25-30 fps boost with little, if any, noticeable drop in visual quality.\n\nThe gameplay is good, the visuals are superb, and the music and sounds are very well done and sound amazing on surround sound.

Every. Single. One.\n\nFor everything about this game I din't like, someone else didn't like it either and made a mod to fix it.

I'd also like to add that despite having an absurd number of mods active the game is VERY stable. This many mods on something like Fallout New Vegas? Forget about it.\n\nSo if you enjoyed XCOM and were on the fence about this one you should consider giving it a try.

Now, 4 years later, Xcom 2 hopes to improve on all of the elements of its predecessor.\n\nTaking place roughly 20 years after where the first game left off, and in an unusual sense for a sequel, Xcom 2 assumes you failed Enemy Unknown as it now takes place in a dystopian future where the aliens have conquered earth. Rather than defending the planet from UFOs, you’re tasked with bolstering resistance cells across the globe with your mobile, flying fortress; the avenger. This functions in the same way as your underground base from the first title, as you can upgrade it, add new facilities, as well as recruit soldiers while managing research and production.\n\nThe core concepts are similar to Enemy Unknown and you’re faced with a constant race against the clock since the aliens are developing something called the Avatar project. Certain missions will act to delay the progress of the project, but it's game-over upon its completion. There’s also dark events which can provide random modifiers and buffs to the aliens you encounter. Occasionally you’ll be prompted to complete guerilla missions which allow you to prevent a dark event but you’re unable to stop them all, as you’ll typically have to pick and choose which event is most pressing.\n\nThe world map functions similarly to Enemy Unknown. You’ll set up a base and will be able to scan the map for certain points of interest. Building radio relays in countries will increase your monthly budget, and continental bonuses make a return, adding some elements of strategy and planning. Upon scanning the map, you’ll frequently be interrupted to go on missions, which are all randomly generated with varying objectives. These objectives range from escorting an NPC, saving civilians, eliminating a target or killing every alien in an area.\n\nThe turn-based combat is what you’d come to expect from an Xcom game, death is permanent and your soldiers can still possibly miss a point-blank shot which otherwise has a 97% success rate. Stealth has been added, which can allow you to strategically place your soldiers and set up ambushes with overwatch, but a lot of the time you’ll feel rushed as there isn’t much time to complete the objectives in most cases. Taking one extra step is sometimes enough to alert enemies to your presence, so you really have to balance between moving cautiously and completing a mission as fast as possible. That element of randomness can be a detriment, as sometimes a civilian could block a ladder and thus seal off the only way up to a rooftop extraction, or a ridiculous amount of enemies could spawn directly on top of a transmitter you’re otherwise supposed to protect. Which leads to one major issue with Xcom 2, it’s extremely luck based and these random factors can cause you to fail a mission with very little control. You can recover from failed missions, but it does feel a little unfair and can be a major downer for ironman playthroughs in which you only have one save file.\n\nThe soldier classes feel a lot more fleshed out and distinct from one another as they all kind of blurred together in the previous installment. For example the Ranger is equipped with a sword which can absolutely devastate enemies in melee combat while the specialist has a drone that can hack hostile robotic units or support squad mates from anywhere on the map. The scientists and engineers play more of a role now as well. They’re actually named and can be individually assigned to different projects.\n\nXcom 2 also completely expands on the level of customization, giving a lot more appearance options for your soldiers. You’re also able to modify your soldiers’ weapons with various attachments as well as give them performance enhancing implants. While all of these customization options were quite welcomed, this resulted in some completely broken and overpowered combinations. For example, I had given one of my soldiers a superior repeater which gave him a 15% chance to instantly execute whatever target he was shooting at and as a result I was able to one-shot the hardest enemy in the game. The difficulty in general is kind of spiky, while the game initially starts off as challenging; it quickly becomes too easy upon developing certain technologies. Some better pacing would have greatly alleviated this issue because as it stands, it can switch from being so easy that it’s tedious to frustrating with little warning.\n\nAt first, there seems to be a greater variety of enemies present in Xcom 2. The majority of enemies you face are Advent troopers, human-like soldiers that support the alien regime, while more familiar aliens such-as sectoids function as lieutenants and are actually a greater threat than the previous games. The other aliens have also evolved over the twenty year gap between Enemy Unknown. Unfortunately you hardly fight them in the latter half of the game as you pretty much always face the same enemies over and over again at that point.\n\nI also had some issues with the world map. It gives you so many optional areas to scan for additional supplies and personnel but you’re interrupted every two seconds to take part in another randomly generated mission. There are very few actual story missions, and the random stages can really get tedious in the latter half of the game. There’s also very little rhyme or reason going into the appearance of a stage. You could accept a mission in Africa only for there to be pine trees and snow on the ground, making no sense whatsoever. There are a lot of bugs present in the game as well. From graphical glitches, laggy animations and the odd crash.\n\nXcom 2 promised re-playability with its use of random stages but I would’ve honestly preferred handcrafted levels with more of a narrative. There’s also extra mod support this time around but most of the mods available currently are cosmetic or the odd weapon, which doesn’t really add anything significant to the gameplay.\n\nThe multiplayer from Enemy Unknown makes an appearance again but it’s even more of a throw-away mode this time around. You’re given even less customization options than before as you’re no longer able to choose the rank and loadout of human soldiers. The turns don’t play out simultaneously and can take an extremely long time as there’s quite a bit of additional lag between them. That combined with crashes and random disconnects make this mode barely playable.\n\nThe soundtrack is well done and changes to match the mood of the battle as well as the enemies you encounter. Unfortunately, there isn't much variety between tracks and it isn't as memorable as Michael Mccann’s soundtrack from Enemy Unknown who was probably too busy working on Deus Ex Mankind Divided.\n\nUltimately, Xcom 2 makes a very strong first impression but it was all downhill from there though, and towards the end of the game, I couldn’t wait to be done with all the randomly generated filler content. That coupled with an overall lack of pacing made it a bit of a disappointment. It’s an improvement over Enemy Unknown in some areas but a step-back in others. Xcom 2 is by no means a bad game, and will most likely improve with time; I was just expecting a lot more.\n\nPros +	Strong Turn Based Tactical Combat\n+	Increased Customization Options\n+	Interesting Premise\n+	Soldier classes and base management are more refined.\n\nCons -	Repetitive Gameplay and Filler Content\n-	Numerous Bugs\n-	Lackluster Multiplayer\n-	Not enough of an improvement over Enemy Unknown\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out our curator page:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/AnalogReviewsOfficial#curation\n\nThanks for reading,","March 17","true","66.2"," 196 of 266 people (74%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","74","196","266","8","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hawkstein/recommended/268500/","Hawkstein","Doggles Brand Doggles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hawkstein/","137 products in account","Listen: At its best, XCOM 2 is a great game and if you liked XCOM EU there is a lot you would like here. The good parts are covered in other positive reviews and I mostly agree with them.\n\nHowever, I cannot recommend this game as a $60 release in the state it is in.\n\nTo be honest, I rarely buy games new at full price because I simply don't make that much money. However, I made an exception for this one because the buzz/preview coverage was very positive and I loved the formula established in EU. They couldn't mess it up THAT much, could they? In my opinion, they didn't and the gameplay experience is mostly great with a few minor quibbles here and there. But even considering that, the technical state this game is in makes me very wary about buying a game at launch ever again. I feel burned.\n\nThe most noticeable thing is is that the performance is terrible - I SHOULD be able to run it at ultra or high settings at 60fps but am sitting around medium with occasional slowdown. Honestly it's a minor thing because graphics aren't the biggest deal to me, but it is still something that annoys me given everything else. But if it was the only thing? Totally fine.\nUnfortunately the bugs in this game are terrible. XCOM at it's best is a tight, no nonense strategy game where you make well thought out, in the moment decisions and live with the consequences. Unfortunately, bugs and crashes interrupt game flow and can make going through missions a slog. I currently have had three crashes in the middle of an action where a crash dialog box would pop up but I would be unable to force quit the game or access the task manager, forcing me to force restart my whole computer. Just my luck as every single time that I happened I was in a hectic situation that was going well for me. At that point I would have to go back to the game, load the last autosave and try and recreate the situation I was in before the game crashed. Completely breaks enjoyment of the game. I've gotten past them, but each time it happens make me less excited to return to the game.\nI've also had instances where I've completely destroyed all of the walls of a lower floor in the hopes it would drop an enemy from above only to have it not happen? My only guess is that if a ladder connects the ground to an upper floor it makes it so I can't destroy that floor, which is not a  bug I guess, but still ridiculous. In that same instance I couldn't target a unit that was behind said ladder despite there being no walls around it and despite the unit not being in any sort of cover.\nRight now I'm in a mission where I have to neutralize or knock out an advent VIP. There is a sectopod near the VIP, so I send a unit with chain shot up to try and shoot the sectopod. Presumably both the sectopod and the VIP are in my line of sight, but for whatever reason I can't change between targets - even when clicking the yellow (flanked) VIP icon or trying to tab between targets, it targets the sectopod. That would be fine except every times I confirm the shot on the sectopod, my soldier shoots the VIP. Excuse me? I was able to destroy the sectopod in another way, but only after reloading my autosave and trying to puzzle out how to get the game to do what I wanted (and should have) been able to do.\nIn this same mission, I finally kill the enemies, knock out the VIP, and carry him away. However, when I knocked him out he was next to a burning car. NO MATTER HOW FAR I AM AWAY FROM THE CAR, and NO MATTER HOW MANY MORE UNITS ARE CLOSER TO THE VEHICLE, when the car explodes the VIP takes damage and dies. Once again, even my soldiers who are closer to the car than my unit carrying the VIP don't take damage. Only the VIP.\n\nThere are other bugs and crashes, but none quite as egregious or memorable like the ones above. At this point I would have to reload the mission in a previous state to try and figure out a way to get past this particular bug. I don't want to do that and shouldn't have to, frankly. I'm not into Ironman difficulties but also don't like save scumming to get the outcome I want. In this case I'm savescumming because the game is messing up, which just sucks!\n\nAt this point I feel like I'm trying to beat the game because I feel obligated, considering how much time I put into it, not because I really want to. And it's a shame because because the gameplay is pretty good and I should WANT to beat it because of how fun it is! But I just never know which mission is going to be the breaking point, where I finally hit a point where my best soldiers die not because of my mishandling but because of the game's mistakes. THAT is problematic and it  makes me not excited to return to this game. And maybe I won't. Who knows.\n\nIt's been a month now and things aren't really ironed out still. I understand a lot of games ship in various states of disrepair but it shouldn't be like this. Maybe other people can get past these things, and maybe other people won't even come across these issues, but I personally wouldn't recommend buying this game at full retail price until it is patched extensively.\n\nEDIT:\nSince writing this review I have played for about three more hours, finishing the campaing. Despite the last mission being mostly great, my recommendation of this game remains the same. Aside from the regular shoddy performance, there were a few bad spots: once again selected one target only to somehow shoot at another, and two instances of not being able to throw a grenade/other item farther than a few squares away with two different soldiers in different locations. Was able to use other soldiers/skills to give me the result I more or less wanted, but still I am annoyed I wasn't able to do what I WANTED to do. Those things did not invalidate the mission as a whole but still muddied what should have been a great experience.\n\nOverall, the game's technical failings are a shame. When firing on all cylinders, this game is fantastic. However, the game's tight flow is too often interrupted by perfomance issues. Given just how IMPORTANT that flow is to making the game enjoyable, it's a damn shame that there are too many instances of you, the player, not being allowed to experience it. You feel like you're hitting a stride, and then all of a sudden a crash or a bug pops up and you stumble through no fault of your own leaving you to deal with the consequences or get back up and try all over again. That just sucks.\n\nWhether you just heard of this game in passing and were intrigued or loved Enemy Unknown, I would highly recommend you do NOT buy this game until there is a hefty sale going on or until it is reliably patched. Preferably the latter. This is a game that should be experienced with no technical caveats as the sytems underneath are enjoyable, addicting, and often rewarding. Unfortunately that time is not now. Or who knows? Maybe you won't experience the bugs I have, as some people didn't. Guess you could just roll the dice.","March 2","false","43.8"," 487 of 700 people (70%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","70","487","700","23","21"

Good.\n\nNow as many reviewers have said I will say as well. Most negative reviews talk about performance: MSAA will slice your FPS, turn it off or enable FXAA. There will be a patch soon to optimise it.\n\nNow that we go that out of the way.\n\nX-com 2 is based after the events in X-com 1. You've lost the war, and well.. read the store page for more info. The point is, the game plays like this. You're a resistance cell, not a full fledged world army equipped with the best of everything. Apparently people are down voting because it doesn't play like this. (Get gud?)\n\nThe biggest complaint apart from optimization is the mission timers in the battles. Most reviews exagerate the mother loving heck out of this as they hate missions which are timed. Fair enough. There IS a mod which removes this already, so if turn timers are not your thing, there you go.\n\nIf a game is going to have timers for missions, then they need to make sense right? Well in X-com they do. They make perfect sense for the missions which have them. You just broke a highly important VIP to the Aliens out of confinement, you're a resistance cell with limited manpower and resources, of course you're going to have to get the hell out of dodge and fast once you break that guy out. It makes sense no? It's REALISTIC. It's IMMERSIVE.. You know.. those things which people apparently hate in games these days.\n\nSetting my own butthurt at societies downfall in terms of gaming aside, the time limit, and how often you run into them is changed depending on difficulty, so if you dont' like timed missions to often, but like them for when they make sense, you can adjust the difficulty level of the game and it will throw less at you.\n\nApart from that, I love how it feels like you are actually a resistance cell in a mobile base. Scavanging for equipment on the battlefield when enemies drop them, selling parts, corpses, and other alien artifacts on the Black Market to get Intel, and buying/trading/selling in Intel on the Black Market to gain goods to fill the holes of research and bad RNG rolls in battles in terms of mods you find, make it feel like you are the aggressors against a superior foe.\n\nThe stealth system in place for most missions is excellent as well, allowing you to scout out the land and enemies before engaging, and setting up ambushes which could wipe the slate in that area entirely before the aliens have time to respond.\n\nThere is now a better world map as well, This is where you move your mobile base from region to region, unlock new regions by contacting the resistance cells in that area, and take on side missions to gain supplies, Intel, etc.\n\n-----------------\n\nOver all the game isn't bad by any means. Some performance issues which should be fixed relatively soon, good immersion, great classic game mechanics from X-com 1.\n\n\n-------------------\n\nIf you're still wondering about the complaints on this game. There are 2 people on the forums are can articulate points far better than me. There is ALOT of debate on the timers in this game. These are 2 great responses.\n\n\n\nMartial.lore:\n\nThe timers are essential. Turtling is not a tactic. The squad isn't trying to find a good picnic spot. XCOM is a guerrilla force that has to make lighting strikes before going back into hiding.\n\nThis theme is reinforced by every mechanic in the game from the short individual timers on the globe to the reinforcement drops that come when you just desperately want to get everyone to the evac point.\n\nSometimes you just have accept that there was not enough time for your ill-equipped soldiers to complete their objective and stay alive, and sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the greater good.\n\nFailure is hard to accept but without the timers the potential for disaster during missions would be missing and the game would not be worthy of the XCOM name.\n\nIf it didn't upset players complacency and make them furious at how unfair life is then where is the fun in that? Sometimes FTL makes me very angry but it's one of my favorite tactical video games and I am generally very good at playing it.\n\nOnce I have learned how to succeed with XCOM 2 I imagine that even though they will feel familiar and seem easier to deal with, the timers will still screw up a good plan once in a while and get good people killed.\n\nPerish the thought that this were a game in which every move, every action and every decision did not have consequences.\n\n\n\n\nJolly:\n\n"It mostly IS blind hate against timers. People complaining without really give it a try, or even trying.\n\n"Because most of the timers are idiotic, and pretty much all of them are poorly implemented."\n\nUm, no. Idiotic? That's opinion and not one I'd agree with. Poorly implemented? It's a countdown on the screen - what do you want, an hourglass? I dancing girl who removes clothes til the "time" is up? WTF.\n\nMost of the people complaining can't seem to let go of their old XCOM ways. They want to turtle thru full cover overwatch and lure aliens into easy kills. It's a weak "tactic" that takes advantage of poor AI that suicides into that crap.\n\nThe timers, which only appear in about half the missions if you actually play the game more than you cry about it, aren't even for entire missions, usually just for objectives. The cause you to move a little fast, to tak risks, take you out of your comfort zone, and they obliterate the cheeseball reliance on overwatch luring.\n\nWhat's sad is that if you actually play the game with an open mind, the timers are no big deal. If you just decide you're going to cry about the timers no matter what, which is ignorant, then you desreve the misery you bring upon yourself.\n\nXCOM 2 is a glorious game and a triumph of design. Embrace and love it for everything that it offers, which is a megaton."","February 5","true","103.5"," 379 of 559 people (68%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","68","379","559","21","39"

Other than that, keep an eye out for this game, the base game is awesome, and there's also a great modding community. I believe this is a game that's already better than EU/EW.\n\nQuick review:  Very  awesome\n\nThis sequel improves every aspect of XCOM EU/EW,  I almost forgot I'm not playing a long war.\nThough, it's true the game need some performance patch.\n\nOther than that the performance issue and few random lag, its graphic is great.\nSound is great (it manages to catch the atmosphere).\nGameplay is very XCOM EU/EW,   though I haven't been playing for a long time, but it's looking good so far.\n\nIf you've played XCOM EU/EW, I'd reccomend it fully.\nIf you haven't, that depends on your preferable genre, as not everyone prefer a strategy game\n\nA bit of advice for people who haven't played XCOM EU/EW, this game quite relies on RNG, don't expect your 99% hit precentage to hit. Always prepare a strategy in case it misses. Still, that doesn't mean it's 100% pure luck type of game, the strategy layer is deep enough to make up for the RNG.\n\nUPDATE: Finished the game.\nWell, it's kind of confusing now that I've seen all the game has to offer. It's not a bad game by all means, it just really push you to be proactive, which good for most people, not really good for other.\n\nThe following things is purely my opinion:\n\nThe good one\n+The avatar project timer is well timed. Not leaving you too laid back, but not really killing your gameplay.\n\n+The timers in missions is sometimes bad, sometimes good, though what really screw me up is the placement of the objective in most mission. (♥♥♥♥ capture mission though). But mostly, it's tight but not too tight.\n\n+The enemies are varied, which is good. I don't think it will ever be a bad point.\n\n+The costumization is good.\n\n+Destructible enviroment. Like, super destructible. This is good.\n\n+The mods are awesome already, and we're not even hitting the one week mark.\n\nThe bad one\n-Some abilities are useless late game, or at least not as useful as the other one. This is a bad point, as every abilities should be useful until late game, to make a varied gameplay.\n\n-The pacing is weird and done too quickly. There should be a few mission with the introduction of new enemies. Instead in early time, I met new enemy in every mission. This is bad for new players who haven't learned anything about the enemies.\n\n-♥♥♥♥ codex\n\n-The final mission isn't as good as EU/EW. Warning though, this is purely my opinion.\n\n-The buying of new weapon and armor is weird. One mission you're underpowered, the next one you're super powered. I don't really like it as there's no transition from one point to another.  The use of experimental stuff is also weird.\n\n-The lack of stuff. It's like they only focused on the enemies, instead of the thing we'll be using against it.","February 4","true","150.8"," 271 of 395 people (69%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","69","271","395","21","12"

Overall gameplay is solid&fun so far and comes with a lot of customization. But performs like garbage and they tried to balance the game by adding timers to both missions and the overworld map (can be modded out) and some bugs are literally copied 1:1 from XCOM:EU to XCOM2.\n\nConcept        Pros        Cons                Graphics        Are very slick.        Performs horribly compared to what you get. Also it lacks 'pre-generated scenes'. Example returning to the base after a mission has a long loading time which should not be necesary                Relocatable base        No more 100% pure rng-reliance on wether or not you can get satellites over every country        Alien facilities (=bases) may all spawn very far away from your starting location (rng). But there is a counter to this (Lead on Alien Facility)                Saving System                Is as horrible as it was in XCOM:EU. Even the XCOM from 1994 had a better saving system. Not even the autosave feature is working as I would expect it to. Hopefully we get a mod for this soon                Mod support        Mod support is great in XCOM2. Also it does NOT prevent you from getting achievements.        I'm getting this feeling that they left out some critical game-features and rely on modders to add them.                RNG (random gen)        Reliance on RNG is less compared to XCOM:EU.        RNG-reliance is still strong. You still have to use tactics to minimize the chances of losing. But if all the odds happen to be against you, you will simly lose. If you are new to the XCOM-series and can't stand rng-based games. Then this game is not for you.                Stability        It is way more stable compared to XCOM EU. It's only the first version so we can expect fixes in the near future        Still has quite a lot of bugs & glitches and even a reproducable crash for me. But most of them do not impact gameplay. I also found 2 bugs that were also present (and still are) in XCOM1 EU which is a big thumbs down for me.                Soldier customization        It is supported right of the bat along with a premade soldier-pool that contains your saved-soldiers for re-use. Also comes with custom colors, voices, and much more        Sadly most of this comes from the 2 DLC which add significantly to the total price                Tedious moments                Can't skip some cinematics. There are quite a lot of these early in the game. Also during combat you sometimes get nagged about objectives while stalling gameplay. Also I have to EVAC my soldiers one by one when they all stand in the zone during a VIP mission? No EVAC-all button? No reload-all? No overwatch-all? Some GUI elements are a bit on the slow side                AI        A lot better compared to XCOM:EU and especially a lot more stable. Also soldiers on overwatch no longer all fire overkill-damage on the same enemy        Civilians stay near burning cars and let themselves explode. They also do not run from aliens and do not seek cover and do not run towards you. They behave like mindless zombies                Missions        Good overal design. You now also start cloaked in most battles instead of getting swarmed by like 20 aliens after moving 1 tile as opposed to XCOM1 EU sometimes        Most missions are timed. Personally I hate gameplay that has timelimits everywhere. But perhaps this was required to prevent turtling in a safe spot                Theme        Being a rebel now after the aliens took over the world is a refreshing change after so many games in the series        Early in the game most enemies look like armored humans. It does not feel as if you are fighting aliens                Overworld        The scanning and sidemissions are a nice addition        Again a timelimit... AGAIN.... Also game progression here feels too linear. I don't have this feeling like I have total freedom to just go wherever I like. I'm still bound to the story just like in XCOM EU. And not truly much choice in what missions you shall take. There is still no freedom like we had in UFO EU (1994). Also sometimes you get like 3 missions in 4 days. You can't even get to a scanning site. But again you can only have 1 skyranger...                Difficulty                There's still a reverse difficulty curve. And some of the difficulty comes purely from the lack of information (no tech tree, some skills not properly explained, etc.) or the enforced timelimits. For players new to the XCOM-seroes, early game can be a total nightmare. Early game is really hard, while lategame you are an untouchable god.                EVAC        Call down custom EVAC points        Even though all enemies are dead and no new reinforcements are on their way, you simply can't recover the alien artifacts with you during an EVAC. Also you can't carry alien corpses manually into the skyranger. You could in the 1994 game but not in the 2016 one...                Mech Design        We have droids (YES) that can remotely hack and jolt enemies        The big MECH's look as if they were designed by Apple. They look nowhere near as cool as the ones from XCOM:EU\n\nYes it has bugs. A selection of the bugs that I encountered:May contain minor spoilers\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/268500/discussions/0/412446292775581295/\n\nWhy still the upvote after all those bugs?- Because ~ 9 out 10 of those bugs either have no impact on gameplay, have obvious workarounds or work in your advantage. Just stay away from ironman mode for the time being. I have seen some bugs that could seriously hurt you in ironman mode.\n- The game just released, so there is still hope.\n- Gameplay is still pretty solid and beats most other games of it's genre. It has many flaws I admit but it still comes out on top.\n- Modders are already jumping in, fixing the game and adding critical features.\n\nNo I have not forgotten how they left XCOM:EUI never managed to beat ironman-impossible in XCOM:EU due to bugs.\n1. Once an enemy got stuck and my savegame was ruined forever. They 'fixed' this like this: "if an enemy get's stuck, just skip the entire AI's turn". You call that a fix?\n2. Another time it bugged out in the final level (FFS) and it wouldn't let me enter the door. They actually fixed this one.\n3. And the 3rd time I forgot. But I just gave up after this.\n\nAlso some of the bugs like the game skipping your turn entirely, save-games not loading correctly in battle, AI that teleports at the start of their turn (in plain sight) and also immediately fire right thereafter including sectopods and the like...\nXCOM:EU was never (properly) fixed. I hope XCOM2 will be handled better.","February 5","true","43.4"," 150 of 212 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","150","212","6","9"

I'd nearly lost after just a few hours of play. The pace of the alien progress forces you into following paths and missions to reduce this immediately, keeping you from choosing your own path until you get it under control. With the progress being so random this can either be very frustrating or non-existant for your playthrough.\n\nResource collection comes down to waiting for the correct objectives to appear on the world map, after which flying over the objective location and waiting for a while completes the objective.\nThe only resources you'll usually be lacking are the ones you need to wait for to collect on the world map, adding a Zynga-esque energy collection vibe to the resource collection aspect of the game.\n\nCollecting items and corpses from missions is made more difficult by only being able to take them from missions that do not have a timer (about 20% of them), however this seems to be compensated by most projects only requiring few items or corpses. In practice you'll collect everything you need without really trying (or having much of a choice in the matter).\n\nOpposite to the previous game, getting a new armor or weapon tier now only requires you to build the item once, which is then applied to the weapons and armor of your whole squad. Strangely, there are types of armor that do need to be built 1 at a time for each soldier, however the UI does nothing to explain the difference between the two, leaving you to find this out simply by making them. Additionally there are projects that award a random weapon or item which just feels silly as it contradicts any strategic choice and just makes the game even more random.\n\nDuring the ground game, timers on most missions force a play-style that have you running gung-ho towards your objective, hoping pod placement and the RNGeesus will be in your favor. There is little tactical choice when all the timer allows for is rushing. Normally I only save scum when I want to attempt a different strategy but XCOM2 had me scumming just to survive the only approach it allowed for.\n\nThis is not to say the ground game isn't enjoyable; the timers DO add something to the game and will have you at the edge of your seat, but they are often set so short that they compromise the rest of the gameplay. Having you instantly lose your soldiers also seems much too harsh. Games like Invisible Inc. find a much better balance in this respect, increasing the challenge as you exceed the time limit instead of simply making you lose.\nThe non-timed missions actually seem to take this approach in some cases and feel all the better for it.\n\nBalancing is another big issue. Strong units and abilities come into play early on. Melee units can run very far and stun you. Some units pop out of nowhere to devastating effect. Mind Control will take out your squad quickly with a huge success chance. Panic is also a big feature and seems to occur fairly often, making bad things even worse. Panicked soldiers throwing grenades at their own squadmates further poke the wound. This is exacerbated by numerous bugs allowing for shots through floors and ceilings, along with the rather lenient line-of-fire through object and structures that was already present in the first XCOM.\n\nAll of this taken together just makes the ground game feel random and unfair; you're given little choice and the choices you do make can be crippled by bugs or the RNG.\n\nXCOM 2 does make a number of positive iterative improvements, such as more destructible environments, weapon mods and some abilities that do guaranteed damage (to help alleviate the randomness somewhat). Some of the new aliens and abilities are also very cool and require new approaches to handle. Armor has been made more straightforward, becoming a simple damage reduction statistic that is displayed on each unit. The new maps are quite cool and the narrative andsetting are well done. The voice acting seems good but I've personally developed a pet-peeve with almost every unit speaking with an Australian accent regardless of race or nationality (?!). Still it's not as bad as Vahlen's German(?) accent in XCOM 1.\n\nFor every positive iteration there are also seems to be a negative, though. Units now have a chance to dodge for reduced damage after a hit has been established. This just further increases the randomness. Environments can explode and damage soldiers standing close. This makes sense for cars and other explosive objects, but can also occur on walls and such. Stray shots can also destroy the environment and I've killed my own soldiers this way.\nAnother minor peeve is the interface showing the max damage done to an alien when viewing its health while aiming a shot, but the actual damage is usually lower, leading to sub-optimal decisions on my part and being frustrated an alien survives when the indicator showed he should've been dead.\n\nXCOM 2 feels like a game with all the right pieces, but not enough time to put them all together properly.\nI'm hoping Firaxis will take the time to fix and balance the game and isn't afraid to make some rigorous changes where needed.\n\nWhen they do, I'll give it another shot, but for now the frustration and dissapointment outweights the fun there is to be had with the game.","February 19","false","21.5"," 762 of 1,179 people (65%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","65","762","1","35","69"

The most obvious culprit is the mission turn limits. Apparentely this was done because overwatch was too strong and they wanted more fast paced/tense gameplay.\n\nUnfortunately it's not well implemented, I don't know if its better on other difficulties but on Ironman/commander you barely have enough time to get from point A to B. This makes lots of abilities and even the sharpshooter class quite useless. Why would I carefuly place my sniper on a roof top to flank the enemy if I know I won't have enough time to get her to the evac point in time? Combine this with some extremely powerful enemies like sectoids that appear early and often and you got yourself a major headache.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum the Ranger and Specialist are much stronger for the pace of the game, the specialist being especially crucial in the hacking missions.\n\nThere are also lots of reports of bad performance, I've been lucky enough not to get any but I also turned down certain performance killing options. But from a game that is supposed to be a pc exclusive and was delayed to make sure it's flawless, it's very dissapointing.\n\nOn the bright side the graphics and sound are great. Executing a perfect ambush against a group of enemies is extremely satisfying (unfortunately you rarely get the chance to do this because you have to hurry so much.\n\nI have no doubt that with a few patches/modding this game will shine and I will have no problem recommending it, but right now (especially with the price tag) I can't do so.\n\n\nTLDR version :\n\n+ Great sound and graphics\n+ Ambushes are very satisfying\n+ I love the new revamped classes, especially the specialist.\n+ Still the same heartpumping X-com action.\n\n-Mission timers for almost EVERY mission\n-some very powerful enemies early on with little way to counter them\n-Performance problems\n\nP.S.

The short of it is that if you liked and played XCOM 1 for any significant amount of time then you are almost guaranteed to enjoy XCOM 2.\n\nGreat new additions or significant improvements:\nRNG: The huge role random chance played in the core mechanics of XCOM 1 was something that really bothered me and many other players. Thankfully, in this iteration, there are so many more ways of dealing guaranteeing damage that it is relatively simple to mitigate RNG almost completely with the appropriate style of play. A few things allow this: first off more abilities that are guaranteed to deal damage including combat protocol on the specialist and weapon upgrades that deal dmg on missed shots, cover is more destructible this time around which allows you to easily expose enemies for reliable shots and most importantly the way the game works now allows and even encourages aggressive flanking. It is not uncommon to get 90-100% shot success on most missions mid way through the campaign now as a result.\n\nAggression and overwatch spam: Due to the way the maps were configured and the constant threat of activating additional groups of enemies, a very defense oriented and overwatch centered tactical play style was considered optimal in XCOM 1. This is entirely not the case in XCOM 2. The way the maps are setup now, it feels like you have much more room to maneuver around the map without fatally exposing your squad. With the concealment mechanic which lets you sneak up on the aliens and with the presence of turn limits on many more missions this time around, the game actually encourages an aggressive playstyle where you take out enemy groups with 1-2 turns of activating them through aggressive flanking and, as is my preference, heavy use of explosives. Another important aspect of this is that using explosives no longer equates to losing the loot you desperately need to fund your operations. It’s a little bit more complicated than that but generally speaking you don’t have to stress so much about not blowing up the aliens this time around.\n\nAdditional customization options: I really wasn’t into tweaking the appearance of my soldiers in XCOM 1 that much but with the mind blowing amount of customization options available now, I’m really getting attached to some of my soldiers that I’ve decked out to look badass. The character pool system which lets saved soldiers randomly appear in your campaign as recruits or VIPs or scientists and engineers is also quite brilliant and unexpected allowing for favorite soldiers to effortlessly reappear in a new campaign. With the out of the box support for mods through steam workshop, the already staggering number of options will only grow.\n\nThings which are problematic:\nUnresponsiveness: I had this complaint with XCOM 1 as well. What I’m talking about is how the game loves to take control away from you in the middle of the action, locking the camera and disabling input while it makes you stare at a “new” enemy that you’ve already seen before accompanied by Central or the Doctor essentially telling you what you most likely already know. There is seemingly more of that this time around and some abilities, in particular gremlin abilities on the specialist have unnecessarily long animations for you to endure. Some of this also applies to the UI in the macro game (the avenger and geoscape). Transferring from the geoscape to the armory menu for instance, take entirely too long and clicking while the animation is in progress may end up sending you to another menu accidentally which only serves to frustrate the matter more.\n\nUI streamlining: In the course of trying to make the UI less dense, a lot of useful information has been buried further down in menus. This leads to a lot of unnecessary clicking to find important bits of information and makes comparing some stats across soldiers unjustifiably painful. The biggest culprit of course, is not being able to see vital soldier stats side by side across soldiers, including their hp and what upgrades they have installed on themselves and their gear. There are several other places where the streamlined approach makes information difficult to discern or understand due to ambiguity, but all this one can get used to eventually, even though some frustration will be encountered along the way. I suspect this is once again a symptom of PC games being constrained by a UI designed for a controller. It’s not a major gripe, but it is something which should have been improved in this iteration and not the other way around as it stands now.\n","February 9","true","47.6"," 150 of 222 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","150","222","2","11"

The tactical combat from the original returns with some additional units and mechanics that takes it to the next level. The small changes like additional focus on timed missions helped the game in the big picture a lot, and the improved balance/skill trees made every class a great boon in the right situation. The simulation portion of the game may have been streamlined....but it was for the better in my opinion, as it makes an impact on your combat performance directly. The visuals for the most part are nice, although it will take you out the experience as well with some bad glitches. The story makes a bit more sense this time around and while its filled with scifi tropes, it does the job. This would be a shoe-in purchase if the performance issues, load times, and glitches are taken care of, because they REALLY create a major problem in the end, as I would have stopped playing if I wasn't formal reviewing the game. If you've got a backlog: play through it first, and wait for some of the issues to be fixed.\n\nLists:\nMy Positives:\nThe well known combat is still as good as ever, with incremental improvements. Difficult but smartly put together.\nClass balance seems to be there a bit more this time around..Psy operatives were useful and still strong, but a great grenadier or ranger could give them a run for their money.\nSimulation elements wisely refined, and seemed to make the difference in the battle in the long run.\nLike the addition of more timed missions: it forces  less conservative play, and put your units more in danger, but not to the point where it was unwinnable.\nGreat character customization added that makes the sting of losing a soldier that much harder, when you've put the effort in crafting them from the bottom up. Your soldiers also can have a nice in-game personality that actually shows up in the lines.\nGreat move on Firaxis part to put in mod support on day one. I expect a lot to be done, as there's a lot of potential in the various weapons/units/etc.\nThe secondary equipment makes a huge difference this time around, and there was actually huge reasons to take it along as opposed to another med pack.\nImproved visuals, in particular with character designs. Like the simple yet effective designs of the Viper and the Gatekeeper.\nFor those who really want it, Firaxis put several autosaves in there at the start of a mission and last turn. If you're a cheater. Cause it's cheating.\nMy Negatives:\nHate, hate the new graze system. It adds an element to combat that you don't know what it directly does in terms of percent probability for it to happen, and is generally an unknown factor. It's the one thing you don't know, and it will REALLY get on your nerves.\nPanic system seems to mean less then before.\nHeld together by glue and string, it seems. The game can run great at times, but when something goes wrong, bad things happen to not only the performance, but the in game mechanics get messed with as well. It's unstable.\nThe loading times. My god the loading times. At one point, it took 3 minutes,  27 seconds to load into the next portion of the game. Unoptimized, the game is not.\nGlitch Fest 2000. Hits a wide spectrum of issues, from graphical, to camera, to in-game affecting. Takes you right of the experience. It's funny at times....but really annoying at others. Especially when the camera decides to show you a wall because it can't figure out jack ♥♥♥♥.\nThe music doesn't do the job like the original. It just doesn't have the punch, it's good....but compared to the original, it just doesn't work at ALL.","February 10","true","33.0"," 219 of 335 people (65%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","65","219","335","16","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/268500/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Twenty years have passed since the conclusion of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and we lost. The alien menace has convinced the XCOM council to join them, now calling themselves Advent. Advent has completely taken over the world promising advanced tech, medicine and world peace. The biggest problem is they rule with an iron fist. The XCOM program lives on in the form of a resistance.\n\nWelcome back to the world of XCOM. Enemy Unknown was released in 2012, and a lot has changed and a lot has stayed the same. XCOM, for those unfamiliar with the series, are military strategy games that have always been about decision making. Whether the decision is one about what equipment to build, what tech to research, or giving orders to soldiers in the field; your decisions make the game. This series was one of the first to use permanent death for squad mates.\n\nIf one dies, they do not come back. This made players very cautious on how to use their squad, or even which squad mates to send in. Do you send in your most experienced? Or do you take a chance and send in a couple veterans and a couple of rookies? Keeping in mind that, of course, the veterans are better and have more skills, unfortunately, if they die you lose access to all their training and skills. It was also one of the first series to introduce recovery time for injured characters. If a soldier got injured in the field, they need time to recover. Hope you have some reserves.\n\nWhere XCOM 2 really shines are with the improvements they made over the last game. In the previous game, players picked where they wanted their base to be. Different locations gave different bonuses. In this game your base is mobile, making you harder to detect and capture. In the command room is a holographic map of the world, and when looking at the it several choices are available at any given time. Should you make contact with a resistance cell in another part of the world? Go steal the supplies from Advent forces nearby? Or should you take out that black site in hopes of securing more soldiers, scientists or engineers? This is a massive switch from the previous game where players really couldn’t move around and all they could do is scan the world for trouble until trouble presented itself.\n\nThe alien invasion story has been one of the biggest areas of improvement since Enemy Within. Its characters talk more, fleshing out a story and creating a sense of companionship despite the fact they’re clearly just a cipher for each part of your mobile base’s inner workings. There’s more mystery here, and great cutscenes go a long way to layering on more and more intrigue as you discover bigger,more sinister revelations about the alien’s intentions. To say much more would be a disservice to the great surprises, but the game’s narrative setup - an oppressive occupying force vs a struggling resistance - doesn’t just allow for a greater storytelling: it makes for a much stronger marriage between story and gameplay.\n\nXCOM 2 introduces plenty of new gameplay elements that fit this new style, like player-placed extraction zones, ambushes, and a complete restructuring of character classes to reflect the focus on guerrilla combat. Players will find themselves thinking hard about which classes to bring into a particular firefight, and finding the right combination of soldier types will be a hard-fought trial-and-error process. Likewise, when players start in concealment – a new stealth aspect that is brand new to the franchise – they’ll find themselves tediously organizing ambushes to maximize their overwatch impact.\n\nXCOM 2 is a serious strategy game, even on normal difficulty. The AI rarely makes stupid moves, and will respond to your mistakes with absolutely brutal efficiency. My most common mistake in the first few hours was advancing too far forward with one trooper, spotting a group of enemies, and watching the pioneer get slaughtered with their companions too far away to help. This is a crucial part of how XCOM 2 works – allow your troops to get isolated from each other, or leave a flank exposed, and you’ll be punished.\n\nYou’ll need to use every trick at your disposal in XCOM 2, as the ADVENT aren't here to play around. The aliens from the Enemy Unknown have been settled on Earth for some time and are more powerful for it. Sectoids - once the lowest ranking enemy in the game - are now powerful mid-game units that can disorientate and debuff your units while ADVENT troops (humans modified by the aliens) flank and close the distance.\n\nThe ADVENT forces are varied and require a considerable amount of tactical thought. Even amongst its foot soldiers there are officers, grunts, sword-wielding assault troopers and heavily armoured damage-soakers. The aliens also bring mechs and robots to the party, as well as more grotesque creatures like the gooey ‘Faceless’ and reptilian ‘Venom’ units. XCOM 2 has gone a long way to make the ADVENT seem both human and alien. Facilities and surroundings will bear all the hallmarks of Earth’s near-future yet be defended by snake-men and dimension-hopping guardians.\n\nAs expected your trusty soldiers will gain promotions as they complete missions and kill aliens and like in the XCOM: EU you get to choose one of two skills to unlock. These skills are mostly a new type of attack, but can sometimes be a passive ability like returning fire when attacked or being unable to be hit after killing an enemy the turn before. If you do happen to change your mind, you are now able to retrain abilities using one of the new buildings, the Advanced War Centre, which can also increase the healing down time of injured soldiers,\n\nCombat in XCOM 2 is very similar to the combat from the previous games, each soldier is permitted two actions per turn. These actions can be made up of movements, firing at the enemy, using a grenades, healing or reloading. When you do lay down some sweet guerrilla justice on the alien overlords, there is a chance for loot drops, these can be either weapon upgrades or materials for advanced research. Weapon upgrades are a great addition to XCOM 2, they can add things like increased critical chance, reloads that don’t cost an action or larger ammo clip size and many more.\n\nXCOM 2 has given pretty much every graphical feature in the previous game a polish to update it to modern standards and it goes without saying that the game is flawless in its design and looks. Every battlefield oozes style and really set the scene for your operations against the ADVENT. Soldiers grimace, wince and shout as they fight, while hair, toolkits and weapons sway in convincing ways. Enemy and friendly animations are smooth and detailed - from leaping over barriers to climbing ladders - and I can’t recall any time where my immersion was jarred by clunky movement.\n\nSimilarly, composer Tim Wynn has done a fabulous job in creating an epic action-movie feel that accompanies the game. The game’s soundtrack is cinematic in its crescendos and swells and palpably tense when things are going awry. The sound effects are also spot-on: guns crack, rattle and boom while alien mag-weapons make suitably science-fiction pops, zaps and fizzes.\n\nDespite being a fan of the XCOM series as a whole I never expected this new entry to be as polished, intricate, immersive, beautiful and exciting as it is. I’ve had to tear myself away from the screen multiple times because I’d got so invested I’d forgotten to eat. XCOM 2 is one of those titles that appear once in a blue moon and set the benchmark for gaming; from start to finish there wasn’t a moment I did not completely enjoy playing it. XCOM 2 is one of the greatest strategy games of all time.","March 3","true","359.6"," 109 of 164 people (66%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","66","109","164","11","3"

However, I'm going full ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ critic here, leaving my love for the franchise aside and will do my best to give a fair review. And as usual, I'll start with the stuff the game doesn't do right. Luckily, there's only three things:\n\nFirst and most important, the difficulty spikes. I'm not sure who tested the game, but he was high as f#cking f#ck. I know XCOM is not known for being easy and forgibing but COME ON, THE EARLY GAME HAS A BIGGER DIFFICULTY SPIKE THAN CORRUPTED PEOPLE ON THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT! Since the second mission (the first one being the tutorial, unless you disabled it), you'll be usually facing with normal and fair enemies like the ADVENT troops AND THEN THE SECTOIDS COME ARROUND. This early on, the Sectoids have MORE HP than your soldiers, have three powerful PSI attacks, and also a Bracelet-Gun they never seem to f#cking use for some reason. And it's not like in XCOM 1 when they could waste their turn to make another Sectoid better or at times cause panic. Here they still have the panic skill, and can also Mind-control AND reanimate dead people into zombies. ON THE SECOND MISSION. If that ain't enough to ♥♥♥♥ you off, wait until the game tasks you to "hack" an ADVENT Officer. It's similar to capturing aliens in XCOM 1, but with a LITTLE SURPRISE the game forgot to tell you about: hacking an ADVENT Officer spawns a MID-GAME enemy, which early on will feel like out-right cheating and artificial difficulty. This enemy can TELEPORT AND INSTANTLY FLANK YOU, can cause some sort of Black-Hole which will instantly unload your weapons AND explode for too much damage on the early game on the next turn, has double the HP than any of your soldiers by that moment, AAAAAAAAAAAND will split in half when you injure it. Now you'd think that splitting in half makes it easier to defeat, but no. It doesn't. His clone will usually spawn in the completely direction, and they share no cool-downs. If you're not careful, you'll go from facing one Codex to facing TWO, THREE OR EVEN FOUR CODEX. Sure turning a hard battle into f#cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThe second people is one I don't really give a ♥♥♥♥ about, but a ton of people do; Performance. This game is not well optimized. I usually blame games for it, but I must admit it looks good and it's a turn-based game, so playing in low FPS ain't that much of an issue... But I must admit that it got old pretty fast, and the devs yet have to fix most of that, as it took them nearly two weeks to release ONE update. No idea what's going on with that.\n\nThe third and last problem are the bugs. I haven't played since last week but Oh God I was finding some weird crap. Most of them are LUCKILY only animation errors, but still there's some weird crap out there that will make you either mad or lose it completely. Things like rooms on the ship not loading and literally being see-through as there's LITERALLY NOTHING IN THERE. Things like characters stuck on the wrong animations, now being forced to teleport arround the map and for some reason take 30 seconds to do each action. Things like your character showing as he's on the completely wrong place where he should be. Those are fun. However, thing as having one of your soldiers stuck in mid-air while enemies fire at him, and forced to use EXPLOSIVES to take him down, literally bleeding out, IS NOT FUN AT ALL. There's also weird crap such as pieces of buildings floating all over the places, sh#tting all over gravity, or both XCOM soldiers and aliens dropping through the floor. Things like that make you even wonder if the game was properly beta-tested.\n\nThat being said though, what do we got left? A seriously good sequel for a seriously good game.\n\nGameplay, ignoring the early game insane spikes, is enjoyable, fun and adds more flavour to a really enjoyable XCOM 1 experience. There's a bigger focus on explosives on this game (as they weren't really that good on the first one), and that goes hand to hand with the mostly completely destructible escenarios.\n\nAnd talking about maps, they're randomized. One time or two they looked similar, but they're always different and that's something I totally love.\n\nCustomization is not only back, it went Super Saiyan: there are AN INSANE TON of options, and it trully feels amazing.\n\nEven better than that though, proper Mod support. And the workshop of Steam already has some fun things on it. Personally I only went so far with customization mods but OH GOD, IS IT FUN TO KILL ALIENS WITH CLASSY TOP HATS AND OVER-SIZED MARIACHI HATS.\n\nI haven't played multiplayer yet, so I'll avoid that, but ♥♥♥♥ing hell it was worth the money. And it already has DLC's coming, which I decided to pre-order as I do trust there guys. However, the price tag will scare people off. WAIT for a sale. 50€ ain't cheap at all.\n\nJust get ready to miss point-blank shotgun shots. It will happen. That's XCOM, baby!","February 16","true","99.0"," 128 of 196 people (65%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","65","128","196","27","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reidskie/recommended/268500/","Reidskie","Reidskie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Reidskie/","165 products in account","I really do enjoy XCOM 2 but the bugs and technical glitches are just too much to overlook. I have a 980 Ti and I constantly see frame drops. Kill cams are constantly broken. Aliens are suspended in mid air or teleporting around. But the worst of it all is the game breaking bugs.\n\nAfter playing Commander/Ironman for 15 hours and constantly getting my butt kicked because I just wasn't good enough I dropped down to Veteran/Ironman. 7 hours in and I'm doing great. No deaths, mag and gauss weapons, predator armor. I'm feeling pretty confident. And then I go on a dark VIP extraction mission and it all goes to hell. A bug treats the mission as failed after I destroyed the VIP's car even though I have him over my shoulder 30 squares away. Then the game calls in reinforcements right on the evac zone in back to back turns. Even though I could have killed them the game treats the zone as overrun and moves it to a place that I can't physically get to in the time left. So that's it. My squad is captured and there is nothing I can do. So my best run is now over and I'm questioning why do I even want to try again when next time something worse could happen 20 hours in.\n\nI'm sure Firaxis is trying to fix these bugs but it is just really disappointing to see a game that was in development for so long and even delayed multiple times is still released in this state. Then again, I guess that is just the norm for video games nowadays.\n\n** UPDATE on February 27th, 2016 **\nSo I have beaten XCOM 2 on Veteran/Ironman difficulty and it took about 28 hours. I went through the game being much more cautious then in my previous attempts. Sometimes I did not attempt a gorilla ops mission that would have given me the best reward because it had something to do with evac and I just didn't want to risk the game bugging out and me losing a squad again.\n\nWhile there were a few bugs here and there (enemies suspended in mid air after I destroyed the floor beneath them, somehow triggering pods when I couldn't see the aliens but they could magically see me, kill zone not triggering on enemies that clearly moved, mutons seeing me through a door and throwing a grenade at me) the game was rather uneventful.\n\nThe problem I now have with the game is that its difficulty snowballed and didn't push me to experiment with my tactics. Once my soldiers levelled up it was hard not taking them on missions and levelling up replacements because the aliens simply did too much damage. Also my tactic of bring at least two grenadiers (and some soldiers in amor suits with rocket launchers) got boring pretty quick. The problem was whenever I tried to deviate from it by not using my grenadiers or holding them back to the end of the turn I found that I just didn't have the fire power. The game seems really balanced around AoE/shredding damage and killing the aliens before they get any shots on you especially because of the aggressive timers which force you into combat.\n\nThe missions also felt more repetitive than XCOM 1. The procedurally generated maps were great. I never really felt that I knew exactly was coming next but the missions were always the same. The guerrilla ops barely changed. The retaliation missions were always the same and you knew exactly when they were coming. The alien facilities were almost identical. The exact same tactics worked on every single one. I was bored my alien facilities by the third one and only did them to lower the avatar project to stall for more time to get supplies. In XCOM 1, looking back with my rose coloured glasses, the randomness of the alien attacks I feel like I enjoyed more. The different types of alien crafts, the landings versus shoot downs, the terror missions which you sometimes didn't see coming.\n\nAlso story missions felt better spaced out in XCOM 1. In XCOM 2 I probably went 12 hours between story missions because after the black site there was nothing pushing me on. I literally had taken out every single alien facility on the planet before I attempted a story mission. There was no tech or advancements behind those missions on then the next story mission to eventually get you the final mission.\n\nAll of this sounds really negative but I did enjoy a lot of the game.\n- The geoscape was great. Tough choices all around. I felt it dragged the game on a little bit because it was hard to get the supplies needed to upgrade everything to tier 3 so I definitely killed time for a month just waiting for attacks because I didn't want to attempt any story missions.\n- There definitely were some missions where even with what I feel are my OP tactics of never-ending explosives and mimic bacons I did feel like I was just walking over the aliens.\n- The character customization really drew me in. There were so many storylines of all my soldiers and their amazing exploits that are all just inside my head. The ability to customize every character ahead of time and just have them randomly showed up really pulled me in.\n\nOn the whole as a die-hard XCOM fan I did enjoy it and I'll probably come back in 2-3 months when some DLC and patches have come out and make my Commander/Ironman attempt. But I am very afraid that I'm just going to have to resort to my same boring tactics again. I'll probably make a couple of attempts at different tactics, maybe rush psionics instead of mag weapons or something but I'm just a bit worried that the game at higher difficulties just isn't balanced for that.","February 10","false","60.8"," 212 of 339 people (63%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","63","212","339","13","14"

I mean seriously they don't even ♥♥♥♥ing dodge it's literally just a pair of words that appear saying: Dodge Grazed: # damage.\nAnother thing the RNG (I really don't care how much you argue, there are so many variables thing you can do it literally is random, if you reload you won't get the same mission you would before for an example), the RNG, it's just, it feels so terrible, I really do feel like I'm getting ♥♥♥♥ed over with how many good shots I miss and how many impossible shots the aliens hit.\nAlong with some of the new or just old revamped enemies. The berserker for an example the first time I found it I found two, the first one I easily killed, the second charged across the battle field with 1 health and knocked out one of my team members after being missed by my Sniper and Heavy at point blank with a cannon and a revolver (I will continue to call them that even though that isn't thei names because they are almost exactly the same thing).\nAnother thing to mention the game doesn't explain itself well at all, like I didn't jump on upgrading armor right away because I didn't realize it automatically equiped every single soldier instead of me having to buy each piece seperately, the same goes for the weapons. (Maybe I was stupid and didn't read something but either way was that system really something that needed to be changed, don't get me wrong I love this new change but it's pretty small)\nAnother thing I don't feel they explained the avenger as well as they could have since you're are going to be expirementing in order to find out the new travel mechanic.\nAs per usual the roof fazes in and out of existence whether or not you want it to, the tutorial is like the last game, hand walking you through it so slowly (if not more slowly) you want to peel your skin off.\nBut like I said there are good things as well,\nThe new map system though confusing is actually simple and I myself actually really like it, the events that happen are pretty cool as well, the new enemies are terrifying and badass including the redesigns (even though some may be a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) and they all have some actual lore reasons to back them up (even though they may still be a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and re-used over and over) being genetic therapy and hybridization, the game puts you in the thick of it right away, the new weapons, levels, textures are all awesome, hacking is something pretty cool as well skullmining is a good excuse to get rid of capturing aliens, this game is hard as hell, mutons are scary, your allies are awesome, the gameplay is pretty much the same except some improvements.\nListen I could go on forever on why this game is good and why this game is bad if you want to buy this game I'll leave you with this.\n\nGood luck commander.\n\nA small EDIT: I've noticed some reviews talking about fixing thing we don't like with mods, it's the whole Skyrim excuse we rate the game not its workshop.\nI'll give my own throw on the whole turn system while I'm at it, I think it was inspired by the meld system in Enemy Within's Long War modification but done in the wrong way. The Long War pushed you to ruch so you could get extra resources but this is rushing is the difference between failure and success and the life of your squad. It puts extra pressure on the player and I can't tell you how many times I've only escaped the mission with one turn remaining. Someone even said it's "realistic" in a game where we are fighting and fending of aliens that are superior more powerful in everyway in a world where each piece of the cities is a ♥♥♥♥ing triangle or a curve and the aliens apparently don't want to send the sectopads at us right off that bat.\nI can't believe people are even defending this mechanic with, "Oh it gets rid of turtling, not forcing you to run and gun", there are multiple things problems here. 1: Many of the aliens can ♥♥♥♥ turtles up anyways, such as the Berserker, Viper, Codex, Avatar, Andromedon,Sectoid(maybe), Chrysallid pack, Archon, and last but ♥♥♥♥ing painful Sectopod. 2: If it doesn't promote run and gun tactics why do I constantly come in at 1 turn? The only way I can think of completing later missions is actually stealthing the mission. 3: You know what else would stop turtling? A longer timer or some resources you had to rush to, like meld.\nAs for the Avatar project it is actually fine though it is actually still the same system of rushing except you can set it back which makes it a lot better.\nThere have also been reviews trying to support the bugs because it's "a new release" which is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t excuse to release a buggy mess or in this case give it a positive review.\nAlso if you disagree with this review just tell me if there is anything I didn't mention or you particularly disagree with.\nLittle bit of a hindsight, this game will completely screw your computer if you don't have a good video card so just make sure you have proper specs before entering. I'll probably redo this review around the time the expansion is released, who knows little may change.","February 5","false","78.4"," 148 of 233 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","148","233","7","2"

XCom2 delivers a great core game, playing off of the strengths of its predecessors, but a few design flaws (and a LOT of bugs and graphical issues) have sunk the game experience for me.\n\nPeople have already outlined those issues in detail, but a short list:\n\nEVERYTHING IS ON A TIMER (EVEN THE WORLD MAP). The aliens are working on  the "Avatar Project" (which might as well be named the Deus Ex Machina project), which ticks forward, often out of your control. God help you if you want to try to get anything done, because you'll be spending all your time on...\n\nRESOURCE DROPS. Yes, to get any supplies, you'll now have to sit over them, like a hen laying on an egg, to get any resources. However, you won't be able to do this, because...\n\nEVERYTHING IS ALWAYS ALARMING ALL THE TIME. Missions pop up all the time and while you're sometimes given a choice as to which one to do, you damned sure better do ONE of them, and best of luck because...\n\nYOU'RE S.O.L. IF YOUR A-TEAM DIES. I don't mind difficult games. In fact, I like the permadeath nature of XCom; it gives your missions and decisions weight and I'll admit having to fight the urge to save-scum when one of my favorite soldiers died. However, the random nature of your missions means that it's entirely possible to get three of those "not mandatory but actually pretty mandatory" missions outlined above, and if you take any damage at all, you'll have to bring in fresh recruits. Even by mid-campaign, Squaddies and Corporals are effectively useless because...\n\nTHE COVER MECHANICS AND TO HIT NUMBERS MAKE NO SENSE. I take a reasonably seasoned corporal with a Tier 2 railgun, put him directly next to a muton with no cover at all under the effects of suppression, and my to hit is... 18%. What? Are XCom soldiers half-stormtrooper? A big giant unit with big giant HP and armor is apparently faster than a speeding bullet. You'll be surprised when a stun lancer hits you literally through a wall because...\n\nTHE COVER MECHANICS MAKE LITERALLY NO SENSE. Hitting through walls? a 20% to hit percentage difference on two of the same creatures literally right next to each other? Sure, why not. I don't care anymore.\n\nI almost never buy anything on launch day, and like I said, I loved XCom EU/EW, and I was excited for this game. But there's a difference between difficulty and gimmick, and the challenge here is not winning the game by playing it; it's winning the game in spite of the game itself.\n\nFor now, I'm waiting on a patch to resolve the glitches and bugs (of which there are many), and to fine-tune the numbers, before I download some of the (excellent) mods and go back for another playthrough. There IS an excellent game here, I just hope Firaxis is able to squash enough of the bugs to create the game that should have been there at launch.\n","February 10","false","21.7"," 587 of 972 people (60%) found this review helpful 83 people found this review funny","60","587","972","83","25"

Also feels like marketing pushed the game to hard and let many annoying bug in just to keep release date. Shame for AAA game exclusive for PC.\n\nWhat need to be worked on:\n- Game crashes in various places (example: when you switches area in your ship while someone is talking to you)\n- Animation sometime freezes or laggy\n- Frame rate drops for no reason multiple times\n- Mostly the mission objective needs to be reached under a turn limit which eliminates "safe" or "go around/behind enemy" tactic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FyreNL/recommended/268500/","FyreNL","ＦｙｒｅＮＬ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FyreNL/","530 products in account",""We are extremely impressed with XCOM 2 project thus far, Firaxis. Your recent results were beyond my expectations... And that is not a statement i make lightly."\n\nWhile i have a small number of grievances here and there, they are fairly minor in comparison. With the recent games Starships and Beyond Earth, i was afraid Firaxis might've lost their touch. Though Beyond Earth was pretty decent, it was no near as fun, deep or satisfying as CiV5. XCOM 2 however restored my faith.\n\nTruly, XCOM 2 cranks its predecessor up to 11. As your opponents have grown in power and unpredictability, there's an even stronger reason to fear what potential weapon they might unleash upon you next. However, so have you. Everything feels powerful, dangerous and there's few things as satisfying as scoring a critical hit and watching a 3 meters tall monstrosity get blown away from a shotgun round. Though performance seems to be a littly wonky at times (framerate drops when in the Avenger or when deploying a flashbang grenade), it's been fairly stable for me with no bugs aside from the AI suddenly going idle once. For 16 hours of playtime on a newly released game, that's a pretty good thing in my book.\n\nExcellent production values shine everywhere. This is apparent in the smaller details as well, such as the great soundtrack and voice acting, soldier customization and the excellent atmosphere in map design that truly gives you a dystopian feel.\n\nNot to mention that XCOM2 has an amazingly badass Workshop. Where The Long War was pretty much the best alternative for the original, there's already a bunch of sweet stuff for you to go on, the game is really built to last on a strong mod community - while still providing a base game that's filled to the brim with content.\n\nThe only thing, gameplay wise that bothers me is that they've added a turn limit. You must complete the objective before the timer runs out, which is usually pretty tight. Though it gives off a feeling of hurry, anxiety and fear - for a game that's partially built on chance and tactics, it's frustrating and doesn't fit well. Thankfully there are mods in the Workshop that remove or increase the turn limit, of which the latter one i highly recommend using. While this is the biggest issue i have, it can be avoided entirely, so i guess it's not much to bother with.\n\n\nIn conclusion, any fan of XCOM or TBS will love it. Hell, i think anyone will enjoy it. And i have some very high hopes for the expansion and modding community. Possible GOTY!\n\nEdit: Seems performance issues are something some people are running into. None here, surprisingly, since nearly every game that's currently being released is full of bugs and performance issues. However, in my experience, XCOM 2 runs smoothly and without problems. Still, i would highly recommend taking proper precautions, such as giving the game's bug forum a read before picking up the game.","February 10","true","45.6"," 126 of 197 people (64%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","64","126","197","31","0"

The bugs, performance issues and turn limits are disappointing though.  It's bad enough that the aiming system seems mostly unchanged from EU/EW, but combined with the turn limits it is a very frustrating game to play at times. Rushing across maps while your own soldiers can't hit ♥♥♥♥ literally next to them at times makes for a worse experience than EU/EW, because at least you had time to try again in that game. I'm hoping someone does something about the turn limit.

Enemy Unknown was simply a better game\n\nEdit: Doubled my play time, Vipers are slightly less BS but can still grab through walls. Turns out Sectoids can mindcontrol and run away which is.... fun... Timed missions are too common, game is more fun without a time window. Free turns are still super annoying. Concealment is not as common as I'd like it to be. Shaken takes far too long to drop off without doing a mission and with doing a mission it's pretty luck based if they get hit or not\n\nSome good points, Greivous wounds cause scars which is pretty cool, Getting a 5 squad is easy and a 6 squad about the same, PCM (PCS?) can give you a nice bit of specialization or plug some holes.

If you are a fan of turn based strategy combat, and a minor basebuilding overworld that involves an early-mid game frantic pace where you juggle resources and make key decisions, Xcom 2 should be right up your alley.\n\nIt improves on almost every facet of the original, though the base building is a little bare bones in comparison, since the nature of this game is quite different and your mothership is your home base so naturally, there are a lot fewer choices to make.  If you played the first one, you will be right at home, nothing is so vastly different that you won't be able to infer what its role or function is.\n\nThe story is pretty well done, albeit a little sparse, and towards the end it does feel a little anti-climatic but really Xcom is about having a badass group of marines and the amazing combat.  A gripe many people will have (myself included) will be in regards to the some what questionable RNG that determines the success or failure of your tactics within the game.  When I think of 80-95% chance of success, I think of it as an almost sure thing.  When you miss 4 of those in a row, you begin to really question how accurate the numbers depicted upon the screen are.... but as everyone says Xcom is Xcom, and this is just part of the experience.  You can miss a 95% and you can hit a 20%.  The game isn't without its moments where you'd like to put an axe through your monitor.\n\nUnfortunately, there are definitely some performance issues and bugs/glitches with the current game.  The game, as impressive as it looks, is certainly not what you'd expect to push your gaming rig to its limits, yet your frames will drop inexplicably, mini cutscenes will stutter, and overall you will notice some choppiness.  Where as it's not aggregious for me (GTX980 TI, 16 gb RAM, SSD, I74790k), it still is bothersome that this game isn't running flawlessly.\n\nThere is quite a bit of graphical clipping issues, it seems the engine has trouble dealing with structures, walls, doors, windows, and multi-level buildings.  Often your character will stick his gun through a seemingly solid object, or try to smash out a window that is already smashed, walk through a door, be pulled through a building, shot through solid cover, etc.   Where as it is annoying and takes away from immersion, the game is still so robust, deep, and rewarding that I found myself looking past it.  It's just too damn enjoyable to let those things drag down the experience.\n\nOne would hope Firaxis is aware and addressing these issues, because once they are fixed, this game is a VERY strong contender for GOTY.   Certainly, this is the best tactical strategy game I've played, and the extensive modding capabilities the game has only means great things when you get guys like the creators of the Long War  working on all manners of new content - for free.\n\nAll in all, despite the somewhat unforgivable performance issues of a PC-Exclusive, this game is definitely what I would consider a must-buy for anyone who is a fan of the genre.\n\n9.5/10","February 10","true","63.1"," 142 of 227 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","142","227","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Iwenttojared/recommended/268500/","Iwenttojared","Daszune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Iwenttojared/","245 products in account","I'll start by saying I'm really enjoying this game and don't regret getting it, however I don't reccomend buying it at full price in the state that it's in. If you can get it cheaper then go for it, provided you're a fan of EU/EW. XCOM 2 is more of the same, with a bit of different. There's a lot of good here and a lot of bad, but the bad is fixable, it's just that it shouldn't have been there to begin with.\n\nPros:\n-The new base management and overworld stuff is pretty fun and in my opinion makes it feel like you're not just sitting and waiting for something to happen. Instead of having to try to manage a bunch of "feal levels", but only being able to affect one at a time, there's only one meter to worry about, and there are multiple ways to manage it. Having to make contact with different countries instead of having to prevent losing them gives you a bit more option as to how you approach things.\n-The new/updated classes feel a lot more balanced and interesting. Each one having two distinct specializations makes your squad more diverse, however a couple of them do feel underpowered, specifically the scout and combat hacker trees.\n-The weapon changes make things a lot less tedious in some aspects, but moreso in others. Pistols on the sharpshooter class are fantastic, they're decently powerful and give your sniper a way to fight in close quarters and able to attack/overwatch after moving. Being able to attack or move after reloading is just great, so taking away secondaries on all the other classes doesn't really hurt.\n\nMeh:\n-Turn timers, I know people are so divided on these which is why I put them in meh instead of cons, but I dislike them. I feel that they force you to play a certain way, even if you don't want to. I've had missions where I had to rush through enemies or else I wouldn't make it in time, causing me to risk my soldiers. There are already lots of mods to change how they work, whether it be increasing turns, reducing the amount of missions that use them, or outright getting rid of them.\n-concealment adds a nice way to setup ambushes, however in most cases it doesn't work out like you think it would. This ties in to turn timers, in that the timers are counting down even while you're trying to set up your ambush. It's just not viable to try to tactically ambush the enemy when you have to get to the evac zone in 8 turns. Also having all enemies suddenly just know where you are when you break concealment can easily lead to you being surrounded if you're not careful.\n\nCons:\n-Performance issues out the ♥♥♥. Supposed to be patched.\n-Glitches out the ♥♥♥. Supposed to be patched.\n-I don't know if it's a glitch or just poor design, but line of sight is just super wonky. I've had enemies attacking me through walls, stun lancers meleeing people through the floor above them, and worst of all, snakes pulling my guys through as many as three walls with no holes or windows in any of them, effectively dooming them.\n-The difficulty curve is steep. Really steep. Within 5 missions I was fighting against armored enemies that could destroy my cover, incapacitate my troops, and almost kill them in one attack, while I was still researching t2 weapons and armor. Enemies pop up randomly one after another, giving you almost no time to adjust your strategy.\n-Dodge. If that's not specific enough, most enemies have a chance to dodge, causing you to do greatly reduced damage. I know the discussion of rng has been done to death, but sometimes it feels like they just always dodge.\n-Your soldiers' wounded level seems to be completely arbitrary. Soldiers that take 10% damage get gravely wounded and are out of the fight for a month to recover 2 hp. I've read of people having soldiers take over 50% damage and only being lightly wounded, but take 2 fall damage and be gravely wounded.\n\nHopefully they can patch the performance and glitches, with that I'd say it's worth it, but until then no. Other than that it's up to you whether these things bother you or not.","February 9","false","22.3"," 147 of 236 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","147","236","7","2"

Much less write a review.\n\nI'm giving it a negative review, because all the issues that were raised in reviews haven't been addressed for the launch copy:\n\n* The frame rates drops constantly (my pc is more than good enough to run it) almost constantly from the start of a mission to the end. So much so that it is sometimes impossible to keep up with.\n* The camera angles are awful at times, grenades explode off screen before they are due to, walls block the sight entirely, sometimes the alien's move is just a black screen so you have no idea what is going on. You can literally lose a soldier and have no way of knowing how.\n* There are excessive short pauses for no reason after actions and during some actions (seemingly at random).\n* Sometimes a person's body will be facing the exact opposite direction to where they are shooting.\n\nAs well as that, a large number of missions have arbitrary turn limits, which are punishingly short. They only give you enough time to complete a mission comfortably if you rush most of the time. And rely on purely run and gun tactics. It removes any chance or opportunity to actually use strategy and tactics.\n\n\nMost of these issues will hopefully be addressed with hotfix patchs, and working with the graphic card companies to get out some optimised drivers ASAP. But that doesn't excuse the game being released in this state. If this is the standard quality of a game at launch then this is the last game I'll ever pre-order.\n\nWe need to make sure companies know this isn't acceptable or tolerated, or it will just keep happening *Looks at Bethesda*.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend waiting until the performance issues and bugs have been patched before purchasing. Once all the performance problems and bugs have been resolved, and there are plenty of mods to allow people to tweat the turn limit system, this will be an absolutely superb and very worthy sequel to X-Com.\n\nP.S. Fan(atic) boys please get your tongues out of the ♥♥♥♥ of Firaxis Games (more like Fixathis Game). Having it in there makes it harder for the aliens to probe them!\n\nP.P.S. the outside game testing period for this game must have been hilarious:\n"Are the snakes supposed to be able to grab people through walls?"\n"Why do my soldiers keep dropping through the floor as they move?"\n"Is it normal for everyone to be shooting through walls with bullets, when the wall is right in front of them?"\n"Why did my character appear on a different part of the map when the snake grabbed me?"\n"Are there supposed to be constant pauses before and after every action?"\n"Why does this game run like Crysis 2 on a Gameboy?"\n"Is it normal for the screen to go black during the enemy moves time?"\n"Why are the voices telling me important things constantly cut off?"\n"Is it normal for a soldier to have their body face the opposite direction when they shoot?"\n"Why are there such long pauses when the enemy does something?"\n"Is it normal for a soldier who has been knocked unconscious to die instantly for no reason?"\n"Are units supposed to have melee combat against each other from two different floors of a building?"\n"Why are you releasing the game when it clearly needs at least another month of work?"\n"What are you doing!? Where are you taking me!? no, No, NOOOOO"\n\nP.P.P.S The one thing I do have to give them credit for is creating a game that has both an 'anti-addiction' and 'anti-piracy' mechanism built into the game.\nThe 'anti-addiction' works by having levels that are so hilariously impossible - due to objectives being destroyed before you can secure the area, or having to take on a whole army whilst getting from A to B in 12 moves' that you'll find yourself literally saying "oh f*** this s***" or "oh f*** off" or my current favourite "stupid f***ing game!" that you'll rage quit from a single player game, and not want to go anywhere near it for at least a day. It's impossible for even the most perverse and self hating sadist to be addicted to.\nAs for the 'anti-piracy', all it takes is for a would-be pirate to read just a few honest reviews of this game (so none of the mainsteam ones then), or to watch someone play it for five minutes, and they'll realise they don't want anything to do with it, and wouldn't even take it for free.","February 4","false","58.3"," 858 of 1,449 people (59%) found this review helpful 148 people found this review funny","59","858","1","148","68"

Unfortunately Commander, there's some bad news.  It turns out that was actually some kind of simulation that the aliens used to understand our tactics, so they could figure out how to beat us.  Earth's citizens have been living under a "peaceful" alien rule for 20 years, and you're now part of an underground resistance force, trying to stop the aliens' secret, sinister plan, before its too late.\n\nJust like the previous game, Xcom2 is divided into two distinct areas of gameplay: the base, and the missions. During the base phase you can research new technologies, build better weapons, armours and equipment, recruit and train your soldiers and manage your economy. Missions involve taking a squad of upto 6 soldiers to achieve objectives such as protecting some civilians, stealing some intel, recovering an item or destroying an alien base. Combat is the same turn based style as before.\n\nAlthough Xcom 2 is a good game, it didn't quite excite me as much as the previous game did, and I can't quite put my finger on why. I think it might just be because I've played Enemy Unknown/Within for a combined 122 hours across 5 successful campaigns, so although Xcom 2 is bigger and better, there's also an element of "more of the same".\n\nThe Good\n\n•	Your soldiers have a fantastic range of abilities. I found every class of soldier to be extremely useful.\n•	Large variety of aliens with unique abilities including mind control, stun, poison, disable weapons, area of effect attacks, shield allies, teleport, clone, shapeshift ... and probably more that I'm forgetting.\n•	The combination of above two points results in lots of tactical depth. I often spent a few minutes on my turn just analysing the situation and considering all my options.\n•	You can upgrade your soldiers' weapons with mods recovered during missions that give special abilities, including reloading the weapon without it costing a turn, bigger clip size, a percentage chance to attack multiple times on your turn, and a percentage chance to get an instant kill no matter how much health the alien has (I actually killed the most powerful robotic enemy in one shot thanks to this, which was a really cool moment).\n•	The campaign is longer than the previous game. It took me 40 hours to finish, compared to 25 for EU/EW.\n•	More visual customisation options for your soldiers.\n\nThe Bad\n\n•	The story is fairly generic and none of the characters are particularly interesting. It doesn't help that the player character never speaks. If there's another sequel, I'd like to see a bit of Mass Effect style banter in between missions with the guys back at your base, to add a bit of personality.\n•	Poor technical performance. I saw several examples of the action camera not actually showing me the action because my view was obscured by scenery (walls, trees, etc). I saw countless occasions of both the aliens and my soldiers attacking through solid walls (both shooting and melee). And the framerate stutters horrendously when loading into and out of a mission.\n•	Frustratingly high number of missions where there is an extremely tight turn limit to achieve the objective. For example, hack a data relay before it shuts down in 8 turns. The data relay is so far away from your starting point that it takes 3 turns to get there moving full distance each turn. And of course there are 2 groups of aliens between you and the objective, which will probably take 2 turns each to kill if you do everything perfectly. These kind of missions feel like there's zero room for error, but at the same time, you just have to rush forward, abandoning any kind of intelligent tactics. The absolute worst missions are when you have to stop the aliens from destroying a data relay, which is on the other side of the map, and the aliens are already shooting it on turn 1.\n•	"Concealment" is a wasted mechanic. Your squad starts most missions in stealth mode, and the aliens don't attack you until you are "revealed", which happens if you open fire, or enter their line of sight. But its pretty much impossible to stealth an entire mission because there are always aliens next to the objective, and so the few times I tried to sneak past a group of aliens, I actually ended up in a bad situation because when I was inevitably seen, I'd find myself surrounded. I quickly figured out that it was safer to ignore concealment, and just attack immediately.\n•	There are occasions where you have to choose between 3 missions that have different rewards (and penalties for the ones you ignore), and just like EU/EW, you can still only do 1 mission, even if you have enough healthy soldiers for 2 or more full squads. All those resources, all that fancy tech, and we still can't build a second dropship, or at least capture one of the aliens' dropships?\n\nThe Recommendation\n\nWhilst its not quite as amazing as I hoped, Xcom 2 is still a good game that is worth playing. You'll get good value for money from a full price purchase. If you've never played Xcom before, you don't need to play the previous games first because the story has essentially been reset, so you could start with Xcom 2 without a problem.","April 11","true","41.6"," 65 of 98 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","65","98","5","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solidkumar/recommended/268500/","solidkumar","Solid Kumar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solidkumar/","175 products in account","Nice Game but Even Fraxis Missed His Shot with 90% Aim.\n\nThis is pretty much how I felt the last time I started playing XCOM, way back in 2012, but I’d liken the game more to XCOM’s “Enemy Within” expansion in 2013. A comprehensive update to the gameplay, customization, and flow of the original, “Enemy Within” made XCOM the game it should have been at launch.\n\nXCOM 2 is better. Not only are customization options far more varied even than the expanded XCOM, the game is simply deeper, more challenging, and more fun in almost every way. Still, it’s not without its problems.\nLets take a look at the Good, The Bad, and The Insulting of Firaxis’ ambitious sequel.\n\nThe Good-\n\nCustomization- I have way too much fun customizing my soldiers. This was severely lacking in XCOM, massively expanded in “Enemy Within” and has reached critical mass in XCOM 2. If you like customization options, they are here in abundance, from language and voice options, to props like sunglasses and baseball caps, to facial hair and scars. When a soldier reaches a certain rank, even more options are opened up\n\nEnemy Variety- Enemy variety is almost overwhelming at times. You learn to tread carefully and start making a kill-priority list very early on\n\nMore Tactical- Alongside the increased enemy variety is an increased sense of panic at the rest of the challenges. Whether that’s rescuing civilians, blowing up an enemy base, or getting to an enemy data bank before it self-destructs, there’s often some sort of primary or secondary objective that makes your life even harder\n\nFeatures- Adding to the tactical flavor are some new game features. Often you start the map out in Concealment mode, and can move through the map unseen by the aliens. This allows you to set up masterful ambushes and take out multiple bogies in one fell swoop.\n\nSwords - Using swords is awesome. Every game should have swords.\n\nThe Scenario Makes Way More Sense- Here we had a global effort to fight back against an alien horde, and we were barely able to fund it. And why were so few soldiers taking on these missions? This time around you lead an underground resistance to the aliens and their global domination organization ADVENT. Having limited resources and a small, elite squad makes way more sense.\n\nMore Strategic Depth- Alongside more tactical missions, your base of operations and world-map are now way more complex. There’s a consequence for every action, too, which means you’ll probably screw up a lot. Or at least, I screw up a lot, or I think I do.\n\nThe Bad-\n\nIt’s All A Bit Too Much - You can barely get one thing done without being interrupted a bazillion times by all the various projects you have going, by new missions popping up, or new resource collecting timers going off. Even when you get through a month and the powers-that-be send you your supplies, you have to go spend a few days picking them up. During that time any number of horrible things can happen, and all the while the ADVENT clock is ticking, leading toward some new calamity.\n\nFrankly, it’s just too much going on at once to be enjoyable at times. There’s almost no breathing room, even in the very beginning, and it’s very easy to slid into chaos.\n\nMental Distress- Let me give example for you: I’ve got my four squad mates lined up just right to take out some bad guys. A dudes is in Overwatch, and the girl I have shooting has an 87% chance of success. Then she misses. My Overwatch dudes miss. Everyone misses and the enemies flank me. One of my squad mates gets hit by an alien with a sword, knocks them unconscious, so they’re out of the game. Then two of my squaddies panic and shoot wildly at nothing. Then a Sectoid takes over the mind of my fourth soldier and I’m out. I can’t do anything. There was nothing I could have done any better, either. I set it all up perfectly. I had a good chance of landing a shot and then taking out at least a couple of the aliens with Overwatch. But because half my squad panicked, one was knocked out, and the other got mind-controlled, I had no options left.\n(After this incidence i took a 3 hours nap)\n\nThe Insulting-\nRepetition- In missions where you have to save civilians, you’re going to lose a bunch of them no matter how good you are. Aliens start picking them off instantly, and it’s a race just to grab the bare minimum. But each time the aliens kill someone, your right-hand man “Central” pops up on the screen to chastise you. “We cant afford to loose too many civilians, Commander!” he intones, or something like that. Many times over. The game pauses while he says his bit, which is really irritating. Stuff like this happens throughout the game. It’s repetitive, slow, and annoying. You should at least be able to play while the NPC’s are dressing you down for being a pathetic loser.\n\n(Whenever Central pops in, I AM LIKE, DUDE STOP IT, I AM YOUR ****ING COMMANDER)\n\nBugs And Glitches\nMy character fall of a building and KIA.

That’s something to consider if you’re thinking about purchasing it. But I can forgive most of the flaws simply because there’s no other game quite like this on the market. It’s top of the class when it comes to turn-based tactical gameplay, and I honestly can’t get enough.","February 8","true","69.3"," 99 of 157 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","99","157","10","1"

I'm a big fan of the XCOM franchise, and I've been hyped for a long time to finally get my hands on XCOM 2.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like Firaxis just tricked us into buying the game with the whole "built with PCs in mind" thing. I'm running the game with a GTX 970, 8gb RAM and an i5 3570. This trio is capable of maxing almost all games released these days, and XCOM 2 is the first game to launch the "completely unplayable games" list.\n\nVsync is locking the game at 30fps, but even disabled it is hard to get past the now removed cap. People can argue that you can turn your settings down to make it "playable", however I cannot find a reason to do that when you spend so much money with a good graphics card. Another big bummer is that the cutscenes are rendered in 30fps. I thought we were way past that when the devs said the game was going to launch exclusively for PC, a platform well known for superior performance in games. For what reason would you lock the cutscenes in 30fps when most gamers want to experience the whole game in 60fps?\n\nI will refrain from talking about the gameplay for a while, but from what I could play, it just looks like good old XCOM. I'm going to keep this review updated, I just couldn't give it a thumbs up or let people give their thumbs up and say the game is almost unplayable. The newest Naruto game was released today and people aren't giving Bandai the same free pass for delivering a subpar experience.\n\nIt feels good to be the commander again, but it definitely doesn't feel good to see the game running in slow motion.","February 5","false","10.1"," 89 of 140 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","89","140","8","0"

Maybe it's the performance issues, maybe it's the 'slower paced' gameplay, or maybe it's the lack of Micheal McCann. I just don't get the same feeling like I do with EU/EW.\n\nEven Long War feels more satisfying, and that ♥♥♥♥ is brutal.\n\nI wanted to be excited for this sequel, and I was for sometime... It feels like it was partially for nothing.\n\n--- Pros so far ---\n- Customization is great. Customize guns/people to a higher extent versus EU/EW.\n- Graphics are nice. I care more for gameplay though.\n- Mod support right outta the box.\n- New terrain/landscapes are nice.\n- New enemies.\n\n--- Cons so far ---\n- No Micheal McCann. His music was the one thing that made me excited going on missions, made me care for Earth's survival, and made me care even more about the soldiers under my command. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exWNztpgfIw\n- Gameplay feels slower versus EU/EW. It feels like I'm forced to watch a soldier finish his/her 3 second animation before I can call my next move. Makes the game feel slower to me. Or maybe that's the performance issues? We'll see by next patch.\n- Story is pretty lame. I won't go into it, do to spoilers.... Hopefully it gets better.\n- Performance issues. Random stuttering, even on high-end rigs.\n- Base building is overally simplified.\n- Get to this ♥♥♥♥ing spot in x amount of turns.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/268500/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","Firaxis strikes again, with a mostly excellent sequel that hits every note bar one.\nXCOM 2 is one of those games that gets under your skin. You'll be playing it mentally long after you've finished your session for the evening, you'll be thinking about various strategies long after your first campaign completion too. The fact that this time Firaxis has built modding right into the game client is a real testament to the fact that this XCOM will almost certainly be the one to beat for some time to come, and with it they've made some major steps forward, and a few steps sideways, along with one step backwards. I'll come to that one at the end of the review.\n\nFirstly, let's go over the synopsis. The game assumes that most people failed their first campaign in XCOM:EU (or EW), which is probably correct, and thusly, the governments of the world, having lost faith in XCOM decided to go the route of negotiating for peace with the aliens. On the face of it, this approach worked. The "elders" as they're now called, have on the surface - uplifted humanity - by providing improved technology, health and civic benefits that have improved the race as a whole, but it's very much a vision of humanity that's ruled with a velvet glove belying an iron fist. Any dissent results in the said voice taking a quick trip to "re-education" and never being seen again. A good way to imagine it is China circa 2015 but with an even more hawkish stance concerning human rights and you'd not be far off.\n\nHumanity that wishes to remain free, lives in isolated clusters at the fringes of society, deprived of any real contact with the world. and resists, albeit ineffectually. XCOM, having gone into hibernation, is suddenly awoken as intelligence brings the commander (you) back into play.\n\nFiraxis gets a lot right\nSo XCOM is now a resistance movement. This rather neatly solves a lot of the story contrivances of the first game, you have limited resources, your base is a very small, but mobile command HQ that can only deal with a subset of what is going on in the larger world. Your options are now reactive, rather than proactive. The enemy is no longer a passive one either, having an active project that it persues. There's no longer a simple "You lose" condition, now the enemy has a "They win" condition that they're going after. This puts active pressure on the player to keep advancing and expanding all the while.\n\nMeanwhile, the tactical layer has had an awful lot of quality of life improvements, with classes now feeling a lot more distinct, and offering a lot more "play" in the 2-AP system that has become a hallmark of the XCOM series reboot. There's now ways to bend, and in some cases, thoroughly break the rules in your favour. The same goes for the aliens, who pretty much right away get the ability to mind control your soldiers, which makes for fun times.\n\nIt's not always sweetness and light though...\nThe game isn't -entirely- without faults, there's still numerous bugs and camera glitches (though they're a lot less than the previous game), and unless you have a real monster of a rig, be prepared to scale the graphics back a bit, because whilst the game looks a fair bit prettier, it seems that Firaxis didn't do that great a job of optimising the code, so the game munches resources at a fairly terrifying clip. If you CAN max out the settings mind, it does look awfully pretty, and you can end up with a great looking game when you're fighting the aliens, so it does reward with the eye candy.\n\nOther glitches I've seen include melee attacks through solid walls and closed doors (really -.-) and some pretty amazing instances where the camera decides the one place to be is inside an object, thus clipping everything and rendering the screen opaque for a fair while.\n\nThe random elephant in the room...\nHowever, the big issue is as ever, the RNG. XCOM 2 uses a "pre-generated" set of rolls over the course of a fight, so imagine a long list of dice rolls prepared at the beginning, as each shot is taken, it checks against the list, ticks off a number, and moves to the next. I've tested extensively against multiple scenarios to isolate this, and have managed to confirm that the current system does not roll independently nor does the seed regenerate with a save reload. This is likely done to prevent save scumming, but unfortunately it also means that the game is robbed of a lot of the actual strategic improvisation that is actually supposed to exist, because it reduces the game to something of a puzzle game, once you understand HOW the pre-RNG system works, you can essentially reload saves to maneuver around it.\n\nIt's a design choice, and it's a bad one. Again, likely to prevent save-scumming, which is a legitimate tactic in and of itself, but it essentially makes a game based on making estimates and percentage shots less about good judgment and more about working out what number is on the list. An option to have the game actively re-randomise rolls on -each- shot would be extremely welcome, and currently the only mod available simply forces the game to move to the next tickbox on the list.\n\nClosing thoughts\nXCOM 2 is a great game. It could be legitimately excellent, were it not for the terrible issues with the pseudo RNG that is as far from actual randomness as one could get. When someone actually figures out a mod that corrects this, it'll be the first thing I recommend everyone downloads so we get the XCOM experience we deserve, that said, the rest of the package is so complete and tightly tuned that this game still warrants my highest rating even in spite of this issue.\n\nFiraxis, if you're listening - Regenerate the seed on each roll check, make this an option as a priority yo. Strategy gamers deserve this.\n\nVerdict : Essential","February 10","true","16.2"," 106 of 171 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","106","171","2","8"

Can I recommend it?\nNo. Not at its current state.\nIam kind of sad to say this, but this game should have never been release in its state.\n\nSo, whats wrong with it?\nI will start with what is right instead.\n\nThe Good:\nSince the XCom:EU remake, some changes in compare to the originals from the 90's are realy good.\nFirst of, it plays fast, action packed, and is nice to look at.\nThe "just one more turn" feeling is still there, and you never get bored during the missions.\nThe story is ok'ish, not that great but you want to know more and why things happen.\n\nReduction of action points to simple 2 actions per turn leads to a fast paced tactical play, skill and soldier class system feels at the right deep for this fast gameplay.\n\nSadly thats almost all about it.\n\nThe Bad:\n-worldmap\nThe stratetic map has been stripped down even more since XCom:EU. You have almost no choices or alternatives, no options.\nWithout spoilers of some sort, every thing you can do is kind of mandatory. If you dont do the right things, you dont advance...but...you will do it because there isnt anything else to do.\nIn fact, you wouldnt even notice if the worldmap where not existent and this things would be done by the AI for you.\n\n-basebuilding\nIts almost the same here. You have some options of buildings, but they are not optional. You can and must build exactly 1 of the key buildings (you cant build more)\nThen there are 4 facilities left you can choose to build. 2 are almost irrelevant (did complete it without even building them) and the others are also mandatory to support your base.\nNo real choices, no alternative approaches.\n\n-UI\nHorrible. For a PC exclusive game I was hoping for a very good and fluent UI. Insteat we got a cumbersome bunch of menus, where everytime you want to go to another menu you have to watch animations of zooming in and out for seconds. Soldier customizing is unintuitiv at best, and burred in lots of different layers till you get your dude equiped and colored.\nAlso there is a constant feel of lack of information. To check your current weapon, upgrades and personal stims etc. on one soldier you need to zoom in and out through a bunch of menus. In your squad overview you see fancy 3D models but almost nothing else.\nGameplay flow comes to a crawl here.\n\nOverall presentation of information is realy bad in almost every part of the game.\n\n-missions\nThe maps are now random generated, which is cool. The battles have not changed to much from :EU. But the maps are ridiculous bugged regarding line of sight, cover etc. (shooting through walls, meele through roofs etc.)\nThe new stealth mode in some missions is just a nice ice on the cake, but its not well thought out. After the initial stealth the enemies still getting their free movement, autospot you if you spot them etc.\nCover is now destructible, which is a good thing, except its to easy and to unpredictable to destroy. I had whole housefronts collapse to dust from swordblows, or fires expand through thin air.\n\n-AI\nThe AI feels implausible. Suicide troops left and right, which you cant take out fast enough in early game, and are too easy later on. Most of the difficult comes from the unpredictable random generator and absurd skills some enmies have. In contrast the lategame feels just like a walk in the park, because your soldiers become also absurd overpowered.\nSo it is a very deadly beatup where you hardly can predict the exact outcome. Luck is a factor here. (even very good players are at times just had more luck then others)\nThen the enemy behavior is sometimes very predictable, even in unlogic situations. If you study this you can abuse it to cancel some threats completely.\n\n-performance\nOh my God. I dont even know what causes a turn based game to suck this much at performance at almost every aspect. Loading times, movie frame rate, animations, delay and hickups here and there. Very often complete animation sequences are skipped for no obvious reason so you have to guess what just happened. (talking about you snakeman)\nThe aftermission reportscreen sometimes needs longer to load then the mission itself, at least it feels like this.\nYou can watch how textures get loaded etc. etc. And no, I didnt play it on Max Settings, even with my very good rig.\n\n-support\nLame. We got 1 patch till today which caused more problems then it solved. Critical flaws are still unadressed.\n\nSo in conclusion, I had my fun with one playthrough, and i had my frustration. But I cant stand to play another campaign because of the numerous flaws, bugs and the horrendous slow UI animations, constant anoying voice chat from your central and lots of other minor things.\n\n\nXCom 2 could have been a precious gem, but someone forgot to polish it.\n","February 24","false","68.5"," 221 of 372 people (59%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","59","221","372","16","4"

If you're interested in Xcom and havent played the originals, and the reboot, AND long war, don't buy. They bumbled this one.\n\nThe bad:\n- Baffling gameplay design choices\n- A huge system hog for seemingly simple graphics\n- A crappy interface, especially for PC (worse than the last xcom!)\n\nThe good:\n- Combat is still very satisfying. But way more bullet spongey\n\nI don't understand the direction they are taking this series. It truely baffles and confuses me. The last game stripped xcom of all of its deepest (some may say complicated) elements, like soldier stats (which made them individually unique), action points, etc. This one continues to remove the things we love, like the (granted, dumbed down) UFO interception system, but on top of that ADDS a ridiculously convoluted geoscape and base system. What the hell were they THINKING?\n\nThere are 400 differnt resources. Its like an Iphone game where you get wood and ore and gold, but you gotta pay 5 dollars for the super special pink crystals! Unless of course you want to wait around with your thumb up your ♥♥♥ for 48 hours.\n\nYou run around the map playing a persistant game of wack a mole. But there is always an obvious choice. There is no STRATEGY in this strategy game.\n\nYou get to maticulesly place every scientist and engineer, assigning them to various tasks. Cuz why not add some needless, unfullfilling micromanagement to the game?!\n\nYou're never really sure what youre acomplishing and why! I need some intel for this, then gotta reseach that, then make contect with this guy then fly over here and pat my head and rub my belly and WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥! How could you make this such a convoluted MESS, yet still say, "Players are too stupid for action points! Thats too complicated! No more interceptors, its too involved! It needs to be accessable!" Are you KIDDING me?!\n\n\n\nBesides the gameplay choices being incomprehensible, I'd like to adress the graphics and interface. Can we please stop with this trend of making everything smaller and smaller, and calling that "graphical improvement?!" Please! The buttons in this game are 2x2 pixels. You need a microscope AND a gyroscope to read the text. Because not only is it impossibly small, they thought it would be a silly goof to add a scrambling effect every 3 seconds while you're trying to read 4 paragraphs of text for every research project!\n\nYou can only rotate the map in 90 degree incriments instead of 45 now. Which makes it enranging when you're tring to click the single pixel that lets you move to the spot behind cover instead of the one where your genitals are perfectly lined up with the aliens gun barrel.\n\nWHY can I play fallout 4 without issue and this game drops to 3 FPS on the lowest settings? The graphics look like 2006's Sam and Max, so why does this game require a monster PC?\n\nSpeaking of which, the graphical design of this game (and to a lesser extent, the previous one) is lame. Its designed for children. I feel like a dork when I play, because I'm looking at guys with cartoonishly large guns and guile haircuts run around in Anime armor. If thats your thing, thats cool. One day you'll be a grown up too and feel some shame!\n\n\n\nAll that being said, it feels a lot like the last game, and the combat is satisfying. However, they really upped the bullet spongeyness of enimies and added more needless, pointless, convoluted elements to combat as well, in the form of hacking. Which is COMPLETELY RNG. Thats fun too right? Thats what people love about strategy games. The RNG....\n\nSo get it if you've exhasted the previous games. Do not support this kind of decision making otherwise.","February 5","false","48.7"," 47 of 69 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","47","69","3","1"

This, however, on easy on the first level, I am struggling. 5 attempts so far and no where close to winning.\n\nThe aliens seem to have a preternatural ability to hit my soldiers in cover despite when it's my turn they show as having a very low hit point percentage.\n\nOne of my soldiers has a mele attack, which, when you use unless you kill your foe in one hit, it leaves them standing next to the alien, which then obviously kills you.\n\nThe very first level has a 'grey' which can raise the dead. This would be fine but it takes at least two full barrages from your soldiers, which means you have to put them into harms to way to kill it before the zombie - which also require two kits to kill - can kill your soldiers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/derhollander/recommended/268500/","derhollander","P. Walter Scrubnut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derhollander/","222 products in account","Short Version - XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within are vastly superior to this game. Go buy them instead, or if you have them and want more Firaxis XCOM, install and play the Long War mod.\n\nI wanted to like this game so bad. Hundreds of hours into Enemy Unknown and I was ready and raring to go for the next step. And there are certainly next steps in XCOM 2, the Starting concealment, the changes to Psionics, different enemy types, those were all really good ideas. On the other hand, there's simply too many things that can make your game go sideways through literally no fault of your own. In EU, I usually knew when I made a mistake. Sometimes things go poorly one turn, and that's the way it is, and it usually doesn't happen too often unless you're just committed to riding the bullet train of bad decisions. XCOM 2 just is the bullet train of failure, and there's no brakes on that train.\n\nBarring the DLC, the art is slick and totally on point, a really good iteration of Enemy Unknown's style. Tygen is cool, but lacks the personality and interest of Vahlen. He's 24/7 cool as a cucumber, and is just constantly aloof, where Vahlen had a proper forward face, but there were plenty of hints through dialogue that at any given time she was basically 2 seconds away from dissecting the nearest thing to her, living or dead, while singing opera. Lily Shen's interest basically drops right after her introduction, she never develops even though she's got the most opportunity to do so. On top of that, she looks EXACTLY like Jackie Ma from Sleeping Dogs, right down to the hairdo and freckles, so that's wierd.\n\nThe soldier base models are all basically flat, they have zero silhouette and really wierd proportions. Even though there's more customization, somehow it feels more constrained, and I think it's due to there just being less interesting faces and hairdos available.\n\nAnd, once again (see: Batman: Arkham Knight), XCOM 2 has massive performance issues by trying to ship a "next-gen" game on a decade-old engine.\n\nLike Rocksteady, they bolted too many custom tools and rendering software onto Unreal Engine 3, and while Unreal is a fantastic engine, they both were trying to do rendering that the engine was just not meant to do. So, came the litany of "I have a top-end machine and I get 20 FPS" and "Game crashes at launch" on forums, and while I only had catastrophic issues once or twice, the load times and frame chug just inside the Skyranger are simply unforgivable.\n\nThe story of XCOM losing was a bitter pill to swallow, but it gave a good start to why there's more aliens in the future. But beyond that, the presentation just lacks the same punch as Enemy Unknown. It lacks tension and a sense of urgency, even though that's what XCOM 2 is supposed to be completely centered around.\n\nI'll go watch the intro cinematic to Enemy Unknown just to watch it, because it gets me totally jazzed up to save the world. Michael McCann kills it with the music, and that stutter cut with the Skyranger gets me giddier than a schoolgirl to go shoot some aliens. On the other hand,the intro to XCOM 2 has scenes that should arguably be even more intense, but the lackluster directing, the totally midtone soundwork, it all made it feel so.... ordinary. Like blowing up ADVENT checkpoints is just what you do on a Tuesday afternoon. Though, Bradford jumping through a window was pretty sweet.\n\nThe sense of tedium never goes away, as you're constantly shifting back and forth across zones because everything takes too long. You'll rarely finish one activity before you have to go do a guerilla op, oh did you happen to notice, ADVENT's  putting the boots to some hippies in a commune that happen to be our friends, hey you should go look at this wierd spot we found, oh by the way, you need to go pick up your monthly cheque from this spot because we couldn't be arsed to mail it to you direct, and there's a 3 day processing wait, did you want to sell stuff, well you gotta go fly there too, because apparently there's only ONE Black Market bazaar on the planet.\n\nThere's a nice balance that Enemy Unknown struck between the Strategy and Tactical layers of their game, The Tactical portion was an overt stress-fest of playing hide-and-seek with bullets, doing Hail Marys behind the tiny log that is your only available cover, and hoping to Sweet Baby Ray's that the Meld canister you're after isn't just a total pod-fest of X-rays. The Strategy layer was much more subtle, and the contrast makes the game actually playable. The Strategy layer gives you time to think, to manage your resources and marshal your thoughts on your game plan. It can be a good 10 minutes before another mission crops up, which is good downtime for the player so they aren't keyed up for too long.\n\nXCOM 2 learned nothing from its predecessor. The constantly running around, the Doom Ticker front and center, everything takes too long, and missions pop up with an annoying frequency to how much you can actually get done in the Strategy layer before "Hey, you gotta pop half-way round the world to go save those dirty hippies again" There's really never time to rest in XCOM 2 and it's frankly exhausting even thinking about booting the game up.\n\nThe last sticking point, and really the final straw for me, is really how screwed the game balance was, and continues to be. Instead of say, fixing the fact that missions play like a round of "Whose Line is it Anyway?", where the shot percentages are made up and the aiming angles don't matter, they decide a good idea is to heavily nerf one of the only options for consistent damage, and taking away the biggest reason you pick Volatile Mix (increased grenade radius). Not even mentioning removing the only means of stopping "Run-n-Gun" Chrysallids and Stun Lancers. And there was obviously decisions that were made akin to those bouts of insanity throughout its development. Tons of enemies have armour (DR in EU) and Shieldbearers can give anyone in a huge radius armour, fine. But they took out Shredder rounds, so the only ways are, Psyhic attacks on non-robotic enemies (which bypasses armour, so the rest of your squad is still stuck in DR hell), an extremely high-level perk for Rangers, and the aforementioned nerfed grenades. Thin Men made a new appearance as the Vipers, and they can strangle you from a distance, great! But, (up until a patch a couple weeks ago, where they can't dodge 100% shots anymore), they have a high chance to straight-up ignore half of incoming damage from any weapon that rolls to hit. Your squad starts most missions Concealed, which allows you to try and get the jump on your enemy by (potentially) setting up kill zones to obliterate a pod before they can shoot back, Awesome! But why is there a 10, or even better, a FIVE (yes, five) turn timer on the mission? It completely nullifies the concept of Concealment and geurilla warfare if your only option to succeed in the mission is to dash forward non-stop until you reach the objective, because you WILL run into a pod, you WILL lose Concealment, and after that, you can't hope to just keep running and expect to win.\n\nThere's things to like in XCOM 2, but it's just such an unfun, buggy mess.","May 14","false","58.9"," 134 of 221 people (61%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","61","134","221","10","1"

What an amazing turn-based strategy game, with a staggering amount of nice character customization (especially with Steam Workshop mods). If you liked XCOM: Enemy Unknown, you will like this even more. If you never played the first one, you will still like this one. With a full mod support from the moment of release, and with the SDK now available, the game will have an extremely high replay value. We already have tons of great mod content, and its only getting better. Highly recommended to any and all friends of turn-based strategy games! If I believed in numeric ranking, this would be a solid 9/10.\n\nWhy not 10/10? My personal complaints:\n- The game has some serious performance problems: with i7-3770k, 16GB RAM, GTX 970 and played from a 250GB Samsung EVO 850 SSD, @1440p or @1080p and medium/high settings (won't matter much), the game will average to about 35-50fps, will constantly drop below 25fps, sometimes even below 15fps(!). Lowering quality and/or resolution won't help much, so the problem is deep in the game. Holding steady 60fps is very rare.  This must be fixed ASAP! In its current condition, I'd say many gamers will lose their freakin' minds over this.\n- late game content seems a bit unstable. I had 3 crashes during the last 4-5 hours of the game.\n- EDIT: Stop Wasting My Time mod helps on this. "SHUT UP CENTRAL!" mod would be amazing! Im tired of that guy saying the same things over and over again, always cutting me off from my game. Why can't I just keep playing while that guy talks ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? Stop cutting my game off!\n- timed missions are partly great, but they have not been well developed here. A single mod made all the difference: mission timer start only when your team is revealed from concealment.

Very flush gameplay that looks great when playing on all 8 cylinders.\n2. A truely different system that feels less punishing than EU's council did.\n3. Well people may or may not agree. The game is a hell of alot easier in the begining than EU.\n\nNow the Cons.\n\n1.Poorly otomized. I partipated in the Devision Beta that game had cutting edge graphics that would put this game to shame yet this game lags regardless how much I lower the video settings. Cut scenes lag, game lags randomly, it will go choppy without warning ruining much of the game's fun.\n2. Narative is almost non existant. Forget being an unpopular narative to begin with. At no point is't the story really told of what excactly went wrong in the first game. You just have one cutscene with the chip being removed and the Archives have almost no information. Just fluff Inomation that I think was copy pasted from a fan site. To eleborate on this the characters all act like you already know what's going on. No "Okay this is what happened and how we got here." It's litterally "Welcome back. Let's get to work."\n3. Even less customization than EU with soldiers. Yes you heard me correctly. Less. One thing I loved about EU was that the soldiers would speak in their national languages. Forget the fact Asian soldiers from Japan and China somehow speak English with an New York Accent. There's even less languages represented then before. And for some reason the toggle for the Soldiers to speak their own national languages doesn't work. You have to manually choose their language.\n4. The procedurally generated maps.. Seems to be a lie. Do not chew me out for this one. But On my first play through I gotten the same excact map 5 times. Do not get me wrong but wasn't that the big deal with this game? It's one step forward then 20 steps backwards.\n5. Hostile social Justice Warrior Moderators on the discussions section for this game. Well not technically part of the game itself. The 2k moderators on the disscussions are the worst I have ever seen. Openly hostile and abusive of the rules in place. People are banned for critizing the game's premise. Which if you read number 2 turned out to still be a problem. They're banned for asking questions or just plain saying any part of the game is something they don't like. Some of the moderators even would start arguring with people just so they can ban them even if the person they started arguring with never actually responded to or acknowledge them. One of the moderators I want the personal adress for since what he did was technically criminal threatening.\n\nThe people you leave in charge of your discussions boards for a game do infact represent your game studio, game and brand.\n\nHow buggy is the game so far? Well as a person who plays Bethsoda games. I have to say atleast Bethosada games are playable at launch.\n\nUpdate: Just beat the game. I now seek a refund. And to retract earlier made statements.\n\n1. The game is less forgiving then prior. The Avatar Project system artifically jacks up the difficulty. The Majority of Missions are timed. There's is too kinds of difficult when it comes to a video game. Frustrating and challenging. Darksouls is a Challenging game. This game is Frustrating. Frustrating due game breaking bugs. Bugged Animations. Missing cutscenes all over the place. Get used to Blackscreens.\n\n2. Clear intention to make terror from the Deep style sequel.  Ending cutscene as well as others lack luster. To sum it up violence in the ending cutscene is censored. No satisfying seeing a mob of baseball bat armed civilians bashing an Advent Trooper's face in. Just cuts away with it implied. Seriously we can slash in the game shoot things in the fact Civilians included. But god forbid an angry mob be portrayed accurately at the victory screen. Also that annoying speaker guy there's a cut scene where the truth is displayed and a mob rushes in to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of him. Again cuts out and you never see the satisfying boot to the face from an angry mob.\n\n3. Balance is very poor. Some of the toughest enemies release early in the game while the easiest release towards the end. What do I mean? Sectopods realrease very very early into the game. Long before you see the Bioshook knock off guys.\n\n4. Victory screen bugs. Just a box saying "Collecting server stats." Which will sit there until you hit cancel and contine.\n\n5. The set up for this game forces you to rush everything removing much of the strategy element. Oh poorly equiped and niether anything better than a couple of squadies with one gun attachment no equipment upgrades? Well you better figure out how your gonna destroy those two facilities in under a turn or you auto lose the game.\n\n6. Can't pick starting location? That's something I liked about EU. You could pick your HQ location. Here.. Not at all. It's random. You just gotta start over and over and over and over until by the grace of the RNG Gods you get the location you want. By the way continet bonsues still a thing so it's not just a flavor thing.\n\nBut the most annoying bug. It crashes on shut downs. Often! You'd think shutting down a game would be an easy feat anyone can master. Apparently not. If I'm done with the game half the time I have to edit game setting make it windowed so that if it crashes I don't have to manually restart my computer.\n\nI am unsatisfyed having beat the game. Hell the DLC never once makes an appearance if you paid for it. Other than the stupid Resistance style armor pack. Which does not cover anything past starting gear. I never gotten that veteran soldier. Even with the increased customization options.. Customization is far less than EU.\n\nI will now seek a Refund. Anyone else disappointed in this game I'd recomend do the same.","February 5","false","38.9"," 83 of 133 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","83","133","4","0"

It was clearly designed for those who have played Enemy Unknown on Classic and have their game down to a science. It is VERY newcomer unfriendly.\n\nI was happily enjoying the game until it started hitting me with missions while was in the VERY LONG process of trying to accomplish any of the supply pickups. I hadn't even made contact with my first new outpost when the game started hitting me with different alien types that started shredding me apart with myself unable to counter attack with nothing but a squad of nothing but rookies, and very low ranking specialists.\n\nAlmost ALL the missions are on timers requiring you to play VERY AGGRESSILY in order to feel as though you're accomplishing anything. Anyone who's played XCOM will tell you that playing with that level of aggression with low level specialists and rookies is pure suicide. Failing the objectives will cause a swift decline in your ability to fight back effectively ending your game before you even make it out of the tutorial stage.\n\nSpeaking of the Tutorial Stage. I feel as though Firaxes was trying to push too much too quickly. I was quickly beaten and destroyed on my very first mission when they brought in a Sectoid. My rookies were unprepared to combat such a high level enemy (on the very first mission no less) with their woefully underdeveloped weapons and armor. If anything the aliens represent a mid-game threat and their number rapidly increase to the point where you're facing down packs of mid-game enemies and you haven't even completed your first major objective when the game gets done hand holding you.\n\nA lot of the missions I tried to ignore in favor of picking up more supplies but the game kept telling me "No. This is a high priority mission. You shouldn't skip this." With each one throwing a new objective at me. I hadn't even had time to catch my breath and consider how to accomplish the last objective better before I had a new feature to contend with. Again I feel that Firaxes is rushing the progressing trying to show me all the cool new stuff they've done. "Oh look at this new alien! See what it can do! Look at this new objective! You've never done this before have you? Look a new way to play!" Dear god can I just catch my breath and consider how my last mission went first?\n\nEnemy Unknown (and Enemy Within) were much better at letting you get comfortable before throwing something new at you. You were just uncomfortable enough until you got toward the endgame and you were a much more equal footting. XCOM 2 is dedicated to smashing you flat until a mountain of new feature after new feature until you finally lose or just give up out of sheer frustration.\n\nI get they wanted to make it like a resistance game where you were hounded at every turn but this game dooms you from the start. And I was playing on Normal Mode. It felt like playing on Classic from Enemy Unknown.\n\nIt's fun for all of about 3 hours. Then the inability to pick up resources because of constantly running missions demanding your attention because they have some new feature to show you cause you to hit a brick wall very quickly.\n\n"Oh but Adhock that the point of the game! You have to make the hard choices!"\n\nWhat hard choices? The choice of ether losing the game because of the inability to stop alien progression while I'm trying to ensure I'm relatively stocked up enough to advance my gear or let myself get smashed flat trying to keep the aliens from advancing their endgame causing me to loose all my soldier with the inability to gear them or get more because I'm too poor?\n\nIt's a lose-lose situation ether way. It takes too long to get supplies and they hit with higher tier enemies that should be saved for further in the game. I was expecting to clash with Advent Basic soldiers much like EU Sectoid until I made myself enough of a pain the aliens would respond in force with their bigger and badder units.\n\nApparantly ADVENT doesn't have enough troops that the aliens feel the need to come out swinging harder then they should instead of letting ADVENT troops do their jobs before taking matters into their own hands when you prove too tough for them. Look at a lot of the gameplay videos. Most of the spawns are basic ADVENT soldiers and their counterparts with perhaps one to two aliens per map. I'm getting hammered with four or five aliens right out the starting gate.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on concealment. The mission that finally broke me my soldiers were boxed in by civilans and the act of trying to get past them cause me to drop concealment on my first move and there were too many aliens to punch through. I lost the mission entirely as the overaggressive push required to reach the objective in time caused me to lose half my squad. When the time ran out the aliens finished off the other bedragged half.\n\nWhich effectively dropped me to only two or three soldiers left unable to field another unit. Because the timers to gain supplies were too long and I kept taking missions I was unable to get more soldiers. Game over.\n\nSave your money. Wait until the modders even the playing field for the early game. Right now it's clear that you have to mod to even survive the tutorial. Because it sure as hell isn't balanced in the early game to where it feels unbalanced but you have a chance.\n\nThis is unbalanced with intent to break you before you even hit the play button.\n\nDo not buy the game.","February 5","false","44.3"," 294 of 503 people (58%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","58","294","503","33","47"

And it doesn't really matter much because you can still do a playthrough just fine (I could atleast, but if it's this bad for me then it got to be worse for someone else with a poor graphics card / bad system). The thing is when you pay 50 euros for a game I believe most of us expect it to be good in terms of performance and optimization.\n\nBut the game is amazing in terms of gameplay (except maybe the camera being a bit glitchy?), so the reason why I'm giving this a negative review is to help show publishers it's unacceptable to push out games before they are properly optimized and ready in terms of performance.","February 5","false","11.3"," 80 of 129 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","80","129","3","1"

The interface is nearly the same and so are the mission styles and there is so much new stuff added on top of the old. As always you have a squad of soldiers ranging from 4-6 people to clear every mission.\n\nEvery soldier will have one of 4 classes that then goes into another 2 types of subclasses, so even though that sounds very limited compared to The Long War mod it still provides for a lot of unique and great combos.\n\nXCOM 2 brings a lot of uniqueness to the things it had already in the previous game and therefore keeps it fresh and new enough for it to be a sequel instead of a huge upgrade/expansion of Enemy Within.\n\nXCOM 2 picks up the story 20 years after the events in Enemy Within. The guys from the former game have been busy trying to rebuild the XCOM project and rebuilding the base. So here you are in the middle of a world where aliens are the masters and humans are the slaves marked as renegades, fighting in the shadows to save the world from the aliens’ newest project codenamed Avatar.\n\nYou’ve recovered an alien ship that you are using as a mobile base of operations, unlike Enemy Within, and you are flying around the entire world map gathering supplies, building contacts, gathering intel and much more. As the game goes on you can expand the ship with more rooms in the same way you could in the old XCOM base from previous games. You can also build and discover unique things across the world map that can make fighting the aliens a lot easier.\n\nYou will need to build contacts with the resistance in every country to expand your operational area and to receive more supplies to rebuild your army. This creates a great way of dealing with research, upgrades, buildings and much more in a great flow that can be boosted by completing unique missions and picking up loot drops on missions that can now FINALLY be performed by your soldiers without them having to spend a year researching it.\n\nTo explain that statement a bit, when you kill an enemy you have a chance that they will drop a loot item that can be anything from a weapon upgrade to PSI implants that will be usable if you collect them during the mission and then complete the mission. Weapon and PSI implants aren’t the only upgrades to be found. There are also ammo upgrades, grenade upgrades, soldier upgrades, armor upgrades and more. The combination of the level of customization available for each character and the number of possible upgrades makes for a level of overall customizability that rivals that of the Sims Universe. (You can’t dress up as Batman yet though, but give it time. Somebody will make a mod for that.)\n\nRecruitment in XCOM 2 is different from Enemy Within. In Enemy Within you just recived a group of random recruits and and were cut loose. In XCOM 2 you can pick your own recruits to start with from a long roster and then when you’re unlocked a certain room (trying hard to avoid spoilers) you can train them into certain classes to avoid the dreaded rookie stage. While this is a relatively minor change, it really makes your recruits and soldiers feel very much like your own people.\n\nAs if all this wasn’t enough, Firaxis has brought out some truly scary aliens to woop our asses this time around. Everything from small creepy things to insanely huge monstrosities that make you wanna run home and cry. You get a great feeling for the difference between every alien and you will be able to tell them apart easily to know which you can shoot at and which you should just blow up with the biggest weapon you have.\n\nAll in all a great experience that will make you scream, cry and laugh as you slaughter your way through aliens to save the planet.","February 5","true","23.2"," 140 of 235 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","140","235","4","1"

I lost a lot of soldiers that way!\n- Broken/buggy action cam; The game would often zoom to a seemingly random part of the map while a soldier took an overwatch shot, for example\n- Moves taking up to & around 20 seconds to register as complete\n\nIt goes on and on. Definitely avoid this game for some time. I took a chance pre-ordering after promising myself that Arkham knight would be my last, because I loved the previous XCOM.\nTo make matters worse I went away for a week just after the game came out, and was looking forward to a patch when I got back - I came home to a hotfix that made things noticably worse and at the time of writing there is still no patch three weeks after release.\n\nAnother one for the VERY long list of broken/lazy releases over the last year :(\n\n(Playing with an OC'd i74770K and a GeForce 980ti)\n\nEDIT: I've been playing the game more since the patch and am happy to say that it has resolved almost all of my issues - The game looks, plays and runs SO much better.\nI'm not going to change this to a positive review, since clearly the game was not ready for release and I'm pretty tired of these non-stop sloppy releases.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Micka190/recommended/268500/","Micka190","Axis Of Reichousness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Micka190/","359 products in account","The game looks like a lot of fun. Sadly, I can't play it, and I can't recommend that you purchase it in its current state. After playing through the first part of the tutorial, I am currently incapable of visiting the base due to a bug. Restarting the game and reloading the save have not fixed this. Attempting to start a new game (because redoing 15 minutes of tutorial isn't going to kill me) results in a complete game freeze. Uninstalling and reinstalling have not fixed this issue.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs at about 30 fps on my rig, which is comprised of a GTX 980 Ti, an i7-4749k, and 32 Gb of RAM, unless I lower a bunch of settings. This is simply unacceptable from an optimization standpoint.\n\nAlso, a small PSA for you fellow Nvidia users: When Steam installs this game, there's a small chance that it decides to activate the 3D settings on your card. If you're suddenly getting your games in 3D, check your 3D settings in the Nvidia control panel to disable it.\n\nAs it stands, I'd stay clear of this game until it gets patched.\n\nUPDATE: After spending 3 hours "in-game", I've managed to fix my game (don't ask me how though, I'm still not sure what fixed it...) I've put a little more than 2 hours into it now. So here are my thoughts on it so far:\n\nPerformance:\n\nIt's HORRIBLE! With the specs I have, there is no reason I should be getting ~35 fps in-game on High graphics. I'm sorry, but XCom 2 isn't THAT good looking! The performance cost isn't worth the visuals I'm getting at all, and the visuals really shouldn't be this taxing! I've ran Witcher 3 with everything cranked up to the max (including Nvidia's Gameworks settings), and my fps remained both stable and above 60. This game doesn't even come close to the Witcher 3 graphically, and I can't see why these settings result in such a bad framerate!\n\nNot only am I getting low fps, but I also occasionally get insane stutter when trying to move units. This has resulted in a few deaths due to missclicks that happened mid-stutter (which makes me glad I'm not playing on Ironman).\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe RNG can be very infuriating, especially when it doesn't make any sense. Point-blank range is something you'd think would be in th game. Sadly, it isn't the case. I've had a few moments where one of my soldiers is next to an advent, his gun is inches from his head, and he misses his shot! This is something many people have been asking for, yet it isn't in the game. Hopefully mods fix this.\n\nThe game will have small pop-ups appear next to ennemies' health bar to show you when you can perform specific actions from the position you'r trying to move. Sadly, the game also has a very small "maximum zoom-out limit" which means you sometimes won't be able to see the enemies' health bars to begin with. Getting a bigger limit to our zoom-outs would be great.\n\nThere are some bugs that can be very annoying. I've had 2 characters die while taking cover next to cars because they'd blow up without any indication that they were going to blow up (By this I mean that the car is in perfect condition and explodes the next turn without anyone attacking it). I've also had a Sectoid who couldn't die. His HP bar was at zero, but he was still attacking (that was fun...)\n\nAlso, why is it that there's a turn timer on every mission? Why are they so low? Like, the second tutorial mission has this device that will explode, you have 8 amounts of turns to disable it. It's in the middle of 3 squads. Walking over there takes 3 turns in itself. See, I can understand timers for things like that bomb, or for rescuing VIPs, but turn timers in elimination missions are so weird! You have to eliminate these 12 enemies in under 6 turns. "What happens after the 6th turn? Like, what's the reason we have to retreat?" "No reason. We just felt like giving you an arbitrary limit, or else you wouldn't be challenged."\n\nCustomization:\n\nOk, I have to ask: Why do characters from the character pool get promoted to random classes instead of the ones they've been given in the pool? Is it for balance reasons? If so, that's pretty dumb. People like me, who want to create their own characters and get them into a squad end up having to re-customize them once they get promoted to a completely other class. Because we can change it it isn't really game-breaking, but stil, if they could get promoted to the class you've assigned them, it would be a nice quality of life change.\n\nCutscenes:\n\nHonestly, my cutscenes have been less "rendered videos", and more "family slideshows". Seriously, I thought getting 20 fps while playing was bad, my cutscenes continuously drop to 5 frames and below!\n\nThe audio and video syncronization is also constantly off. It gets really distracting when you hear an explosion and only see it 5 seconds later.\n\nVerdict:\n\nI can't understand how this game has been released in its current state! Its performance is horrible, and it has game-breaking bugs! Honestly, it feels like I'm playing a beta. I just can't wrap my mind around how someone could sit down, and say "Yeah, this is ready for the masses!"\n\nAs of right now, there are no client updates, and I've yet to hear about plans for one (though I can't wait for one to come out). It does have potential, but I'd recommend you wait until it's on sale, or until they release a few patches before getting this.","February 6","false","9.9"," 164 of 278 people (59%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","59","164","278","12","0"

Also, some of the drawbacks of the game can be altered with mods like "Stop wasting my time", "True concealment" and "Shut up Bradford".\n\nReview:  I've been looking forward to XCOM 2, while also dropping most of the PR about the game in it's developmentphase.\n\nThe game adds an interesting continuation of the story from XCOM EU/EW and while the premises of the game is different from the endring of XCOM EU/EW, this is allowed for by events in the game.\n\nIn XCOM 2, the aliens are in control and the remnants of the XCOM organization is in shambles and beeing hunted. Your task is to build up a strikeforce and connections around the world, work against the alien propaganda, discover what the aliens are up to and sabotage said plans.\n\nPositives:  The premise of the game is positive. The aliens have conquered earth using overwhelming force, XCOM is shattered and the population is under strict control and anti-freedomfighter propaganda.\nDestructible terrain. I loved playing X-COM Apocalypse and beeing able to destroy pretty much anything, if needed or wanted. This is also the case in XCOM 2, where most terrain can be destroyed with either liberal use of ammunition or explosives.\nUse of explosives is slightly less punishing, as most enemies do not drop anything lootable.\nResearch, base construction, gathering intel and research is quite intuitive with few quirks. It can be somewhat annoying having just starting checking out (scanning) a rumour, then having to fly to the other side of earth to do a mission, but that's part of the game.\nThe game is mostly enjoyable and can become a decent addition to the XCOM / X-COM games, given proper mods or patches.\nNegatives:  Insufficient quality assurance.\na) Watching twitch streams and playing the final mission myself, the game may suddenly 'corrupt' in the last room, 		with visual artifacts and colors blooming and flickering. This bug makes it hard to concentrate on the (acid trip-looking) gameplay.\nb) The game may crash to desktop after killing the last required enemy on the final mission, in one instance causing a corrupt save.\nc) Overwatch shots may go through solid walls and hit.\nd) Melee attacks may occour through solid roofs or floors (vertical).\ne) Pull mechanics may go through multiple covers, visibly dragging the unfortunate soldier through.\nConstant nagging from Central, combined with loss of cameracontrol. This remains an issue even with the reduced v/o option.\nConstant delays after completing actions, e.g. heal a unit with a gremlin (drone) from far off, then watch as the gremlin slowly flies back to the operator. The loss of cameracontrol cannot be cancelled.\nMods are great, but removing or adding mods can (or will) ruin your savegames. Considering mods can be withdrawn from the workshop, this can be an issue for ironman playthroughs.\nAccuracy. For some reason, standing in the tile next to a flanked muton gives less than a 100 % accuracy when using a shotgun.\nIn-betweens:  The player is limited to four classes, each consisting of skills divided into two subclasses. Stats like health, movement, aim, etc. are standardized and a soldier is simply given a class on promotion from rookie. Personalizing soldiers based on stats, e.g. making a high mobility assault/scout type soldier, is no longer an option. Personally, I found it giving to be able to select gear, classes and skills with stats and end results in the field in mind.\nThe Psi-operative is nigh overpowered compared to the other classes.\nThe concealment mechanic is interesting and allows for setting up ambushes or completing exfiltrationmissions almost without combat.\nSoldier panic can be chaotic. Soldiers can run to new cover and shoot or use items. This can lead to situations where the paniced soldier runs towards the main army of aliens and turns around and lobs a grenade toward an alien standing next to the rest of your soldiers. The result is no cover for your own guys, possible death and more panic, not to mention your paniced soldier possibly beeing exposed (thus dead). Drawing lines back to X-COM Apocalypse, simular actions could happen, as a paniced soldier would either freeze, start shooting at whatever was in front of him (including friendly fire) or run away from enemies. Personally, I find that a paniced soldier is too unpredictable in XCOM 2, as the friendly fire can be a bit over the top in a game where friendly fire is mainly a none-issue. It's a matter of taste.\nTurn limit. Most missions are limited by a max number of turns to complete the mission. This serves to give the player the feeling that the aliens at any minute may tumble down and create a full lockdown on the area, but in most cases, it makes little sense to activate the timer when the squad is concealed. For some reason, it's OK that it takes maybe 6 hours to fly to the mission, but somehow, you are limited by minutes from the minute your team hits the ground undetected.\nNew mechanics have a tendensy to be stuffed down the player's gullet. Prime example is trying to kill a muton with a melee attack (specialty of the ranger), only to have said muton block and counterattack the ranger. I'm usually a fan of aliens beeing scary in itself, e.g. the popper, multiworm or brainsucker in Apocalypse, but I'm not a fan of counterattacks with no other possible counterplay than not ever using melee on said unit.\nRestart mission option if you fail the final mission, even with ironman activated.

The game starts out with a very "do the right thing" feeling behind it, but that just hides the fact that is a retexured mod with birthday candles on top. The new "stealth" aspect looks like it had no work really put into it. The missions where you start without stealth are the ones where you are stealthier. Guerrlla missions are like the Exalt missions from Enemy Within, the DLC to Xcom Enemy Unknown, except you get punished for making sure your guys dont get ambushed (e.g. Overwatching). At least 80%, not inflating that number, of the missions I ran were timed where you had to exfil (aka leave) the mission in 6-12 turns or congrats! You lost all your best guys, woo. Not spoiling anything, but even the campain is timed. Instead of Enemy Unknown there no "Saving who you want" and Helping to reduce panic. Nope the game just says straight up "You're Doomed" and hands you a peice of swiss cheese and says its a sail boat. But dont worry! I am not 100% negitive, there are  more customizations for your solders than there are colors of paint at a hardware store. That way when you loose each mission and squad after squad gets wiped, at least they looked FABULOUS!

I made the mistake of not holding to that with XCOM 2 because I loved the predecessor so much and I promptly got punished for it.\n\nIn short, XCOM  2 is a great game which improves on XCOM in multiple small ways so if you liked the first one, you will probably LOVE the second.\n\nBUT it has so many bugs and technical problems atm that imo it should not had been released when it did. None of the bugs I encountered was game breaking, but there are so many small annoyances mounting up that I almost put it away on multiple occasions out of sheer exasperation.\n\nThe game is still great, don't you believe otherwise. But if you successfully avoided the preorder trap, wait a little longer until they have all (or at least most of) the bugs fixed. You'll get a much less tarnished experience and will enjoy the game a lot more without minutes long loading times, clipping errors, sound cutting out etc.\n\nI am sorry to say, I cannot reccommend buying this game at this point in time.\n\nEdit: Rejoice, for I have been shown the way.

You just have the one braincell and nothing to rub it against to make it spark? I will take you through it step by step.\n\nSince you read this review, I am assuming that you have not yet bought the game. If you did, what are you doing here?

But I spent almost double that amount on XCOM and far less moments where I wanted to punch through my screen and exactly zero minutes contemplating a critical review.\n\nSo assuming you did NOT buy the game yet. From the top of my mind, there are two reasons I can think of why.\n\nA) You desperately want it, but are broke. And while scrounging the money together, you amuse yourself by reading about how good this game is, trampling its enemies into the dust, grinding their bones for your bread and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on their graves. Yay you! Good for you, everybody needs a hobby, I guess.\n\nB) You wanted to see if the game is worth your money and your time. For you, I wrote this review. Is the game worth it?\n\nThat depends, do you want a really good game (yes it IS good as my hours can easily testify, even if you subtract the idling time) NOW?

I've read on the steam discussions that I am not the first to be told "your specs suck, not our problem", people who claim to have a much better GPU as well.\n\nFiraxis and 2K have created a broken mess, what about all the thousands of paying customers who complain about horrible performance issues and constant crashes, who definetly have more than the min. requirements?\nIt's a broken launch that they are unwilling to fix, good thing steam refunds are a thing, though I feel very sorry for all those who cannot ask for their money back.\n\nThis is the last time I buy a product from Firaxis and 2K, I mean as if broken launches weren't enough, their attitude of "we support modding" takes form in releasing day 1 extra content as "mods", giving the playerbase easy to configure .ini 's so the customers can do what the developers couldn't be arsed to do.

The game should also be far less cripplingly buggy.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, XCOM 2 is an excellent game. It improves upon its predecessor hand-over-foot, with stunning visuals and engaging battlefields.

This is where Firaxis has messed up, and until a hotfix is issued, I can't properly recommend this game.\n\nIf you want to play XCOM 2, wait for a month, maybe two, for a hotfix to be released and HOPEFULLY remedy these terrible bugs and compatibility problems.

The computer always get a free move. No matter what. This removes any try of the game to be a turn based strategy, and become just a Human vs bad AI game with "challenge" added by cheats like free movements.\n\n-Time counters on every mission. If you hated the first game when you had X turns to do something, well, now you have this on EVERY mission. No strategy, no sense (cause most of time you take days to reach mission site but exaclty 10 turns befora a bomb explode... wow, super awesome for some 6 year old)\n\n- It took like 2 hours to get the first chance to edit a soldier or modify your base... 2 hours being told to click here and click there. Again, 6 year old tutorial that bore you after 10 minutes.\n\n- Huge loading screens.\n\n\n\nThis game isnt a turn based strategy. Its more like a rogue-like rush game. You will die randomly. The comp cheats. The same rule that aply to your forces dont aply to the enemy, this kindo of thing that essentially destroy a turn based strategy game. Seems like the game was designed to make you go, rush around dying just to see the layout of the map and where the enemies are, then load the game from the start of  the map and go the perfect route to ambush the enemies with overwatch. If you try to ambush them by shooting, they get the free "nonsense bad design" move and go to cover before your second soldier can shoot. But if they get you in the open, they all shoot and kill before you can react, cheap cheating is cheap.\n\n\nThe game isnt a complete fairule and i would wait a little for modders to make the game people really want to play, my only concern is the timers, since all missions are designed about this stupid "blitz mode, no thinking" timers, even if a mod remove them, many dialogues would make no sense.\n\nEverymission there is a bomb, a trap, or a incoming something, that you need the timer... awesome diversity i must say, by the third mission i was so dissapointed by the timer that i kept playing just to try to see where the stories go.\n\nIf you like this kind of rush game, go ahead, if you like strategy, this game isnt for you.\n\n\nEdit after playing to the last mission:\n\nAdded bad:\n\n- buggs everywhere, and sometime is even dificult do know if is a bug or intended. Bugged exactly on the LAST hit of the last mission after 3 hours playing the mission. 3 wasted our of my life.\n\n- Scum save game. This game is simpe: No strategy as posted aboved, complete save and load game. After scumsaving every mission, i ended each mission with about the hit rate i would have if the game engine of random numbers wasnt broken. I take most of my shots at 75% chance, without scumsaving, at the end of a mission i hit like 40% of the shots, after scumsaving i get around 70 to 80%! so i am not  even saving and loading to make everyshot hit, but you have to scumsave just to make the game behave as the aim % say it would behave!\n\nAfter all this time trashed on this game, i probably will play last mission again just to see the end, but the game is SO unfun to play that i am really have to make a effort to play again. Bore repetition with scumsaving around.\n\nCant recommend  the game. Probably will be much better with 16 y.o. modders showing a professional company how to make a game. Wait for like 3 or 4 months and try again, thats my recomendation.\n\nI was really disappointed when they insisted on make a game disregarding all X-COM EU final, fanboys kept telling me to wait for the game... you have to be REALLY a fanboy to like the game in the current state.","February 5","false","137.6"," 31 of 45 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","31","45","2","0"

It's no longer a strategy game, just a race against XCOM's legendary rage-inducing RNG.\n\nThere's so much here to build on, and that's part of that makes this so disappointing.  There's a great stealth mechanic...that you can't use because of the turn timer, so you blow it on the opening group of enemies you see.  It's neat, fun to play with for a few (failed) missions, then you leave it alone because the turn timer invalidates a piece of great design.\n\nThere's awesome classes with neat abilities...except sharpshooters are worthless since using them like the sniper they're supposed to be means that you lose them when the evac timer runs out.  Once again, the turn timer invalidates another piece of some really good class/game design.\n\nYou could always counter the whims of the RNG in XCOM: EU/EW by playing safe with overwatch and setting up a good sniper position, and you can see the design intent to stop that with the turn timer.  But that turn timer coupled with the whimsical RNG turns the game from a "series of interesting decisions" into a series of bad ones and worse ones.\n\nIt's really close to being the GOTY candidate so many reviewers are making it out to be.  But without a balance pass, it's just an overengineered race against a timer full of nigh-impossible missions.  Any strategy is invalidated by the timer, so you just roll your shots and hope they hit, because if they don't, you're dead.\n\nThis is XCOM.  They don't hit often enough to stop you from dying.","February 6","false","72.4"," 74 of 122 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","74","122","5","0"

It's COD in isometric form.","February 27","false","6.9"," 45 of 71 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","45","71","3","0"

Character custimization, weapon mods, melee combat, stealth mode and a cool story line for example.  However, the addition of so many timed missions completely ruin the game for me.  I really enjoyed xcom enemy unkown's turn based tactical shooting style and expected the same from this game. Every move of every turn required planning, for both that character and the squad as a whole.  Having a strategy to tackle the mission was essential along with the ability to adapt to unkown enemies that you didn't see.   Instead, the timed missions of XCOM 2, which seem to make up the overwhelming majority of missions, force you to play a blitz style game.  Your only option is to make the shortest route possible to the mission objective in which you are forced to make long range movement, puting your characters into positions of disadvantage, and efffectively removing any type of tactical strategy from the game.  Let me be clear, my complaint isn't that the game is too hard, it's that the developer's have completely and utterly changed the game from a tactical shooter to a run and gun style game that i think they hope will compete with the more fast paced first person shooters. All in an effort to attract a new generation of 12 year olds who don't have the attention span to enjoy anything but a call of duty style game.\nThe rushed gameplay style ruins any other good aspect of this game.  I strongly reccomend you spend your money on somehting else, I wish i had.","March 20","false","39.2"," 46 of 73 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","46","73","0","2"

XCOM 2 so far has been pretty great so far. But in a game like this where the campaign completely relies on if you can complete objectives quickly. So I would consider it a game breaking bug if the game doesn't allow you to comeplete objectives. Specifically the game would not allow me to do a supply drop, it was only supose to take 3 days, and I ended up wasing weeks in game trying to get the supply drop to work(it never did). During this time my research was glitching as well ... I went from doing pretty well, and having plenty of time to get ♥♥♥♥ done, to being completely dicked over on the entire campaign. I now need to go back and try to salvage a save game and hope that the glitch doesn't happen again.

Is it playable? Sure. However, the constant slowdowns (even at reduced graphics settings), animation bugs, floating heads (armor doesnt load on background characters), and camera bugs definitly take away from the experience.\n\nIt is very clear to me that the publisher said screw the polish, just release it. It's been several days now and still no patch to fix any of these issues. $60-$75 for what? A bunch of reused assets on a three year old engine? AND it doesnt run perfectly? Thats what really bothers me.\n\nIs XCOM2 better than the last one? Yeah, the game mechanics fit the setting a lot better. The world map is more interesting, even though it just feels like im playing a cheap board game. Is it worth the price they are asking? sadly, no. I should not have bought this, you'd be better served just waiting for the 'complete' version for 10 bucks. If you are lucky, by then it'll run properly.\n\nUpdate:\nStill no patch... finished the game regardless. Spoilers ahead, you've been warned: I have to say i'm all around a bit dissapointed with the story. It's so linear, nothing interesting happens, no betrayals even if the side commentary keeps hinting at certain characters not being trustworthy. No twists. The idea of the Avatar project feels ripped off from mass effect2. Then it all ends with an episode of dragon ball. I have to wonder, did they not hire any writers? Did they let the intern write the story? I'm thinkin so.\n\nUpdate2:\nSo it's been about a month, and still no 'real' patch from the devs. Game is still a mess, and they've done a good job here making me regret supporting one of my favorite franchises. Pathetic.\n\nUpdate3:\nFinally a patch. While it does fix some issues and speed up the game play, it also lowers the gfx. Can't seem to re-enable them either, game is noticeably uglier. Pretty lazy, clearly they didn't want to spend time to optimize the game engine and just nerfed it instead.

The enemies still know when you see them and the ridiculous reaction move is still in place. The cover system is pretty much as bad as it was in the previous game and even though many guns shoot bursts it can always count only as a single attack. Also you apparently can't hit wrong enemies by accident. Corpse reanimation via psi powers is an instant action and seemingly requires noi 'maintenance' by the the one doing the resurrection. Also all reinforcement actions are poorly 'translated' into turn based environments. At times when you look all the things that happen you can safely say your team is having a nap while the enemies do strange chains of actions.\n\nSo in essence this game pretty much has all the flaws I expected it to have and for now I haven't seen that many improvements over the last version. There are some small tweaks in functionality but for now I have completed only a couple of missions so there are still plenty of things to discover.\n\nIs the game currently worth the full price? No, not really. I suppose some issues may get an official fix and mods will probably fix some others so this game has a fair potential. Even as it is the game seems to be reasonably enjoyable but the actual game mechanics seem to be on par with the most simple board games ever created.\n\nEdit: Started out with a recommendation but now that I have played more the game just feels so unbelievably scripted. Ammo clips also don't last very long as these 'soldiers' spray and pray all the time. There are no single shots for most weapons, meaning that even your more senior officers will act like total rookies to the end of time. Also movement rate for everything is far too great compared with the other things you can do. Also firing a weapon ends the turn for that soldier. You can run before moving if you like but you can't do it the other way around. This game getting over 90 points is just ridiculous and 80 would be a far more accurate.","February 4","false","12.0"," 58 of 95 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","58","95","4","0"

Weapons and armour look amazing.\n+ Environments are varied and look a lot better than XCOM:EW.\n+ Environmental destruction! Need a quick exit? A grenade on the far wall will do the trick nicely!\n+ Psionic soldiers and powers are a lot more fleshed out.\n+ Skills and abilities a lot more interesting.\n+ Customization options.\n+ Weapon upgrades.\n+ Ammunition mods.\n\nCONS\n- Everything needs to be scanned and everyone is always in a rush and demand your immediate attention. There's a lot of flying back and forth across the world map. "Commander, we have supplies waiting for pickup in Asia." You fly over there to pick them up and then immediately something else pops up and requires you to deal with it. Then another thing. And another thing. And so on... It's annoying.\n- Missions with timers are a Run-and-Gun gauntlet. This severely prohibits you from playing how you want and it detracts from the overall enjoyment of the game.\n- Psionics are overpowered. Field a squad of Psi-Ops and you'll rarely want to run any other soldiers.\n- Poorly optimized. Plenty of framedrops even with certain options turned down/off.\n- Suffers from typical Firaxis-sequelitis with a touch of Bethesda-modanium - okay that was bad, but still. The fans are expected to "fix" the issues in the game with mods because it was half-arsed during development.\n- Hacking and the weird randomness of it. Having a high hacking skill seems to do naff all. I've had a lot more success with non-specialist soldiers hacking things than with the class that is supposedly an expert on it.\n- Accuracy is incredibly wonky. Standing in front of an alien, in the tile right next to it, does not give you a 100% to-hit chance.\n- Pull mechanics from the Viper-alien is horribly broken. They can pull you straight through walls and obstacles.\n- Melee attacks are also broken. Attacks through walls and obstacles are commonplace. Cover does nothing. I've had instances where I was able to strike an alien standing on the floor above me.\n- Overwatch and shooting in general isn't making much sense, either. You can shoot through walls and hit the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ standing on the other side of the map as long as someone has spotted the enemy.\n- The delays after every. single. action. Heal someone? Delay. Hack something? Delay. Shoot something? Delay.\n- Unskippable cutscenes and Central bugging you constantly.\n\nFinal thoughts.\nXCOM2 isn't bad but it isn't good either. The lack of quality assurance is clear; everything from poor optimization and broken pull-mechanics to all the delays after every single action. It's not much but every little thing adds up. I've spent over 300 hours in XCOM:EW (and god knows how many more in the originals) and I've enjoyed every single one of them, from the missed high-percentage shots to the one-shotting of the Über-Ethereal in the final mission. I have 50 odd hours logged in XCOM2 and I think I'll log another 30-40 to get the last few notable achievements (not Multiplayer, not touching that in an XCOM game) and after that, I don't think I'll play more. Not unless a major optimization patch fixes things.\n\nWhat's the verdict?\nGood question. I honestly don't know. I don't dislike the game but I don't like it either. It's all very "meh". It has so much potential but it is held back by its own failings.\nFinal verdict on XCOM2 is a 6/10. It is just... average. I only barely recommend this. It needs to be fixed before it can turn into a truly great game.","February 14","true","108.6"," 34 of 52 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","34","52","5","0"

As there is no perfect game, this one also has its flaws but in my humble opinion they are more at technical area, more explanations below.\n\nPros:\n-Greatly improved inventory with many new gears = much more possibilities in the battlefield\n-More detailed environment and more destructible\n-Epic songs\n-Many new enemies forcing different means to kill them\n-"Timed" missions making real the feel of urgency of the setting of the game (controversial for many but for me it was a good decision)\n-New mechanics such as "concealment" where in some missions you have the possibility to set up ambushes to unaware enemies\n-Improved Headquarters gameplay, contact finding etc\n-Good variety of skills and its actually useful to lean to one side or another when training soldiers to a class\n-Story so far is keeping me very interested, totally fits in the setting and makes me want to kick aliens ♥♥♥\n\nCons:\n-The game runs fine, until certain point (some specific missions) where FPS goes down to 20 or so and you need to restart it, as if it is not managing memory well, loading everything and not unloading as you've done (for reference: max settings @ GTX970, I7 4790k, 32gb ram)\n-On Alien actions, sometimes it takes too long to catch up that you need to wait 5 seconds + for actions to take place, doesn't affect gameplay at all, just annoys\n-some minor bugs on enemy actions display, doesn't break the game again\n\nwell, that's it if you have any questions send me, I strongly recommend this game for fans and for those who like the genre","May 14","true","29.8"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

I love it, and like many others here, I really like what XCOM 2 is doing.  I have beaten XCOM EU twice on XBOX in Ironman mode.  I also LOVE "The Long War" mod.   I love Ironman mode, and as frustrating as it is to lose some of your best soldiers, or get a squad wiped out, I appreciate the struggle.    With all of this being said, I am not a newbie to XCOM.  So I feel I should be able to play the game with a reasonable amount of success on the Veteran setting.  Nothing pretentious.  Just take yer lumps and try to save humanity with whoever can survive.  I also am very familiar with Confirmation Bias, so I don't think missing a 92% shot is ruining the game with difficulty nor is the game cheating.\n\nMy problem with XCOM 2 is the seemingly overwhelming odds against my troops.  I have lost 11 ironman games in a row.  I didn't just have a bad battle or two, or just lose my highest ranking soldier on occasion...   My games are done. Game Over, man.   And there seems to be nothing I can change about the situation unless I want to stop playing Ironman and scout maps and reload saves constantly.   I cannot get plated armor any faster than I've been getting it.  I can't get more engineers than I've gotten, I dont' see a way to change anything I'm researching or building to make anything any better.\n\nI love when my 4 man crew has 1 strangled by a snake, 1 mind controlled, 1 in forced panic and the other in actual panic.  You just sit and watch them run around on the screen.  (One got so scared he actually dropped a grenade on himself and died.  I laughed at that one.)\n\nThe latest 6 man squad I've sent in to rescue civilians ran into a new Alien.  A Berserker (My first time getting this far in the game.), a Shield Advent and a Regular Advent.    So I'm trying to rescue civilians and at the same time, I am unloading on this huge beast of an alien which is not dying even though I'm hitting it.  I manage to kill it on the second round, but it takes a full two rounds and every trick i can think of to deal max damage. (Blowing up walls so others get shots, shooting propane tanks to kill the shield advent... that sort of thing.)  However, in the scond round, while flanking, I somehow unlock two groups of aliens.  1 Advent Officer with his mark of death, two Mutons, 1 snake, 2 Stun Lancers AND ANOTHER BERZERKER!   And to top it all off, there is still more aliens off screen killing civilians.\n\nI can't even retreat to call an evac.  I'm strangled, stunned twice, blasted and berzerk stunned (or whatever they do)  I'm left with one sniper trying to reload because for some reason her clip only has 3 bullets.  I guess that High Capacity magazine ban that the democrats want carries over to advent socialists.\n\nThere's only one solution.  Take off and nuke the site from orbit.  Humanity is lost.","March 2","false","43.5"," 41 of 66 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","41","66","6","1"

Hustling into poorly set up engagements because preparing properly takes too long isn't particularly satisfying, and the solution - especially in Retaliation missions where you need to get to 6 civilians that are often rather far away from you before they're killed - is primarily to have enough firepower to not get bogged down in combat for too many turns. Actually outmaneuvering the aliens to success is largely too slow to consistently beat the timer. I preferred the risk/reward decision-making of collecting Meld in Enemy Within over this ham-fisted way to always force aggression.\n\nThe deal breaker for me is however the bugs. Dealing with glitchy cutscenes, random black screens on enemy reveal, getting shot through solid floors, UI that completely locks up, and combat turns that just get stuck and never end was trying, but I've finally given up after the timers on the strategic map started counting past 0 into the negatives, preventing further progress.\n\nI want to love this game, but it doesn't seem to want to love me back.","February 6","false","147.3"," 47 of 77 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","47","77","4","1"

Keep in mind, though, that the game was designed around that "mechanic", and there're still plenty of implicit timers around (civilians, objective defense, unlimited spawns, etc). In light of that, and the fact that modders are just kind strangers and not Firaxis, my review remains the same.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nHere's my -entirely subjective- view of this game as of now. For the record I'll say that I'm a big fan of the old XCOM as well as EU.\n\n**** CONS **** (i'll list them first since this is a negative review)\n\n- Plenty of timers.\n\nIf you liked the council missions where you had to deactivate the bomb on a timer, then you'll be fine. However if you're like me and you like to approach things carefully, then those kinds of ops are going to get boring, fast. I get the whole "urgency" thing, but when 4 out of 5 ops end up being timed (either by a turn counter, or a civilian counter, or any other counter for that matter) it becomes somewhat frustrating. It may be ok on the easier dificulties, but the higher you go the more you'll hate them. And that's not even mentioning having to beat the Avatar Project.\n\nMan Firaxis sure love their timers.\n\n- Shorter soldier list, longer recovery time.\n\nYour guys are expendable, especially during your first hours with the game, but combine the fact that the aliens are now more dangerous and resourceful with the fact that soldiers may take several weeks to heal up after they're wounded (provided they don't die) and you'll end up recruiting A LOT of cannon fodder, spending precious resources that you won't be able to dump anywhere else.\n\n- Friendly Fire.\n\nIt's always frustrating to see your soldiers shoot themselves when they panic, but now they not only do that, but also blow your entire squad up with their grenades. Combine with the previous points and you'll get how infuriating this can result.\n\n- Unlimited enemy spawns.\n\nDuring some ops the enemy will reinforce their numbers, as they did in the previous game. Only that now they'll continue to do so every few turns. What's that? You don't want to risk your guys? Tough luck, you'll do that or you'll be royally f***** whithin a couple turns. Combine with the previous points.\n\n- Bad optimization.\n\nThe game ran poorly on my (high-end) system. It'll probably be fixed once the drivers get updated and all that jazz. Hope so anyway. This was the first time I had any kind of problem of this type with XCOM.\n\n- Losing stopped being fun.\n\nBecause unlike EU or the older titles, this game does not punish your mistakes. It instead pushes you to make them, then punish you for it, which I found to be a little too much, and I was a regular Ironman Imposible player back in EU.\n\nIf you're of those who consider timers realistic, think about this, everyone knows that you never EVER dash/move twice on Classic or Impossible, yet the turn limit forces you to do that. How bad is it? Well, aside from the fact that worrying about the timer takes away from enjoying the rest of the game, you'd think you can always dash safely while conclealed... Only to realize then that you triggered 2 unseen groups and a turret and now your Ironman campaign is going down the toilet, fast. Remember how good it felt to carefully coordinate your squad to wipe out that alien pack in a single turn coming out of concealment?\n\nGood, remember it well, because chances are you're not gonna get to that often.\n\n**** PROS ****\n\n- No thin men.\n\nJK, you'll face worse.\n\n- Meaningful choices\n\nThe game is full of them, but the ones I liked the most are those related to soldier classes. A lot was done to improve the skills you get to choose when your guys level up, unlike EU where you picked more or less the same every time.\n\n- No satellites.\n\nBuilding satellites was a chore, but was almost mandatory in the previous game. That is, luckly, a thing of the past.\n\n- Soldier and weapon customization is over 9000.\n\n- Maps are more diverse and feature a lot more detail.\n\n- You get access to a lot of tech very early on (by XCOM standards), likely to balance the increased alien threat.\n\n- The story is a lot more fleshed out than in the previous game.\n\nI have a lot of positive things to say about XCOM 2 regardless of my negative review, and it's certainly worth the price, if you're the kind that enjoys the changes they made to gameplay. I'm not one of those people, and that's why I'm giving this one a thumbs down. Consider it carefully before buying though, or you could end up like me.\n\n*** Closing Statements *** (Spoilers)\n\nSo I've finally -almost- finished the game. I've seen everything it has to offer and my feelings are of disappointment more than anything else. The equivalent of the base defense and -especially- the final stand are long ops that end up feeling like a chore. The final mission is pretty similar to the one on EU, perhaps a bit shorter, but pretty much the same. What's unforgivable, at least for me, is the fact that they spiked the difficulty at the end so hard it makes no damn sense.\n\nYou can pretty much complete the op breaking face all the way to the last encounter, which throws A LOT of BS your way. So I basically shut down the game and fired up YouTube to see the ending cutscene, because I was not going to do that all over again (You can see how much I cared for the game at this point).\n\nCompleting the campaign (or at least 99.9% of it) on Commander Ironman took me a sweet time and was fun at times, but there was a lot of stress and boredom involved as well. There were times when I just wanted to get it over with, and the final op was the last nail on XCOM's coffin for me, I didn't feel any reason to re do everything and try again afterwards, much less jumping on legend, though the game cheats a lot less than it did on Impossible back on EU.\n\nIf you made it this far I thank you for your time :)\n\nCheers.","February 5","false","93.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

I only had to play the first TWO missions to realise that the balancing in this game will make it a perpetual nightmare. However, with that said I do want to cover the good things about it as well; so let's take a look at that first.\n\nThe game's tactical combat is still very solid for the most part: it's very comprehensive and you understand in a near-instant, so if you haven't played Enemy Unknown, you needn't worry too much. The pace of the game has certainly been upped a bit; Enemy Unknown was a bit more slow-paced: it pretty much needed you to complete the mission incredibly carefully and it required you to take a step back and analyze everything before acting. While this game is very similar in that regard, it seems as though it's more likely for someone to act on impulse in some circumstances. (It was certainly the case with me anyway.) But now that I look back on it... that's kind of the only thing that I can commend it for thus far honestly.\n\nOne of the main problems with the game is it's balancing, or the complete lack thereof. Allow me to explain, when you start off with the tutorial you face of against ADVENT soldiers whom are essentially the Sectoids of XCOM 2: they're pretty much the grunts of the game through and through.\n\nNow I can imagine (if you've played Enemy Unknown) you'd think the game would have paced itself properly so that you can deal with them for a few missions, get yourself some better equipment and the like and the game will steadily progress and gradually increase in difficulty. Well, Firaxis decided to give that oh-so mad notion the middle finger and instead gives you enemies to fight that you would expect to see mid-game: the new Sectoids; whom are much stronger and have highly advanced Psionic abilities: such as reanimating their fallen allies, disorienting soldiers and mind-controlling them! In the second mission, where you will have ONE squaddie and THREE rookies!\n\nNot to mention, Firaxis decided to take a couple of steps back and even simplify the game in some respects. As the Second Wave options from Enemy Unknown are no longer present, which is a huge mystery to me.\n\nThe Second Wave options were a great way to add a little more unpredictability to what happened throughout the missions and on some occasions could be fantastic lifesavers if you implemented one of the options. (Such as that Aim Roulette one. I forget it's name.) Why it is Firaxis removed it is nonsensical, as it added a lot more tension depending on the circumstances, and would make the players have to think much more critically about whether a risk was worth taking or not.\n\nUnfortunately, that's all I need to say; this severe lack of pacing BREAKS the game straight from the get-go: unless you are a seasoned veteran of XCOM you really aren't gonna have a good time with this one. Now, I can understand why Firaxis wanted to go through with this particular idea; XCOM isn't as powerful as it was in Enemy Unknown, they're now guerrilas against a near-indominable empire. And as such there will be a lot more tribulations for them to face than before, thus they make the game a bit more challenging by making the enemies more powerful than before and more tactical, I appreciate that idea. But at least give the players a chance to meld in with the game before you start raining meteors on them in order for them to be blasted to dust! And with the lack of Second Wave, no matter how many times you try and re-load your save and see if you can do better, everything will be down to the same formula no matter what, meaning that you would have to start the mission from scratch if you want to do if flawlessly.\n\nNot to mention, as many people have mentioned, there is a turn-based time limit for some of the missions, and that begs the question: why?! Now, granted yes Enemy Unknown did a similar thing with it's bomb disposal mission, but 1. those missions were very uncommon so you didn't have to worry about them too much for them to be pressing. 2. They allowed you to at least extend the amount of time you have so you can approach it much more calmly.\n\nXCOM 2's spin on it is that you're given a certain amount of turns and that's it; meaning you have to brazenly charge into the battle without thinking, and not being able to analyze what in the blue hell is going on. This is NOT what you put into a turn-based STRATEGY game! I cannot stress enough how important it is for a game like this to allow players to take to it with a logical and sensible approach to avoid casualities, and deal with enemies with utmost efficiency. This mechanic completely contradicts the idea of a turn-based strategy game: as you just have to charge in as quickly as possible, thus attracting more enemies to you and then winding up with more hassle than your team can cope with. At least there is a mod that allows you to disable that, but it's only for non-story missions. But regardless, I have to give that son of a gun a HUGE thumbs up for that one.\n\nNow, while the premise of this game points to it being an understandable mechanic to implement, that doesn't mean they could have used it more reasonably. This is something that should be used in critical situations, if the enemy were able to call in reinforcements, then the timer would be a clever idea; for if they cleared the enemies in time, then the timer wouldn't be too much of an issue. Instead of being a mandatory implementation, it should have been a circumstantial happening when the enemy decides to try and pull a trump card. That way, it would be rewarding to the player if they could deal with it effectively, and the tension would rise dramatically since it could be an unpredictable happenstance; if you're gonna include a timer in a strategy game, do something like that and DON'T make it a key feature in the missions.\n\nNow I know SOMEBODY out there is gonna say "well if you've got such better ideas, then why don't you make your own game then?" Well I'll tell you: I don't know how to make a game, and this game is by no means my jurisdiction, but I feel that my ideas as well as many others' (who will be much more experienced in this, believe me I'm a mere greenhorn compared to veterans) should tell Firaxis about their plans and perhaps in an upcoming patch they can fix it. I know I'm sounding a bit sanctimonious but I feel that, if Firaxis has ANY respect for their fanbase, then it's their responsibility to make the changes necessary to make all of it's players satisfied and be able to enjoy the game. I'm not saying it needs to be perfect, but I think many of ideas have ideas that Firaxis should probably take note of at this point.\n\nXCOM 2 certainly SEEMS like it could be a lot of fun... but unfortunately we'll need to wait until Firaxis stabilizes the game's pacing or some modders come along and devise a plan to at least make it playable for newcomers. But until such a moment transpires, I'd recommend waiting a bit longer.\n\nEssentially, don't get this game AT THE MOMENT; wait until it's fleshed out, wait until it's been patched (hopefully). That way, by that point you should have the resources necessary in order to make the game a little bit more fair and reasonable.\n\nOr just play with the developer console... you decide.","February 6","false","19.3"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","0"

So much that I played through the entire game twice. When XCOM 2 came out I was really excited about it. But after having played 8 hours of the game and have won maybe 3 out of 15 encounters I gotta say, I'm really disappointed.\n\nIt's not that I don't mind a challenge, in fact I was hoping this game would be slightly MORE challenging than Enemy Unknown, but this game is more than just challenging. This game is, for lack of a better term, ridiculously cheap. You've got enemies that can run for what seems like half the map and one shot your soldiers. You've got insanely overpowered enemies that swarm you from all sides early on in the game, before you have any time to research new technologies and have half a chance at winning. You've got multiple enemy types that can incapacitate your soldiers for multiple turns/the rest of the match. So you basically go into every battle with 2 guys you're just sacrificing to the enemy no matter what, and then left with 2 other grunts to try and fight 8 overpowered, cheap, enemies. And, you have a lot of missions with turn limits, which ruins any chance you have to set up any ambushes, and ruins any chance of you having any sort or tactical advantage at all.\n\nThis game should be called XCOM: Hurry Up and Die\n\nI'm going to try a new game on Rookie mode and if it's more fun that way I'll update my review but for now, I'm pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I spent 60 bucks on this.\n\nUPDATE: Started a new game on Rookie mode and couldn't beat the 2nd level. Completed one objective while remaining hidden, immediately got noticed by the enemy even though I was out of sight. Shortly after my opposition went from 2 easy alien soldiers, to 10 aliens. 4 of which were those one shot kill "stun" baton guys that can run way too far. My entire squad couldn't hit anything they shot at, even at close range with 70+% odds, and then eventually became dead or mind-controlled by a swarm of overpowered aliens. Rookie mode has actually turned out to be more difficult than whatever I was playing last night. I feel ripped off.

Wasn't a fan when they shrunk squad size in Xcom 1 (Reboot) but it was still a good game. This one is also not a "Bad" game, but I am coming to the conclusion it isn't my kind of game.\n\nWhile I love alot of the mechanical changes, concealment, new overwatch mechanics, assignable engineers and scientist, ect. ect. The thing that is killing me most is almost every god damn mission has a turn limit. You are almost always up against some kind of clock. And for me that just kills the tactical aspect of the game.\n\nJust turned off the game due to getting a guerilla mission that only gave me 8 turns to reach the objective. Took 3 of those turns just to reach sight of the objective and to get positioned before I broke concealment. But then as Soon as I broke concealment I ended up facing 9 enemies almost immediately. With only a 4 man squad I just can't bring enough firepower to bear without save scrumming. Even when I save scrummed hard enough and accepted losing a guy and taking wounds across the board on the rest to complete the mission with 2 turns to spare. As soon as the last guy went down the dropped reinforcments down right on top of me. And that was the final straw.\n\nNow I won't say I am a truly gifted player. Tried Ironman mode in Xcom 1 and will freely admit it was to much for me. But I am no slouch when it comes to strategy games. But it feels like they really went over the top on forcing you to constantly scramble in this version and it really detracts from what I see as the tactical puzzle solving aspect that I have come to love from the franchise.\n\nMaybe if the Long War team does a version for XCom 2 like they did for Xcom 1 I'll give it another go.  That mod team made Xcom 1 the game it really was meant to be.\n\n","February 6","false","133.6"," 57 of 96 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","57","96","5","0"

I really enjoyed the change of pace and base management. A lot of the systems they changed felt like an improvement too. Offers a lot of replayability and character creation is a time sink as always.\n\nI do feel that in some ways they could really improve the character customisation (more voice, armour, camo patterns, helmets, hair colour, etc.), even by importing older assets from the previous games. They seem to have left it to the enormous modding scene (they offer tools for this), which is a bit of a shame. Of course, that's not to say that the mods are bad - quite the opposite.\n\nYes performance is sluggish if you don't meet minimum requirements (and trust me, a GTX 560 is bare minimum at 1080p), but turning down the graphics settings will improve things (obviously).  Definitely use a 2GB graphics card which is faster than a GTX 560. Running full screen seems to improve CPU load balance, but then I already have a fast CPU (i5 4690K) so it doesn't make much difference to me.\n\nIt's an unqualified recommendation if you meet the system requirements.","May 12","true","69.1"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrSmooooth/recommended/268500/","MrSmooooth","Mr. Smooooth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrSmooooth/","86 products in account","XCOM 2, the sequel to XCOM Enemy Unknown, is without a doubt one of the best strategy games I've ever played. XCOM as a franchise has always been some of the best strategy games out there and I am pleased to say that this new entry more then lives up to the legacy of its predecessors.\n\nXCOM 2 assumes that you got your ♥♥♥ handed to you in Enemy Unknown(Enemy Within if you got the expansion, also reccomended), and turns the tables on you. You're now leading a resistance movement to overthrow the alien run ADVENT coalition, who are now operating a global government. 20 years have passed between this game and the last, and it shows. ADVENT is well entrenched, not only resource and infrastructure wise, but also in that they have the popular support of the people. Assuming you play the tutorial, the game begins from the perspective of Central Officer Bradford, as he leads an operation to rescue The Commander(Read: YOU) from an ADVENT facility. After the tutorial's crash course in some changes to the ground battles, such as concealment, you're taken to your new mobile headquarters.\n\nXCOM is now operating out of "The Avenger", a re-purposed alien cargo vessel, now serving as your mobile base of operations. Striking from the Avenger, you travel the globe, uniting resistance cells and striking at ADVENT facilities wherever you can. While the previous games had you countering alien abductions, and defending populations, the new version pits you in a guerilla warfare situation. Now your missions consist of hit and run strikes against research labs, local armories, and other facilities, to rescue VIPs, hack their network for intel, destroy data-relays, or protect your own network taps. Some missions even involve kidnapping or assasinating key officials in their organiszation. Dirty Collaborators.\n\nMaps are now procedurally generated, so that you never get the same one twice. The new maps are beautiful, and fully destructive. If you need a door somewhere, feel free to make one. Heck, you can even collapse the floor out from under an enemy's feet, or lure them into a building and with a few well placed explosives, drop the entire building on top of them.\n\nThe change in pace is noticeable. Almost every mission has some sort of time limit, either due to ADVENT actively destorying whatever you need to protect, or an actual timer untill the mission ends. This adds a sense of urgency to missions and encourages more risky play. Gameplay feels more fast paced then in previous installments. This also adds dificulty, not only must you achieve a hard task, but you need to do it in the next few turns or you won't have enough time to make it back to the evac point.\n\nSpeaking of Difficulty, XCOM 2 continues the franchise history of brutal and unforgiving gameplay. The easier difficulties are just that, easy. You can coast through them and learn the game in a more forgiving and casual environment if you want. Rookie to Veteran is a significant but manageable leap, however, the difficulty spikes hard changing from Veteran to Commander. The last of the training wheels come off at that point and it shows. The real test of your abilities comes from playing under the "Insanity" setting. The training wheels have been long forgotten, no more punches are going to be pulled. The game will officially break your nose and toss you overboard into shark infested waters to see if you can swim. That's not to say the game is unfair, because it is. You can beat insanity mode, but there is no longer any margin for error.\n\nTo win the game, you'll need to unravel the alien's true agenda. The ADVENT coalition is up to something, in the form of the AVATAR Project. This is the alien's win condition, and puts a timer on the game as a whole. If the aliens can make enough progress on the project, game over. Thankfully, you're given ample oppertunity to sabotage facilites critical to this initiative, slowing and even reversing their progress. If you can discover the truth about their agenda, and put a stop to it before they complete this plan, you will reign victorious.\n\nA commander is nothing without his men, and to put an end to the AVATAR Project, you'll need the help of alot of them. Lucky for us, customising the soliders under your command has been greatly improved from the last game. New customisation options, incuding scars, tatoos, and individual armor pieces, can help vary the look of your troops. The Character Pool function allows you to save your favorites to share with your friends, and characters in the pool can appear at random points in your campaigns. New looks are accompanied by new skills. The Class based system is back, but has been changed dramatically. The Heavy, Support, Sniper and Assault classes of XCOM EW, have been replaced with the Grenadier, Specialist, Sharpshooter and Ranger, respectively. Each bring something new to the table, but hav roughly the same roles overall. A powerful 5th class exists now as well, if you're willing to spend the time to unlock it.\n\nOne more noteworthy feature is the extensive mod support, the steam workshop has over 500 mods already published at the time of writing, and more are on the way as modders explore deeper into the game's code.\n\nSummary: XCOM 2 is a great game for the strategy junkies in all of us, offering compelling story, beautiful visuals, top notch gameplay, and brutal, but fair, difficulty. A solid 9.5/10, Must own for anyone interested in strategy games, or who enjoyed the previous installment in the franchise.\n\nTL;DR: Buy it, game is good.","February 17","true","105.7"," 46 of 77 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","46","77","3","0"

Some people with terrible machines have it run just fine, while others with beastly monstrosities have experienced all sorts of issues. There seem to be a lot more people with problems than without, so you may not even be able to have this game run fluently if you do have a supercomputer.\n\nATTENTION: If you work at NASA or have access to the computing power of IBM's WATSON, you will find this to be a fantastic game. Otherwise, you will have big problems with performance where there should be none, not to mention the fact that this game is buggier than a square kilometre of the Amazon rainforest.\n\nXCOM 2 is, gamewise, a worthy successor to XCOM. It may not feature the full range of contents yet, and the story is a ♥♥♥♥ poor as you'd expect, but if you bought this expecting something on par with Mass Effect, you should not have. XCOM is about shooting aliens, machines, and alien-human hybrids (seeing as the players cannot be expected to simply be fighting human soldiers who have threwn their lot in with the alien overlords), and if good turn-based tactics and moments of euphoria followed by indomitable rage are what you're into, this game is for you.\n\nSadly, it seems Firaxis somehow managed to do many of the things it did right terribly wrong. Yes, there is full modding support (as in: the tools the devs had, we had available on day 1), but the documentation on it is spotty at best. The character pool was a great idea, but it turned out to be an unweildy and unecessarily complicated feature. Not saying you wont get the hang of it, but once the ranger guy you carefully worked out to be an insane brute becomes a specialist because the game refuses to use the class you specified you'll be quite mad, I assure you.\n\nThis is also one of the better sides of the game: the mods. The community is already hard at work, and some fantastic groundwork has been laid out, so you can be sure great things will follow. Firaxis loves the modders already, and maybe that is because they hope they can figure out a way to improve the horrendous performance, but the encouragement people are getting can only be rivalled by Bethesda. And seeing as EVERYTHING is moddable, workarounds for everything you don't like about the game will be available soon enough.\n\nStill, I cannot recommend the game in its current state. Wait until they fixed the performance and the modding scene is a little bigger, and this will be well worth your money.","March 4","false","123.4"," 67 of 117 people (57%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","57","67","117","11","9"

I'm a long term fan of the franchise with 100+ hours in EU. XCOM2 just fights me at every turn. It's more frustrating than fun. The difficulty seems moreso frontloaded than XCOM is known for, so I'm not entirely sure this game is for newcomers to the franchise either.\n\nI sat back and asked myself, was I having fun playing this game? Not much fun to be had in getting punished for playing honestly without reloading in the form of post-combat debuffs (gravely wounded for 5/7 hp? sure, thanks for that). XCOM2 feels like it just devolves into reloading the last save (which takes a bit) until you get the desired result.\n\nI usually enjoy difficulty and challenge (granted this example is cross-genre, but Bloodborne is one of my top 5 favorite titles of all time) but XCOM2 feels contrived and frustrating.

Instead, it's the most frustrating game I've played in recent years. Unless you play games for a living, playing XCOM 2 for maybe an hour every day will lead to nothing but frustration and resentment. Why? Because even on normal difficulty the odds are stacked against you at all times, to the point where it becomes grueling. Once you're a couple of hours into the game you will have to scum save every move in order to make it through the mission by reloading it 15 times. There is not a single mission where the balance is not one step away from being completely out of whack. Move one tile too far and you will aggro another - previously invisible - enemy squad that can tear your group apart in a single turn.  With the over-abundance of escalating missions and the timing constraints added as a new ‘feature', strategic depth is simply AWOL in this game. Only rarely are you given the time to set up your units or prepare an ambush. If you don’t like trial & error games where missions randomly go south, you should avoid this game.\n\nOn the plus side, the graphics are much better (albeit laggy most of the time) and the controls have been improved a lot.","March 4","false","17.8"," 32 of 53 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","32","53","0","2"

However, after many dozens of failed missions and restarted campaigns later, I just can't recommend this game. It's too random, way too luck-based, more than before, to the point it becomes aggrevating. Countless of times I found myself yelling at the screen when my squad mate misses a target at point blank range with 90% hit chance, only to be gunned down with ease by another enemy 30 yards away. People say "that's XCOM", but I say it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The beginning missions are ridiculously difficult, even at an easier difficulty, your squad mates die constantly, so you have no promoted soldiers and therefore no edge against the enemies. When you complete an objective with barely your squad intact, more reinforcements show up to kill you. I had a scenario where 1 enemy with a stun sword killed my entire team. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's even worse when you have to complete an objective in X amound of turns, forcing you to hurry and dropping your guard, so you have absolutely no way to plan a careful approach, which is what XCOM is supposed to be all about. Instead, you have some annoying ♥♥♥♥ back at the HQ barking orders at you while he's eating a donut, telling that the Alien relay is closing down, as if you didn't know why you're there in the first place.\n\nXCOM 2 is like playing Mount & Blade and selecting "Auto-fight" before every encounter and getting your ♥♥♥ kicked by the computer. You can maneuver, yes, but ultimately it all comes down to a dice roll and you will die in situations that would never happen in real life, like missing a shot, when the gun barrel is literally at the enemy's stupid face.\n\nThere's just so much frustration in this game. Creating a squad of friends and seeing them all die during the first mission is beyond infuriating. To me there's nothing more annoying than an unfair challenge and that's what this game boils down to. Some people get easier missions and scenarios early on so they can build their team, but if you're like me, you just get humiliated again, again, again and again. You start feeling like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, because you paid full price for a game that makes fun of you at every turn, and forces you to turn down the difficulty, because you're too much of a ♥♥♥♥♥ to play on Ironman like you did in the previous game.\n\nIt was also plagued with weird gamebreaking bugs, like a zombie ragdoll glitching through the floor and flying around the map, preventing the game from progressing. I have never seen a game, where a round continuing is dependent on whether a random ragdoll is stationary or not. Astounding.\n\nOverall, I felt like I was going insane while playing this game, I almost broke my mouse and my keyboard. If you buy this game, you might have an easier time, but I'd rather shove a pineapple up my ♥♥♥ than play it again.\n\n","February 6","false","74.0"," 47 of 81 people (58%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","58","47","81","13","1"

I played all previous games, I preordered XCOM2, I was waiting like for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ christmas.\nBut no. I'm disappointed, I'm very disappointed.\n\nBecause it's not strategy right now. It's "rush forward and wish for lucky shot or reload latest save if you miss".\nTimers, timers everywhere. Every mission crucial for the plot is on timer, main quest on strategic map is on timer, but that's not the problem. Problem is that these timers are set up so you have no tactical or strategical options other that mindlessly rushing forward. Only other choise is defeat from running out of time. You can't outflank enemies, you can't set up ambushes, you can't walk around them because CLOCK IS TICKING.\n\nWhy? First XCOM didn't have those (yeah, terror misions, but they make sense. It's either aliens kill everyone around, or you manage to kill aliens faster, no issue here). Technically you could take all the time you wanted. But the aliens were also growing and advancing, they were attacking, they were getting new units and new toys. There was no clock but the pressure was there all the time. That's the difference between enjoying the challenge the games gives you and just being worried seeing diminishing turn counter. I want a game where I have to worry about long term decisions and about outsmarting enemies on tactical level, not go Call of Duty dakka-dakka style.\n\nThen there is performance issues. It's not even about FPS drops. New games always have issues like that, they will probably patch it soon.\nBut visible animation issues? You can see where animation of soldier running ends and animation of sticking to cover begins. And after you complete some action the game just waits for several seconds like it is thinking what to do now. Or my soldiers lands a shot at the enemy even if he is looking in COMPLETELY different direction.\nTHOSE WERE ALL PRESENT IN FIRST XCOM. HOW MANY YEARS YOU HAD TO CORRECT THOSE?\n\nAnd this feature of editing how your soldiers look and behave? You advertised this as best thing since sliced bread. It's just few options more than first XCOM. And what logic allows you to edit those only after soldier get higher ranks?\n\nIf I had to rate the game.\n\nAs a standalone game, not looking at the title - 6/10.\nBig game, lot of content, good graphics, complex, yet annoying mechanics. Still much better than most other on the market.\nAs one of the XCOM series - 2/10. A disgrace to to the brand for reasons mentioned above.","February 7","false","42.3"," 190 of 348 people (55%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","55","190","348","10","6"

Humanity\nhas new ways to fight from new technology to even strategy on the field. Xcom is even more bad ♥♥♥ than before and adds so much more. It starts off a bit hard, gets harder and then pisses you off if you've made the wrong choices or just bad but still a good game.\n\nVideo Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqACDr286F0\n\nGraphics The graphics is improved in this version of the game while still using the same engine and a beefier pc is needed to run it although it isn't drop dead gorgeous it still looks very good. At the same time there are some performance issues for the game even for me running a Titan and higher end processor but it is minuscule and the situation seems like it can be fixed via patches.\nThe environment is more detailed and come in many different varieties all over the world towns, cities, snow, rain, sand etc.\n\nSounds and music New alien sounds and voice acting in the game along with some returning familiar voices. The guns sounds great and new alien devices just blows your eardrums with its creative sci fi fx along with thier speeches. Accompanying this are also some great voice acting which goes does a really great job for the story. The music pieces for this game is phenomenal and gets your adrenaline going.\n\nStorylineThe story is much more action packed this time around and explosive along with time sensative missions. Most of the game is accompanied by cut-scenes but there are also in game chatter between characters to let players understand the lore and situation of what has has been happening to the world in the past years. There are also archives and logs players can go through\nto discover and read to obtain more insights. The aliens are up to something but what exactly play it and fondle thier plans.\n\nGameplayThe game pretty much follows the same formula from the previous Xcom game except the r.n.g the game (Random number generator) during shots seems alot more improved (Sorta LOL)_. You can still of course miss shots at 40% or even 50% but it doesn't happen ALL THE DAMN TIME! Although 80% chance to shoot in the face can still miss lol.\nAlong with the returning gameplay there is more strategy and the action is faster paced since there are many missions which are turn sensative (many of them). The new concealment system helps player plan ambushes on the battlefield and also strategize ambush attacks\non the aliens before they can react along with new devices to scout, technology to upgrade, guns, armors and even environment hacking  to buff your units or debuff enemies  for a better chance to fight back.\nThere are also plenty of new class promotions, skills and load out for characters. The enemies this time are tougher, harder and even more annoying. They will bind you, poison you, shoot lasers at you, mind control you,teleport around you, aoe you, blow you up and kick your teeth in, thankfully you can retaliate.\nEverything is randomized as usual even your start location so you don't really know whats going to happen as you play the game because your planning on resources will have to be appropriate for the counter. Sometimes it can start out smooth or harsh but it all depends on what you invest in and your choice.\n\nPros + Graphics looks much better maxed out on the pc.\n+ Much of the same formula and gameplay, improved rng\n+ environmental destruction improvement adds so much to the strategy including grounds building floors blowing up which can create win conditions.\n+ New Concealment system, More weapons, technology and loadout and class trees with stats to help in the battle against the aliens.\n+ Emphasis on the base building of choices you can invest in to get stronger. The choice is yours but the wrong investment can spell your downfall. Go for Supplies? More scientists? Engineers? or keep attacking?\n+ Your base is now a badass mothership, and even called avengers at times I thought it was the avenger ship\n+ Randomized missions and more side missions, the aliens COUNTER ATTACKS this time too.\n+ Many new types of alien enemies and they look damn good. They'll knock you around like pebbles.\n+ Multiplayer with ranks, quickmatches and custom games.\n+ Mods support\n+ Close your windows, shut your doors, hundreds of hours galore\n\nCons - Some performance issue in certain areas and a bit of stutter/fps drops (miniscule such as loadout and lifting off) - hopefully they patch this up!\n- Some graphic clippings, enemy clipping walls, you making wierd shots, invisible guns but miniscule things due to engine.\n- even though the rng is better a bit with the new buff skills, you can still miss an enemy while standing in thier face with 80% chance of shot lol.\n- Most missions have move times, its super rough if you aren't fast.

I dont like being forced into running blindly into trouble because theres no other way I can get there quicker. It shouldn't be in so many missions like it is. I feel like it was only added to combat the over powered Overwatch mechanic and instead of balancing that they made you have to rush threw the maps.\n\nAlso personally I like using a controller with the first game over 100 hours played I perfer playing on a big screen in my recliner and not having to use a mouse/kb with this game.

I am a big fan of the franchise and a big fan of the previous game, enemy unknown/within. XCOM 2 was probably the one game that I looked foward to playing in 2016. I was more excited about this game than any other AAA games or indie games that are coming out this year. It is sad to say that the game did not live up to my expecation at launch. I say this because the core premise of the gameplay is good, but the technical aspect of the game is horrible. The peformance and bugs that came with release of this game can rival that of Batman Arkham Knight and Assassin Creed Unity at launch. What really gets to me is that this is a PC exlusive game, so it should have beeen the game that comes out the most polished on the PC platform in this current generation and the graphics in this game are good but not mindblowing to a point where gtx 970 should not be getting 20fps in sideview of your avenger base. It is hard to defend this game base on optimization and bugs because the game have been delayed so the developers have ample amount of time to fix the performance and bugs reported from the review copies of the game. Aside from the technical problems, I really enjoy playing this game because it is XCOM at heart. If you are new to the franchise I recommend waiting until hotfix or performance patch have been rolled out. I would glady change my review when technical problems have been solve by patches but I feel like performance wise this is the best we are going to get. I am not hoping to see major performance upgrade from patches because the peformance problem may tied in to their heavy tinkering with the Unreal Engine 3. I hope they prove me wrong.","February 5","false","59.4"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","20","31","0","0"

It's ugly and more or less unplayable. A little googling revealed that this is a known issue and that many others suffer from sucky framerate and lag, no matter what the pc. The official support response is generic and useless to say the least. The game is poorly poorly optimized. All in all, a total waste of money on my part. I am also sick and tired of Steam allowing game developers/companies to severely understate the minimum requirements for their games just so they can reach a broader market and make more sales to people who would be put off by any HONEST approximation of a games requirements. I believe that to be the case here. This game is not even in a releasable state in my opinion. Corporate greed and corner cutting to capitalize on the success of the previous titles.

I would swear it's different from the one that got downloaded to my system.\n\nSerious balance issues, buggy, performance is really below where it should be. With graphics turned all the way down, or all the way up, it still chugs and lags so bad on my system that I can hardly play. Delivers the same frustrations as the previous game with little of the novelty. Enemy reinforcements are frequent and punishing, even on lower difficulty levels. Overpowered enemy units show up early in campaign and make some required missions nearly impossible to complete. You will run out of soldiers frequently through attrition or when everybody is in sickbay for a month.\n\nEVERYTHING has a time limit, or a timer, or a progress bar, or some hidden event that will push you to the brink of ruin. Tactics and choice are truly very limited, the concealment idea is nice but poorly executed- how can I put my units where I want them AND engage overwatch, etc when there are so many detection zones, and I have just a handful of turns to complete my objective? No time really given to let you learn things, I guess the idea is you will fail in your first game somewhere, give up, and play again with all your "training" in place.\n\nApparently there is a "correct" tech path to take in order to go very far in the game- don't deviate or you will quickly be outmatched and outgunned to the point of abandoning the game. DONT USE MODS UNTIL EVERYTHING IS PATCHED- they seem to corrupt your savegames :). That was a fun discovery.\n\nThis could all be done in a fun way, but it isn't. If XCom was Civ 5, XCom 2 is Beyond Earth. Somebody at Firaxis needs to sit down and figure out what they used to do right, and do that, instead of whatever they're doing now.\n\nDefinitely not worth full price. DLC is dangled out there in Summer (really?), so if you want to finish the game and then wait four months to play it again WITH A NEW HAT, grab it now. Knowing what I do now, I'd pick it up when it's on sale and patched, or when mods are out that help balance the game and make it enjoyable.","February 7","false","43.7"," 55 of 97 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","55","97","5","0"

It honestly doesn't feel like a full sequel. Feels like XCOM: Enemy Unknown 1.5. But that's not really a bad thing. As mentioned, many things have been refined and streamlined, and there have been a host of new additions that do mix things up to a certain degree. Though yes, at the same time, I must say I am a tad disappointed that things aren't more different.\n\nSo, long story short, if you like XCOM: EU you will most probably like XCOM 2 as well. The campaign length for a first run is around 40-50 hours.\n\nNow, the game has some glaring issues. One is optimization. I honestly do not find the graphics to be anything stellar (they don't seem that different from in XCOM EU), but even on the lowest settings I am getting absolutely terrible performance.\n\nAnother is from time to time, the game can bug out. I hacked a Sectapod successfully, yet somehow it remains out of my control and kills my troops on the next turn. Then there was once a muton who was actually on the roof, but the graphics made it look like it was at the bottom of the roof. And once my scanning went to -3 days (it just bugged out).\n\nGameplay wise, too many enemies are just bullet sponges in the mid-to-late game.\n\nNow that I am right at the end of the final mission, I can say that this game suffers the same two issues from XCOM EU.\n\n1) The mid-to-late game is relatively much, much easier than the fiendishly difficult early game.\n\n2) There is no "middle ground" difficulty setting between Veteran (a tad too easy) and Commander (a tad too difficult)\n\nThis game is a net recommendation actually but I leave a thumbs down until Firaxis can fix the optimization issues at least.","February 11","false","87.4"," 32 of 54 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","32","54","0","4"

This is truly what a sequel should be, improving on the bad, making the good better, adding some new features, and taking away anything unecessary. This game feels exactly like the original (the one in 2011) and former Xcom players will have no problems jumping in. Likewise, newcomers will find this game to be a bit harsh at first if they don't know what they're doing or if they don't know what the best strategy is, though there are lots of guides to help with that. To me though, the hardest part definitely comes in management. The Avatar Project, or the main thing you're fighting, can only be slown down by certain operations, it's no longer the take your time that we're used to in EW, but it still can feel a lot like it the further in the game you go. On a similar note, combat has been revamped and with all the other people talking about concealment and timed missions, I won't go into it, though I will say I like both. Another good thing is the multitude of ways to finish missions. In EW it was straight up kill all enemies or rescue certain amount of civs then kill all enemies. Now, there are missions such as hostage rescue, comm defense, comm destruction, vip capturing, and even detonating bases. The way they all function is great as well, they have multiple ways of finishing them, you can either go in guns blazing with a full squad, or use a lone soldier to capture an objective and then high tale it out without killing anyone. In general, it's a fun game and a great way to feel mad after seeing your rookies constantly mess up. 9/10","February 13","true","104.7"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","0"

I'm going to stay true facts that many others have come across and myself as well.\n\nThe games RNG has only gotten worse from the last game, simple as that.\nMost missions you will lose most of your squad or your entire squad.\nThe only way to do much of anything in this game is to be a "save scum" and reload till things go your way.\nThis is nowhere near what the community hoped for in a Xcom game since honestly? Its just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game literally,It's like the Developers thought hm? Nothings really wrong with the game(nothing was) So lets make a sequel exact same game, just a few different things and lets up the difficulty scale by 100.\nIt's kind of ridicoulous of much time i have to spent on one mission, I spent up to 3 hours per mission and lose my entire squad.\n\nNo i am not one of those people who are oblivious to everything and fail at gaming no i am sadly a veteran nerd at gaming specially turn based games like these. I've been following Xcom game series for my entire life i love them to bits. But this? This is just unfair, cruel and honestly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, i regret spending 60 dollars on this trash.\nEveryone about this game is also predetermined once you start up a game or make a shot instantly its predetermined so if you lose and reload and then try the same ♥♥♥♥ again, Same result, if you move a little to the left same result. That shot is predetermined. There is no RNG in this it's just a masochist game for junkies. Sadly i'm a dedicated gamer so i will continue to try to make this game work for me or wait till there is mods that will actually do something about this unbelievable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. And i am prepared to face the amount of fanboys who will come to this games rescue but fun fact, I've already made 10 people run away crying with the kind of ♥♥♥♥ i can say against this game. I do love it, but its also complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, a waste of time and money. There are very few cons to this game which are outweighed by literally everything about this game.\n\nYou will see top reviews about (don't listen to the people who just point out a few cons) Yea no thats just another fanboy trying to get you to support this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game. Difficulty is annoying, the "RNG" is pathetic. There is also many smaller details i can gladly give anyone who is willing to listen and not waste 60 dollars on this failure of a Xcom game. Sadly my review won't do ♥♥♥♥, i doubt anyone will see it but i hope someone does, i hope this spreads cause i'm tired of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t games getting rep for being good.

Strategic elements are entertaining and interesting.  I find it challenging that attempting to gather resources may cost you in the long run because it forces you to choose between gathering or accomplishing missions rather than being able to achieve both.  In terms of tactical combat, this is a terrible game.  The cover system is horribly flawed.  Elevation plays no impact in the game whatsoever.  Having a good angle on an opponent means nothing if their plane of cover is between you and your target.  Fog of war prevents you from being able to make rational ambushes more than once per mission.  It's as though the game is designed around quick saving because they can't come up with a more creative engine, just nerf certain aspects such as overwatch.  Honestly had way more fun with the Front Mission series.  It's not that I expected this game to be that series, it's that it doesn't offer anything more than it.  A good tactical game should allow you to recover from an initial mistake if you play your cards right, not heavily punish you for scouting fog of war.  If you're going to make it so enemies can instantly discover me behind cover, you may as well make them all aware of my presence after the first ambush.","February 13","false","12.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It's such a huge, HUGE downgrade from it's predecessor in this regard, it's impossible not to notice.\n\nTake my advice: Before buying this game, either pick up and try Enemy Unknown or reinstall and play through it again, then ask yourself if you really want to see that game call of duty-ified to no end, because that's honestly all XCOM 2 will seem like in comparison to it's predecessor.","February 13","false","79.1"," 36 of 62 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","36","62","0","1"

All the right ingredients are there, and it should be the best XCOM game ever made according to the sum of its features.\n\nYet the restrictive turn counters that appear in most missions utterly ruin the game, and indeed go against what has always been XCOMs central concept. No longer do you carefully plan your way to victory, but instead find yourself scrambling to rush to an objective completely arbitrarily. Apart from anything else, it simply restricts the way you can play a mission. In the past, if people wanted to rush an objective, that was one of many possible strategies. Now, in most missions, it is the only possible strategy.\n\nThe problem is only exarcebated because most of the maps are randomised, meaning there is no guarantee an objective is even completeable in the time allowed. When your entire squad can be wiped out on failure of certain mission types, this becomes a simply inexcusable and frankly game ruining design feature.\n\nIn all other aspects this is a truly fantastic game, and those 1 out of 10 missions where there are no timers can be incredibly gripping. But knowing that a potentially game ending mission (through no fault of my own) could be just around the corner makes it increasingly difficult for me to play this.","February 9","false","15.9"," 45 of 79 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","45","79","3","4"

Aliens are actually a threat!\n+ Tons of different items for solders to use (various granades, ammo types, gun mods)\n+ Turn based missions make overwatch turtling an impossible strategy, which was pretty much the I-Win-Button for XCOM EU/EW. Also adds a sense of urgency.\n+ Ranged heals\n+ New classes are well designed and have some neat perks\n\n- Some performance issues. Sometimes there's a 5 - 10 second pause at the start of the enemy turn. Sometimes on the enemy turn the screen will go black.

These were added in Enemy Within (along with localization), and should have remained. Even if Firaxis didn't localise there for XCOM 2, I'm sure a copy/paste of sound files from EW would have pleased those overseas.

Even on the lowest settings on a computer that can run games like witcher 3 on the near highest settings at 60, this game chugs and chugs and chugs even on the lowest settings. It chugs when loading the main menu and missions, it chugs when you throw a grenade, it chugs when something explodes, it chugs when the aliens take a turn or do literally everything.

Aliens have taken over the Earth and it is your duty to reclaim our planet.\n\nAll your favourate character classes are back: Snipers, Assault, Heavies and support.\nHeavie is now called the Grenadier and, as the name suggests, now carries a powerful and upgradable grenade launcher as well as the good 'ol minigun you already know from the previous game.\nSnipers now have a powerful pistol they can use as well as their usual long range sniper rifle.\nSupport is now known as the Specialist and they have a military drone that can hack into the enemy's network, heal teammates or electrocute enemies.\nAssault is now called Ranger and they wield swords. You read that right. Swords, baby, swords! Hack 'n' slash through the alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who shot down your ride!\nYou can now customise all of your soldiers tho. You can change their sex, name, nationality, voice, hairstyle and colour, armor style, colour, camo and same for weapons. You can even download mods from the Steam Workshop to take customisation to the next level.\nI had a tough military looking guy in my squad. His name was Arny "GetToDaChoppa" Commando and he used the Arnold Schwarzenegger Voice Pack. Amazing!\nR.I.P Arny Commando. You'll be missed.\n\nYour base is now an alien spaceship. You can fly it around the Earth to collect supplies, build resistance radio towers, contact and join your forces with the resistance in different countries, visit the Black Market and go on missions.\nWhere we’re going, we don't need roads.\nRemember collecting resources with the Normandy in Mass Effect 2? That's basically how the "Earth map" plays out in XCOM2. It may sound like there's much to do on that map but there really isn't. Fortunatelly you don't spend too much time there. It's a cool addition but near the end i realised how repetitive and boring it really was and it just turned into a chore after a while. It's still a cool addition tho. I just wish there was a bit more to do on that map and that they wouldn't spam counsel missions that much.\n\nWhat more can i say? The graphics are improved. The gameplay is exactly the same as in the previous title which is good. There were couple of graphical glitches and i experienced 2 crashes in my 38 hours of gameplay but overall i'd say  that XCOM 2 had a pretty good launch (which seems to be rare in this day and age) and is an absolute joy to play.\nDefinitely a must buy for all strategy fans.\n\nBuy it now and start savescumming!","February 27","true","37.6"," 100 of 183 people (55%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","55","100","183","11","7"

I was hooked, no question about it; I set myself offline on Steam and Skype just to keep playing, and didn't regret not seeing the light of day. And even, to top it off, the only surviving soldier from the very beginning became my first Psi soldier, and she ended up triggering the final cutscene - MVP? Definitely. I was fully invested in the most understated sense possible.\n\nHowever, this game, whilst it's definitely not a bad game, doesn't have the same level of connection to me. Whilst I get that the beginning levels of a game shouldn't be unfailable, nor should they feel like the halfway point of the previous title in the franchise. I get the whole "You've lost the war, you're on the backfoot; survive." sort of thing, and I like it in concept, but in action it just feels poorly done. I neither feel like I'm the underdog - since I'm getting to every conflict on my side of the globe with six soldiers, a flying boat, and a ♥♥♥♥-ton of grenades - nor am I the remnants of a super-efficient private war unit - since I've got a scientist, a girl who makes her colleagues do everything, and a commander who won the award for "Most cliche, expressionless soldier" at the army's summer ball.\n\nIt just doesn't feel like XCOM. The aliens have really ramped up their abilities too; of course this makes sense, but towards the end of XCOM EU this felt like a tactical issue rather than a resigned "Yup". My skirmishes go somewhat like this: "Alright, okay, everyone in position. Twelve turns to move this MVP and the squad up to the evac point (which could have literally been on top of us, but okay). Put these guys into position over there annndd ♥♥♥♥. ♥♥♥♥. Okay, we'll flank h- ♥♥♥♥. You're mind controlled are you? Okay, right, he's floating in the air." and so on. That floating in the air bit actually happened at a point where two of my soldier were side-by-side on a church rooftop, which got blown out from underneath them. One fell to their death, the other just calmy stood up there, not being able to move off of the nothing that he was now perched on.\n\nIn summary: it's frustrating, it's slow, and it's definitely not the sequel to XCOM EU.\nBut since I'm not one for spoiling things, I'll let you find out about the performance issues yourself.","February 7","false","44.0"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","21","34","5","0"

Take note that my review is from only having played the very old Xcom games, and not any of the recent titles. (im a bit of an oldie gamer). A lot of people are saying the same thing, the cons outweigh the pros.\n\n-=PROS:=-\nA) The Overwatch system is a great new addition to the game, the ability to setup an ambush from stealth is a great way to open a fight, however..it comes with its own problems (See Cons 'A')\nB) The graphics, music and voice acting are all amazing here apart from 'The Council's voice...never liked that movie-voice dude, its a bit too over-the-top > to > just plain annoying, TALK PROPERLY DAMMIT.\nC) I love how you can customize your characters and even import/export your friends characters to the game, making every soldier in this game someone you care about, and not just another worthless grunt. You CARE about your teammembers.\nD) I love how destructible the maps are.\n\n-=CONS:=-\nA) Unfair Enemy advantages, leading to poor balance where 'save-scumming' is the only way to win (repeatedly saving again and again until there is actually a possible way to win or proceed. See below:\na1) Enemies have a free movement action DURING YOUR TURN when discovered rather than at the end of your turn, meaning your overwatch ambush from stealth, (which hasnt yet been finished being setup), isnt allowed to be finished during your turn because the free movement action allows your enemies to run away or take cover before you have applied Overwatch to your teammembers. This is highly unfair when NOT discovered. This almost removes the fact that it is a turn-based game, when your enemies are breaking the most basic rule of a turn-based game. If they can move during your turn, as they are now, it makes completing missions almost impossible in a high number of missions because YOU dont have the advantage of moving however the f### you please when its not your turn.\na2) Enemies are given an unfair amount of action points which seems to change repeatedly. For example, (and you'll know what i mean if you have played) Players are limited to 2 action points, enemies however seem to breach this. I had a Viper who MOVED, TONGUE-PULLED, COILED, and ACID SPIT the rest of the team all in the same turn, turning my winning game, into a lost one, in a single turn that was not possible to defend against. Another example are Stun Baton soldiers, who are given 2 Running actions, and are still allowed to attack, which leads to another gamebreaking problem:\na3) Most Enemies are all given very unfair 'INSTANT KILL' and 'INSTANT INCAPACITATE' abilities, which are able to be carried out from absurd distances. 1: Viper Tonguepull into coils from 8 spaces away, through 5 'Full Cover' walls (another bug/exploit). 2: Mindcontrol from 12 spaces away (meaning your team has to make a suicide run up to the controller to stop it, meaning, you're screwed 3: Stun Baton from over 10 spaces away -.-, the list of Instant-Kill abilities just goes on, which are super unfair considering my next point:\na4) Your team size is limited to between 4-6, you can end up in fights against 20 aliens at the same time...meaning they get far more turns to kill you, and most aliens (see a3) can choose, whenever they feel like, to instantly kill your whole team in a way you cannot defend against, with no counter especially early-to-mid game, way before their turn is even over. Xcom original let you take way more soldiers and even tanks into the battlefield, why are we limited to such a small team size? And dont give me that 'Graphical limitation' bullcrap, Xcom ran tonnes of soldiers and aliens at the same time on the Commador Amiga, back in 1994.\na5) Cover and Aim, is bugged and broken. Cover doesnt do anything right now, everyone just shoots you or instant-kills you THROUGH it. You can be in an aliens face with a shotgun, whilst flanking, from behind with a 95% chance to hit (why the hell isnt it 100%) and that 95% shot will ACTUALLY miss 50% of the time. Now i know Xcom is about RNG, im a very experience player of these types of game, but the Aim RNG is actually BROKEN. The % shown to you is not actually the correct %. Many many more players are confirming the same bug. You can actually shoot enemies, and they can shoot you, through Solid Rock, and multiple thick layers of alien metal and still hit you for full damage....wtf is going on here, FIX THIS FIRAXIS.\na6) Some missions are so hard, that you can die on your very first turn, wth NO way to survive it, and given no control whatsoever to prevent it. I started a mission to protect a village from attack, (early game too) and had 2 heavy armor units, 3 special health-regen enemies, 2 mind control units, and 5 Advent soldiers who had all started, spawned right in front of my face at the beginning of the mission....they of course Instantly got a Free Movement Action during MY TURN DAMMIT, and then once i told them to take cover it didnt matter..the mission was impossible, and was Instant-death from the moment i came out of the Mission Start screen -.- this is BROKEN.\n\nHoly crap i think im done with point A.\n\nB) There's no time to do anything in the world. The moment you want to collect a resource, 10 major disasters will happen the moment you want to attempt to get some basic income going, even at the beginning of the game, collecting basic Starter resources gets you screwed over. These disasters and events seriously need reducing in frequency. If you dont do them, the penalties are so harshe theyre too easy to ruin the rest of your game right from the beginning! It's too much of a rush.\n\nC) When you do the final misison (no spoilers of course) the game is just OVER. No more freeroaming no more 'confront alien invaders' its just THE END. You cannot continue playing......WTF Firaxis. This needs to change, once the story mode is over, random alien attacks, missions and enemy ships should still be happening, like the good old days of Xcom where the game mode is Infinitely long and you can continue playing to your hearts content.\n\nD) No Skyranger VS UFO Ship  battles and downed-ship invasions to recover parts like the good days of Xcom (how Xcom was supposed to be played), if you run into a UFO, the game just goes "You have instantly lost, defend your ship" or in other words, GAME OVER, lets just drag out your slow death by rubbing it in your face for the next hour.\n\nE) The Avatar Project timer which limits everything you do to a GAME OVER timer, ruins the game for me, seriously just remove it entirely and go back to the classic Endless Mode of the 90's. I dont want the duration of my game to be limited and then END when its the end of the game...it makes all my efforts feel pointless, because The End means you cant play anymore.\n\nF) No friendly fire means you can shoot a minigun at an enemy who is engaged in melee with several other squadmates with no penalties or chance of them being hit. This is just WRONG and senseless when you watch a cutscene of 100 bullets go literally through your allies to hit an enemy, friendly fire needs to return.\n-\nand many many more issues.\n\nHOWEVER....all is not lost here. The game feels amazing to play, this review could easily change to RECOMMEND if Firaxis does the following:\n\n1) Fix the bugs, many of them are gamebreakers.\n2) Work HARD on balance, because you have a LOT OF WORK to do here.\n3) Allow greater squad sizes +Tank/Heavy Armor like the good days of Xcom. This game is a downgrade from the 1994 systems, and those fit onto a 2.4mb floppy disk -.-\n4) Bring back ENDLESS MODE, no Xcom veteren wants the fight againstthe alien to just 'end'. -.-\n5) Bring back SHIP - VS - SHIP battles","February 18","false","69.9"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","21","34","2","0"

They ruin the pace and strategy of the game for me and force you down one path - rushing the objective.  In a single player turn based strategy game I like to take my time and try different ways of achieving the objective.\n\nOne suggestion would be to make it so the timer doesn't even start ticking until you are out of stealth at the start of the mission, but overall I just don't like the timers.  I certainly don't think that they should be in 75% of the missions.  If timed missions came up around 10% of the time I would be OK with it, so maybe it is a question of not enough diversity in the mission types?\n\nHopefully the modding community can sort this problem out.\n\nThe other problem is the performance of the game, which I have found to be all over the place, and I have a pretty good PC (i7 4790k, GTX970, 16GB RAM, SSD).","February 6","false","84.1"," 57 of 102 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","57","102","4","0"

The game makes you feel pressured and you often have to decide on the best of two bad options. The field game is a lot more in depth and plays a lot more like old school X-Com. that said there are a lot of problems. Some of this stuff can be fixed with patches, however, on some level the game is just fundamentally flawed.\n\nIt's hard, and I'm fine with that, XCOM should be hard, though I feel a lot of the time it's hard in the wrong ways.\n\nThe missions often have time limits, and that's okay in itself but combine that with the way aliens enter the fight (they become active in packs of 2-3 as soon as one of your soldiers spots one of the pack, at which point they get a free move to cover) means that it is never smart to push out more than a few spaces a turn. If you discover a pack with your penultimate or last move of a round, 2-3 strong aliens get a free move to cover (or, even worse flank you) and then have a whole round to take down a couple of guys.\n\nThe game pushes you forward with time limits and then punishes you for moving forward at even a moderate rate.\n\nAlso, a lot of people seem to feel melee is OP, I'm not sure I'd agree with that, but I don't think it feels very good. If you run up and take a sword swipe at something and miss, that soldier is probably dead.\n\nThe geoscape gameplay is not very well explained either, I'd advise treating your first game as a throwaway until you get the hang of how that works.\n\nLastly, this game is really badly optimised, lots and lots of slowdowns, the game hanging for 5-10 seconds. Lots of gaps in the action, you'll throw a grenade, and there is significant gaps between the grenade being thrown, exploding, damage being dealt and the next action taking place.\n\nThis game does have a lot of potential, but I don't think they can change the gameplay enough with patches to really make the gameplay coherent, the mechanics complementary and the difficulty.tough but fair.","February 14","false","27.0"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","22","36","0","0"

I've played XCOM1 for 255 hours, but I do not feel like giving XCOM2 more than the 55ish hours I gave it so far\n\nXCOM2 follows the same pattern the previous games did: start with rookies, study alien tech, build some armors and weapons, learn psionics, find a way to the aliens' base and destroy it, and have your base attacked at least once in the process. There's even pretty much the same tech development - assault rifles into magnetic guns (laser guns) and then plasma. Only 3 armor tech levels too. Sure, there are modifications and some fancy variations of weapons and armors, but that's still underwhelming. This is hardly an improvement on XCOM1:EW. I expected XCOM2 to be much more developed than EW, but it's merely on par. It's not even longer than XCOM1.\n\nThe final mission is also an insult to the player. I don't want to spoil the surprise here, but it was not just difficult, the designers made it simply unfair. I was about to prevail against the odds, when the crucial enemy I needed to kill teleported away to the other end of the gigantic map leaving me sorrounded by a dozen enemies.\n\nThe game is a bit glitchy and unstable - hopefully there will be patches in the future to fix that. Fortunately, not everything is gamebreaking, but I had to restart the game and steam several times in my playthrough. Frozen cutscenes, cutscenes displayed more than once, disappearing/stuttering/looped audio. Currently, it is not worth its full price - I recommend waiting for discounts.\n\nWhat is perhaps the most puzzling is the poor design of gameplay. Sometimes I would roar in frustration because I had to listen to the same dialogues over and over again after restarting a mission and there was no way to skip it - the apogeum of frustration are the terror missions. The game still hijacks the camera away from you (I think I know better what I want to look at, thanks). Also, does the cam really have to center on the soldier I switch to every time? Lots of your time will be wasted for no reason at all (I recommend getting some mods to fix that - they don't change any balance, such as Quiet Bradford) because apparently you need full 10-15 seconds to be told that there has been progress on the Avatar project.\n\nThere are several improvements though: waypoint soldier movement, reloading does not end the turn anymore, more class balance, diversified enemies, diversified terrain, soldier customization, simplified base build-up, melee attacks (finally!!!). I might have forgotten some things, but they certainly do not change my opinion of the game.","April 23","false","53.1"," 85 of 155 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","85","155","4","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gimfigle496/recommended/268500/","Gimfigle496","Gim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gimfigle496/","207 products in account","Finally fully finished a run of this game so I am now able to give a complete rundown of the game.\n\nThis game takes the normal formula of an XCOM game and twists it to fit the guerilla warfare style of the story. While this is refreshing and forces to player to play far more offensively and aggressively there are some issues in doing so that I feel were not ironed out before launch as was left up to the modding community to fix.\n\nStory:\nThe story opens with the Commander being rescued by his old advisor and reveals that Enemy Unknown/Within never happened at all and that it was a series of simulations done by the aliens immediately following the instant surrender of Earth after they captured the Commander. The story continues to unfold with the game and the decisions of the player but every so often key parts of the story open up and show that the aliens are actually doing bad things to humanity rather than actually helping them and culminates on a final assualt.\nA lot of people had a problem with how the first game was relegated to simulations but I find that outcome not only logical but hilarious considering that only 10% of people even beat Enemy Unknown at all with how easy that game is. My problem is that the stance of the aliens is barely explored at all throughout the game and only does get explored on the final mission.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is still the same at its core as it was in Enemy Unknown but with added features and elements. The main feature added is the Concealment mode. This allows your team to move around without enemies heatseeking them until you open fire or enter their field of view, which in turn allows you to set up an ambush.\nAlong with concealment, some new features were added along with some new goodies, too. A lot of classes have been reworked from EU and gun attachments that augment how a specific soldier operates and new explosives and armor have been added as well. The main problem with the gameplay is how Concealment works logically with some of the timer missions. Why would they rig their own supplies to explode when they don't even know that XCOM is in the area?\n\nGraphics and Performance:\nThis is where the game really falls apart. While the game as a whole looks pretty good, it performs like absolute ♥♥♥♥. With a 970 memecard, I was getting huge frame issues on max settings even after the patch. Turning off ambient occlusion and reducing AA to FXAA helped a lot but there were still issues that caused it to dip into the 40s after turning off some partical effects as well.\n\nAudio and Music:\nThe music is still roughly the same as it was in EU but sounds a lot more triumphant upon a victory than before, mainly due to being a tiny rebel force fighting a huge alien force that has the planet in its grasp. The audio is about as standard as it gets but voiceovers can NOT be skipped and during retaliation missions, Bradford never shuts up and continues to repeat the same unskippable dialogue over and over each turn.\n\nOther:\nThere isn't much else to talk about aside from the modding community. While Firaxis left a lot of issues in the vanilla game, they made modding tools very open and acceisble to the community and they have done wonders for this game. From adding small aesthetic mods to full blown mods changing how Concealment and timers work, the modders have done good work and have effectively fixed all the issues of the game. This does not excuse Firaxis for releasing the game in the state it was, but it allows players to easily change the game to either their liking or just enough to fix some issues they have with some game mechanics. Keep it up, mod community. You guys do good work.\n\nEpilogue/tl;dr:\nEven with all the graphical and gameplay issues, the game is still solid and adds a great deal more content to play with and against and any issue a player might have with the game can be fixed with the click of a button in the workshop.\nWARNING: Adding a mod to a campaign and then removing it and attempting to continue playing will result in an error and bypassing that error may result the campaign corrupting or becoming unplayable.\n\nI give this game a solid 8/10 and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of XCOM, new or old, or strategy games in the vein of XCOM in general and would recommend those that aren't to at least give it a good shot.","May 12","true","51.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

Mainly because it's so much missed potential and some major design decisions that ruin the experience. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent game, but I feel it does not deserve all the credit it's getting from official reviewers, and frankly giving this game anything higher than 7/10 just proves that they have no real grasp of game design or game mechanics.\n\nAt a first glance the game looks and plays very much like the previous game, I recon this is why it's getting good reviews from a lot of reviewers who haven't really spent that much time playing. I played this on iron-man, and veteran settings because that's how I believe X-Com should be played to offer an interesting challenge. If you play it on easy settings your soldiers will have some unfair bonuses to your aim and damage.\n\nThe Good:\n- Upgraded graphics\n- More events, locations, enemies, gadgets and weapons\n- The random map generator. (Adds some degree of replayability to the regular missions)\n- The mod support\n- Addition of "stealth"\n\nThe Bad:\n- Too much randomness, random events that screw up the most carefully planned mission. Events that you as a player could not have had any chance of predicting. It's just too much.\n- "Unfair" rules, say that you sneak past a group of enemies and think you were smart, think again. If you complete the main objective all enemies that have not been activated might be activated at once and rush you.\n- Timed missions, most missions have a timer attached forcing you to have to sprint forward in order to reach the objective in time, This in turn makes stealth tactics or any tactics for that matter pretty useless.\n- Enemy behaviours don't match their roles. As an example zombie aliens can move about as far as your soldiers per turn, even though they look and are animated like they should be far slower.\n- Lack of unique soldiers/recruits. They are so obviously randomly generated that they sort of lose their "personality". Lazily written descriptions where there could have been hundreds of stories for the soldiers making them seem more real.","February 6","false","54.7"," 34 of 59 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","34","59","3","1"

To give you an idea of my specs:\n\nGtx 980\nIntel i7 3.50\n16 GB ram\n\n--------\n\nSo, the game makes my pc STRUGGLE at max graphics, a pc that handles witcher 3 on max with no issues whatsoever. However, it only struggles when i maximize the settings. If i set them to medium, there will be some framerate stutters here and there. I do not know if this optimization issue is only relevant to the GTX 980, or if it is worse on other cards out there on the market.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as the first one, with some annoying things (that can be solved with mods, true- but we're reviewing the game itself here.) The gameplay has to be described as "annoying" because that's exactly what it is.  If all of your squadmates are on the same extraction platform, why do you have to extract each and every one of them individually, why not add an exctract all button? (There is a mod that solves this, however.)\n\nThe game continiously annoys the living crap out of you with dialogue, dialogue hindering you from doing anything on your turn. "We've just recieved a transmission due to X". Or, one of your officers pop up in the right side window, mentioning you do not have many turns left. Why am I not allowed to do anything while he's talking? And this goes on and on and on in the game! I couldn't bring myself to play it any more. (However, there is a mod that fixes this.)\n\nThe worst experience so far- for me, Is the world map. I had one day left on my research, and I started it. One day usually takes 1.5 seconds to pass. This took me three minutes, due to dialogue popping up, that was unskippable, mentionings of the avatar project growing further. The camera pans to where the avatar project is on the map, but does not pan back to where you were before on the map. HALTING your production as well. So, I start it again and another dialogue pops up. It's atrociously annoying!\n\nIf you did dislike timed missions in the last XCOM game, then this game just isn't for you. 80% of all missions are "8 turns left to finish before X explodes" or something else. While, it encourages the player to use tactics, it is just too much of it. Almost every god damn mission! (there is a mod that fixes this.)\n\nThe loading times are bad, just dreadful.\n\nThe game saves itself ONLY because of mods. Mods made by players to fix this boring & annoying game.\n\nI would not recommend you buy this game. But if you do, I would recommend checking out the mods in the workshop section fixing this game!","February 21","false","3.1"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","16","25","2","0"

So might as well do something I procrastinated the hell out of because I swear to CHRIST I had put a review of this up about a month ago.\n\nXCom 2 is good. Now we got that out of the way, I'm going to say it now, I don't know why I didn't love it like my own child like I did with XCom: Enemy Unknown.\n\nThe idea is good, the plan is good. I like the idea of using resistance tactics to work against the alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but it wasn't used to it's extent I feel. Maybe it was the Avatar Project-- I think the dogs are knocking on the back door again, hold on.\n\nWhere was I? Avatar Project, yes. Everything in the game had to be sped up quite a bit because of the ensuing project that would end in a game over if it were completed. So research and development didn't have that vibe of being a small child looking at a red firetruck through the window of a store and knowing you'll get it Christmas morning considering how quickly your technology advanced. You don't see plasma pistols and say, "Mommy why don't I have that?" Then Dr. Vahleen says, "Commander, could you stop talking to me like that?" in that god-awful accent... as you are escorted out of the labratory and a new rule is in that you can't go in anymore. Anyway, more time for the science geeks to do their science fair project and more for you to hold the line against the alien threat.\n\nThe additions to classes and how they work are amazing, helpful, and of course they realized how squad-sight is a must for snipers. But again, I never was able to field a psionic soldier till my next playthrough since I didn't have the supplies or time because of the Avatar Project.\n\nThis is a bit of a minor spoiler, but it pretty much is obvious quickly on in the game. At least... Ten minutes after the tutorial?\n\nIn the original XCom, you lose. Bam. As it is revealed, it turns out some of earth's leaders sold you out like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ patsy to the aliens. They-- hold on, something at my door.\n\n\n\nThe gracious aliens visit and land on earth peacefully with little to no roughness in their handling, but soon after you were taken to an anti-aggression facility to be processed!, and the aliens come in to advance our technology, solve all world diseases, bring world peace, and teach us about peace, harmony, and how we should-- T̸̼̟̼̬̝H̢͇͍ͅE̶Y̖̝̲͠ A̟̞R͓̖̹̩̙̫̘E̩̫͇̺͓̭͜ ͖̲̀LY̶̭̝̻̦I̫̪̠̟͍̪N̷̲̩͙G̗̗ ̥̣̭T̹̝͓͍͟O͉̣̺̝̣͉͈ ͇̫Y̪͎͙̠͚̯̗O̵̦͉̲ͅU̟͇͈̰̞͈̱ --love each other dearly.\n\nOur brilliant alien friends however are not opposed.

These diabolical TERRORISTS I dare call them would be willing to use new tactics to harm our valiant peacekeepers. Even barbaric weapons are being used such as swords are being used to cut into those that signed up to protect your neighborhood! Their tactics are under handed and aggressive. Using this new "Ambush" tactic that involves moving into positions, posing in "overwatch" until someone fires off the first shot.\n\nOur brave men never see it coming.\n\n"Overwatch" is a very effective tactic, for our own people, but when the aggressors against our glorious friends from the cosmos use it for ambushes, they have no aim penalty. Making them that much more dangerous to our troops merely seeking cover from their attack!\n\nBut do not despair my brothers and sisters, around the clock Advent is working on ways to isolate and take the aggressors to an anti-aggression facility for their own good! For example, we have our own craft flying about attempting to seek out the Avenger, the mobile HQ for the resistance. Once we brought it down by disabling their engines as peacefully as possible, the resistance fighters immediately broke out guns blazing at our peacekeepers attempting to defuse the situation! In fact, they destroyed the jamming beacon that kept their ship settled so we could help them!\n\nThey however could not bring everyone along, and managed to subdue a resistance fighter who was left behind by his own people.\n\n"They're ly-- HANDS OFF! They're going to k-- Lieutenant Barkley! Serial number five-five-- Advent is a lie!"\n\nThat savage aggression only shows how depraved these people are.

Remember, the old nations and their laws are gone, but until convicted, you are still innocent in the eyes of Advent.\n\nThe new tactics that are being used also went into resistance fighter classes... How dare I say that they're... Effective. Adding a new layer to the strategies being used by these belligerant XCom resistance fighters. Even their snipers becoming much more effective at hitting even civilian targets at further range.\n\nWe honor Mister--T͟ͅR̰̤ͨͪA̒̾͛ͪ̎͏͉͇̙Ḭ̷̮̝͖͌̅̏̑͛T̟ͨ͗̉ͨ̇̐ͦOͦ͌̐͛̊́ͥ҉̺͕̜͖̫Ȑ̨̞̲͕͇͒̏̄̑ -- Johnson's memory as he was lost in a tragic assassination by the resistance fighters.\n\nNever fear, my friends!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kozzy420/recommended/268500/","kozzy420","kozzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kozzy420/","478 products in account","So, Xcom 2 is here and people are asking "How is it?"\n\nOverall it is a great game and a really nice improvement over the last Xcom game, but it is not perfect. Let's start off with the Negatives shall we?\n\nThe game is not optimized very well and has some bugs, this seems to vary from person to person but there is no denying Firaxis needs to get to work on some performance fixes. I also had a few graphics bugs when my character goes to pick up his teammates when they are down and a few times the game has gone below 50 fps. No gamebreaking bugs and the performance issues have not been disasterous but they are there and should def be mentioned.\n\nWith all that said, shall we get to the positives now? There is alot of them so let's get started. First off there are some wonderful additions that really add to the gameplay and overall enjoyment of the game. The animations and graphics are also better, not drastically huge improvement but without a doubt things are smoother and tighter as far as how the game looks. There is a bunch of other new features that add to the game and make it feel like a well thought out sequel instead of just more of pretty much exactly the same as before ala AC or FC series. Voice acting is good and the game also controls very well. I can see myself playing this game for many, many hours. Alot of hours have gone into the old Xcom games and Enemy Unknown for me and this one will be no different, it is very addicting.\n\nOverall the good far outweigh the bad for me personally (and by a good amount) but some might want to hold off until a patch or two come out for the performance issues and small bugs. These are my thoughts after 16 hours on the game so far (I will post more after 50 hours, this right now is just a first impressions), if you love Xcom as a series this is a no brainer, I liked the last Xcom but it wasn't as good as the older xcom games, this game here though takes that the last game did well and adds a bunch of great features and improvements, while unfortunately suffering from the odd nagging issue. Xcom is back and it is back in a big way, once the kinks get ironed out this will be even better. Already a game of very high quality but at the same time one that can improve and get better in a few aspects. There are so many aspects to games, from graphics, to ai, writing, voice work, to gameplay,  performance, controls and much more. This game nails 90% of these things with near perfection, but struggles with that one issue, optimization.\n\nSo many mods for this game! Played a ton of hours on it now and I am blown away by how many cool mods there is already. New Classes, New Voice packs, new helmets/hats/tattoos,etc.. for customization your troops. Yes the game has bugs and performance issues, but that is really the only problem, everything else rules and is a nice improvement over the last game. Did I mention all the mods being awesome yet?

I played it on my PS3, PC/MAC, and my iPad. Hell, I still play it on my iPad. I then got into the Long War mod, and I couldn't play the base game anymore (except my iPad). XCOM 2 had some large shoes to fill. Did it?\n\nI think it did. Let me first put a disclaimer up. I didn't experience any crashes or game ending bugs. I somehow missed all of those. Sure, I had some slowdowns and long loads, but no crashes. Very few bugs at all. I don't even have that great of a system, but that's besides the point.\n\nI love XCOM 2. It took me a while to accept the timers, but when I did, I got over one of the few qualms I had with the game.\n\nI love the new story. We lost to the Aliens. How refreshing. We are having to fight back and try to re-conquer our world. AWESOME. We have new mission types, and we use the hellicarrier from the Aveng....  er... floating alien transport ship instead.\n\nWe are a guerilla force out to exact revenge as we uncover the plot of the story. The unit rebalance and customization is great. The new gameplay is great. The timers... um, not so much. But then we have mods.\n\nOh the mods, the glorious mods. After downloading a dozen, I can't play the base game anymore. The modders are making this game even better.\n\nHow would I score this game? Hmm, I would certainly recommend it, but players need to accept that the RNG is brutal. Really brutal, and the game is harder than XCOM:EU was. Is it as hard as the LW mod? No, but it can be on the highest difficulty.\n\nI have many more thoughts about it and if you are interested in reading them, here's a link: http://explorminate.net/2016/03/04/friday-excursion-xcom-2/\n\nHave fun commander, and if you want to know what mods are a must, just comment here and I will let you know what I use.","March 19","true","146.1"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","23","39","0","3"

For me, mainly two: the game isn't as optimised as it should be, I'm running a 650 Ti 2GB currently but I feel like it should be able to run the game at higher frames (although the game has never outright crashed). I also feel like the difficulty of the game needs some tweaking - I've been playing on the second difficulty and it feels too punishing in certain areas.\n\nIf you make one mistake in your research, mission choices or facility choices, you can find yourself in completely frustrating situations, like not having enough squad member slots, or wasting all your money on new soldiers because you didn't buy the facility needed to use the speed boost that heals your current soldiers faster and in time for the next mission. Once you realise your weaknesses and start trying to correct them down the road, the Avatar counter will keep ticking up as expected, not giving you enough time unless you want the red bar almost completely filled by the time you're prepared for the mission.\n\nMaking these types of oversights can make the game extremely tedious unless you constantly revert saves, which isn't how you want to play it. You can find yourself saving after every mission so you can revert to any point of the game and change your choices so that you can avoid the problem that made you revert in the first place.\n\nOverall, good game for strategy players and one that improves on Enemy Unknown. Don't buy if your graphics card is old or if you don't want to constantly revert saves or constantly lose all time and effort you invested into your playthrough.\n\n(Yes, I understand XCOM is meant to punish bad decisions, but personally I feel it went too far in that direction and could have been more forgiving at least a few times, especially on the first two difficulties).\n\nP.S.

Timed missions were the curse of the first part, because all the nice setups you can plan in this kind of game just need to be hurried and you cannot explore with a timer. This happens almost every single mission now. The entire laid-back feeling that made the XCOM series great for all that time is gone with this single change. It wouldnt be so bad if this happened to b the occasional odd-one-out timed mission. But it is almost every single one.\nThe same principle applies to the whole campaign by the way. Your only have the illusion of choosing your goals in the campaign, because the very narrow time limit has you chasing after primary objectives and the means necessary to acces them (contacts/intel) all the time. This always hectic feeling really squelches the fun out of what could be a prime gaming experience.\n\nThe second issue is the ridicoulous low performance and memory leaks.\nThe in-combat performance is really low on default settings, but can actually be tweaked via lowering graphic options to manageable levels. The bigger problem here is a kind of stuttering that is introduced after you run the game for some time. Usually starts with slightly longer breaks between turns, missions or changing a screen on the campaign map. The longer you play, the longer the pauses, until you feel like the game freezes every couple of seconds.\nNow this feels like something that could be patched in time, so the question remains: why on gods green earth does every premium developer nowadays resort to releasing half baked products?","February 6","false","27.4"," 192 of 361 people (53%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","53","192","361","13","10"

I was so stoked to get my hands on this new reiteration of the XCOM franchise, and after finishing the campaign, I am very happy to repport that 2K & Firaxis took it to a whole new level. They improved almost every aspect of the game, cutting off the unnecessary ones and gave us even more control over everything. That is how a sequel should be done! I remember my initial dissatisfaction at the delay in the launch date, but my, now I am so happy that they did, cause all the extra game polish worked wonders!\n\nXCOM2 is all about survival of the human race. The canon story behind XCOM Enemy Unknown/Within is that we lost horribly and the aliens decided to take the role of "benevolent" rulers who are constantly improving and "helping" humanity. Pockets of resistance across the world still remain and one of them is led by none other than "Central" - our trusty right hand, office Bradford from XCOM1. He goes on a hunt to discover YOU - yes, you, Commander are in the game! And so it begins...\n\nIn true fashion for my reviews, I will take a look at the good and the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1. Extremely immersive gameplay. To me, this point outweighs every single other. You will get immersed in the story, you will care heaps about the world you are living in, you will care about your soldiers as if they are your children, you will feel happy when all of them make it back and sad if someone gets injured or doesn't live through a mission. You will remember and tell their stories, and I can assure you, there will be tons of stories to tell.\n2. Amazing story, with great buildup, that only gets better till the final showdown. You will have full CLOSURE in XCOM2, and you will have a lot of fun finding out what happens to you, Bradford, the Council Leader, the old team, new team, everyone! Hell they even tell you why a Sectopod is called like that!!!\n3. A soundtrack elevated to the next level. Every single song will get you very pumped up and ready to go kick some alien ♥♥♥♥! Turn up the volume, cause you are in for a treat!\n4. Customization brought to a whole new level - every single thing is customizable now. You can totally expect to spend an inordinate amount of time just making soldier(s) look the way you want. You can fully customize:\n4.1. Your soldiers - name, sex, race, nationality, voice, posture, armor types, accessories, colors, etc. You can literally do everything.\n4.2. Their weapons - as in XCOM1, you have 3 tiers of shotguns, heavy guns, sniper rifles, pistols, and assault rifles that can be named, colored, improved with loot you find on the field, which leads to a ton of new combinations that fit your taste or vision of how the soldier should play out.\n4.3. Their armor - once again, you have 3 tiers of armor, which is extremely slick and aesthetically pleasing. In XCOM2 you get to kick ♥♥♥♥ and look good doing it. What's more to ask? To make things even better, armor types of the same tier don't get obsolete - and you can even make experimental armors to boot!\n5. The new Avenger, the better take on the world map, and the improved research and engineering – you are no longer forced into using the same best strategy over and over again. The Avenger is your base, and even though it is very much like the old one with levels and stuff to clear before building, it is mobile, which lets you get creative. The world map is your playground where you and the aliens both have your goals – they must complete the avatar project, you must prevent them from doing so by making contacts with other resistance cells, hitting them where it hurts, choosing in what way to hinder them, and so on. The research and engineering have seen marked improvement, and you are even allowed to do meta projects that are not mandatory, but can give you better gear, ammunition, powerful psi abilities, bestow skills from other classes to a certain soldier, and so on and so forth. This gives you a plethora of ways to approach the game!\n6. The graphics – XCOM2 is undoubtedly gorgeous. Streets, signs, the skyline, everything looks amazing.\n7. The Combat – the combat remains very much the same as it was in XCOM1, but there have been a lot of small tweaks to make it more fluid. A lot of actions that used to end your soldier’s turn in XCOM1 are now just half the cost – most notably the reload, which now means you can reload and then shoot! Add to that the whole new concealment mechanic where it is actually YOU stalking the aliens!\n8. The enemy variety – there are even more enemies in the game, ready to surprise you and make your life a living hell. Every enemy in this game comes with own set of skills and own danger level, and you will have a lot of “fun” discovering who can do what. And when you think you know everything, the enemy will suddenly use some secondary skill you never know he had… like that time a Muton charged my soldier and melee attacked her. And I was expecting shots or grenades…\n9. The soldier class variations – you may be disappointed to learn that you only have 4 main soldier classes (plus a secret one that I am not going to spoil for you), unlike the crazy amount that the Long War mod introduced, but don’t hate on the game just yet. Each class can be customized with skills (some that even belong to other classes!), psi abilities, weapons and weapon mods to such extent, that you can barely recognize your starting guy.\n10. The mission timers – so many people hate them, and it is understandable, but as an XCOM veteran, I welcome them. They give a sense of urgency and prevent cheap half move/overwatch tactics. And if you still think this is a bad thing, read No. 11!\n11. Modding – as Jake Solomon himself said, once you buy the game, it is yours to do whatever you please with it. Less than a week after release, there are already a good number of mods for you to choose whether to use or not, including ones that extend or flat out remove the mission timers people hate so much.\n12. The line of sight indicator – now you always know whether you are going to be able to shoot an enemy if you move to a certain position. While the camera could be a bit finicky to position in order to see whether the cross appears or not, whaddya know – there is a camera mod that helps with this!\n\nThe Bad:\n1. Bugs, bugs, bugs – XCOM1 was no stranger to bugs on release as well, but so far I haven’t had gamebreaking ones, and 95% of them can be solved with a simple save and reload. Unless you are playing Ironman, you have at least 3 mission autosave points to return to.\n2. Only 3 tiers of weapons and armor – while I don’t terribly mind, the Long War team was employed to help 2K/Firaxis, and they did create number of additional weapon and armor tiers for XCOM Long War… I guess it just wasn’t a priority here. I am quite sure there will be mods to remedy this, though.\n3. The learning curve – XCOM2 is a whole new XCOM, with many new things for you to discover and learn. It can be quite daunting of a task for a new player and even for veterans with hundreds of hours of XCOM1 under their belts. The game will also force you to break a good number of old habits, which can be quite disconcerting for some.\n4. Framerate is all over the place – many other people have found this to be an inconvenience and it is fair to point it out.\n5. Hefty hardware requirements – for a turn based strategy game, the recommended specs for the game are actually quite hefty.\n\nConclusion: XCOM2 is a marked improvement over XCOM1 in every feasible aspect. They learned from XCOM1, cut all the fat and put even more meat where it was sorely needed. 2K & Firaxis took a game that is already awesome and brought it to a new level of brilliance. This game is worth every cent of its purchase price, and then some. Once all the bugs and oversights are dealt with, you will be in for the best combination of turn-based/management/tactical experience to date.","February 11","true","116.8"," 46 of 83 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","46","83","0","0"

After installation i could play for 3 min before game froze and i was forced to restart my training mission. That is your first mission to do (That is also forced on you). So game out of box is not functional. But after deleting one file (Documents\My Games\XCOM2\XComGame\SaveData profile.bin). The game works fine. And i could go on and explore Xcom2.\n\nThe game looks nice, and it feels nice in the eyes. With all the shadows and light laying down correctly on the characters and ships and consoles when you look around in your HQ that can fly !  And it have big potencial for mods with accessories and stuff.\nBut what i feel the game lacks big time and is a game breaker is the % to hit stuff. I was playing the game and having a blast when i got the game to run. But i fast feelt that some thing was odd and strange about the game. It took for ever to do some thing in game. And when i have done some thing. I way often missed all the shoots my characters was taking. If i had like 50% or more to hit, i oftenly shoot around the enemy. But if i had under 50% to hit. I more oftenly did hit !. And it did not mater if the target had cover or was running or if it was a long distance. It hits !\n\nSo i started to get iritated by it. And after lite more game time i was raging. I know and i do feel that Xcom is a game that should be hard and unforginving if you do a wrong move. But even tho i do it correctly as much that i could. But i keept on loosing and loosing and loosing. Even tho the mission it self says Easy. No way ! No way ever ! In my eyes the game is rigged and incorrectly built. And all i can say is that Xcom2 have allot of problems that Xcom:Enemy Unknown had. So in my eyes Dev's have not put in enugh effort to fix old problems to the new game that they know was there.\n\nI do not recomend this game in it current state (2016-02-14). I am gona shelf this game and hope for a big update to fix this un-balanced rolls and hit %. Before i even think of opening the game again. If you have purchased the game or if your thinking of buying the game. Refund your money if you can.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ank501/recommended/268500/","Ank501","Ank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ank501/","1595 products in account","XCOM 2 is a turn-based strategy developed by Firaxis and published by 2K Games. It is a direct sequel to the previous XCOM: Enemy Unknown and the expansion XCOM: Enemy Within.\n\nIn XCOM 2, follows the story where the XCOM lose the war to the alien. The aliens rule Earth, building shining cities that promise a brilliant future for humanity on the surface, while concealing a sinister agenda and eliminating all who dissent from their new order. So they said it, we are now on the offensive on XCOM 2. With only limited resources, XCOM must retake back Earth from the ADVENT.\n\nXCOM 2 gameplay are quite similiar with XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but plays differently. In fact, you feel like you already knew how it plays out until you see the timer. Yes, each mission has a time limit to reach certain objectives. But most people describe it wrong as a turn timer or whatever it is they said. The truth is, it's a turn limit to reach certain objectives such as hacking a device, rescuing VIP or destroying key objectives. Most of them if completed, then the timer is gone and you can have all the time you want to kill the enemy. NOT all missions has this turn limit objectives however. Overwatch in XCOM 2 is even more powerful I think, even if some people didn't like the turn limit, overwatch now doesn't trigger all at once, they trigger one by one that you can be sure every overwatch is count. Base building retains the same element but building adjacent bonuses are gone, instead you get to upgrades with resources. The global map have been changed too. Since you have a mobile headquarters, in the global map, you need to move from place to place to scan for resources, intel or even contacting resistance on other location.\n\nThere is this thing called Avatar Project or simply AP by the community, I think, it renders your campaign has time limit which you have to act fast to delay or setback the project progress. You can do this by assaulting alien bases or hacking then kill the alien codex. There's also Dark Event, which some kind of random even that if left unchecked will, I say again WILL give you disadvantage and give the alien an advantage. Like XCOM: Enemy Unknown abduction mission, not all Dark Event mission can't be completed, you have to choose which you think is the best... or the worse. All of this makes your campaign has faster pace then the previous.\n\nTactical combat also has become more difficult, at least for me. I can see more challenge here. Remember Sectoid? They're not what you remember now, they posses more power and can mess you up if you don't kill them real quick. What about Thin Man? Now you will see the true form of the alien infiltration unit. Soldiers now also has even more useful abilities, some are in fact powerful if you know how to use them. Soldiers can even be upgraded further to gain more advantage, whether it's a weapon or the soldier themselves. Turn limit may be frustrating, but in my opinion they're not as frustrating as some people said.\n\nCustomization in XCOM 2 are great, I will say huge if they actually add more content or option into it, nevertheless we have modding support. There is a dedicated place where you can create you characters before you even play the campaign. Characters you created can be set to appear as XCOM soldiers, or VIP which is scientist or engineer, or even Dark VIP which will appear on some mission and you must capture them. With mods, customization will be unlimited.\n\nFiraxis did improve the graphics and effects on XCOM 2. They look prettier than XCOM: Enemy Unknown. The downside XCOM 2 has is the performance. It is unoptimized that I can barely have FPS above 35. Most of the time I get stutters and lags. Mission loading time is quite long. They need to fix this.\n\nOverall, XCOM 2 is a great sequel. Some people don't like the turn limit, but for me, knowing that we are on the offensive with guerilla style warfare, that's just about fair and challenging. With mods support is even better. If only the performance were better on release, I would give XCOM 2 way better score. I recommend XCOM 2.\n\nRating 7/10","February 8","true","143.6"," 47 of 85 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","47","85","4","1"

(Other than the procedurally generated maps; the feature I was most excited about before the game launched.  The maps feel handcrafted and still provide near endless variation.)\n\nXCOM 2 is a genuine sequel, not a polished re-skin with a few new buttons.  This game is a sequel in terms of story, your opponents, and even the difficulty level.  (For that reason, if you haven't played XCOM: EU, I recommend you begin there.)  Despite my experience with the previous game, XCOM 2 destroyed me on my first attempt, at the difficulty level I played most on EU.  I'm thrilled about that because fans like myself can experience the challenge, the rush, the highs and lows of the war, and those moments when everything's so intense that your heart pounds but you keep on playing!\n\nThe story and the characters in the campaign have been improved immensely.  The tutorial introduces you to them, and the setting, through a series of story missions that'll make you feel connected to them in a way you never did in XCOM: EU.  As the story goes on, the connection you feel to each character continues to develop, and the story might stay with you for a long time.  In addition, the ending is much more thrilling and rewarding than the end of XCOM: EU--however, this game makes that somewhat disappointing ending into a spectacular one, and then goes on to give you an even better ending in XCOM 2!\n\nThe strategy layer of the game has been significantly enhanced in XCOM 2 as well.  In the past you could do research and construction however you wanted, but that isn't the case in XCOM 2.  No more watching the hologlobe spin while you pass time at the base either--now the Geoscape is like a board game.  Your decisions on the strategic layer have a major impact on the way the game plays out, and the aliens are also playing their own game against you.  You'll need to adjust your strategy on the fly to counter the aliens' projects and prevent their victory.\n\nAdditionally, the tactical gameplay is better than ever--and that's where XCOM has always been strongest.  Many games try to copy the tactical combat of XCOM, and you might hear games described as "like XCOM."  I assure you that having two actions per soldier per turn, and a cover mechanic, DOES NOT qualify a game to be declared "like XCOM."  The number of enemies and their combat abilities, combined with psychological effects your soldiers can suffer, really sets this game apart from imitators.  In XCOM 2, you're fighting to liberate the world from an occupying collective of aliens that has superior technology, and many missions will feel impossible--even with fully trained troops, using the best gear.\n\nLast but not least, the audio in this game is phenomenal!  The cinematic scenes and sound effects are as good as a blockbuster action movie.  The voice acting is impressive, and the dialogue feels natural.  The music enhances every moment of the game; from ramping up the tension in the most threatening combat situations, to relaxing you after a hard-fought battle.\n\nNegatives:\n\n1.  XCOM 2 has some bugs and performance issues at launch, but keeping regular saves and back-up saves will prevent some frustrating issues.  I had one crash during my first 65 hours of play, and the save file got corrupted.  I do not recommend playing in Ironman mode until the game is patched.\n\n2.  Some people don't like the pressure of turn timers on some missions.  I love the timers because the tension is part of what makes XCOM 2 special, but not everyone wants to play a game that requires skill.  Don't worry, however, as there's already a mod to take away the timer if you just can't play the game as it was intended to be played.\n\n3.  It will probably be several years before XCOM 3 comes out.","February 11","true","364.8"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","16","26","0","1"

And if you are a fan of turn based stratagy games then this is a must-have purchase. That being said however, It does have it's drawbacks.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Far, far deeper customisation for your soldiers, now being able to choose things such as face paint, camouflage and individual options for the torso, legs and arms of their armour.\n\n2. Randomly generated levels meaning that you won't play the exact same level multiple times like in EU.\n\n3. Consealment. Now when you start most missions you are in consealment meaning the enemies don't know that you're there, Allowing you to move without being attacked and set up abushes.\n\n4. Strong class system requireing you to think tactically about who you bring on each mission and what equptment to give them.\n\n5. Much improved Visuals.\n\n6. Mod support.\n\n7. More varied enemys with unique abilities to each other.\n\n8. More methods of going about the task than just shooting. You can now use a specialist to hack robotic units, or use a ranger to deal massive amount of damage with their sword.\n\n9. More mission types. The missions are no longer just kill everything or escort someone across a map. There are new objectives such as destorying a communications relay. Breaking VIPs out of prison or having to carry an unconcious VIP across the map to the extraction zone.\n\n10. Almost fully destructable environments. Is there an enemy flanking one of your soldiers while on a rooftop, and there is no way that you can shoot it to death in that turn? Get a grenade and blow up the floor beneith it! making it take the grenade damage, fall damage, and if you're lucky, fire damage from the building begining to burn down.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Clipping issues. Soldiers will often fire through solid walls, break windows that have already been broken, or standing on absolutly nothing in order to shoot an enemy while positioned on a ledge.\n\n2. Performance issues. For some unexplained reason this game is far more demanding than it deserves to be, or that the reccommended settings say it is. Unless you turn off MSAA then it WILL lag. Even without MSAA it will still lag, jusst not as much.\n\n3. long load times. Even on an SSD, expect load times to be 30 seconds+. While it is understandable on the way to the missions due to generating teh map, on the way back the load times are even longer. An issue that can inexplicably be fixed by pressing the 'Caps Lock' button which makes it load almost instantly.\n\n4. Mod support. While I said that it is a good thing that it has it, it has been implimented in a way that means that any mod you turn on creates a dependancy for that mod in that save. This means if you install a mod, play a mission with it an descover you don't like it then you either need to keep playing with it, revert back to a save before you had it, or with Ironman player, restart the game.\n\n5. Steep dificulty curve. While in Xcom EU the first 3 missions would be fighting sectiods, then they intoduce thin men who can spit poison, on Xcom 2 the first 2 missions are fighting nice, weak enemies, then suddenly the introduce sectiods in the 3rd which can panic and mind control your soldiers. In the 5th mission the introduce vipers that can grab your soldiers from 7 tiles away and pull them out of cover. The game gets very hard, very quickly.\n\n6. Mission timers. Most missions now have a timer for you to finish them in before you fail and are either force evacuated or captured by the aliens. The problem is that they give you usually less than 10 turns to kill about 12 aliens, finish the objective then get to a set evac zone on the other side of the map. Another problem is that most of the reasons for the counters are 'drop ships are coming to attack you' or 'the aliens have rigged this thing to explode' but when you enter the missions you're consealed so there is no reason for the countdown timer to start in that case.\n\nAlthough I listed almost as many cons as pros, the good things that the pros bring by far outweigh the badness of the cons, and none of the cons are things that can't be fixed in updates or by mods. And yes, this is a difficult game and I have rage quit it many times, but i'm not going to be pathetic and post a negative review, just because I wasn't thinking tactially enough to get myself out of those situations.","February 10","true","27.1"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

There are crash issues with animations freezing the game at times, and the framerate is choppy, but despite that, there is a mod for almost everything in this game, which makes the replayability go up by a factor of 10. Also, if one is not careful, he can get destroyed even in easy mode, something that sold the game to me, just like Divinity OS.\n\nIf you have hours to spare, like customization and management, and are a fan of turn based combat, this is a must buy.\n\nAku - Roku - Zan","May 22","true","64.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Though that is not necessarily a bad thing as the great gameplay from the previous one is still in there, the bad thing is that it feels as if many of the assets such as animations have been re-used from the previous game so it does not feel entirely fresh. And the graphics look sleek without being too good.\n\nMany of the new additions are great and since you are now on the offensive most of the time it means that many missions have timers, so you have to get your objectives done and then get out as soon as possible which creates tension and forces you to adopt new tactics compared to what you were used to previously. Though some of the missions have timers that either are too short or does not make much sense in relation to the objective. Such as the missions where you have to secure a supply stash, and even though you start the mission in stealth the enemy will still destroy the supplies if you take too long even if you were never detected.\nThe endgame also feel a bit too easy, as there are no elite versions of many of the enemies, ADVENT soldiers of all kinds seem to level up and develop as time goes on, but many of the units such as the Vipers don't. Meaning that a once feared enemy no longer is a threat at all. So the pacing feels a bit off later on.\n\nCustomization is really great, with many new ways to customize your soldiers, from a wide selection of hats and armours, even weapons and character personality animations can be changed to make your own squad more unique. Many of the classes also have been a bit more streamlined as well, and many skills feel a bit more useful and distinct. The specialist for example can now go down the skill path to become a medic or combat hacker. Both are useful so it is up to you how you mix and match character skills and builds.\n\nAll in all I enjoyed XCOM 2, but I feel that they could have done more, it feels like a large expansion rather than a full new game. But if you liked XCOM: Enemy unknown, then you will probably enjoy this one, just be prepared that they are fairly similar while at the same time have enough differences. If nothing else there is always a steam sale later on.\n\nOne thing is the same still though, RNG is still a ♥♥♥♥♥.","May 25","true","47.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

That's a drastic improvement in content over the first XCOM, which could be completed in 20 hours on one playthrough.\n\nGameplay mechanics have been improved quite drastically to keep things fresh each time you play a mission, and difficulty rises as you progress but does not feel insurmountable once you know what you are doing.\n\nCustomizations for your soldiers really let's you get attached to your soldiers, and I even found myself scolding my ranger often for failing his Bladestorm attacks but never wanting him to be in harms way.\n\nThe Linux port is very well made, with one caveat. Performance is not as good as I would have hoped, but I do trust that performance improvements will come in the near future. It is playable, but not as enjoyable in that aspect as it could be on a GTX680 at 1080p.\n\nThe only last real caveat I feel the game suffers from is timer-based missions (gameplay mechanic). Some of them force you to abandon tactics, and sacrifice soldier's lives for the sake of completing the mission in-time. This is a turn-based game, but it feels like I'm being forced to play it like an RTS which is off-putting for those missions. Thankfully most main missions don't have these turn timers or have well-balanced timers.\n\nOverall, a worthy successor to XCOM EU & EW. Highly recommended for those that love strategy games, but even more so for those who do not define their libraries by genre but rather by engaging and well-made games!\n\n","February 13","true","56.5"," 29 of 51 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","29","51","0","1"

Being a great fan of the relaunched Xcom the second installment was an autobuy. And I am very confident they will eventually patch it to where it should be, but...\n\nEven on easiest setting some of the missions are extremely hard - mainly due to the RNG gameplay mechanics built into the core mechanics: I've had to reload for literally 2 evenings to finish one of the missions because of flaws in my team that I simply could not have prevented as a player. And that comes from a ironman player of Xcom 1. I have no qualms with being punished for stupid gameplay - in Xcom2 I am constantly reloading simply because stuff happens that I have absolutely no control over.\n\nThe alien opponents seemingly use their maximum movement range and still melee attack - or they have insane range. And why Aliens get an out of turn movement phase when they are surprised by my team beats me. Result as so often is that they can essentially flank the hell out of me without my team even being able to reposition.\n\nThe timers are extremely tight and often enough I had to restart missions all the way from the beginning simply because I had that one turn missing to finish the extraction. I even had to leave folks behind due to the constantly reapearing aliens - without my guys having a fair chance to fight their way out. No one left behind? Not in Xcom2.\n\nAnd don't get me even started on the hit/cover percentages... Let's say it this way: they really need some love.\n\nStory and core combat of the game are great and absolutely addicting. It's just not really polished for the player yet. But I am sure it will happen over time and then my hesitant "NO" will become an overwhelming "YES"... until then: you either have to be a lucky star OR masochistic.

I'm not going to ♥♥♥♥♥ about the difficulty which is really inconsistent in my opinion, but I will comment on it.\n\nI don't play a game like this with the idea of winning through failure. I like reloading and trying new strategies out. Sometimes reloading resets the RNG, sometimes it stays exactly the way it is whether your moves are the same or not. This gets frustrating in some situations like: moving your troops to better hit the enemy, moving your troops to avoid being hit, or running to try to complete the mission.\n\nSo basically I find 95% of the time no matter what my moves are, if I miss 4 times in a row the first time I try, it will happen no matter my % of hitting or where my troops are. That doesn't feel good: I've reloaded a single spot 25+ times and every option comes with 2-4 misses and minimal damage, while every retaliation 1-shots one of my units. Besides personally irritating, it seems completely scripted to me.\n\nOtherwise the building transparancy gets frustrating a lot. I don't think it "ghosts" through buildings half the time I need it to, only to not figure out how to get it to work.

Bypassing enemies will just result in you being pincered every time, when it's even possible in the first place. The aliens will actually pause their patrol path while you're close to them, and then resume it as soon as you move forward, resulting in them walking right up and seeing you - even if you waited 15 turns with them just standing there, the instant you move, they move too!\n-Grenades have to be engineered one at a time. Soldier armors and weapons do not. What?\n-Overworld pacing is horrible. Nothing can wait. If you try to finish up a task you have an hour remaining on, the game will immediately say "No, you have to do this now!" Ignore that and you inexplicably lose an entire region. I guess extracting that VIP was critical to the resistance's very survival or something, and it couldn't wait an hour, even though it takes you six hours to fly there.\n-They tried to make the game much harder, and make you have to deal with soldier losses instead of just reloading every time. Unfortunately, with the value of skilled soldiers, you're screwed if your A Team dies, so...\n-General performance issues. Long loading times.\n-Every time anything happens, the game locks your input and zooms over to it. This includes things like a soldier returning to cover, a soldier changing weapons, a soldier saying something after killing something (in which case the game waits 2-3 seconds!), a new enemy being spotted (sometimes multiple times in the same turn), a civilian dying, anything. While the total time is neglegible, it's just long enough to become annoying. It's astounding how they seem to figure out a way to get the game to wait exactly long enough for you to be annoyed.\n\nBy far my biggest complaint, though, is the difficulty. No, the game is not too hard. No, the game's not too easy. It's both. Yes, both. This game does not have a difficulty curve. I'd be tempted to say it has a difficulty sine wave, but that's not true either. A sine wave is predictable. This game has a difficulty scribble. Certain missions are ungodly hard for no reason I can adequately determine - I've had to reload and restart some missions eight times while playing on normal - and other missions are laughably easy. The easiest mission I've had so far is a BASE DEFENSE. How screwed up is that? There are almost no missions I can remember that had a difficulty that was just right. Everything is either too hard or too easy. The things that make this game difficult aren't facing tough, smart enemies who will move to flank you - it's when the game decides to throw you a mission with three groups of enemies all clustered in the same place right around the VIP you have three turns to extract.\n\nI'm having some fun with it, but this game isn't worth the price being asked. It needs serious balancing and many patches, perhaps a complete difficulty and mechanic overhaul, before it would be worth anything like the asking price.\n\nIt's astounding to me that they screwed up this badly. I had the utmost confidence in them. XCOM 1 had issues, but it was a fun game. It wasn't annoying. This game is annoying. And that's horrible - it's one thing for a game to be bad, but annoying? I'm so disappointed. :/","February 22","false","27.2"," 140 of 264 people (53%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","53","140","264","11","13"

They walk towards you constantly unless you're moving towards them. I tried a sneaky approach on one of the missions where instead of a frontal assault on a base I tried to flank around the rear closer to my objective and sneak in with a quick recall out. instead when I reached where I was at I realized that all the gaurds that I had passed were actually just walking at their "patrol" pace towards me on the map. who cares if I had waited turns for them to reverse their directions so I could sneak past? it was a forced combat situation in which 14 units (8 of which who were snakes that all instantly bound every soldier I had) were dumped into my lap completely unfairly\n\nThe rate at which missions happen and the end game timer runs up are way too simultaneous and uncontrollable. instead of you running any form of what could be considered game it's more of a see how fast your rat army can scramble as you constantly get kicked in the ribs and bombarded. the timers in missions go incredibly fast and seeing how you'll always be facing around 6 units at a time unless you make incredibly risky situations you will just BARELY ever be succeeding in them more often than not you'll have to save scum your entires missions or risk losing the game because your units have paper mache' for flesh and glass for bones (which is suprising seeing as they'll jump down two story drops of their own will rather than use the nearby ladders)\n\nIn the end this game is just you getting kicked in the teeth for however long it takes you to finish it. 3/5 could be way better if there was a lot more balances to it","February 8","false","29.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Xcom 2 aggressively changes everything that made its predecessor great.  Let me count the ways.\n\n- This game is a turn based strategy, only when it wants to be\n\nThere are enemies that can both move and attack you on your turn.  YOUR turn!  All your troops are positioned perfectly.  You inch your way forward as safely as possible.  One soldier takes one step too far.  Suddenly (still, during your turn) an alien shows up, runs towards this soldier, attacks AND poisons them.  Your soldier will be dead in 4 turns.  That's what you get for walking.  This game hates you.  It wants all your troops to die.  It will take their lives in the most unfair ways.\n\n- Geoscape is overly complex and confusing\n\nBase management in Xcom 2012 was fairly straight forward.  You needed to research stuff and build stuff and grow your staff.  This was all to gain more satellites, thus increasing your income.  Apparently Firaxis didn't like how cut and dry this was, so they completely changed the base management aspect and hid every bit of information behind a wall of obfuscation.  Let's say you want to fly your base to gather supplies.  The game tells you there are supplies waiting, and that it will take 4 day to collect them.  So you fly to the supplies and start waiting.  Within seconds, a red dot is added to the alien advancement gauge.  You are one step closer to losing the game.  In reality, this gauge isn't all that important, but its inclusion stresses out players for the first 5 - 10 hours.  Whatever, you shrug it off and keep waiting for the supplies.  Seconds later, you are presented with 3 bad "Dark Events".  These happen monthly.  You get the ability to prevent one of them.  The others will happen.  Sometimes just one of them, other times both of them.  It seems random and just adds more confusion and stress.  And just to make things even more stressful, they don't tell you what the third dark event is.  You have to pay to unlock that information.  Sometimes you won't have the money to do so.\n\nYou start off with one scientist and one engineer.  You are not really told how to get more.  You can't use your knowledge of Xcom 2012 for this, because gaining staff is completely changed in this new game.\n\n- Unlike Xcom 2012, the randomness in this game is really frustrating and it makes no sense\n\nDue to Xcom 2's punishing nature, you will often find yourself in a situation where you absolutely NEED a shot to connect.  A group of aliens appear.  You've approached the situation perfectly.  The group was discovered at the very beginning of your turn, giving you the best chance of killing all the aliens.  Your sniper has a 82% change to hit.  MISS!  Your grenadier has a 67% chance to hit. MISS!  You re-analyze your situation, realizing that you can no longer kill all the enemies that turn.  Someone is going to take damage.  If your unlucky streak continues, the alien will do a critical hit and kill your soldier instantly.  You will come to love grenades simply because they can't miss.  You can't even rely on your ranger's sword.  Standing directly next to someone and only have a 94% chance to hit them is crazy.  Sure those are good odds, but the first time the sword misses will make you second guess using it ever again.  Later in the game you will find that enemies have ridiculous dodging ability.  Flanking an alien that is only a few tiles away will frequently give you only  a 70% - 80% chance to hit.  There is absolutely no way to improve those odds.  You just have to get lucky.  This game hates you.  It wants all your troops to die.\n\n- Xcom 2 attempts to give the player heavy choices, but it fails\n\nGames are all about choice.  The right choice depends on context, the state the gameworld is in.  The player has to analyze their game state and determine what the proper choice is for their situation.  A proper decision means the player made a proper analysis.  This is satisfying.  Xcom 2 tries to make it's decision making hard by witholding vital information.  This is frustrating.  You will fail and it won't be your fault.\n\n- Ambiguity\n\nGrenadiers gain an ability that lets them fire at all enemies in a cone-of-sight.  The game just tells you that this consumes "lots" of ammo.  How much?  You just have to figure that out on your own.  When you try it in battle, you will feel ripped off.  Not only does it use up all your ammo, but it prevents you from reloading for several turns.  Not only that, but the ability can miss.  There is absolutely no reason for the game to withhold this kind of info from the player.  THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE A GAME DIFFICULT!  btw, this kind of thing happens a lot.  Here is another example.  Some armor only needs to be build once.  A single build cost gives you access to unlimited of that armor.  Other armor requires you to build individual sets.  There does not seem to be any indicator of which is which.  I eventually learned to save my game before doing anything new.  In fact, saving and loading is the only way the player can really come to understand what is going on.  If you are going to use a new ability for the first time, save the game and be prepared to reload once you have figured out what the consequences are.\n\n- BUGS!\n\nThere are so many bugs in this game.  Unlike Bethesda games, these bugs aren't funny OR innocent.  I've had several soldiers burst into flame for no reason.  I had one soldier catch fire while running over a tile that had no fire on it.  Upon reloading, the tile did have fire on it.  The game simply failed to load the fire effect on that tile.  When moving your troops, an icon will appear over the tile your mouse is on.  This icon indicates that the soldier will pass through fire/acid/poison/windows/doors if they move to this location.  This is great, except when the icon fails to show itself.  This has caused me many reloads.  There are also many times when the game failed to tell me that an enemy had entered overwatch.  A linear, single-player affair has no right being so buggy.  This game honestly feels like it's still in beta.\n\n- Conclusion\n\nXcom 2 has moments of greatness.  One of the earlier missions was one of the most intense and enjoyable experiences I've had gaming.  However, the confusion, frustration, and plethora of bugs strips it of all it's greatness.  One moment I loved the game, the next moment I hated it.  This is coming from someone who loved Xcom 2012 and indeed the original from the 90s.  It's unfortunate, because when the stars align and the bugs aren't an issue, a pretty good game wants to emerge.  In the end, I wish I had passed this game up.","February 24","false","36.8"," 35 of 63 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","35","63","2","0"

But wait, performance fixes are needed, and modders are doing a good job patching up what Firaxis has delivered, it is becoming a game. When it came out, it was mostly a storyline, non-canonical at that. Again.\n\nWhat do I like? The battles work much better, now you can actually sneak about - set up ambushes, and spy on patrols and try to predict where is the best angle of attack. Mostly the same game as XCOM1, but with has an abundance of cutscenes and animations, which is a bit of a problem for some in regards to performance. I manage.\nSnake people are back, instead of the thin man concept, they are actually snake people.\n\nScience is still stupid. Always was. If the soldiers given an alien a nickname in the field, that's basically the name that sticks, and you get the animation with the analysis when you initiate the research, not when its done. Well you get it then too - more text, no new content. Lots of loading, nada content. But it was always like that, now its just - IN YOUR FACE. Engineering works much better. There are no MEC's this time around, though. Instead they have more armor, and a hectic game pace.\nThis game is actually a bit of a challenge.\n\nBUT: There are no factions, like in XCOM1, you just have money handed over to you from more or less irrellevant sponsors. Why of why have Firaxis abandoned the concept of factions - which were brilliant in Apocalypse, when you could pillage, raid and wage war as much against human organizations, as against aliens, and they would gravitate towards XCOM or the alien "masters" (otherwise that game was extremely silly with teddy-bear graphics...)\nThis game, with its terrorist angle would not be any less of an enjoyment if you could try to make alliances with other resistance groups, could try to convince corporations to lend you aid covertly, or attack these treasonous groups outright for supplies and corvè labour. It is a blunder and missed opportunity that tells me that Firaxis is more interested in mass production than quality.\n\nThen we have damage. You can actually kill everything here. You kan kill every civillian and level all buildings without any consequences whatsoever. Of course there is 1 type of mission where you HAVE TO RESCUE 6 people. Because they are yours. But even here you can safely blow up the rest. This is stupid. In the "olden days" collateral damage, even damage to infrastructure would harm your budget and support. Now maybe, as a terrorist, bombing buildings would not have a totally negative consequence but playing ISIS is completely possible here, and doesnt affect the game at all. And is stupid.\n\nNow, I have to mention that physics is back where it used to be before Firaxis took up the thread. Now objects will not be hanging in empty space if the supporting structure is removed. Killing aliens by blowing up walls and floors, making them fall many stories, or having the roof cave in on them is actually a workable strategy, and this is a huge and welcome improvement. I could not believe why this was not the case in XCOM1.\n\nNow I must also mention the stupid mistakes they have made upon launch. Like smoke grenades actually not providing any game effects at all. Oh you might think you got some defense bonus, but that's just a puff of color you have there. Fortunately, the modders have fixed it, but you HAVE TO get one of those two mods.\nLike the sound options; you can tone everything down, but there are some ambient and triggered sounds that DONT RESPOND to your commands in the options. Like the intro music that will still blast you upon launch until the menu appears, like the sound that comes when aliens are revealed, this will always be loud, radios and other sources in game will jabber on. So if you play on a headseat, or late at night trying not to wake others from sleep, be aware of this so you dont go deaf or something.\n\nAlso, still there are no bases to be built. Now you fly around in a captured (?) UFO, which is fine for a resistance I guess, but it must get cramped and you loose any possibility of specializing your capacities. So there OUGHT TO be a feature where you build small bases, which would act as your recruitment/training facilities, the listening posts, R&D stations, etc. But there are No such Things. You fly around the world and set up radio towers. Like the analogous radio network would be beyond the capacity of aliens to infiltrate. There are no base attacks either, so this time around Firaxis saved themselves ALOT of work. There are no alien landscapes at all in this game. Very few aliens as well in fact (they are all projections or genetic reworkings, the aliens are gone).\n\nThe storyline hints at a dynamic approach with the option to turn against the resistance. This is only in words, there are no such options in the game. It is a uniliear storyline, with very little strategy, and these make up my primary problems; No strategy, no factions nor economics without any diplomacy and very little responsibility.\nTactics work fine, great and much better than last time.\n\nIf I can manage to learn, I will make the factions and the ways to deal with them myself. Cause of course without modbuddy this game would be DOA.\n","March 10","false","143.6"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","1"

If anyone new is thinking about getting it I suggest lots of research and learning on how to apply the game's available mechanics successfully. My perspective is purely from some one who's new to the series and haven't played much turn based strategy in the past.\n\nMuch of your success will be based on probability rolls. What this means is, even if your shot has an 85% chance of success, you could still very well fail. It can be infuriating, but careful planning and smart use of the tools available can very much help mitigate some of that frustration.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiLjQMk2opg\nI've mentioned that this is a difficult game, and indeed the learning curve is very high but strangely enough, understanding the core mechanics was easy and well paced. Learning how to apply them is the challenging part.\n\nOverally XCOM2 is a very satisfying game when things go according to plan, but can be infuriating when it doesn't.

Possibly the best thing that developers have introduced are procedurally generated maps. Maps are not random, instead they are a combination of huge number of ‘modules’ (sets of these modules are exclusive to locations) that are picked and shuffled in a new way every time you start a game. If that was not enough, there is a number of weather conditions that take place – rain, night, flying burning ashes, etc.\n\nClasses have been revised, now you have five of them (sword person; hacker; sniper; heavy; and psi-soldier) and sixth will be added as part of the pre-purchase DLCs later this year. I really like the new psi mechanic, you now train your psi soldiers within the base, but you can take them to mission when needed and they will jump in back to complete their current education upon return to the base. If you train the psi-soldier long enough, they become a bit too powerful.\n\nGameplay wise, the game is slightly tougher than ‘XCOM: Enemy Unknown’ and at the same time, I found it mostly more enjoyable to play.\n\nDownsides? Visual glitches and a few bugs here and there. Until they are fixed, there is no point to even try completing the game on Iron Man difficulty. Quality Assurance is not exactly the strong part of Feraxis. I hope that they will fix them soon, as they did with the first XCOM and Civ 5.","February 13","true","41.2"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

But, XCOM feels more like being in a sketchy casino rather than a strategy game; It's like betting a big stack of money on an post-apocalyptic alien invasion coin flip.\n\nThe never ending dice rolls is what takes so much away from this game. No matter what amount of skill a player has in this game, randomness is what sends you spinning out of control, epecially in missions on the harder difficulties.\n\nThere is so much work lost through random-chance character deaths and mission losses, that any enjoyment and reward are overshadowed from the amount of frustration and hours of grinding and reattemps.\n\nAnd I can attest. I completed the last game on its hardest difficulty and played this one on its "Legendary Ironman" mode just to say that I did. So, I can honestly say I gave this game a complete and comprehensive playthrough before criticizing it.\n\nIf you've read anything about this game, you'll have picked up on the flame wars in several threads between the highbrow critics and fankids. I suppose I am the former, but the issue is apparent.\n\nHowever, I am a patient completionist.\n\nAs I said, I played the previous XCOM and beat it (Reluctantly, after several attempts) on its hardest difficulty.\n\nIt wasn't fun. I did it simply to say I did it.\n\nAnd now I am playing this one on its "Legendary Ironman" and will beat it (Eventually, after several begrudged attempts). But, I gotta say it's really not fun. Needless to say, its really hard.\n\nBut, it's so hard that it's not fun.\n\nI'm just going through the motions for some achievements.\n\nPlaying it on its hardest modes only bring out the reasons why its reliance on its All-or-Nothing RNG gameplay is just not fun.\n\nI suppose this is what the game was intended to be like. That's just XCOM, as they say right? You could play it on easy mode, but why buy a new game at 60 bucks just to play it on easy mode a couple of times? Is that worth it?\n\nThe gameplay mechanics not only make the game unenjoyable and frustrating, but seems to make alot of things unbalanced as well.\n\nI purchased this game with it's AAA price tag in hopeful expectation that I'd see some refreshing new core gameplay and a better level of enjoyment, but I rolled the 2K's RNG dice and it let me down once again as it has so many times before. Sigh\n\nMaybe I am the demographic that XCOM is targeting, along with the other gambling addicts and "masochists"?\n\nI cannot recomend this game with it's current $59.99 price tag and have usually told my friends who are strategy buffs to avoid it, as most wouldn't enjoy it. The majority of whom I know that have tried this or the last XCOM game have been disappointed, unfortunately.\n\nIf you really want to try this game I'd say wait for a price drop or give an older XCOM game a go. Preferably try a free demo. Like I said, you might not enjoy this game because of it's core mechanics. It tends to put off many players.\n\nIn the meantime, I hope that 2K takes heed from other turn-based tactical games like Square Enix's Front Mission series and reward skill, not gambles.","March 5","false","283.2"," 51 of 94 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","51","94","0","6"

Some turns you will do everything horribly wrong but still win due to luck, the next turn get everything right and still die to luck.\n\nI have had a high ranking soldier be killed in one shot from full health due to a crit (by a lowly ADVENT trooper) whilst in high cover with a smoke grenade on him. Why should it be possible to crit anyone in high cover? Also I have, on many occasions, set my whole squad to overwatch whilst concealed to lay the perfect ambush to have only 2 out of the 6 troops fire and the other 4 sit there watching, despite the enemy running right past them. Also I have had crazy things like an enemy move, be killed by overwatch, respawn, move again, then kill one of my soldiers all in one turn. Not to mention a few times Chryssalid's have spawned from beyond the fog of war, moved, and attacked (sometimes 3 of them at once) in one turn before I have even revealed them or had any chance to defend myself.\n\nI'm not sure if any of the above is intended but it sure as hell makes any kind of tactical planning near impossible.\n\nAlso it runs horribly. The FPS is way lower than games which look much better than this, the camera constantly bugs out, the load times are ridiculous even on an SSD and it constantly hitches and stutters for no apparent reason.\n\nThere are some positives to this game, such as the character customisation however it is hard to enjoy this because for some reason the game lags like hell during the character customisation screen, dropping to 15fps whilst using only 30% of my GPU and CPU.\n\nI was a massive fan of XCOM:EU and EW (with 137 hours in them). So it is with a heavy heart I have to say I cannot recommend this game. The RNG frustrations were definitely present in EU and EW however with this game they seem to be off the charts. It is for that reason and the performance issues that I cannot recommend this game in its current state.\n\nAs a side note I have no idea where all these 9+/10 reviews from the professional critics are coming from, were they playing a different version of the game to us?

However, XCOM2, despite having fantastic new game mechanics, is rendered virtually unplayable due to ridiculous framerate issues and mission load times. The recent patch did not improve the situation whatsoever. Simple gameplay is made frustrating and this ongoing issue has totally taken the joy out of the game. Even throwing a generade is hazardous due to the lagging interface, and so ironman styled games are almost out of the question. Simple navigation around the avenger is frustrating also. Mission load times are more often than not, extremely long. I can go make a cup of coffee whilst waiting for missions to load from the skyranger, reminding me of the days I would load my hotmail inbox using a 56k modem.\n\nI love this game, and I want to sink endless hours into it.

Please keep in mind that these are based on my own experience with this game. Some people have little to no issues with this game. That is why the reviews are not all negative nor are they all positive. Anyhow, back to the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- it has the potential to be a great game, if playable (some recurring new mechanics that i did enjoy: timed missions,\nblacksites and class mechanics (all classes are good and none of the builds are inherently weaker than the other builds.\nIt really depends on the mission, to determine which build is more efficient. Also, don't be afraid to experiment with\nyour builds. You have the option to retrain your soldiers at some point in the game.)\n- most issues people have with this game are fixable\n- a great and friendly community (a lot of people, who have small performance issues, can find help in the steamforums\nof XCom 2)\n\nCons:\n- crashes and freezes that leads to crashes (black, grey, red, blue screens, i have experienced them all atleast once in the\nlast 4 days)\n- poor optimization (low to mediocre fps even on high end rigs)\n- a lot of bugs and/or glitches ranging from aliens detecting/shooting you through walls to allies sinking in the floor\n- poor technical support on the side of the developers (a friend of mine was advised to use the same strategy as with\nXCom EU/EW. That is to play untill you crash/freeze with XCom EU/EW, then start up XCom 2 and play untill you reset\nyour pc. Repeat this process, if you want to play XCom 2 without black screen (or whatever colour you're\nexperiencing))\n- no patch announcements, so you can forget about short term improvements and/or resolutions.\n\nConclusion (Well, i did promise to keep it short, so here are my final thoughts regarding XCom 2):\nI loved XCom EU/EW and XCom LW, but sadly i am unable to enjoy and play XCom 2 due to technical difficulties. So even if i wanted to, i just can't recommend this game to anyone, untill the game is properly patched. Which is a shame, because the game has a lot of potential. I just have to wait a few weeks (or more likely months) for the game to be patched, so i can enjoy the game thoroughly and on my own terms, instead of making compromises due to poor optimization and or technical issues.\n\nI sincerely hope, that i have dissuaded atleast some of you from buying this game in its current state, because i really want you gents and/or ladies out there, to have a great and memorable (first) experience with this fantastic franchise.\n\nCheers!\n\nSnuPi","February 9","false","20.7"," 27 of 48 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","27","48","0","0"

Wait for a couple of patches is my recommendation\nRasons:\n- Really bad performance, even on top end systems, like mine. The game recommends me to use highest settings with my system but I actually have to run in medium settings as not to get stuttering or massive frame rate drops. It is a shame considering how good the game looks in max settings :(\n\n- Turns are stalling in between player/alien turn switches.\n\n- This is a big negative one one for me: Timed missions are poorly implemented. The timers are way too short.  Missions often end after just 8 turns. It is just enough time to force you to rush to a mission end but you can't enjoy the map or possible side actions.  On top of that those timed missions are way too numerous. It makes it impossible to enjoy a stretched out tactical game for those players who like it slower paced and are not overly aggresive.\n\n- Melee is far too overpowered. All you need is a squad of sword swinging maniacs and you cut through the aliens like butter. No more tactical weapon usage required.\n\n- Camera angles are awkward at times\n\n- Grenades are bugged in some instances when you explode walls\n\n- character stances are bugged in somes instances and facing the wrong way while shooting\n\nPlus a dozen other smaller bugs that by themself can be overlooked but with those piling up fast are starting to annoy a lot.\n\nIt very much looks like this game did not get a proper quality control testing before release. *sigh*","February 5","false","23.4"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

I get about 15 FPS on average with occasional drops to <5, for example in cutscenes (GTX 680, game installed on an SSD). The game also often freezes for several seconds, for example when you stumble upon enemy pods. All of this leads to the game feeling really sluggish and often unresponsive.\n\nApart from the frequent camera glitches which we know and love from the first part, I've encountered a ton of new and sometimes game-breaking bugs (e.g. assaults warping through walls when doing their slash-attack, soldiers getting stuck, issues with the new concealment system) which make me seriously question Firaxis's quality control.\n\nIf you intend to play this game, do not repeat my mistake of playing in Ironman mode.

I've been able to chug through about good number of hours with the horrible framerate drops.  I'm at a point where in a mission my FPS is running at around 10-15 fps at minimum settings... that's right, at minimum.  It's constant - not even a drop in fps.  I honestly can't believe it and I'm very disappointed.  I loved EU/EW and sunk a lot of hours in those games (just look at my profile).

In XCOM: Enemy unknown both sides try to get the upper hand, the aliens through number and brute strength while the player can achieve the goals through destruction of terrain and positioning to flank, while in XCOM 2 if you don’t kill everything that you see in the turn that your unfortunate eyes sees them, which you won’t with the few hundred of them, which is understandable with the story, but with massive amount of health and damage that your B-B guns will merely tickle the Muton that will evaporate on your cavalry impersonator by looking at it funny. In addition, even XCOM: UFO defence which is known for being difficult is just difficult, not punishing. The aliens have a larger range and are usually hidden, so you have to be careful as you move, unlike in XCOM 2 where the Cortex will disable all of your weapons, teleport behind you and kill the only useful team member you have all in the same turn which will cause the animalistic “super soldiers” to go into a panic, run out of cover and then get immediately shot by whatever waits for them.\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown glitches are fun. You grapple onto a ledge and you get teleported under where you started, or by doing a Chryssalid dance with the dumb AI, while in XCOM 2: If you log out of the game while something is building, which you probably will as doing more than one mission at a time is about as desirable as grinding teeth against a cats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the building suddenly doesn’t exist, all the days that you waited for it have gone to waste, and the materials you invested into it are now gone. I mean, it’s not like you really need those Psi operatives to make the game playable.\nWe’ve come this far without talking about the timer. XCOM 2 has introduced a timer for practically every mission, which isn’t fun, it’s just artificial difficulty that will make you panic. If you don’t do the mission in the time limit, the world becomes that much worse, everyone blames you while you were standing on a roof trying to not get absolutely everyone killed with the mass amount of aliens the game throws at you. Take Jet Set Radio into account: Would be an amazing game but gave everything a time limit, but there it made sense as it’s supposed to be a fast paced hip hop game.\nIf you wanted to buy XCOM 2, my advice is: Don’t. I’m going to play some more XCOM: Enemy unknown.\n","February 13","false","60.0"," 56 of 104 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","56","104","2","1"

Enemy variety is plentiful and is for the most part really well balanced. The game is a decent looking game too. Sadly, the enemy variety sort of goes out the window late game and the longer you play, the worse performance gets due to a nasty memory leak. The Avenger base isn't anything special. It's just slightly better than it was in EU and not really worth mentioning. Oh, and the sound design, both with the in game voices and sound effects to the phenominal score is nothing short of amazing. I absolutely LOVE this game. XCOM has always been a series that I've LOVED since I was a child. And because of the love that I have for the series, I HATE writing a negative review on this game. You see, aside from the core aspect being amazing, that's really the only positive thing I can say about this game. It's quite clear that this game seriously lacks polish. There's even evidence that the developers actually panic patched the game at the last minute to make it harder. And there lies the problem with XCOM 2. The XCOM games have never been hard, challenging yes, but never hard. This game however is hard for all the wrong reasons. From spawning 2 Archons and 2 Advent elite troopers at the LZ of a timed mission (and then landing another 3 troopers ON the LZ making it 7 foes to face) to having your troopers caught during the "concealment" phase without so much as a warning to let the players know that said troopers can actually see behind the 2 buildings you're at. The game honestly feels completely botched. I NEVER felt screwed over when I played the older XCOM games or Enemy Unknown/ WIthin. I've always played on the harder difficulties to make it more challenging. The AI has ALWAYS cheated in the older games (it's a fact), but NEVER as blatantly as they do in this game. This game has absolutely no sense of balance nor fairness. And the game completely contradicts itself too. It wants you to sneak around and set up well planned out ambushes. Well, that takes a lot of time to pull off and 90% of the time you're expected to use these ambush tactics, there's a timer where you have 8 turns to hack into an item across the map or you lose meaning that instead of doing what the game was designed to do (at least in the early stages of the level), you have to dash towards the objective. It makes no logical sense. Not to mention that flanking offers the player no reward aside from higher chances to land a critical hit on an enemy and the high grounds offer no real advantages either (though you still do get a bonus for being up above). A lot of the times the player is actually punished for making tactically sound maneuvers. The aim penalties in this game are beyond insane too! It's tooth shatteringly logic defying when a giant metal floating ball is floating 1 square away and I have a plasma rifle aimed at it with only 50% chance to hit on my colonel ranked support character. I understand that since it's floating, it gets a "flying buff", but when it's no less than ONE SQUARE AWAY, should't I be at 100% to land a hit since it would literally be impossible to miss that shot? I have MUCH more to say about this game, but I fear that, that would require me to write at least 4 pages worth of complaints. And that's not even me talking about the TERRIBLE optimization and performance issues (I have a 980, i5 4670k OC'd, and 16gb of RAM) that this game has nor the countless bugs. Fun fact, the reason that I ran into a terrible (even game breaking) bug that wouldn't allow me to make any actions, but if by God's good grace I managed to pull off an action, the game would just freeze up. And no, not crash, the game would literally just halt at the zoomed in character that is about to make a shot. Background noise and music still playing and soldiers and aliens still doing their idle animations. It was nearly impossible for me to finish the mission I was currently on. I did fix it though. It really saddens me that a PC only release is plagued with such mediocre and amateur mistakes. Especially from a dev team like Firaxis. As the game stands now, I cannot see how ANYONE could give this game 9's and 10's across the board. This game is a 6/10. It's such a shame, because I want to love this game (more than I already do). It sucks to say and even think this, but I can't wait for the patches and modders to fix this game. Once it's fixed, I know that this game could easily be a 9 or a 10.","February 5","false","64.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Even though in any graphical configuration but for minimal the game was full of lag - a problem I hadn´t have with any game in my current pc before, I didn´t mind as the gameplay was fantastic. The innovations and changes refreshed the serie and everything feels different from the previous XCOM even though a lot of concepts are unchanged. In some reviews people complained about the turns limits, but in all the missions that I played that had those, I didn´t need to rush too much and managed to complete the objectives just in time with few turns remaining in a way that it seemed that the number of turns was well balanced - neither making the mission too rushed nor letting you move slowly abusing overwatchs. However, soon the crashes started. Firstly, I tried hard to make excuses such as that the problem was with my computer or that it was just something occasional so I could just let it pass and keep playing. But they persisted and striked everywhere: in the middle of a mission, in a loading screen, in the geoscape, etc. And they have the peculiarity of even if I reloaded a save happening again if I tried to do the same thing that resulted in the first crash, which worsened substantially the problem. In the end I couldn´t evade from the obvious and unfortunate conclusion that the game was UNPLAYABLE - at least in my PC, but I didn´t have such problems with any other game before. Certainly this will be fixed in the first patches for the game but it is rather frustrating to have bought this game in presale and to have waited so anxiously for its launch to receive a product unplayable and to have to wait more for the patches to be able to properly play it. Anyway, it may be that the problems I am having do not extend to all players, but if you are thinking on buying XCOM 2, the safest route would be to wait for the game to be fixed. A part from those problems, the game is great and I will totally recommend it once it hopefully becomes completelly functional and playable.","February 6","false","12.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm disappointed in the development team. I can't imagine that there isn't at least a few of the developers, whether writers artists or programmers who didn't think "Man, there's going to be a lot of really angry players."\n\nThis game is a reskin. That's it. That's the entire review. Everything else is just exposition and nuance.\n\nSatellites are now Listening Posts. The Council timer is now the ADVENT timer. You excavate a starship like you excavate a bunker (amazingly straight down only. No, you can't excavate starting from the bottom or sides ignore the areas of the ship around this smaller-base-than-XCOM-1 you must excavate down). The Terror Missions are now named Retaliation Missions. The Classes are still split into Heavy, Sniper, Support and Assault but there's been some rebalancing to remove certain abilities players were abusing and name-changes to protect the innocent.\n\nCombat is the same. The AI is different, but also in a strange way, the same. Did you play Long War? Did you listen to Long War talk about what was wrong with XCOM1? Congratulations. You've already played XCOM2's combat.\n\nIt looks the same, it plays the same beyond minor tweaks (if the enemy getting free moves bothered you then you'll be happy to note: its now an essential gameplay mechanic). This is the same engine. Same content. Same everything. Its ctrl+c; ctrl+v. Its lazy... and amazingly it doesn't have things that we find in the first XCOM like Second Wave mechanics. The cynic in me says that Second Wave will be released under a new name as DLC. Again.\n\nIt feels like an expansion pack. No, it doesn't. Scratch that. It feels like the Blue Shift or Opposing Force campaigns. Allow me explanation on that one in case you're not familiar with the examples. In Half-Life1 you had some alternate campaigns that were released as expansions. Same game, same engine, obvious recycles the whole nine yards. You just played the same story from a different perspective. The same happened in a lot of older video games. You got two campaigns. Usually an Allieds and Axis, or Rebellion and Empire. That sorta thing. This feels like a Blue Shift campaign being marketed as a sequel in hopes that the playerbase is too stupid to notice. That's what you get here. Not a game in its own right, because you've already played it and this game is so identical that you could probably mod in XCOM2 back into XCOM1 without a whole lot of work.\n\nAnd you know what pisses me off? What really angers me the most about this? This isn't like the trailer. This game doesn't even reflect the main menu (for those of you who haven't seen it, its one of your soldiers in the suburbs about to ambush alien police officers). You don't build up multiple fronts of cells. You don't fight and take cities. There's no thought or complexity in this beyond "hack the thing and shoot everything in the face". There's no campaign beyond flimsy goalposts of "research this" or "stun a Sectoid Commander for interrogation" (in XCOM2 its stabbing ADVENT Commanders in the face with a probe to interrogate their faces directly) but that's one of the requirements.\n\nObviously there's a lot of money in the XCOM franchise. XCOM1 sold well. The DLC sold well. The Enemy Within expansion sold well. There's a lot of people like myself who bought the second game with little more than a trailer and some hope. The press releases for XCOM2 were... quiet, but what was released promised something more than just a reskin and taking notes out of a modding community's playbook.\n\nIf I had to sum it up: XCOM2 was a ♥♥♥♥ move, Firaxis.

No more mixing and matching to create different synergies.\nMissions have been dumbed down with their stupid timers forcing one type of playstyle and removing any option to use tactics other than run and gun.\n\nThe new mechanics of this game should encourage us to explore various ways to overcome and solve them and allows us to develop multiple playstyles. Instead we are railroaded into only one aggressive playstyle which means we have to rely on RNG to go our way too often.\n\nA huge step down compared to Enemy Within.

The one thing that was fixed was how overwatch targets are handled - units do not waste their overwatch shots on downed enemies anymore if they have a different target on that same turn.\n\nOf course, wierd pauses pretty much everywhere are still here; poor intel (actually, criminally poor intel, lore-wise) is still here; atmospheric immersion is worse, ironically because there is more of it - more points of failure have emerged.\n\nXCOM you could play while drinking a beer and watching what was on your screen like a nineties action flick - brave americans kicked some alien ♥♥♥ and looked cool doing it.\nThis game doesn't play like this. It doesn't even play like a 'rebel tactics'.\n\nSo all in all, while being graphically an upgrade over XCOM, logically and atmospherically it may well be quite the opposite.\n\n\nDisappointment reigns.","February 14","false","166.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There are performance issues, bugs and just unexpected lazy efforts in some areas by the devs. My computer is high end, I get mega load times and huge lag spikes some graphical errors here and there with animations. They say it's not universal and they are aware that some high end systems have issues. That's basic laziness because things like that would easily be found out with any, ANY competant testing. Who did the math calculations? They should be fired and never allowed to work anywhere near a computer or anything electronic again. Oh you can miss 98% shots 10+ times on a playthrough but good luck ever making a 30% hack. 30% = 3 out of 10 in most parts of the world if not all. Try a 30% hack 500 times and let me know if you ever succeed. These aren't game breaking but seriously annoying. Gee let me try that 50% hack, nope denied, everyone is discovered, enjoy, be sure to try next time. Seriously? There is very little strategy in this one too, kill, kill, kill, kill. What you build and in what order matters very little in this one, just do every missions, destroy the avatar buildings as fast as possible, unless you like reloading saves never try to hack anything and never bet your mission on a single shot unless it's 100%. It feels more like a step back from the Xcom Enemy Unknown not an improvement. This one EVERY rookie can be a psi operative lol, and no jets vs. saucers, if I didn't know better I'd think this game came first and Enemy Unknown was the more advanced newer game. Just my opinions, play it and judge for yourself. If you never played the earlier versions you'll probably love it, if it runs well on your computer.","February 11","false","136.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/268500/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","XCOM is a tough kind of game to sell, because when it's good it's bad and when it's bad it's bad. The best time you can have in XCOM is when you're scraping on the skin of your teeth with one soldier dead and another one bleeding out and a sectoid waving his finger ominously in the distance, and so it's hard to sell to someone who just wants an easy time. Thankfully this is the sequel, so presumably everyone here is a masochist who enjoys feeling like they've lost even when they've won.\n\nThe first thing that surprised me in XCOM 2 is how much they've expanded the unit customization. Unlike in the previous game, which was somewhat dull in soldier clothes and left me just giving everyone the classic Guile hair, 2 features a pretty wide variety of glasses, hats, hair, beards, and other ways to form a personal relationship with your soldiers before they're eviscerated before your eyes because of your own orders, blood which will never wash from your hands. You can even choose from different arms, legs, and torsos for each type of armor, though the later armors usually have less variety than the early one.\n\nThe game also has a stronger emphasis on story, with more cutscenes and development to the characters. I thought it was a welcome addition, though it does leave things slightly less resolved at the end than I would've liked. Most of the enemies are reworked versions of the old ones, but there are a few new ones here and there, and they all perform a bit differently enough to give veterans a surprise every now and then. There are still the usual customization options for your soldiers' abilities, but the more interesting ones from Enemy Within like genetic modification and augmentation are missing, leaving the game feeling like there's something more interesting hiding in that expansion pass. Other things like UFO landings also return, but they don't seem to have any real significance like they did in EU aside from just being minor resource grabs. My only actual problem with the gameplay is that in some ways it feels like more of the same in a bad way - they introduce a Concealment feature where your soldiers start some missions hidden and can ambush the enemies, reversing the typical xcom formula where you're the one being ambushed and fitting in with the game's guerilla warfare theme, but after you break concealment the first time it's gone for good except for special skill-based circumstances, and after that the game just starts with the same traditional gameplay. I'm not wanting to change the game into Invisible Inc. or anything, but I think it would be interesting for some of the more low-key missions like hacking a relay to be able to done with a small squad in stealth (or maybe it can - in my game whenever I tried there would be humans blocking the doors to every building, but maybe I just had bad luck). Another thing in this vein that bothered me is that almost every mission in the game requires you to kill all the aliens, rather than just do your work and get out. This is something that made sense in the old games, since you were defending earth from invaders, but in XCOM 2 they've already taken over, and killing this tiny group of aliens is completely inconsequential to their overall effort.\n\nBut while I overall enjoyed the game outside of those minor flaws, the big problem with this game is the actual build quality. On my GTX 970 and overclocked i5, I managed about 15 fps on the main menu scene, with maybe 20 to 30 in-game. This isn't necessarily a problem since it's a turn-based strategy game, but the problems got worse as the game went on. Reaction shots would sometimes cause the game to hang in front of the character shooting for several moments, enemies would stand still for upwards of 30 seconds before moving, just flying to the single-screen or loading a small map with one building might take 30 seconds or more on an SSD, etc - and that's not even going into all the times characters would go flying around the map or robots would get stuck in trees. During the final fight my game crashed 5 times, and on 2 of those crashes it corrupted my autosaves and made me start back 10 minutes or so. It even caused my computer to bluescreen at one point. The build quality is so terrible that it makes me think that the only reason the game is PC-exclusive is because they couldn't get it to even boot up on a console without it immediately melting.\n\nOverall, XCOM 2 is a game that's still good enough for me to recommend, but just know that you're going to have to take some bad in order to get the good. Maybe in the future Firaxis will patch the game, but in the mean time you might want to double-check your specs before jumping on.","February 7","true","34.1"," 49 of 91 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","49","91","5","1"

Hopefully someone will mod in a real xcom game here.\n\nInstead of tactical game play, there are tons of missions where you have to do something in a small fixed number of turns (ie, defend/destory X object in 6 turns.)  this means you just have to rush to the objective and end up losing tons of units less you save scum or don't care and just go and lose the mission.\n\nInstead of a really good AI, they got lazy and just added in teleporting monsters (teleport next to your guy, free shot, rinse repeat),  ones that have very high move rates so they can close in on you in one turn even if you setup a shop tacticaly a few screens away.\n\nDue to the forced events that control game time, the game has limited replayability (compared to say X-Com:UD or X-com:TFTD.)\n\nSave your money, buy it for a one time $5-10 expiernce when it goes on sale.","February 14","false","37.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

Many times I would have a soldier aim at one enemy, but then shoot at another one that I didn't intend because of some glitch.  The camera has an odd tendency to slowly drift on its own when you're planning a movement or aiming a grenade which results in leaving your soldier in the open or missing a toss.  Whenever an NCP in the game talks to you on the radio, you're not able to take any action, and there is ALOT of radio chatter, which is usually reminding you of mission objectives that you already know or telling you about the mission timer of which you're already well aware.  There is an option that makes it seem like you can reduce this needless dialogue, but it has no noticeable effect, making missions last much longer than they need to and adding frustration to the already broken system.  It's disappointing to have the experience ruined by game glitches, bugs, and wasted time, and until they fix these problems, I cannot recommend playing this game.

All tactical missions feel fresh and less tedious, except 'terror missions' which are way too much blood and time pressure, and overall I feel there were not enough missions without timer. Metagame made in a way of more restricting manner, it may be not so, but it feels like that, with more pressure, 'doomsday counter'  etc. Skill progression is interesting and enjoyable, feels fresh, especially for psi soldiers. Base building feels a bit dumbed down but still different when taking in account staff management part. Item building is new but feels very confusing, it may harm campaign progress for many players. With all that I confirm my first impression that developers took the right ratio for new vs familiar things. And for all the right places.

Since these freedom fighters take orders of their own anyway.\n\nWatch the bug here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lasbv6-ihrk&feature=youtu.be\n\nAnd after trying to move a ranger in close from a different angle (since the suggested path makes him open), the game suffers a critical crash.\n\nThe game definately needs a stabilize protocol at it's current state.\n\nEdit: (08/02/2016)\n\nBugs keep popping up left and right.\nGame crashes, wrong actions being taken, etc...\nLaunch grenade! ..... evac point gets marked instead... -.-\nWait... wut?\nFor 3 days, I've been sighing and staring depressed at the screen how one horrid bug after another unfolds.\nWhen you're reloading the same file 10 times in a row, hoping the bug will not trigger this time, you know you got some real quality on your hands.\n\nAlso, why do extract data missions require you to kill all aliens as well?\nPackage is secured, there's 135464645 billion more aliens around on the entire planet.\nBut killing 3 more is a must to have the objective completed (or it's marked as failed).\nSir, we got the data allready? -.-\n\nJust sitting, feeling your life drain away from all the stupidity that occurs, and sighing the day away.\nI thought games where meant to be interesting and entertaining?\nEven the people living with me are affected by the way this just brings me into a dark depression.\n\nI understand there some masochists out there, who love seeing their entire squad get bludgeoned.\nI just want to see my people make it through the day and actually advance (without stumbling into another 50 bugs).\n\nLeft with an empty feeling.\nForcefully pushing myself to advance.\nWhy am I not playing boshy or another anger-inducing game then?\nBecause X-COM did things right.\nYes... did.\nThis one... it's something... but it's not X-COM...\n\nFinal report (10/02/2016):\n\nAfter 5 days, beating the game on commander (classic) difficulty, I can finally make my final report.\n\nAnd sadly enough, it still remains a non-recommended from my point of view.\nReplayability is extremely low compared to it's predecessor.\nThe Avatar project counter ensures that you have to, sooner or later, make a move towards the end objective.\nThis excludes having time enough to explore more, train more troops, and all around have a lengthy ammount of good fun.\nThe player is constantly being rushed and pushed. The game tells you how much time you have, untill you're forced to end it, taking away the player's freedom entirely.\nThankfully, the modding community is very active. Most likely, there'll be a mod where this avatar project no longer limits your play time.\nI loved spending hours in X-COM 1, finding new recruits and exploring their potential. Literally playing for months on one playthrough, in search of assembling those particularly unique good people.\n\nWhich also brings me to another minus point: There is no second wave option, once you beat the game.\n'None are equal' and 'hidden potential' are nonexistant, 2 of the options which where my favourites.\nOnce you beat the game, you get the choice to make another playthrough, and that's it.\nOnly ironman remains, but what's the fun if you can't add in random generators of your choice?\n\nAgain, it'll be completely up to the fanbase to make mods for these.\n\nThere was also a dissappointing lack of customization options in terms of character creation.\nWhat was promised as an endless ammount of possibilities, ended up in only 6 faces to pick from.\nAlso props and such, fall pretty short if you look at them.\n\nThere's too much 'cheating' going on in the game as well.\nHave a patrol passing by, and waiting for them to leave to sneak past?\nThe moment you do so, the computer decides to send this patrol right to your hiding spot, instead of completing it's patrol route.\nDumbass enemies like the sectopod, andromedon and gatekeeper, destroy their own facilities with their patrols. Showing little to no care given to the facilities in which their own avatar project is being processed. Some patrols even refuse to move, when your team is hidden away, waiting for them to pass. Resulting in an endless loop of ending your turn, waiting for these stubborn guys to move on.\nThis ruins the stealth aspect of geurilla attacks, negating them pretty much entirely.\nOperating in shadows is only good for getting that first scout off. It pretty much ends in guns ablazing. An attempt at being groundbreaking, but failing to do it's part.\n\nIf you plan to play the game vanilla only;\nWait untill it's on sale.\nWith the game now completed, it fails to keep me in a grip like X-COM 1 did.","February 5","false","243.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

While it seems like there aren't a ton of of game-stopping bugs there's still one pretty major one: During any mission the game can crash and corrupt every single save made during the mission, including autosaves. On ironman this means game-over - you have no chance of salvaging the run. Without ironman you can go back to the latest save made on the world map - though considering that the intended/prefered way to play xcom as stated by the devs is ironman a bug like this is unacceptable. Personally I ran into this bug around 3 times even before the final mission but what takes the cake is that this bug seems to be most common during the final mission - several prominent streamers had their ironman-run killed right during the final mission due to this bug and one streamer I occasionally watch is now waiting until there are any fixes for this bug before attempting the final mission.\n\nOther noteworthy bugs include the enemy AI completely borking out which in turn has the effect that the AI's turn takes an abnormal and aggravatingly long time while actually remaining completely stationary and inactive.\n\nAnother common bug is the alien viper enemy being able to use their tongue-pull to pull your soldiers without any line of sight and through entire buildings.\n\nCombine these technical issues and game-stopping bugs and the extremely poor optimization that a lof of people already have drawn attention to and I don't see how Xcom 2 deserves to be supported/bought at full prize in its current state. If you put aside the technical issues Xcom 2 is a fairly fun and decent squad-based TBS/RNG-BS game and would be worth the full prize for fans of the genre like myself - in its current state it's a lot less clear cut.\n\nMy advice would be to hold off and wait until patches are out and while you're at you might just as well wait for a sale. Personally I won't buy any Firaxis game at launch anymore and instead hold out for patches and sales. At this point I just don't trust Firaxis to not release a game with game-stopping bugs and I don't think they should be rewarded with full-prize sales for a MO like that.\n\nedit: i feel like a lot of reviewes kind of glossed over the more major bugs, this one does a good job at addressing the issue imo: http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/xcom-2-review/1900-733/","February 15","false","54.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

Performance, performance, rigs rigs, load screens, FPS - I'm hearing this a lot, even from the more corporate review sites that give hyperbole and abstract ZOMG FANTASTIC praise. They're always sure to add in a litle sentence at the end letting you know that they, too, experienced the ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ performance of this game at launch. Oh, 2K. Oh, publishers in general. A great man once said, 'the most important thing an owner can have is integrity."\nWell, you own these IPs, various publishers of the world. Wouldn't you agree that releasing a game with bedrock stability and smoothness is what we in the professional world might call 'an integrity move'? Do we just not care about integrity anymore? Apparently not. And why should we? The consumer schmucks will pre-order and buy it at full price either way, so where's the incentive to change?\n\nListening to the XCOM: EW soundtrack as I write this. ♥♥♥♥ me, it's good.\n\nOh, I know, negative reviewers "Huff puff, I'll never pre-order again!" Yes you will. We all know you will, friend. You're a chump just like the rest, a chump just waiting for that game to sweep them away, to give them that honest wonder that transports them from the banality of their marriage, their key-clacking work life, their fluorescent lights and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ office chair, the anything, the everything that might virtually erase reality.\n\nXCOM 2 was supposed to be that, wasn't it? Wasn't it, my working joe? But it wasn't. And you know it wasn't.\n\nIt might have started with a subtle sense of wrongness from the outset, but... damn, if you couldn't put your finger on it. Performance issues be damned, a game is a game , right? You used to wait for Playstation RPGs to load for a minute straight, this is nothing.\n\nBut no, it's more than that.\n\nIt's... the ambience. The colors. The 'vibe' of the game. Wait. What's wrong with the music?\nOnce upon at time there were two armies. One was heralded by the tinny brass section, the horns and trumpets, a squeal that failed to intimidate.\n\nThe second army pounded through the world by the beat of the primal drum, and the unified hum of its warriors. It was minimalist. It was eerie and horrible, it shuddered the earth. It was BASS, BASS, BASS, and hiss, hiss, hum, hiss. Guess which was which? XCOM was the primal drum. XCOM 2, the pathetic, militarity march trumpet, the tap tap tap and the blap blap blap. Who cares. Give me the drum. Give me the drum any day.\n\nThe composers changed, you fool. And you didn't realize, until now, just how much the music makes the game, did you? Especially in a turn-based strategy game, where all is thought, and ambience and patience are everything? Where is the suspense? It's nowhere.\n\nXCOM 2 is to XCOM what a furiously masturbating man is to a man trying to concentrate and paint a fine work of art.\n\nXCOM 2 is a fireworks show. XCOM 2 is a heavy-handed belt to the mouth. XCOM was a creeping, swelling tide of terror and triumph. XCOM 2 is a Red Army commander with his gun to your head saying, "charge, comrade, or die."\n\nYou'll ♥♥♥♥ your pants either way, but, wouldn't you rather ♥♥♥♥ your pants on your own terms?","February 6","false","0.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","9","14","4","2"

Solid gameplay. Great story that carries on in the tradition of the ones before it. Wonderful details in characters and environments. Amazing sound quality. Deep customisation options. Ramped-up sense of danger and difficulty. I could sing the praises of this game for years, for all that it has done right. I love this game and have missed family events to play with it. I have left friends waiting in the rain to finish missions because they were so intense and nerve-wracking. Amazing on so many levels. Ask me, and I'll gush!\n\nWhich is why it pains me to say that I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend.\n\nMarch 17th Update: I told you folks I'd update you when I have a better idea of what's gone/going wrong. To all the "toaster" comments" and the people talking about attitude, I have to say only that you need to examine the whole of the situation. People are having problems. Nobody knows why.\n\n"Hardware roulette" is a thing with this game. Somewhere along the way, script got broken or a setting got changed without direct input, preventing some mods from updating. I forcibly removed everything (everything, people) that the game placed on my machine and reinstalled. I then had to validate files almost instantly because things weren't woring properly. Whether this is Steam or XCOM 2 is unknown, but the problems are now fixed after reinstalling the game a few times and making sure the files are validated.\n\nThere is, undeniably, something amiss. Firaxis has admitted as much, and are working hard alongside the customers and mod developers and magic code sprites to brings things up to speed and deliver the game that was promised. Kudos to all involved.\n\nHowever, it's still kind of lame (and quite infuriating) to have the ability to run at mid-to-high settings and be stuck at low-to-unplayable. This is sadly common and I cannot recommend a game that was so obviously pushed out before it was fully-prepared for launch. "Big AAA" means nothing if the delivery system or the product itself is flawed.\n\nIt's like buying a used lamp from eBay and it arrives broken at your doorstep. Who is at fault for the condition, and how do you fix the situation easily? No simple answers, but it will take time.\n\nIn its current state, I don't know that I can recommend in good conscience. Given some TLC, it can be THE game of the year. My review will stand as-is, since I will likely be back to playing it indefinitely without coming up for air. I hope I can tear it down and post an "ALL FIXED" update with a rave review, but the many problems my friends and myself (with many others) are encountering for no reason other than a rushed product (and it doesn't feel that way until you examine it, believe me; it's the most well-polished 95% of a game ever!) keep me from given this game the Thumbs-Up it desperately deserves. Maybe in a week or two.\n\nTL;DR: I love the game, but there are a few game-breaking issues, mod support is amazing but buggy at times, seems over-polished without being fully-realized. Worth buying, for hardcore fans and gamers, but may give some troubles.\n\nI don't mind "negative" comments, but let's at least keep them relevent instead of bashing preferences or systems. Hardware and OS aren't the issue, in my case, just a sloppy bit of coding that created conflicts. Anyone wanting more information about specific issues will be answered to the best of my abilities.","March 11","false","248.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","0"

It's everything you expected out of an xcom 2 game, but when it comes to me working so hard and having everything corrupted because saves no longer work, I just can't. I've reported this and hope it will soon be fixed as I am in a late game, but this pushed me over the edge along with bugs causing my people to die, such as many occurances with enemies line of sight. I don't think the team working on this project purposely let the aliens see past walls, and this accident has ruined many, many mission. As of right now with all the bugs, and corrupted files I can't give this game a good review. I'm not saying to avoid xcom because of these small, yet annoying, bugs I have encountered. If you've had your eye on the game for quite a bit then go for it, it's amazing, but I just want to put out an honest review that this game has finally crushed me with multiple save issues.

The same game, made slightly different and released with a lot less features than you might come to expect after playing the previous game. If you're unfamiliar, Firaxis seems to be making a habit of releasing the bare minimum required to catch people's interest and to then release $50 expansions that slowly bring the game in line with what you were actually expecting.\n\n\nThe game plays out much the same way, including all the graphical bugs we know and love from the previous game. There's no real graphical change, just a slight alteration in overall aesthetic. The Avenger is a simplified xcom base with an ideal layout that is obvious once you work out just what things do. Put the power on the big power things, put the workshop in the middle and then build everything. The interface is completely unchanged feeling exceptionally clunky with mouse and keyboard, especially when trying to use area of effect abilities such as grenades. You don't have any mechs of any sort this time, just soldiers which are divided in to five classes now, mostly the same as the previous game just psionic is now its own class that is easier to secure a soldier for and brings back memories of an avenger full of Psi Amps considering how strong it is.\n\n\nThere's a lot more I could say about this game. It's not a bad game, don't get me wrong... but there's no way I could recommend it to anybody. This has sealed the deal for me on this developer. Wait until they're making xcom 3 and then buy a bundle with the full game when it's on special. Spend the $90 you'll end up saving somewhere else, perhaps on a developer who's willing to give you your money's worth on release.","February 15","false","36.6"," 26 of 47 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","26","47","0","0"

If you enjoyed the first game, you will probably enjoy this.\n\nThat said, if you are looking for big improvements on the first game, you may be disapointed. Much of the variety from the original (including the expansion) is not in the game. There is a really streamlined version of troop enhancements and MEC style troops, but it is not near as diverse or satisfying as the previous expansion allowed.\n\nEverything else is repeated pretty much right from the base game in a lot of ways except ship combat was completely removed. Considering that, it is disapointing Xcom 2 didn't do a bit more, but Firaxis as a developer is pretty well known for phoning in sequels these days. I don't mind that they didn't even attempt to improve on the interceptor game, but if it is going to be removed, players should see new content added. One could argue that the mobile base is that new content, but really it is the exact same base design mechanic as before with a different UI for interacting with the global map. That is about all it does.\n\nAlso, the economy is actually pretty bad. Everything special in the game costs elerium cores, which is random drop only from enemies. In effect, you end up with tons of alloy and elerium, but nothing to do with it if you didn't save those elerium cores. It is nice that core upgrades, like switching to laser weapons (well, I think its called magnetic, but whatever) just upgrades all your guns and don't require individual construction.\n\nDifficulty wise, at least on normal/veteran, it felt a bit easier due to increased access to AoE, high damage ordinance. It really isn't that hard to get everyone sporting a rocket launcher in a reasonable amount of time and that is one of the weakest options available. A few other balance bits felt off as well, though the special weapons are satisfying to use.\n\nIt could have been more, but it is what it is. If you want a fresh Xcom fix, go for it. If you can wait, then I would highly recommend waiting for a sale. As it stands, it is hard to justify this game as being worth full price.","February 9","false","31.9"," 42 of 78 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","42","78","4","0"

Seems to be fixed as of now.\nHowever it is HUGE in terms of datavolume (~25GB) so you better plan some extra time for the download.\nThe graphics are fancy yet require quite the system to run with decent fps-rates. The storyline is interesting aswell as the tides have turned and you are kind of in the role the Aliens had before. The new classes are interesting too but sadly the melee aspect which firaxis tried to implement seems kind of weak and therefore (in most but not all cases) useless. A lot of missions have a time restraint early (I got the feeling this changed later on) and so does the genereal mission. So this is unlike XCOM: Enemy Unknown. I know a lot of people bragged about that, but I don't think it's that big of an issue. The limits in missions can hurt but also force you to take smarter and more effective decisions. While challenging, I think this would have worked better as a feature for the IronManmode. The general limit makes you feel an urge to go on and maybe also a bit of unrest or even panic which I like a lot. On the other hand this limit can be kept in check by regulary doing special missions which wasn't so hard in the end. It also feels like the difficulty went up a notch which is not a bad thing.\n\nI enjoyed it a lot but somehow liked Enemy Unknown/Within a little bit better.","February 22","true","93.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

The game is very moddable, and still lets you get achievements with mods\n\nCons\n1. The game runs like crap, even with people who have monsters of a computer. The game is very poorly optimized. Live through minimal graphics with twenty to thirty FPS to single frames per second with high graphic options\n2. The AI can sometimes be really unfair, or at other times a complete idiot, walking right into your overwatches\n3. The game has too much RNG, watch as a single ADVENT runt dodges almost every shot, and crits your soldier, gravely wounding them\n4.

Maybe an Addon will bring more fresh wind but the Story is very thin and Missions get dull really fast. Would give 5/10 with Sideway-Thumb.\n\n\n\nThe improvements over the first part are good:\n\n- Classes fit their role perfectly and different styles are encouraged (from very mobile agressive to very static lurking). Also the new character customization options are great. However there are some minor balancing problems (Melee of Ranger too weak for the amount of risk, most of the time you can just Run'n'Gun with Shotgun for more damage)\n\n- The rework of the worldmap need you to be more active and gives you the feeling of having more control over the given situation: You can decide to a certain factor, what you're doing and how you're doing it. (more about that later). Also different kinds of Ressources (Info, Ressource, Scientist and Ingenieurs) leave room for your approach to save the world.\n\n- New mechanics like Armor,Melee and weapon upgrades bring some fresh air to the battlefield. Especially armored opponents require more tactical work in fights and changes your Setup and Loadout a lot.\n\n- The new Enemies are fun to play against. Especially the Snake and ADVENT Melee need you to adapt to the situation fast\n\n- Starting in Concealment is an interesting way to let the players feel like hidden agressors and allows for better preparation of the whole sector. Works great!\n\n- The Basemanagment seems very well thought through. There's new buildings which fit perfectly to the game and the old buildings got a great rework. The building part feels less grindy and more impactful on your gameplan.\n\n\n\nWhat didn't went as good as expected for me:\n\n- The Story is dull. A modern version of "Nazi-Germany suppressing the population and experimenting with certain civilians." Haven't seen that in a while! After 2/3 of it I already had the urge to stop playing. Currently I'm in the middle of a Legendary Ironman run (Tier 2 weaponry and armor) and am not motivated anymore.\n\n- The freedom of the decisionmaking on the worldmap is mostly illusional. It's mostly contacting the sectors to the next ADVENT Base, clear Base, repeat. That's mostly it. Also you get interrupted by Advent a lot which gets annoying really fast. After the 4th or 5th time you sit there rolling your eyes and ask yourself "what's it this time?"\n\n- Repetitive missions already during the first playthrough. There's basically two types of Missions: First one is "Get to Point A (Hostage, Hack Terminal, Collect Information), then go to Point B (Extraction)". Even the special missions where you locate and collect storyobjects work that way. The second type are the missions known from XCOM 1: Rescue Civilians. Just more difficult since the aliens prioritize them more and there are less. Didn't find them interesting in the first part, here aswell. Also hidden enemies in those missions. Why?\n\nThe last point is the dealbreaker for me. Even when every other part of the game got really really well refined, the lack of different missions in XCOM2 made it boring very fast for me.","February 13","false","63.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Actually, it's somehow worse than previous XCom games. It still has a bunch of inherited bugs with camera/UI/animations(like notorious turn pauses, pointless camera angles, objects obscuring view, frozen animations). Now spiced up by clunky base building(or i just forgot if you also could not cancel some item or structure building in some situations in previous games) and all the annoying stuff taken up to 11. Like unskippable combat animations, in-between mission cutscenes, characters talking to you on mission (mother ♥♥♥♥ing Bradford...) or interrupting whatever you were doing.\n\nAnd my god it runs like a major ♥♥♥. It manages to tank my GTX970 consistently below 20 fps while running 30-40 in the best case without any Antialiasing. It stutters, it drops to single digits andl streams textures right in front of your face. All that while looking mediocre at best. And i'm not talking clown-ugly setting and characters of this game. There's nothing in the technical side of this game that would even remotely justify high hardware requirments. It has pretty small locations with humble texture resolution and amount of detail. Rendering effects they use are pretty standart(SSAO, SSR, basic deffered render + csm or psm. All of this has been done million times even with UE) and 've been done and documented many times, requiring remarkable incompetence to screw up. Texture streaming is one of their biggest problems... Although i haven't implemented it myself yet, AFAIK it is a standart part of UE and was used successfully(Dishonored 2, from the top of my head). I don't see any challenge here for a team of at least somewhat competent programmers.\n\nAnd the last, but not least - the gameplay. I do not consider myself as a genre veteran. so maybe my opinion is not that accurate. But i didn't have much fun despite being excited for the game and that kind of gameplay. 12 hours in i still have no idea, what am i doing and what are my priorities. My actions have very vague impact on overall situation. Difficulty goes uphill pretty fast, but i feel helpless. I don't get it, whole base managment part - by what criteria i should make choices on my research, production, building and contacts. Game spend a lot of time teaching me how to move soldiers, but zero time teaching any valid tactics to put in a right direction. It feels like i can do any concious decisions only after beating the game, preferably several times. Until then, my choices are pretty much blind.","February 19","false","12.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It is well designed, beautiful, atmospheric, and did everything better than its predecesors.\n\nHowever, I simply cannot recommend XCom 2 at its current state. It is simply too buggy.\n\nThe bugs ranges from minor issues like graphical glitches, performance drops, animation not properly displayed, to unfortunatly what I would call game breaking:\n\nI play on Ironman mode and I have lost two of my best soldiers to bugs. One of them got stuck to a wall and I cannot evac her at the end of the mission. Another was bleeding out but somehow I couldn't pick him up even the evac zone is one move away...\n\n[spoiler free, don't worry]\n\nNow the worst is the final mission...  there is a known bug that makes me afraid to even attempt it. As the game is designed you are allowed to restart the final mission should you fail, even in Ironman mode. However, people who restart their mission reported that all their passive abilities, ammo, and armor are gone. Given the difficulty spike of the final mission I don't even want to try it before they get this bug fixed.\n\nI'll update the review when Firaxis get the game fixed properly and it would be an amazing game.

There's just a lot of lag and random\nfreezes all over, so it doesn't seem too well optimized, performance-wise. I almost get the idea(as others have said) that Firaxis/pushlisher may have slacked on fixing the performance/bugs, since the game was created with "mods" in mind. Mods, that could fix said issues. I'm no expert, but I assume this isn't Skyrim, and should be terribly hard to optimize for such a well-established development company.\n\nI really like the game otherwise, but not gonna recommend until it's a little more stable and has a nicer overall flow.","February 5","false","8.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

More often than not I lose full health squad members who are either in full cover or in half cover (I understand half cover isn’t always guaranteed). On one occasion I was flanking around the side of a garage with two troops at full health. Soldier 1 was behind a road block and soldier 2 behind the garage wall, this gave me both Half-Cover and Full cover respectively. However this didn’t seem to matter because soldier 1 was hit at distance and died instantly loosing 5 health. Soldier 2 was shot through 2 solid non damaged walls and again was killed (How the enemy would have seen her I don’t know). That doesn’t leave a lot of room for setting up your team and formulating a tactical plan if the enemy can just shoot through cover as if it wasn’t there, this for me is a major issue. I feel that either the enemies are too overpowered or the cover isn’t working as it should do. Surely a concrete roadblock would assure a smidgen of protection.\nIn another instance, I had a full health rookie behind a barrier; the enemy melee unit ran all the way up so he was positioned on the other side of the barrier (half-cover) and killed me with one thwack to the head.\n\n2) Timed Goals\n\nI have no problem with the idea of a timed goal; however there are 2 issues I feel need to be addressed:\na) Harsh countdown times - The timed goals given are on the whole too short, running and gunning doesn’t work as combined with the above issue of cover being like jelly, it makes getting to the goal impossible and in most cases I lose the majority of my team getting there, just to have to spend all of my supplies on new recruits and thus getting stuck in a vicious cycle. (and this was in the Early game).\nb) Random reinforcements are too penalising, as you just have barely enough time to get to the goal. But add in the fact that 75% of the time, reinforcements form behind your team, and just mop up with 1 shot kills.\nFrom what I’ve played of the game, there’s a lot that I’ve enjoyed, there's a lot of potential and I’m genuinely excited about it, but I personally feel there needs to be a re-think when it comes to the cover situation and the harsh countdown timers.\n\nThere are also a few performance issues that I believe are being looked into, however, I’m not as badly affected as some.\n","February 11","false","41.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

XCom 2 is a great sequel and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the prequels or turn based games. I actually don't want to get into detail about the gameplay but rather the things that need to be fixed as fast as possible.\n\nThis game really fixes some of the issues with the prequel and reinforce the strong points that made it so great. Thus far I enjoyed the game except\n\nthe horrible technical problems, bugs and countless issues that really destroy the enjoyability of this game. This game has so many performance issues and the framerate is all over place even with a powerful rig. It's absolutely random and really decimating the enjoyment. Furthermore there are bugs, clipping errors and absolutely broken things. It also could add some more balancing here and there. Gameplaywise I would appreciate the timed missions to be more lax in order to give the player some freedom instead of the constant rushing.\n\nI see a great game that needs some serious patching before really being enjoyed.

I know that's one hell of a tongue (impressive actually, it could have OTHER uses too :wink wink: ) but come on, going through walls? it gets annoying really fast, I mean the first 5 or 6 times all's well that ends well... but for the love of the holy avatar, it is ****** annoying and one hell of a bug.\n\nAside from that there's some "lag" I'd say, sometimes windows break  even before a soldier charges in, or the snakes damage appears even before they grab and bound my soldier but that's fine I guess, maybe other ppl go through the same?\n\nOther than that, this game is amazing, love the mechanics (except the tongue thingie from before), enemies are great and tactics are well, actually that word, tactics, just like in the previous release you can't just go charging in guns blazing (or you could... heh that'd be fun I guess), you have a really nice variety of soldier classes and their skills are well thought, the system in which if they suffer an injury they can remain shocked is good, the cover system oh god that's amazing, love how everything goes from being the best cover to literally nothing, ashes.\n\nStory so far with the few hours I've put in is a blast, characters are even better than in 1 (except for shen, shen father was better than lily) and I'm expecting even more surprises.\n\nAll in all I do recommend this game but that ONE BUG with the snakes is a negative, really negative point for me ruining completely some tactics on important points of the game.\n\n* Update after last patch *\nSo I've been playing it a bit more, MODS are saving this game, they´re really, REALLY saving it, new katanas, new weapons, new enemies, new maps, buuuuut, the game retains its usual mechanics and that's a win.\n\nAlthough since I'm still facing same issues from before, I won't change my recommendation on this game, you need to polish the game (bad optimization maybe?) and the bugs a bit more Firaxis, you made such a great game and one of the best things it has is that even though it's a rush simulator it's fun, enjoyable and really well thought to let such bugs (and their workarounds - yes I'm looking at you cap rushing the return to the avenger without knowing that it can crash your game-) ruin it.\n\n\n* Update*\nCan't play this with mods and have to constantly verify cache? Way to go, I've over 30 mods at least in FO4 with no issues and you're telling me I can't have even 10 here? This game went from a not recommended to pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, if you're reading this you're better off getting this game from a torrent (yes, I'm saying to pirate this game to hell) ever since launch it had issues, it continues to have, it's not properly optimized and firaxis gives little to no attention to the game.\nIn all fairness I've tried a couple of fixes... and got the debug screen in which I was able to select what I wanted to do or even if I wanted to go to the final product screen, come on people, that's utter crap, uninstalling because it's too late to get a refund.","February 6","false","129.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Maybe an Addon will bring more fresh wind but the Story is very thin and Missions get dull really fast. Would give 5/10 with Sideway-Thumb.\n\n\n\nThe improvements over the first part are good:\n\n- Classes fit their role perfectly and different styles are encouraged (from very mobile agressive to very static lurking). Also the new character customization options are great. However there are some minor balancing problems (Melee of Ranger too weak for the amount of risk, most of the time you can just Run'n'Gun with Shotgun for more damage)\n\n- The rework of the worldmap need you to be more active and gives you the feeling of having more control over the given situation: You can decide to a certain factor, what you're doing and how you're doing it. (more about that later). Also different kinds of Ressources (Info, Ressource, Scientist and Ingenieurs) leave room for your approach to save the world.\n\n- New mechanics like Armor,Melee and weapon upgrades bring some fresh air to the battlefield. Especially armored opponents require more tactical work in fights and changes your Setup and Loadout a lot.\n\n- The new Enemies are fun to play against. Especially the Snake and ADVENT Melee need you to adapt to the situation fast\n\n- Starting in Concealment is an interesting way to let the players feel like hidden agressors and allows for better preparation of the whole sector. Works great!\n\n- The Basemanagment seems very well thought through. There's new buildings which fit perfectly to the game and the old buildings got a great rework. The building part feels less grindy and more impactful on your gameplan.\n\n\n\nWhat didn't went as good as expected for me:\n\n- The Story is dull. A modern version of "Nazi-Germany suppressing the population and experimenting with certain civilians." Haven't seen that in a while! After 2/3 of it I already had the urge to stop playing. Currently I'm in the middle of a Legendary Ironman run (Tier 2 weaponry and armor) and am not motivated anymore.\n\n- The freedom of the decisionmaking on the worldmap is mostly illusional. It's mostly contacting the sectors to the next ADVENT Base, clear Base, repeat. That's mostly it. Also you get interrupted by Advent a lot which gets annoying really fast. After the 4th or 5th time you sit there rolling your eyes and ask yourself "what's it this time?"\n\n- Repetitive missions already during the first playthrough. There's basically two types of Missions: First one is "Get to Point A (Hostage, Hack Terminal, Collect Information), then go to Point B (Extraction)". Even the special missions where you locate and collect storyobjects work that way. The second type are the missions known from XCOM 1: Rescue Civilians. Just more difficult since the aliens prioritize them more and there are less. Didn't find them interesting in the first part, here aswell. Also hidden enemies in those missions. Why?\n\nThe last point is the dealbreaker for me. Even when every other part of the game got really really well refined, the lack of different missions in XCOM2 made it boring very fast for me.","February 13","false","63.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Actually, it's somehow worse than previous XCom games. It still has a bunch of inherited bugs with camera/UI/animations(like notorious turn pauses, pointless camera angles, objects obscuring view, frozen animations). Now spiced up by clunky base building(or i just forgot if you also could not cancel some item or structure building in some situations in previous games) and all the annoying stuff taken up to 11. Like unskippable combat animations, in-between mission cutscenes, characters talking to you on mission (mother ♥♥♥♥ing Bradford...) or interrupting whatever you were doing.\n\nAnd my god it runs like a major ♥♥♥. It manages to tank my GTX970 consistently below 20 fps while running 30-40 in the best case without any Antialiasing. It stutters, it drops to single digits andl streams textures right in front of your face. All that while looking mediocre at best. And i'm not talking clown-ugly setting and characters of this game. There's nothing in the technical side of this game that would even remotely justify high hardware requirments. It has pretty small locations with humble texture resolution and amount of detail. Rendering effects they use are pretty standart(SSAO, SSR, basic deffered render + csm or psm. All of this has been done million times even with UE) and 've been done and documented many times, requiring remarkable incompetence to screw up. Texture streaming is one of their biggest problems... Although i haven't implemented it myself yet, AFAIK it is a standart part of UE and was used successfully(Dishonored 2, from the top of my head). I don't see any challenge here for a team of at least somewhat competent programmers.\n\nAnd the last, but not least - the gameplay. I do not consider myself as a genre veteran. so maybe my opinion is not that accurate. But i didn't have much fun despite being excited for the game and that kind of gameplay. 12 hours in i still have no idea, what am i doing and what are my priorities. My actions have very vague impact on overall situation. Difficulty goes uphill pretty fast, but i feel helpless. I don't get it, whole base managment part - by what criteria i should make choices on my research, production, building and contacts. Game spend a lot of time teaching me how to move soldiers, but zero time teaching any valid tactics to put in a right direction. It feels like i can do any concious decisions only after beating the game, preferably several times. Until then, my choices are pretty much blind.","February 19","false","12.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It is well designed, beautiful, atmospheric, and did everything better than its predecesors.\n\nHowever, I simply cannot recommend XCom 2 at its current state. It is simply too buggy.\n\nThe bugs ranges from minor issues like graphical glitches, performance drops, animation not properly displayed, to unfortunatly what I would call game breaking:\n\nI play on Ironman mode and I have lost two of my best soldiers to bugs. One of them got stuck to a wall and I cannot evac her at the end of the mission. Another was bleeding out but somehow I couldn't pick him up even the evac zone is one move away...\n\n[spoiler free, don't worry]\n\nNow the worst is the final mission...  there is a known bug that makes me afraid to even attempt it. As the game is designed you are allowed to restart the final mission should you fail, even in Ironman mode. However, people who restart their mission reported that all their passive abilities, ammo, and armor are gone. Given the difficulty spike of the final mission I don't even want to try it before they get this bug fixed.\n\nI'll update the review when Firaxis get the game fixed properly and it would be an amazing game.

From what i understand, the RNG is a single element that applies to all XCOM units and ADVANT forces regardless of the circumstances.\n\nFor example: lets say you have a Ranger unit within 3 spaces of a target thats out of cover, and you have a 95% chance to hit; this Ranger then misses for some stupid reason. you can load from the auto save and try again, but now anyone is garanteed to miss the first exchange regardless of who attacks first and regardless of "hit percentages".\n\nThis type of situation can result in some pretty ridiculous kills. My best kill was a critical hit with a shotgun at it's maximum hitting distance, through a full cover wall; and that was an 11% chance to hit and 2% to critical it (AND THAT WAS REPEATABLE FROM THE AUTO SAVE!). Seriously, if that doesn't show how bad the RNG is in this game, I don't know what will.\n\nEvery XCOM class is unbalanced, overpowered, or completely useless. The XCOM classes have a handful of useful classes: snipers, medics, demolition, heavy gunner, and psi op; every other class is completely worthless unblended (putting all your class points in one skill tree) and will get your team killed.\n\nThe Combat Technician (combat hacker) gets the ability to hack mech units, shock enemies with a drone (minimal damage at best) and do local scans to find enemies within proximity of the user; Medics can heal, revive, and resurrect from a distance (that in itself is extremely overpowered, no need to keep the medic close by), and can get the ability to do all that to everyone on your team, all at one time, once per mission.\n\nThe Gunslinger (Pistol Popper) can use their pistol (not main weapon) to shoot multiple enemies, shoot multiple shoot at one target, and take a pistol shot before using their main weapon (really the only good ability they have). Snipers can shoot at multiple enemies with a more powerful weapon, set up killzones (overwatch on crack), obliterate armor or near instakill (deadeye), and shoot from anywhere as long as someone has eyes on the target.\n\nThe Blademasters and phantom skills need to be blended in order for rangers to be any good (if you didn't do this, good luck).\n\nAlien units are Unbalanced and OP. There are a lot of Aliens you will hate to fight in XCOM 2; mainly: Sectoids, Gatekeepers, Shieldbearers, Vipers, and Codex.\n\nSectoids have a huge variety of psi abilities and sometimes use more than one in a turn.\n\nGatekeepers are tank-like psi enemies with huge AoE attacks and laser eyes.\n\nShieldbearers can turn any aliens around them into tanks or better tanks.\n\nVipers can spit venom like thinmen, and grab units with a long tongue like Smokers from L4D (btw, their snakes, not frogs, wtf, they shouldn't have a tongue ability).\n\ncodex can copy themselves, teleport, and AoE disarm units.\n\nThe timers are stupid and make no sense in certain missions. Why do I have a timer for a rescue mission or an assassination mission? Why is there a timer for stealing enemy intel from a box or computer?\nRelease Quality\nThe game was released in an unoptimized state. It's glitchy, slow, and can crash pretty hard from time to time. I had to start three missions over because my autosaves were corrupted, and restart the game at the final mission to fix some texture issues.\nConclusion\nThis game needs some serious overhauls and patches; the game is down right frustrating with the current RNG and game mechanics, and is a chore to get though.\n\nWait till this game gets an update, patches, overhaul mods / DLC, and a drop in price to no more than $30.\n\nIt's not a bad game, it's an ungraceful game that needs some serious reworking.","February 22","false","66.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

If you're into Xcom.. Buy it.  If you're not. Don't.\n\nAs far as a follow on goes, it's good.  Good idea, quite a basic storyline, but it's fairly involving.\n\nThe missions after awhile become quite samey.  But they're fun to complete.\nThe big let down for me is enforced gameplay and timed missions.   I prefer open non linear games.  Xcom 1 was non linear, sure you have to take out aliens, do missions etc but it wasn't forced on you.\n\nIn Xcom2 You spend a few days gathering intel, then a few days picking up supplies(money) then you're given a mission, which you can't ignore doing so looses you the game. In fact you can't really ignore any of the missions or you'll either loose the game outright or you'll loose the county you've spent a week getting.\n\nThen there's the avatar project, which even if you hold every country in the world, can still be completed by the aliens.  Your hand is forced throughout the game and during missions via the timer, forcing you to make moves you'd never make without the timer.  Forcing you to rush and loose essentially.\n\nThe game world is excellent, the ai in general is very good, sure there's issues with line of sight and some cosmetic glitches but overall the "idea" of the game is superb.\n\nIt is just let down by poor balancing, poor performance issues and mostly by poor design.\n\nI've beaten the game twice on veteran difficulty.  I lost maybe 2-3 soldiers in each game.  I don't mind loosing soldiers if I'm outplayed, but at times the game just seems to decide that you've lost, it's predetermined this and there is nothing to you can to stop it.\n\nIs it value for money? Sure.  I expect with time at least by summer, when the dlc's are introduced it'll be patched and updated.  Will I still be playing it then.. I doubt it.\n\nIf xcom 1 had random maps, intelligent ambush and overwatching, the ability to carry wounded soldiers there would really have been no need to even release xcom 2.   It's really just the same game with added insult.\n\nGames aren't about being frustrated and bored they're about having fun and winning. Xcom 2 is about loosing, it's about not getting to do what you want to do when you want to do it.   The physical game is replayable, but do I want to play it again and again.\n\nNope.  There's just too many annoying mechanics in the game.  Where there's a great idea, it's just poorly implimented or they clearly, just don't care.\n\n7/10 I really tried to like this game, but overall, after everything, I just can't.  Everytime I think of something good about it, I remember 5 bad things.\n\n*Edit*\n\nI hoped the dlc would add more to the game, but it hasn't.  Missions that should appear in mid or late game are appearing almost at the very start, pitting you against insanely powerful boss aliens and you just don't stand a chance.   Without some heavy modding of the dlc to reduce the hitpoints of these bosses, the dlc is worthless.  The added weapons rubbish.   Essentially it's a joke dlc, it's insulting.   Jake Soloman should be fired from firaxis for making this mess.","February 13","false","163.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

My system meets the minimum requirements, and yet whenever I play the tutorial mission (in order to start the game with Jane Kelly and a fully customized squad) it crashes during the Avenger arrival cinematic.  Every time.  If a person who wants to play the tutorial can't get past it into the game-proper, then your game isn't working.  Then there was the fact that smoke grenades didn't do anything, until a modder finished the devs' job.  Or how the "permanent control of turrets" described in the haywire protocol ability had to be corrected by a modder.  Or how your soldiers don't always fire on the correct enemy unit that you very specifically selected.  Or any of the multitude of other flaws reported by others.\n\nWhen the game works, I enjoy it, I'll grant that.  Well, except for the perception that the RNG *massively cheats* in the aliens' favour.  But the problem is, the game DOES NOT consistently work, and in some ways, consistently doesn't work.  And that experience isn't what I paid for when I bought this.\n\nOh, and post-patch, the game crashes every time I try to load my save game.  Or start a new game.

We have all been waiting for this game and it is amazing in so many areas! but what is the point if the games compatability issues constantly drag you screaming and kicking from that immersive beautiful world. This is no different to ordering a great tasting meal at a resteraunt and it turning up 5 hours late with half the food missing! would you not compalin? The game is beautiful probably more so if I could max the settings without it crashing! it plays well and improves beautifully on the Xcom franchise to which I am a great fan and played the originals for 200 hrs minimum. But I am just tired of publishers and AAA studios getting a free pass whenever they like. Compatability is just as important to gameplay, story and while visuals are great they are not the key to having a great game. I have had my rant take what you want from it, I have many friends who are playing this game and have less issues with bugs than I do!

If I have an ambush opportunity, I have time to fly across the United States to get there, why do I find I have 8 turns to complete the mission and extract my soldiers? 0 Point in Snipers at all, I lost mine as I could exctract them in time.\n\nI wouldn't recommend at all, until at least some kind of Long War mod comes out, I'm a few hours in and already it feels like the game is forcing me to do this and that as quickly as possible, the campaign has a timer, so you can't even really spend time doing the missions that pop up, you have to throw yourself at every opportunity (even with full Rookie squads, as things like Codexes appear, and you are fighting two boss enemies, after clearing the map, with a basically dead team, wiping them out).\n\nFurthermore, Overwatch in Concealment Sucks and is broken. I had a stun trooper, walk in range of all four squad members, all four in overwatch, hit my medic in the face, and then it was my turn? Not a single shot fired by the overwatch guys?!\n\nIt's a good game mechanically, but the forced nature of the story and every single mission makes me wish I had not of purchased it and waited to see if the modders can fix it.","February 6","false","35.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I'm a huge X-Com fan. This misses the mark. The flying base the "Avenger" is just a frustrating waste of time, it bogs down the game.\n\nSome of the new enemies completely unbalance the game. Like the enemy that has the same ability as the Ranger class. Which is lazy and lame, the rangers ability should be unique to your squad. Your going up against a much larger force, they shouldnt have the same abilities as you, and this ability allows them to move across vast distances and melee you, and it rarely misses, so basically you'll always have a wounded soldier almost guranteed every mission once that enemy is introduced.\n\nIts buggy, choppy, and slow.\n\nOh, and the amount of timed missions is completely awful. Once you get a few hours in the enemy troop difficulty\nramps up VERY quickly. If your lucky you'll barely have magnetic guns at this point, and its not enough...\n\nSomething is just off with this game, and leaves me just frutrated  with little willingness to play it anymore.\nMost likely going to try getting a refund.","February 23","false","61.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If you're into Xcom.. Buy it.  If you're not. Don't.\n\nAs far as a follow on goes, it's good.  Good idea, quite a basic storyline, but it's fairly involving.\n\nThe missions after awhile become quite samey.  But they're fun to complete.\nThe big let down for me is enforced gameplay and timed missions.   I prefer open non linear games.  Xcom 1 was non linear, sure you have to take out aliens, do missions etc but it wasn't forced on you.\n\nIn Xcom2 You spend a few days gathering intel, then a few days picking up supplies(money) then you're given a mission, which you can't ignore doing so looses you the game. In fact you can't really ignore any of the missions or you'll either loose the game outright or you'll loose the county you've spent a week getting.\n\nThen there's the avatar project, which even if you hold every country in the world, can still be completed by the aliens.  Your hand is forced throughout the game and during missions via the timer, forcing you to make moves you'd never make without the timer.  Forcing you to rush and loose essentially.\n\nThe game world is excellent, the ai in general is very good, sure there's issues with line of sight and some cosmetic glitches but overall the "idea" of the game is superb.\n\nIt is just let down by poor balancing, poor performance issues and mostly by poor design.\n\nI've beaten the game twice on veteran difficulty.  I lost maybe 2-3 soldiers in each game.  I don't mind loosing soldiers if I'm outplayed, but at times the game just seems to decide that you've lost, it's predetermined this and there is nothing to you can to stop it.\n\nIs it value for money? Sure.  I expect with time at least by summer, when the dlc's are introduced it'll be patched and updated.  Will I still be playing it then.. I doubt it.\n\nIf xcom 1 had random maps, intelligent ambush and overwatching, the ability to carry wounded soldiers there would really have been no need to even release xcom 2.   It's really just the same game with added insult.\n\nGames aren't about being frustrated and bored they're about having fun and winning. Xcom 2 is about loosing, it's about not getting to do what you want to do when you want to do it.   The physical game is replayable, but do I want to play it again and again.\n\nNope.  There's just too many annoying mechanics in the game.  Where there's a great idea, it's just poorly implimented or they clearly, just don't care.\n\n7/10 I really tried to like this game, but overall, after everything, I just can't.  Everytime I think of something good about it, I remember 5 bad things.\n\n*Edit*\n\nI hoped the dlc would add more to the game, but it hasn't.  Missions that should appear in mid or late game are appearing almost at the very start, pitting you against insanely powerful boss aliens and you just don't stand a chance.   Without some heavy modding of the dlc to reduce the hitpoints of these bosses, the dlc is worthless.  The added weapons rubbish.   Essentially it's a joke dlc, it's insulting.

Just completed the campaign and man it is so much harder than the previous game. If you love EU/EW you will love this sequel.\n\nAlthough it launched with varied performance issues, and some... 'interesting' bugs, the performance is pretty easiliy tweaked and the bugs are not so much game breaking as they are... weird. Mostly visual delays during the alien turn that leave you pondering what is going on until the turn ends and animation catches up and normalness resumes.\n\nDeeply rich campaign strategy and very very satisfying tactical combat. The turn counters add just enough pressure to make sure you're not quite comfortable while giving you the time for intelligent decisions and ultimately, victory. Even though about 75% of the missions had timers for me, the ones without the timer still kept me on my toes with the very difficult combat.\n\nLiterally improved everything we loved about EU/EW and added new features and combat mechanics.\n\nHighly highly recommend this game to fans of the previous installment. Though the difficulty has gone up significantly! New players be warned! This is not a relaxing game but a stressful challenge to put your wits to the test! (brutally difficult but very winnable). And oh so satisfying when you obtain victory against overwhelming odds. Looking forward to many playthroughs.\n\nSTRATEGY GOTY.","February 12","true","47.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

The strategic layer, combat, classes, soldier customization, enemy AI, enemy variety, mission variety, maps, resource management, all improved. But optimization and overall polish has definitely taken a hit, and there are a few questionable decisions that hold it back from being perfect.\n\nOn the strategic layer back at the Avenger, managing your base's allocated space has seen a pretty drastic overhaul, and the new contact system replaces the satellites of previous games. In general, you have a lot more control over what missions you take and what you spend your time doing, instead of always passing the time by scanning for activity like in Enemy Unknown. Now as different scanning opportunities pop up with all different kinds of rewards, you can proioritize which place you'd like to take the Avenger to scan based on the rewards that each location gives out.\n\nAs far as managing your space goes, the new upgrade system is a welcome improvement over EU. Now you don't need to wait until late-game to get the most out of building generators, for instance. When you unlock the next level generator that increases output, you can just upgrade the generators you have. It's a system that punishes you for early building considerably less than EU did. In addition, each facility can now be staffed with engineers, which are a resource that you'll gather over the course of the game. Staffing facilities gives different bonuses depending on each facility, and you can switch up which facilities are staffed on the fly to focus on what you need at any given time.\n\nCombat is much the same as EU and EW, with some subtle refinements and UI improvements here and there. Grenades and explosives are more powerful and more important now, as you'll often fight armored enemies who need to have that armor shredded by explosives before they become vulnerable. Verticality plays a larger role now as the new maps are built more with setting up for height advantages in mind. The procedural map system works brilliantly and honestly feels like these maps were handcrafted.\n\nEach of the replacement classes for the classes from EU is a step up from the last game, and each one has two distinct paths of skills that almost make each side feel like their own class. The Ranger replaces EU's Assault class, and can be specced for stealth melee or a shotgun vanguard. Sharpshooter replaces the Sniper and be specced for pure sniper or as a gunslinger (a pistoleer that actually has distinct advantages over a sniper -- I once took shots at 8 aliens in one turn using the Faceoff skill that lets you take a free shot at every enemy in range). The Specialist replaces the Support and can be set up as either a field medic or a hacker, and comes with a drone that allows him to heal or hack remotely. The Grenadier replaces the Heavy and can be either a demolitionist focused on explosions or a heavy machine gunner that focuses on the usage of miniguns. And there's a fifth class this time around, the Psi Operative can be acquired earlier in the game than Psi troopers of EU, and is its own distinct class with tons of great abilities. My favorite is being able to permanently mind control one enemy per mission. And the best part of all of these classes is that you can mix and match skills from both sides of each class, so you have a lot of freedom in builds.\n\nSoldier customization is great. You have a lot more control over how your soldiers looks, with customizable faces, names, nationalities, bios, props like shades, headbands, bandannas, headgear like hoods and helmets, full control over weapon and armor color, you can add patterns to weapon and armor (and might I add, weapons and armor can be customized separately), you can pick variants armor torsos, arms, and legs (except for the  middle tier of armor -- you can't change the torso there for some reason) and can even upload your characters to a global character pool so the people you've created will appear in future playthroughs. One big missing feature: If you save a character, you can't load that appearance/description onto a rookie, you just have to hope you bump into that soldier again randomly if you want to use him. To that end, I refrained from using the character pool and will just manually recreate my soldiers next time if I want to re-use those characters. But you can also create characters to be engineers, doctors, or bad guys if that's more up your alley. And finally this one is to Firaxis (thanks for reading, Jake): Give us some more helmets, please. Such a great selection in EU and EW and yet there's only a handful in XCOM 2, and they don't look so good.\n\nNow for some negatives: The game is not optimized well. At all. Back at the Avenger it's  not uncommon for dips down to 10-20FPS, and I have a capable rig playing on reasonable settings. I had better performance on missions after the initial ten-second stuttering as the map first loads, but many people have terrible performance all around. Here's hoping Firaxis addresses this in a future patch and manages to make this game more playable for more folks. It's unacceptable that a game in 2016 that was delayed and made exclusive for the PC runs this poorly, especially when the visuals, while ultimately good, are nothing crazy. There are also frequent hitches like the game hanging in between turns, actions taking longer than they should to start/stop playing, UI and sound bugging out. It's hard to understand why the game shipped like this when Firaxis generally knocks optimization and overall polish out of the park.\n\nMission timers. Oh boy. Mission timers are a divisive topic within the community. Some people love them, some people say they ruin the game, some people don't care much either way. I played on normal ("veteran", as it's known in-game) and won my first campaign, and on normal the mission timers are very tolerable. On higher difficulties however, the general consensus seems to be that they're only there to force you to rush and make mistakes. I definitely agree that they're artificial difficulty at best and while they didn't bother me so much at my difficulty level, if I had the choice, I probably would have disabled them. They didn't detract much from the game, but at the end of the day they didn't really add anything.\n\nWounds. My biggest gripe with the game. Injuries for your soldiers are much, much more prevalent this time around than they were in EU. If a soldier takes any hit, no matter how strong their armor is, and no matter if they get healed with a medkit, they're wounded. Wounds come in three flavors, lightly wounded, wounded, and gravely wounded. Grave wounds last up to an in-game month, and while this isn't so bad in the early game, by late-game you're going to be on missions where high-ranking soldiers feel almost mandatory to counter what you're up against. There's a facility where you can staff an engineer to cut recovery times in half, and even then the amount of time your soldiers spend wounded is obscene. The EU system of soldiers only being wounded when they take more damage than their armor adds to their health was much, much better, and I hope this new system is addressed in a patch.\n\nNegatives aside, the game that we got is pretty much just EU but bigger and better in every way. It's not perfect, but what is? It's got some problems, but what doesn't? I would still wholeheartedly recommend this game to anybody, especially people who liked Enemy Unknown.","February 13","true","41.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","2"

Your thinking, shes fitter, and she must have the same personality. But does she ♥♥♥♥. Shes out for your Wallet and will leave you falling asleep after 15 minautes of ♥♥♥♥ all foreplay and playing dead the whole time"\n\n"Xcom2 in my opinion, A Horrendous ♥♥♥♥ Picking ♥♥♥ Receptical."\n\n===========================================\n\nI recently mustered the courage to purchase this game despite cringing for my beloved yet light wallet. Ussually my purchases are very selective but I decided, having played Xcom 1 and adored many of the previous in the genre, this was a safe purchase. How wrong was I.\n\nMy consensus playing this game leaves me lacking ANY form of excitement, I literally have to force myself to play it, let me break it down:\n\nStoryline: The story has completely failed to drag me in. Set in a world already conquered by aliens, It fails to establish any kind of emotional or empathetic connection with 'any' of the storyline characters and yourself. With no lack of attempts to drag you in, It just feels like they've attempted a mass effect/dragon ageish approach but completely ♥♥♥♥ed it up purely with a ♥♥♥♥ back story, no user customization/decisions making it linear and a one trick pony, then theres realism, your sat there thinking how the ♥♥♥♥ did all this happen, with little believable reason as to why. This theme that world has already been conquered and colonized leaves me feeling there is already no hope and humanity is ♥♥♥♥ed. Despite the fact there are already multiple Xcom storys flying from previous genres, they've reinvented the wheel yet spectacularly managed to make it the same as every title before. "get base, kill aliens, save the world" except in the EXACT SAME WAY AS ALL PREVIOUS TITLES. Jees, atleast have some forks in the road. -1\n\nRealism: None, there isnt any, the story is unrealistic, the setting, the tech, I know its a sci fi, but you need some realism factor in order for people to relate, and get pulled in. -1\n\nCombat: Whilst vastly the same as previous Xcoms, has features implemented which frustrate my gameplay. UI has been reduced 'even more' like I didnt think that was possible before, with even less information on display allowing you to interpret the battlefield leaving you frustrated when your tactical decisions fail due to gameplay mechanics you simply werent aware of. The camera is god damned awful, with constant custscenes skipping in and increasing your wait time when all you really want to do is survey the battlefield, sure you can turn it off, but half of them still go on. Oh yeah surveying the battlefield, your camera is zoomed in only allowing you to see a short distance in your vicinity, to see further you have to mouse out, which gives what I'd consider a "normal" battlefield viewing distance, but once you release, it goes back to the previous camera. How the hell your supposed to think ahead tactically on this "middle mouse and remember" ethos is beyond me. It feels like this game has been dumbed down for console. Heavy modding will most definately be needed. -1\n\nGameplay: The first couple of hours in this game, I felt like I had little or no influence over what was happening. No choices, just following a merry go round of "click OK to do this". It reminds me of a Web Based Strat where you spend weeks doing this ♥♥♥♥ only to get bored out of your ♥♥♥♥ing brain. The only choice I have are to click "ignore" then recieve a warning saying "♥♥♥♥ YOU BETTER DO THIS OR HELL WILL BREAK LOOSE" and you feel like you'll miss something and succumb to fear mongering. -1\n\nDifficulty: The AI is a challenge, and the amount of options available to you in combat do present tactical freedom leaving you hanging on the edge of your seat. Gone are the "guy 1 shoots misses, guy 2 shoots, misses, guy 3 shoots misses". +1\n\nGraphics: Yeah great, but since when did looking at a nice picture captivate me for 60+ hours... That said, it feels like playing a frigging cartoon. Im giving it a +1 because it is beautiful in places, but its also getting a -1 because I think thats the reason im not dragged into this game, Its a fecking cartoon! +1 -1\n\nExperience: Whilst I enjoyed Xcom 1, it was already dumbed down as it was, and it was bearable, even fun, this didnt need to be dumbed down anymore. It needed more UI not less. More tactical options, not less. More User decision making not less. More Customization.... not... less..\n\nConclusion: I really dont care for this game, its crap. Its a Cartoon graphicy console port.\n\nMy Score:\nnegs -5\npos +2\n\nOverall, -3\n\nLeaving Xcom2 in my opinion, A Horrendous ♥♥♥♥ Picking ♥♥♥ Receptical.","February 9","false","42.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

There is tons of potential that is let down by a poor interface, poor ai and a poor story. There is not much variety to the aliens, and the research trees are not very deep. There doesn't seem to be a lot of difference between weapons either.\n\nI enjoyed my first playthrough, but am struggling with boredom to try to finish my second one. Tactics are a little different which take a bit of getting used to - My first attempt was on normal difficulty and I got whooped. Once I figured things out, it  got a lot easier.\n\nI would recommend getting X-COM instead if you have never played one of these before.\n\nThis will be the last time I prepurchase an X-COM game though.","March 20","false","154.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

One of my guys got shot from outside the building he was taking cover in - right through the wall.\nEver seen a soldier smash in a laser-grid window, shattering glas everywhere? You will see that a lot in XCOM 2.\nDisplayed information for actions is occasionally incorrect or doesn't contain any info at all (like missing damage/percentage numbers). Occasionally Explosives that clearly outline the enemey units as affected, don't to jack to them.\nThe action cam repeatedly shows a black screen with red bars - so you won't even directly see what the ADVENT soldier right in front of you is doing. And when you can see something, the soldiers usually hold the guns to each others heads or walk though obstacles to shoot at the enemy. Same stuff they did in Enemy Unknown.\nAlso, the mission occasionally lets stuff go boom next to your squad for no discernable reason, killing off your dudes without you ever having a chance to have prevented it.\n\nIt's now all bad though. On the plus side, you can customize soldiers and weapons and even augment most of them with mods. Loads of maps are randomized now, so you won't likely see the same levels multiple times. And you have concealment now. Which basically means you don't have to creep ahead one space at a time as enemies are now unware of you until you get the drop on them. But don't worry, after that first fight, you get right back on your knees and crawl at a snails pace again as Enemy Pods are the way to go in the sequel as well...\nBut you have turn limits on most missions now, so the game acitvely FORCES you to run into Pods head on as you wouldn't be able to complete the missions elsewise.\n[To be fair: You can mod the turn limits to be higher or non-existant, but since that is a mod-induced feature it wouldn't feel right to say that this isn't complete bullsh*t.]\n\nSo, I am not a fan.\nBarely an upgrade in terms of mechanics as far as I see it and I guess XCOM has Polio again. Several design decisions such as the turn limits are highly questionable and make me actually hate this game.\nThis is another AAA-Beta-Relase. XCOM 2 needs a hefty dose of polish, then we can maybe talk about it being a decent game.\n\nApart from that there is so much freaking RNG involved, you can as well play Monopoly or Ludo.\n...Gods forgive me, I acutally recommended playing those two games...\n\nIf you wanna really give this one a try, go to your cardiologist first. See if he has any objections to high blood pressure and rage fits.\nBecause you can and will lose your favourite soldier due to a random crit of a guy that decided to go bonkers, activated by one of your squaddies taking cover behind a wall or even worse getting dragged over half the map by a Viper.\n\nAnd don't come at me with "learn how to tactics" or any other of this PCMR bs. If an outmaneuvered Muton evades all shots directed at it and then decides to ignore the Suppression directed at him and crit a heavy in full-cover in the face, melting her in one shot, there sure is a lot I must have done wrong.\nXCOM:EU was hard but fair. XCOM 2 is flat-out unfair in every aspect. And the way it is designed it acutally punishs tactical planning.\n\nBut if you love rolling the dice and lose all your stuff, oh boy, this game sure is for you.\n\nEdit: Don't even get me started on the Multiplayer. That thing is just plain broken.","February 7","false","12.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

First of all, the bs %TO HIT system is dumb. Ask yourself, in what possible game, do % to hit fit in? Not in this game, not in any other. Because in real life or just a normal shooter, there is alot more factors involved other than a random item you found on the ground's bonus stats which can be attached. Your character can literally miss a guy standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM SOMEHOW. Theres also ALOT of waiting in this game. For some reason, the develepors of the game decided that you have to watch as they walk into their death duo to dumb % hit system. The camera's locked on the character that you told to move ALL the way, and they are slow as hell. Honestly, if I did not have to watch ALL my characters move to position SEPERATLY I would not have 11 hours on this game, it feels like you're spending hours on watching them move.

I looked through multiple pre-release reviews and there was basically no mention of bugs or what is at times, completly illogical enemy behavior.  for example the game interface works fine on my laptop, right untill i dock it and use my mouse.  now when i mouse over a button it dissapears before i can select it. that's annoying but i can work around it until the hot fix but what i can't get past is the often completly moronic responses of the advent troopers.\n\nmore than once they've advanced on my position to get a nominally better shot on one of my squad but expose themselves to another squadie.  several times i've had an advent trooper move from a firing position to a burning vechile, ensureing they die after taking thier shot from the explosion.  because they move with no hint of self preservation it's like you are fighting an OP zergling rush.\n\nEven that wouldn't be so bad but your squaddies fail about 80% of thier will checks, often creating a cascade failure that is irrecoverable because you're (seemingly) always fighting against a timer.\n\nI could probably even work past all of this but i get the stong feeling that failing at any one mission will start a larger failure cascade in the larger game and i don't think there is much of chance to recover once your (nominal) grip on the situation starts to slip.\n\nI understand this is supposed to be harder experience and i even embrace the idea but if failure is such a constant  the game becomes a chore.  I've got 6 hours into the game, and i've yet to see the fouth promotion skill for any class because none of the squaddies stay alive long enough.   There is no point in spending time customizing a squaddie if they are going to die in the next mission or two.  the only reward for good tatics in this game is that you might not get completly boned by the crazy enemy behavior, but i wouldn't count on it.\n\nThe base control suffers from constanly haveing to stop one thing to go to another section to start a new research project, restart a scan that got stopped for the 3rd time, re-assign an egineer, move your ship, deal with a concil alert, and on and on and on.\n\nI'm going to table the game until the patch comes out, hopefully fixing the interface and nerfing the will checks a bit.  If it becomes fun i'll write a new review but right now it's just a gigantic dissapointment.","February 9","false","21.0"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","27","50","2","0"

The gameplay is about what you'd expect from a turn-based game but of course with significant additions compared to Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. Although I do miss my squad of superhumans and MECs, the new revamped classes are worthy replacements. The combination of rangers, specialists, grenadiers, sharpshooters and Psi operatives make one hell of a squad. Guerrilla Ops is a nice change of pace in which you enter a mission concealed thus allowing you to set up an Overwatch ambush. Fantastic addition to say the least. Gone are the days in which you can send out your Firestorms to shoot at alien crafts, and that is something I do miss at times. I won't spoil anything about the story here, but one thing I can say is that it gave me chills from start to finish and all of it in a good way. After such a long wait, it is good to be back as the Commander.\n\nps. Optimisation issues are still troublesome as the framerate dips almost constantly from time-to-time, not to mention the loading times can take a considerable amount of time.

The gameplay is about what you'd expect from a turn-based game but of course with significant additions compared to Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within. Although I do miss my squad of superhumans and MECs, the new revamped classes are worthy replacements. The combination of rangers, specialists, grenadiers, sharpshooters and Psi operatives make one hell of a squad. Guerrilla Ops is a nice change of pace in which you enter a mission concealed thus allowing you to set up an Overwatch ambush. Fantastic addition to say the least. Gone are the days in which you can send out your Firestorms to shoot at alien crafts, and that is something I do miss at times. I won't spoil anything about the story here, but one thing I can say is that it gave me chills from start to finish and all of it in a good way. After such a long wait, it is good to be back as the Commander.\n\nps. Optimisation issues are still troublesome as the framerate dips almost constantly from time-to-time, not to mention the loading times can take a considerable amount of time. It can be painful to watch the cutscenes stutter at times but Firaxis is working on it from what I heard. Hopefully they release a patch real soon. Didn't stop me from completing it though.","February 11","true","46.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Looking at all negative reviews where people are whining that their pentium 2 with voodoo GPU can't run this game is unreal, makes me want to shot myself in the balls.\n\nFirst of all, it's 2k Gabes, you had to expect ridiculously unoptimised game before preordering or buying short after release. It was OBVIOUS the game on the launch will work like 60 years old soviet tractor. I still bought it and playing to my heart's content, and i certanly don't care if my fps can suddenly drop in bloody turn-based game. I spent some time looking for a fix that makes fps drop to the bottom because of bloody USB MODEM connected. And this bug is present since BORDERLANDS 2 and was never fixed (something about 2K online integration and stuff). Majority of Enemy Within performance issues were never fixed and  you expected a clean lubed start with this one? This is like buying Total War or Paradox games and expect them to work.\n\nYes, PC games' quality control is dire nowadays, there's no actual testing, wide variety of PC configurations can not work with the game for mystical reasons, publishers always push devs to release SOONER AND SOONER, it's not a reason to discard the game if the game is good. You should have a vague idea that making games is pretty hard, right? Or do you think throwing a tantrum about having 59 fps isntead of 60 will somehow change the world?\n\nSecond of all, people complaining about game being TOO HARD, TIMED MISSIONS ARE TOO FAST, INTEL INCOME TOO LOW... Is it official IGN embassy or what? It's XCOM, bro, make up your mind. You are supposed to care about every single rookie in your barraks and to know how to damage control your every failure. You are supposed to have squad wipes because of bad luck, massive panic from unlucky crit, scarce resources and you have to know how to work with what you got, unless you like to be a whimp and save scum your every failed shot. It's in this games' blood, that's the point. "OMG i can't finish mission in 8 turns :^(((" - WTF?\n\nGame is fairly balanced on Classic so far, except for annual major diff spikes here and there, there's nothing that human being with three digit iq couldn't handle. Certain class abilities can even be called absolutely OP and can pull your whole squad through completely doomed operation.\nIf anything, everything is much easier than originals, where you can't scratch your bum without throwing smoke grenade first.\n\nThere are also people who are STILL complaining that it's nothing like original UFO defense, but they are old farts by now, they can complain all they want.\n\nAs for the changes from previous games since reboot - i like almost every change in mechanics. EVERYTHING is handled better. Tactical combat is much more compelling, geoscape gameplay makes much more sense, base management is somewhat nonexistent, but i don't really care that much. To be fair, this thing about single base was stupid in the first place, so making mobile base is pretty much right decision, considering that introducing multiple bases would only spawn more "too difficult >:(" whine at this point. I wish there was more variety in weapons between tiers, but that's what mods are for. Full mod support, baby!\n\nMajorly improved story, A E S T H E T I C S, sound, graphics, gameplay, a lot of cool science-fiction stuff here and there, snakes with boobs, CODEX'S BOOTY, ability to create a squad with Hatsune Miku and Samuel L. Jackson because of pretty rad customization options, what the hell more do you want? Core mechanics of previous game aren't really changed, so if you didn't like them back then - you won't like this one. But with whole gorilla warfare theme everything sort of makes much more sense, so you still can try it even if you didn't like Enemy Unknown/Within\n\nAs someone who's following franchise since the original games, i can say that this game is best effort to bring XCOM into modern pc game reality without just copypasting outdated mechanics to pander to hardcore oldfarts who can just go and play the originals for 100th time.  It's basically like Heroes 5 compared to Heroes 3, both are excellent games with the same spirit, one is just much more modern, so it will lose a lot of charm for MLG-LAN-PARTY-RANDOM-MAP-PROS.\n\nI give this game 100 hidden movements out of 100 and encourage you to buy and play it as soon as possible. But if you are man of faint heart and crаppy rig - wait for more performance patches and gameplay mods.","February 6","true","101.2"," 47 of 89 people (53%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","53","47","89","11","2"

The sound in XCOM stopped working for me so I decided to go ahead and buy XCOM2.\n\nWell so far the game seems pretty good but I couldn't say much about it because of all the game breaking bugs.\n\nDuring the tutorial there came a time when it wanted me to go into overwatch mode.  I tried, and no matter what I couldnt get into overwatch mode.  I use the steam controlller and it already is kinda weird controls so I tried on my mouse and keyboard, still couldnt.  So I had to quit.  This time I skipped tutorial because I don't have all day to play games and just wanted to play before my wife came home from work.  It was pretty good for about an hour or 2 until at a mission screen my ship starts on it's way to the mission and just stopped.  The game wasnt frozen it was just as if my ship didnt want to go to the mission anymore.  But it was on its way so the game wouldnt do anything else.  I just can't pujt the time into playing a game thats going to stop working all the time I am at a point in my life where I just want to be able to sit back on the couch and enjoy playing a game without thinking about it.   This is not able to be one of those games for me due to all the bugs.  :(\n\nAlso as I mentioned earlier the steam controller works for it but the controls are bad to me (unless I just have not found out how to change them) but it requires you to click icons with the "mouse" for your moves instead of being able to use  the controller to cycle them with buttons.  Any time I'm forced to use the touchpad on the controller to navigate to tiny buttons is annoying,\n\nSo maybe one day I'll be able to play this when it's polished more.  Until then it's been a waste of $50","April 7","false","3.0"," 28 of 52 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","28","52","0","0"

Same infuriating, pre-calculated RNG, same LoS issues. I'm not sure if there is flying armor in this one, but I bet it will be just as horrible as i remember it from EU.\n\nSecond thing, the game is stupidly hard right out of the gate. You are playing bunch of hobos fighting alien military (with borderline cheating skills sometimes), and it will make you want to throw the monitor out of the window. Once you manage to claw your way to better gear and ranks, things will get more enjoyable. You will still get horribly wiped, but at least you will be able to return the favour.\n\nTechnical issues are present, but they don't affect the gameplay, and in general don't make me want to tear my eyes out. They will be patched anyway.\n\nNotorious timers, while annoying, aren't too stressful - you can easily finish them with 3-4 turns left if you play aggresively. Global map timer, while intimidating, for now behaves pretty much as panic levels in previous game (including reverts).\n\nWith all those things said, game improved in pretty much every aspect. Economy is more interesting, soldier progression is hugely improved. Fighting is definetely more "interesting" as well, for better or worse. Most of problems are either temporary, or inherent to the series. Highly recommend it.","February 5","true","57.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

And my frustration doesn't come from the combat as much as it comes from the "big picture" the game has going.\n\nI enjoy the combat of these two games.  I just don't like how the pace of the game forces you to rush the game so much.  I get that they were going for a "the world is in danger, get your ♥♥♥ in gear" asthetic in the game, but that's just not for me.  I would have liked a little more time to enjoy the combat and see my characters grow instead of pushing stupid objectives that force me to fight this "game-ends-if-you-dont-do-what-i-tell-you" mechanic.  I would have liked a little bit of time to outfit my characters and enjoy the fruits of my labor.\n\nThe combat is meant to make you feel like you're fighting a losing battle.  But it takes it a little too far.  You know that guy you tried playing dungeons and dragons with that one time in high school who seriously tried to "total party kill" your team the entire time.  Like, they REALLY did everything they could to stack the game against you for some stupid power trip?  Sure; the mechanics are there, and if you have luck on your side you'll come out on top. but no matter what; the odds were stacked entirely against you?  That's what this game feels like to me.\n\nThe balance of "I feel good because I overcame this obstacle through ability and determination" is thrown far off-balance and it feels like I won because I loaded my game enough times to try and outsmart the computer on my terms.  I didn't feel like I was ever getting any better because the enemies were always ahead of me by too much.  I never felt like I was getting any better.\n\nI can't recommend this game because the creators took an old IP I really like and made a game that is just frustrating and seldom rewarding. The initial build at release crashes a lot and my "high score of missing shots" has reached a new high at 98% chance to hit (and still missed).

Rection","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044424540/","30 products in account","TL;DR? = Unenjoyable, Every mission felt like a chore, stupidly flawed probability system, missions gradually become impossible to complete, game forces you to play how it wants you to play, timer to beat the game makes it virtually stressful and unrelaxing.\n\nI personally enjoy turn based games with a strategic and tactical element implemented to make you feel like a commander of a fireteam. This game fits right in there but with major disappointing twists that have rendered it unejoyable and everything about it is forced onto you. In addition, one thing I HATE the most about this game is the element of probability, and not just that but the probabilities you get in terms of a successful hit are very unrealistic and just straight out annoying.\n\nIn the beginning of the main campaign, I was having fun. Missions were playable, but only easy if you knew how to position your fireteam and target the most lethal and threatening enemies first while taking care of your own team in order to suffer little to no losses or damages. I was mastering that pretty well. The enemies I faced were a suitable match to the soldiers and lack of equipment I had to begin with which was fair enough. Then came this AVATAR project. Now I understand Firaxis wanted something unique, but to implement some sort of timer required in order to beat the game well thats just thrown any form of relaxation and joy of the game straight out the window. Then enemies staretd to become harder, and I couldnt keep up with improving my team and equipment. The game forces you to use your veteran teams more often due to the sudden rise of difficulty. Leaving you with no chance of using any additional rookies to promote them and give them access to better equipment. The further into the game I got, the more stressful it became when you lost even one soldier (who was either a squaddie or Cpl) because that meant you needed to replace him/her, but that was vitually impossible because I have now reached to that part of the game where every mission I play now is extremely difficult for rookies. I then eneded up having to restart because I kept losing soldiers bit by bit after every mission. How I was losing them I will explain later.\n\nNow the missions themselves I believed were forced onto the player. You're given a mission to do in which although you have an option to skip it, you will suffer a serious penalty if you do. Now you're probably asking, why would you want to skip it anyway? Well maybe because I was in the middle of picking up a supply drop and researching equipment to further improve my fireteam, and I know that if I don't finish those researches then I won't stand a chance in hell in doing any further missions. I understand that sacrifices have to be made sometimes in order to complete a mission, but sacrificing after every mission makes any future missions impossible to complete. It's stressful enough that you need to spend time in collecting supply and researching equipment in order to keep up with the mission difficulty, but then to stop me mid way and literally URGE me to do this mission or I suffer a penalty, its just silly. I also understand that they make us do these missions so that we dont go ahead of the difficulty and enter a mission with a fully kitted out fireteam making the mission a walk in the park, but the difficulty is already way ahead, after the fact that I lost two soldiers from the previous mission, and I had to waste supply recruiting more which will be useless because they dont have the equipment to even survive for two turns in the next upcoming missions (sorry for abusing the word "missions").\n\nNow onto the stupidly flawed probability system. 6 out of 10 ten times I was given a probability of a 70%+ chance of hitting the enemy and I end up missing. 2 of those 6 misses my soldier was in point blanc range of the enemy. Not only that but on several occasions my soldiers were behind full cover and end up getting critically hit back to the stone age as if they were sitting ducks out in the open (and no they weren't being flanked because the sheild symbol was still blue and not yellow). You were doing a good job killing off the enemy fire team with no wounded soldiers because you mastered the arts of flanking and cover just to have one alien, suddenly blessed by the vision of god and snipe one of your guys who was behind a brick wall. I stopped beliving it was due to unluckiness and started thinking that it was just plain bull, since it happened consistently.\n\nOverall, the game became less enjoyable after every mission. The missions started to feel like a chore instead of actually being hyped to do them.

However, as it currently stands there are a number of glaring issues with the game that need to be addressed before I can do so.\n\n1.) The game is a poorly optimized buggy mess.\n\nFrame rates are wildly inconsistent, and character animations are hilariously buggy (falling through the ground, breaking already-shattered windows, guns firing while on the back of the soldier, teleporting to another part of the map while being strangled by a viper ect...). The kill-cam is arguably even more buggy now than in XCOM: Enemy Unknown, especially when using abilities that initiate multiple attacks at once.\n\n2.) The UI is genuinely awful.\n\nFraxis chose a concise and "stylish" look for all the important information in the game at the cost of the players. Damage estimates always show the highest possible outcome causing players to make poor attacks, what constitutes as flanking is completely unclear and not apparent before making a move, soldier skills are not viewable in the deployment menu,  the difference between "one-time" projects and "for all soldiers forever" projects in the workshop are not made clear, and information regarding the aliens outside of their health on the battlefield is never viewable by the player (what does "battle frenzy" even do?). No wonder many of the most popular mods are simply UI fixes.\n\n3.) Gameplay is enjoyable, but suffers from some minor issues.\n\nFor the most part, the gameplay is enjoyable. If you liked the previous XCOM's gameplay, you will like XCOM2's gameplay. However, it carries with it the same problems of its predecessor. Firing angles are still bizarre and unclear; sometimes you can shoot through walls, other times your soldier cannot fire at an enemy clearly within range/view. Difficulty remains wildly inconsistent, with the early game being challenging, the mid-game unbearablely hard, and the end game being a bit too easy.\n\nThe most controversial new gameplay decision is the addition of various turn timers to most of the missions. Whether you would like this or not really depends on how you play the game. If you like slow and methodical gameplay, you will probably hate it. Thankfully, not all missions are timed, so you still have some diversity in playstyle.\n\nIn conclusion: unless you are a huge XCOM: Enemy Unknown fan, wait for a sale before buying this game. Right now it is an unpolished product that needs a lot of time and work before being worth full price.","March 1","false","58.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

This totaly ruins the already limited tactics you can apply.\n- The game freazes in cutscenes (e.g when the Advent reinforcements arrive, when you discover enemies etc.) and also randobly after totaly random turns. You have to wait minutes until the game gives you back control of your units.\n- The game crashes in cutscenes (e.g. when you destroy a Avatar base and  it explodes at the end of the mission)\n- Idiotic tutorial, it forces you to move in particular places on the map, forces you to make bad decisions and you loose soldiers. This not mentioning the fact that it does not explain anything useful. I played most of the XCOM series and it confused even me.\n- The aliens are overpowered even in the second level dificulty (Veteran), they hit you 90% of the time from insane distance, most of the time with critical (even if your troops are under full cover) and 80% of the time your troops panic.\n- Your troops suck, the sniper misses shots with 90% chance to hit 2 times in a row, the heavy never hits anything, so on so forth. The only good soldier is the ranger.\n- Another huge inconsistency that prooves the AI advantage over the player: Turrets. A hacked turret never hits anything even from almost melee range while a turret in AI control will hit you half way across the map evey time.\n\nI will stop with the examples here im sure there where other players mentioning these things in other posts.\n\nMy conclusion: - this game is not fulfilling his role as a recreation, is not fun, gives you no satisfaction, after playing and while playing it leaves you frustrated and with a very bad impresion.\n\nI know the difference between a complicated hardcore game and a really bad implemented one, this is the latter.\n\nUnless they fix it don't waste your money and time on it like I did.","March 18","false","31.7"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","2"

Okay.\n\nIf you enjoyed the latest reboot of XCOM, you will find more of the same in XCOM 2 - the difference being that they actually improved on the reboots original formula. The Overwatch is slightly more intelligent, the enemies more diverse, the strategies you can employ change a bit as well (especially with the "Concealment" factor) - there's new mechanics such as the "hacking" system which can give varied bonuses, and the new soldier classes are definitely more interesting (even introducing the first melee class in the Ranger) - they definitely feel much more interesting to play with.\n\nThis game however does move even further away from the base building focus, simplifying it even further from the first game - whether this is a pro or con really depends on your personal opinion of that aspect of the game (I enjoyed the classic XCOM's base building and invasion mechanics, the reboot's base building mechanics felt a bit tacked on, and XCOM2's feel like a 'refined necessary evil' approach has been used - they're nice, but may be too simple)\n\nI like the direction they went with the storyline as well, making failure "canon" is an interesting leap very few games go with (Halflife being another big one) - that also leads to a lot of interesting story opportunities. It is also a nice play on the fact that XCOM is notorious for its difficulty (this game is a lot more fair than the original XCOM or its Reboot though, at some points could be considered a pinch too easy by some)\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed the original XCOM, this game is worth the asking price - if you just enjoy tactics games, I would probably wait for it to go on sale ( possibly 15-25% off ) - as it is still a very solid performer in that regard.","February 6","true","38.7"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebigblah/recommended/268500/","thebigblah","The Ultimate Potato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebigblah/","120 products in account","I thought long and hard about this, but I came to the same conclusion as everyone else.\n\nXCOM2 is a very good, although unfinished game. It's funny to have to call it unfinished seeing how it is basically the exact same thing as XCOM1, running on the same engine, and fundamentally with the same gameplay, albeit with sensible balance improvements. What's new?\n\nThe base is now a spaceship that flies around the map. Instead of building satellites, you build radio towers to gain region bonuses. Regions can be destroyed by terror missions, but you can rebuild them.\nEverything has a time limit. Even the map has a time limit. Each month the aliens get +1 victory progress or something like that. You have to take these points away by destroying alien factories. Almost every mission has a turn limit, so no camping.\nThree monthly random events, only one of which can be stopped. Lowered income, aliens get poison bullets for a month, more alien reinforcements for a month, +1 alien victory progress etc.\nProcedurally generated & fully destructible maps.\nProving Grounds (AKA foundry) projects are now random.\nThere's a building that lets you respec soldiers or train rookies as a specific class.\nA significant increase in customization options\nWeapon upgrades\nConcealment\nThese are very welcome and well thought-out mechanics, but it's also where the praise runs out. XCOM2 has all the glitches XCOM1 had, and then some. The optimization is absolutely pathetic - this game has higher requirements than GTA5 and unplayable with any kind of anti-aliasing enabled. During the last mission there were so many enemies on screen that the game's engine kicked the bucket multiple times and gave epileptic textures requiring a reboot.\nThe action cam is an incredible drag as well. XCOM1 could handle rapid fire in one animation, but XCOM2 pauses the game twice. Or three, or four, or five times. This is ridiculous considering how many abilities let you shoot 3+ times per turn, and since it used to work on the same engine in 2012. It's basically like aircraft animations in Civ5.\nThe frequent loading screens approach 40 seconds in length, despite using an SSD drive. Also the stats and leaderboards don't work.\nOne thing to be particularly weary of is being able to destroy the floor underneath an enemy. It seems like a great idea, but it guarantees that enemy will be glitched out and freeze the game for 15 seconds each time it moves or shoots. It also guarantees a desync in multiplayer.\n\nSpeaking of which, most disappointing of all is by far the multiplayer. It comes with questionable limitations (only 2 types of each class as opposed to 5, cannot choose weapons, cannot choose armour, not even half of the utility items are available, no PCS, no deep pockets etc.) These are the gameplay aspects. Gameplay aspects, however, do not matter if you can't play the game.\nOnce again, in this third installment, the multiplayer an unplayable and completely broken mess.. It is beyond unstable. It is even worse than EW, which, in turn, was worse than EU. I have yet to finish a singe game without it collapsing under desyncs and glitches, and finally disconnecting. How hard can it be to do multiplayer in a turn-based game? Legacy XCOM had multiplayer over email for crying out loud. It's unacceptable to sell this game as "having multiplayer".\n\nBut enough of that. I was going to give a negative review for as long as the extremely high price coincided with technical issues, but ultimately I chose acquiescence. It's a good game with tons of fantastic little flavours you won't notice, extensive moddability (!) and significantly improved balance (except for that one item). I'm sure that the modders will find a way to improve many completely of the broken aspects that the developers clearly didn't have time to finish.\n\nI'll admit that I was worried about XCOM2 being geared towards "a wider audience", with a huge amount of guaranteed hit, guaranteed miss, guaranteed protection, never trigger overwatch, mind control lasts for ever and other such items & abilities, but they pulled it off just fine, it wasn't as bad as I thought. Token black guy and woman of colour turned out to actually have a personality instead of being there as a strategic resource. Higher difficulty still has an insanely low margin for error. You will always be gradually losing over time. Sometimes a screwup will cost you a near guaranteed game over 3 hours later, but you won't know until then. Time limits work, but they feel like a lazy and artificial solution to mask the AI's shortcomings.\n\nXCOM2 will sell a lot of copies and make a lot of money. This means we'll see a lot more like it, and by that I mean games being released in an unfinished state. The complete lack of optimization feels like penny-pinching to maximise profits at release, while ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off a lot of people in the long term. The "multiplayer" is blatant false advertising, there is no multiplayer. Personally, I am disappointed and would probably write a negative review if I paid more than I did.\n\nYou will have to ask yourself whether the couple of bullet points above are worth the incredibly hefty price tag. As with all Firaxis titles, it is a questionable purchase until an expansion comes out.","February 16","true","62.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

If you were a fan of the last reboot, and are wondering about whether or not to get this game, read this review!\n\nYou start most missions in concealed mode, which allows you to creep around the maps and set up an ambush. In this mode, Overwatch no longer has an aim penalty, so you could set all of your soldiers but one on Overwatch, and have the last one attack, or run out in the open to trigger a 'pod'. (Group of enemies that are just stood there) Once triggered, they will most likely run for cover, and your soldiers will shoot them.\n\nConcealed mode is an interesting addition, but during the timed missions, where you are given 8 turns to complete the objective, or you fail the mission, you cant really be messing around slowly setting up an ambush to deal with the enemies. In this way, the game comes accross as having multiple personality disorder. Because of the new abilities the aliens have, you have to be very careful, running away and looking for cover. But because of the round timers that the developers have, you have to be very fast, making sure to get there on time. The developers also saw fit to remove the ability to 'dash' to a door or objective and activate it in the same turn. That means that you have to move there, and use your second action point to activate the objective, or dash there, and activate it on the next turn. Nearly all of the 8 turn missions I have attempted have been failed with one soldier standing right next to them, ready to activate it! FOR GOODNESS SAKES! I failed 8 missions in the campain, and completed 4, (some of them tutorial missions) on the easy difficulty, even though I have played the other game on impossible.\n\nThe aliens themselves have also been given much more power. Sectoids can now mind control, and appear just as early in the game as the last one. In the last game, only Sectoid Commanders could mind control, and you didn't encounter them until much later, when the research your scientists had done allowed you to manufacture advanced armours and weapons that leveled the playing field. Not only that, but Sectoids can also now raise the dead. So if one of your soldiers is unlucky (Literally, since the game is based around pseudo-random hit chances more than ever before...) not only does it hurt because you can attack the enemy once less per turn, but also it hurts because they can attack you once more per turn!  Killing the offending Sectoid will kill all the zombies as well though, but unfortunatly, it is rare that you encounter a Sectoid all on it's own. It is often accompanied by a pair of 'stun' troopers. These aliens are also encountered early in the game, and can dash AND melee attack your troops in the same move! Not only that, but they have a high chance to stun your troops, robbing them of their next move. It is hard to run away from these troops AND reach the objectives in time. Not only that, but while you run away for more cover, which is the only strategy in these Xcom reboots (everything else is random, positioning is the only certainty (and suppresion /explosives )...) you will invariably trigger another pod of deadly aliens, which will surely slaughter your entire team in the next go.\n\nWhat is also poorly explained, and completely ruined, is the geoscape. In the last game, you were given clear goals of what to do next, or what decisions you could afford to make. In this game, Everything is random. There are 11 continental perks, but there are only 6 continents. The game randomly picks your starting position, randomly picks 6 perks out of the 11 in the game, and randomly gives each continent one of those perks. I started in New India, in Asia.\n\nIn the last game, you had a scan button, which would advance time. In this game, there are Scan buttons located all over the map. These buttons are essentially like bars, that get filled up as you choose to scan at that location, instead of another. once you have scanned it empty, you get the reward from it, what ever that was. Now, instead of monthly funding, every month, the funds you would have got are put down on the map somewhere, and need to be scanned for three days. You also need to build communications centers in your base to be able to contact more regions, and the regions are contacted in linear order.\nResearch and base management works the same, with a list of upcomming events that get completed as you scan in the map. Manufacturing works similarly, but now once you have manufactured certain items (Like armour or weapons) You only need to manufacture one, and every troop can have one.\n\nThere are certain missions in the game which advance the 'Advent' bar until completed, which when full, ends the game.  These missions don't disapear after a day like the others, and can be attacked at anytime. But only if you have contact with the continent that it is located in. So if you dont have access to that mission, you will have to build a communications center. But if you don't have enough power, you will need to build a power plant. But if you don't have enough money to do that, you will need to scan around to get some. While scanning, there is a risk a pick two, or pick three mission will pop up. You can choose to ignore it if you want, but there are 2 or 3 negatives associated with each of those missions, such as all enemies will have armour for the next month, or your funding will be cut in half next month. You can only pick one of those missions, and the other two negatives will happen anyway. But it will be difficult to beat those missions, with the new timer mechanics, and unfair enemy powers. If you dont have enough time to wait for all the building either way, then you will lose the game.\n\nThere is no way to play the game like the last one in my opinion. Now, instead of being able to start a new playthrough and put on Ironman/Impossible, and follow through with a certain strategy you have been working on, the game does everything\nrandomly, making it so you go in blind everytime. The old rules still apply to a deggree, elevation is good, blow up their cover, run away if you can to a more secure location, focus fire etc etc.\n\nBut all of those rules go out of the window randomly. You rely on cover? Well what about if one of the humans running around on the map randomly turns into a giant monster, that can walk up to your soldier on a balcony, and swipe it's claws, and completely destroy the building your team is stood on, in one move? You always know you can run away from the aliens to secure a much better environmental advantage, like higher cover or a vantage point? Aww, well, too bad, you got a mission that expects you to kill 10 aliens and hack the box in 8 turns, with four rookies, and devastating consequences for failure.\n\n\nThere are some positives though:\n\nThey fixed the mouse lag, making for a much more enjoyable user experience. The game also runs well for me on my old rig, so I don't know why some users are reporting performance issues, but it may be a driver issue or something. The game looks pretty good as well. The game features well done randomly generated maps. The designs, the music, the sound are all great! One great moment I recall was a grenade knocking a soldier into a train, only to have a 'BANG' play, as his body hit the metal train! xD The game is also much more snappier than before, it's very responsive and less time-wastie to give orders and pan the camera. The game world and designs ooze atmosphere also.\n\nThe tactical randomness lets the game down imo. You shouldn't have to mod the game to give you one or two more turns, that's something the developers should have anticipated.","March 18","false","91.7"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

Once modded the gameplay was amazing. Especially with the Long War mod.\n\nYes, there were still some things wrong with the predecessor, even after modding.\n\nBut to call XCOM2 'weak' would really be a shame.\nBecause that would waste the perfect application of the term 'abysmal' for this game.\n\nWhy?\n\n\n1) The actual premise of shooting down UFOs (that's were the series came from, guys, it was originally called "UFO: Enemy Unknown") was totally and completely removed from the game.\n\nNo more figher planes, no more interceptors, nothing. Simply gone.\nThat's like taking city building out of Civilization. Stupid. Game breaking for me.\n\n\n2) The premise of a small resistance group being able to do what it does in the game is totally ludicruous.\nBut hey, it's sci-fi, it doesn't have to follow logic, right?\n\nWrong.\nFor something that has turned into a terribly stupid economy- and turn-based-combat simulator the game logic is utterly ludicrous again.\n\nEVERYONE on the combat map suddenly becomes visible if even ONE soldier is spotted makes for some totally immersion-breaking moments EACH AND EVERY COMBAT MISSION. Why would I keep someone back from the frontlines only to have him suddenly become a target when somebody else who is nearly a mile away is spotted is beyond me.\n\nBecause now there is NO CHANCE WHATSOEVER of leading the enemies on a wild goose chase by fleeing (visibly) with one soldier and dragging them behind me while the rest of the stealthed team moves in on the mission target. No chance for this basic maneuver. Due to some total balloney BS of a game logic.\n\n\nStrategic map:\nYeah, ADVENT is in control of the world, we get it.\nWe don't know anyone around the world who opposes them except our own little group. But we were the greatest force to oppose the aliens 20 years ago. Now we are nothing but a powerless group of gimps trying to get a F'ING HUGE ALIEN SHIP to fly again. Yeah, great logic.\n\nWhile we, as the resistance group on the 'strategic map' (hah, what is strategic about it, can anyone tell me?!?) can't simply broadcast on short-wave radio across the globe to simultaneously reach ALL resistance groups at once. Especially with a damn f'ing huge alien ship (where did it come from, anyway?) can't do a little radio building of our own.\n\nNaaah, too logical. Nah, can't be done.\nSorry. Stupid logic does not trump sci-fi based logic.\n\nThis list could go on for quite a few pages.\n\n\n3) A random number generator that generates a new roll every time the game is reloaded but still (and I checked) fails to come up with a number below 43% (which at that time was my chance to hack a heavy advent mec) after 50 (FIFTY) attempts is not a random number generator. Something is fixed there.\n\nOr my four failed attempts to successfully apply a dead-eye shot with a final adjusted to-hit percentage of 94% with my plasma sniper rifle, a superior scope, the aiming PCS, and tracer rounds.\nYeah, very very likely, that chance.\n\nNuff said, otherwise I'm gonna go random on some developer's a$$.\n\n\n4) A tech tree that is so shallow that you can have it finished after a mere two months game time?\n\nMerely three weapon groups (basic, magnetic, plasma). No more laser, no more REASON to have different weapons. Once you reach plasma the end is reached. No more advancement, not even the slightest increment after that. No matter how many scientists you have. No chance to apply your possibly dozens of scientists to upgrading the clip sizes, or the ranges, or the damage, or... or... or...\nNothing.\n\nEspecially the ludicrous game logic of loading electorinic warfare bluescreen BULLETS into a PLASMA rifle.\nShouldn't the PLASMA rifle fire PLASMA?\nWhich is a super-heated stated of atomic nuclei stripped of their electrons (therefore being UNABLE TO BE A BULLET ANYMORE BECAUSE THERE IS NO MORE MOLECULAR COHESION?)\n\nStill only ONE grenade for every soldier except the grenadier who can (hold your breath) carry at best FOUR grenades.\nWOW! Now that is one hell of a grenadier, right? Especially as he carries an ancient ONE-SHOT grenade launcher design from around the 1940's. Wow, now that is really modern tech, isn't it?\n\nStill only ONE ammo type for each soldier. No choices of changing ammo during the mission.\n\nNo mecs, no cyber-units. Upgrading of specified soldiers abilities of totally boring two choices each level.\nNo adjustability AFTER the fact.\nOnce you pick, you are stuck with it, even when the choice you made turned out to be totally useless (and trust me, there are quite a few really useless abilities in the game, such as all pistol skills for the snipers.)\n\nNo useful avenger upgrades except those 16 few vertical slots. Again, a flat side-view.\nScientists and engineers with as much personality as an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nWho would have thought that the original UFO: Enemy Unknown would still have a better base building technique than a game 20 years younger? Not better graphics, no, butter a much more intersting premise.\n\nAnyone still remember the 3d- building slots that allowed you to lay out your own base in the original game?\nWith defensive stations that actually did something useful instead of simply upgrading your theoretical defenses.\n\nEspecially because after the first UFO was evaded in this game I never ever saw another UFO again during my whole game. So what do I need those stupid defense stations for?\nBoooooring. Snooze-fest!\n\n\n5) A ranged game that has absolutely useless ranges for their weapons.\nMany weapons have the problem of being barely able to clear a street -across, not lengthwise.\nSometimes you have problems of shooting across a room, as that already seems to be beyond the acceptable range for some weapons BECAUSE YOU ALREADY GAIN RANGE PENALTIES FOR IT!\nEven the sniper rifle is barely able to shoot along a street, much less along a street block of three houses.\n\nCome on, my slingshot at home has a greater range (and probably damage) than that stupid sniper rifle.\n\nDito for other classes.\n\nThe Ranger class that has amazing cinematographics for the first few times they strike down an enemy. After that the enemies become far too tough for that stupid useless toothpick of even the most advanced swordtype to do squat against virtually any enemy except the weakest. And the Ranger's shotgun requires the Ranger to be almost on top of the enemy.\n\nYeaaaah, great. Why not give me a spear and a sling with stones. Maybe I would actually get a better range with that than with my shotgun.\n\nPsionic soldiers, errr operatives, that require a clear view of the enemy AND also nearly have to be up close and personal. Blaargh.\n\nNah, don't make me go into more detail.\nThe ranges and even the best upgrades in the tech tree totally suck.\n\n\n6) Bugs and balancing issues still riddle this crash fest of a game.\nI don't know how often the game crashed during my one play-thru. But I lost count at around 30.\n\nWhen did Firaxis subscribe to the current gaming industry standard of releasing seriously unfinished and untested product?\n\n\n7) And finally, an ending that was so anti-climactic that it nearly put me to sleep.\nOh boy, are you guys gonna be surprised the first time you see it.\n\nIt probably was one of the worst endings in the full UFO series I have ever seen.\nNah, not worth it.\n\nForget about this game. Maybe when, or rather IF, some of the Long War modders have finalized a full game overhaul of the complete logic then you might consider this game.\nBut only once this game has landed in the bargain bin of Steam.\nCause I wouldn't pay $10 for it in its currents state.\n\nBut even the most amazing mod won't bring interceptors back again.\n\nSad, sad state of afairs for the gaming industry.","March 23","false","43.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

As an example they've added the ability to actually see if you have a line of sight on the enemies so that you wont have to worry about it when moving around.\n\n+ The new system in which you spawn invisible to the enemies makes the first part of every map more enjoyable because it means you're setting up ambushes instead of hoping for good rng with the pod openings.\n\n+ I for one like the new base building system even if it at first glance might look dumbed down. It feels like you wont have to play a certain way IE follow a certain building line that was always the same no matter what.\n\n+ So far the enemies have been fun and rewarding to face, and I'm eager to see what they will throw at me for the rest of the game.\n\n* Some graphical glitches like weapons or enemies clipping trough walls, pretty much the same as the previous game. It doesn't affect game play unless you really care about graphics.\n\n* Difficulty has been scaled down and it feels like if you would play on a difficulty level under commander(classic) it would probably be really easy compared to the previous game.\n\n- The AI has a habit of some times running into really stupid positions. As an example I've had two occasions now where AI ran into cars that exploded the next round, instantly killing them. Not sure if intented but I doubt it.\n\n- Terrible optimization makes the menu, cutscenes and base almost unplayable. I don't know if this is a common issue but my rig should easily be able to handle this on even the highest graphics. Luckily since it's a turn based game it doesn't affect game play that much.\n\nEasily recommend the game for now!\n\nFirst mission for anyone intrested:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X6rjDwqz30","February 4","true","21.8"," 31 of 58 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","31","58","0","0"

The amount of RNG (which on it's own is fine), combined with new status effects that essentially render your soldiers completely ineffective for a turn (and the sheer number the enemy can deploy them on you) can quickly render entire missions impossible to complete within the first turn of combat, potentially forcing you to reload the same mission over and over.\n\nAnimations in combat take forever and sometimes pause for a second or two afterwards for no clear reason, completely removing the sharp and snappy combat aesthetic they were aiming for and making battles take forever. The camera seems to snap all over the place for no good reason, even occassionally missing important enemy moves, and if I have to see that pointing animation one more time I don't know what I'll do.\n\nThe stealth system, while a nice addition, seems a bit ad-hoc and doesn't seem to explore its own potential fully. I'm not sure how I'd change it up but currently it just feels lacking.\n\nThe additions to the overworld gameplay are really fun and add a lot to the game, the more guerilla style warfare gives XCOM 2 a suitably refreshing style change from 1 and I think it's the overworld that's the strongest part of the game. However, that doesn't really translate to the battle gameplay.\n\nAdditionally, I'll be the first to admit my machine isn't top of the line (or even all that good anymore) but the amount of variation in the framerate, even with graphics settings dialled down from recommended only increase the frustration of trying to play this further.\n\nIn conclusion, a promising game sorely let down by some terrible design decisions for the battle system that would turn an otherwise fun game into a mess of frustration and disappointment. A real shame, as XCOM 1 is among my higher rated games.","March 23","false","15.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

For a game that was priced at $60 ( $80 for dlc), the amount of bugs is not worth it. Thank god for all the sales that are going on at this time, but even then I would say it is not worth it for how unpolished this is.

The gameplay in this one is even better with some annoying things gone such as the having to upgrade your own airships to takedown enemy cruisers, the new aliens are an interesting change. I wish they included more avatars for the later missions though rather than having only 4 in the entire game. The beginning is definitely challenging because you're limited on men and the aliens are so brutal, the mid game is kinda meh, and then the late game is a joke because if you research right and manage can manage your positioning you could take out hoards of aliens with ease especially when you get the soldiers with the right abilities.

Seriously, this game desperately needs some optimisation.\nAnd I get it: As a resistance you have to operate on a time limit but the constant turn timers force you into a certain play style. Gone are the days when you could position your soldiers for maximum effect. Snipers almost are a redundant class. Streamlining is one thing in a game. It is another matter entirely to artificially inject a sense of urgency with game play mechanics limiting your range of tactical choices. Thanks to some quick modders you can now set up longer timers or remove them entirely from the game which basically is a bloody cop out. The devs simply included too many of those timer missions early in the game which is rather unfortunate because that's when your squads are at their weakest compared to the alien opposition. Any mistake in keeping up concealment is punished mercilessly by this game. So you find yourself inching forward with the waypoint movement system. Even worse, this whole system of forcing you into quick movement tactics is counterproductive when you reach later stages of the game. The key story missions don't have timers and you'd be well advised to dust of your old EU skills of slowly advancing your front line.\nSo what's the bottom line? Well, XCom 2 is a good game at least in theory. The enemies are varied and each species presents their own specific challenge. The timers are bloody annoying but you can get used to them. The real problems come from the bugs in this game. When you see your squad go to hell in an ironman game because one of those snake creatures can pull your soldier through a door and two floors, then you feel your frustration level rising because you were not defeated by a bad move but by a bad game engine. Sure, with some experience you learn to expect certain bugs and work around them but a truely excellent game would not force me to reserve some head space in order to avoid problems which shouldn't be in the game to begin with.\n\npros:\n\n- interesting and varied enemies\n- a real tactical challenge\n- a good UI\n- a competent AI\n- tons of customization options\n- compared to XCom 1 a greater choice in missions\n- steep learning curve as the game is brutally unforgiving (if you want a challenge)\n\ncons:\n\n- still some performance issues\n- still some glitches especially with the detection and line-of-sight system\n- the game forces you to adopt a certain playstyle in order to succeed (at least early in the game)\n- melee enemies have unbelievable range\n- steep learning curve as the game is brutally unforgiving (if you are new to the game)","February 5","true","43.9"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","1"

So here it is:\n\nGOOD\n* There's always something to do, whether it's an operation or simple supplies gathering. No more boring weeks with nothing on the hologlobe\n* Nice visuals and cut-scenes. It was a strong point of Enemy Unknown/Within and they don't disappoint in this area.\n* Variety of mission types. No more "kill all the enemies to complete objective". Now you have to do something more than that\n* Character pool and customizations. It was always about soldiers and I'm glad they improved those options.\n* Weapon mods\n* Interesting and good-looking enemies\n* More random maps with some interactive features (aiming at explosive things, soldiers appearing as WANTED on holo-ads)\n* Badass Bradford\n* More 'progression' objectives\n* Very nice soundtrack\n\nBAD\n* Poor optimization, graphic glitches, freezes, long loading screens etc.\n* Avatar progresses too fast, without good planning you'll end up lagging behind\n* Too big reliance on explosives. You'll end up grabbing more Frag Grenades than any other items, despite wide selection of them\n* Poor chemistry between Tygan & Shen. Remember Vahlen and Shen senior? It's not even close to those funny taunts and conversations.\n* No more individual weapon creation. Now you grab one and it's available for all your soldiers.\n* Still 3 tiers of weaponry/armours. It may appeal to vanilla XCOM players but after Long War, it's a downgrade.\n* Concealment mechanics could be improved (e.g. you re-enter the concealment after few turns without enemy in range)\n* Timed missions force you to go straight to the point, with enemies always on your path. You lose the advantage of the map design, since you can't wander around.\n\nOVERALL:\nStrongly recommended despite minor flaws.

I never did this in any other previous chapter of XCOM or UFO.\n\nBut what I hated the most, was the complete lack of freedom of the original UFO series which is definitely lost: you have to follow the plot that the devs have planned for you, no matter what.\n\nThis used to be a great game about tactics, resource managing and freedom of choice.\nAll of this is dead now, what is left is a very standard mainstream game, with good techical programming and very poor gameplay.\n\nI am SO disappointed.","March 24","false","9.9"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

A lot of the problems i had with XCOM:EU and EW are fixed here. The streamlined base building mechanics are also welcome over the confusing layouts in Enemy Unknown. The character customization is also very detailed, allowing you to create lookalikes of your friends as well as yourself. The story is genuinely interesting too, with the concept of Aliens runnning an oppressive government executed quite well, with high-quality cinematics too.\n\nHowever, the technical problems are very much present. Various animation glitches, crashes, terrain disappearing, aliens taking too long to respond in a turn, framerate drops etc. If this wasn't a turn-based game, i would have stopped playing a long time ago. i ran this game on an Intel 3970x @ 3.9 Ghz, 2x GTX 970s, 16gigs of RAM and the game running off a high-speed SSD, and the performance was pretty much the same, irrespective of whether SLI was on or off. And by that i mean the game runs poorly regardless of whether sli is on/off.\n\nIn it's current state, i cannot recommend this game. My advice for a potential customer would be to wait until the problems have been ironed out before picking this up. Or maybe wait for a sale.","March 13","false","49.3"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","3"

Quick firefights and edge of the seat action. (Even within the first few hours.) This is my review of XCOM 2, on the day of launch. I'll likely edit this review as I encounter new things and form new opinions. For a list of current pros/cons scroll to the bottom.\n\nI've gotten the feel for this next installment of the game, and I have to say it plays well. Stealth is now a thing, using grenades to do more than just killing enemies and the character customization... oh man. It's exceedingly in-depth for any sort of shooter. In the first hour, I infiltrated a base, discovered a bit of lore, felt badass, and got my ♥♥♥ kicked. The game is unforgiving of any mistakes. But not so where it'd lead you to believe that the AI has cheated. The flanking and stealth systems will be a constant feature that'll be utilized by all players if they want to survive the higher difficulties. Moving your troops to the right side of cover, knowing when to fall back, and how to advance efficiently and not be taken out by a single grenade.\n\nThe game has gorgeous graphics and is textured amazingly well. I can see the height of the grass compared to the curb it's right above, and I can see the stress on the faces of the soldiers. It's brought back the whole "command center" from the previous games, with a bit of a twist. New characters are introduced, and new bonds are made right off the bat. The voice acting is solid, and I haven't heard "Rodger dodger" once yet.\n\nNow onto a bit of a negative aspect of the game. Though I can run the game on near max, and get 60fps the game has very poor optimization in the sense that I should be running it much stronger than it's letting me. I.e. can run the game awesome in combat, but I can lag in the command center. I feel it should've been the other way around if anything.\n\nModders rejoice! Remember how in the last one it was really awkward to mod? Had to basically move the folder out of the steam directory, change the read-only or what have you? Now it's all integrated with the workshop, and there are already some items released for it! (There were some before the game even launched actually.) There's also an ini file that you can easily change the entire game with. Basically, every setting that the game has, you can change there. Wanna have an unforgiving war where if you don't get the jump on enemies you lose? Sure! Wanna play with aliens that are as gentle as a kitten? Certainly.\n\nPROS\nHighly moddable.\nCan jump into your save at any point without losing immersion.\nGorgeous game.\nEven the first few hours of the game are on the edge of your seat.\nCharacter customizability.\nLack of noticeable game breaking bugs. Even at launch.\n\nCONS\nPoor optimization.\nMinor bugs i.e. rarely a troop will shoot facing the wrong way.","February 5","true","3.9"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","2"

Time to go after their UFO landings, shoot up everything that comes out of them, and eventually go find some weird aliens with strange psionic powers.\n\nWait... I lost the war? WHAT DO YOU MEAN I LOST THE WAR? I HAVE 100% COMPLETION IN XCOM ENEMY UNKNOWN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nAnyway XCOM 2 is both similar and different to it's predecessor. Similar because much of the gameplay mechanics are the same. You build and research stuff at yer home back, go out to beat up aliens on turn-based tactical maps, then return to yer base to look at all the alien goodies you captures and see if you can learn to make fancier toys to use against them. Different because, well, you lost the last war somehow and the aliens now rule the world, so now you get to be a GORILLA instead of the leader of a multinational special forces unit.\n\nThe change in circumstances is shown quite nicely. Since you are the "attacker" this time, you always have targets to go after and places to go in order to help improve your resistance network. However, it also feels like you are pretty much always starved for resources and forced to make do with whatever you can scrounge together. Eventually this means, of course, that you will scrounge together some power armor and plasma weeapons, but that felt earned after dozens of battles where the technological odds were heavily stacked against me and I had to overcome the foe with superior strategy... or just legging it for the escape area if it was one of those kinds of missions. XD\n\nI'm going to play this game some more because there are achievements to unlock and more aliens to shoot and blow up. Also because, well, I had lots of funs doing it. Yes, it's very similar to it's precessor, but enough is different that it feels like a different game with a new experience, rather than just a remake of a proven success.\n\nAlso you can decorate your characters to look completely silly. That's a nice bonus and even adds to the "guerilla" feel of the war you are fighting. Not everyone is going to be dressed up the same like it was some regular army, after all. Therefore, it is perfectly ok to lead your armies into battle under command of the moustached fellow with  a pink hat, purple clothes, and a yellow assault rifle! :P\n\nHave funs!

Although in XCOM 2 the desperation is palpable, all of EARTH is occupied by the Alien menace that now uses human/alien hybrids called the "Advent". Right away the action is reminiscent of the original, which is a good thing! Each action looks like a short film, the firing of the rifles is absolutely beautiful, only multiplied by a rib crunching strike against an enemy trooper. XCOM 2 also puts alot of emphasis on the psychic and psionic threat of the aliens. While you may be safe at a distance from being turned into purple jelly by a plasma ray, an advanced alien might use a technique to make you panic, running maniacally into the enemy only to be slaughtered at close range.\n\nIve notice some people had complaints about lag, the only times I noticed the lag issues where in the pod before a mission, and I am hoping 2k can quickly solve this problem. Also the loading between each members turn can take awhile. This game has a much more "Guerilla" feel, you are trying to create a resistance team to finally crush the alien race. Did I mention Lore? Lore Lore Lore, especially if you were a fan of the last game this one will have you drooling at the mouth.\n\n9/10 Great Job!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKxJkkNVCj8","February 5","true","7.2"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","1"

They are currently in control of everything. XCOM is njow little more than a  small group of freedomfighters, with very little to their name. The goal is to stop abductions, overthrow the aliens, and get the cake. Although not a very innovative story, it is certainly interesting enough to keep you hooked.\n\nFiraxis have let the story show through in some of its game mechanics-in both good and bad ways.  You are constantly on a timer, meaning you have to prioritize production of gear, research and facilities well. You may alos find yourself abandoning areas of the world to help out another. Every choice feels important, and this really helps carry the story forward.\n\nOn the flipside of the coin however we have the idea of timed missions. In XCOM I enjoyed them as a nice little break from the normally slow phasing, But in this game they have taken it to the extreme. Practically every mission have some sort of mission timer, usually 8 or 12 rounds, but sometimes also 6, or via the use of a "dont let the aliens blow up the computer" mechanic.\nThese timers are extremelly short for what you need to do, and you often find yourself forced to double move into unknown territories, just to keep up with the timer. This means you cant really react to what you find, and there's a big chance you put yourself in a flank. This mechanic would've been fine if Firaxis added a few turns  on each mission, but as it stand it is just infuriating.\n\nThe game is also extremelly buggy. there are countless amounts of visual glitches, such as bladestorming a Viper as he is entangling you causing you to be stuck in the entangled animation for the rest of the mission, or falling through a recently blown up floor causing you to lose all your animations every once in a while. The list of minor bugs can go on practically forever. This however was probably anticipated as we saw similar issues with the release of XCOM.  There are however several game breaking bugs, such as falling through roofs and getting stuck in an enviromental piece, doors on the final mission not opening, or certain enemies on the final mission warping off the map.\n\nEnemy design is overall great. All enemies have a counterplay (although cryssalids are extremelly infuriating and not enjoyable in any way), and they all look great. They have all evolved in some way since XCOM, and it's always enjoyable to see Firaxis keeping their story at heart.\n\nThe gameplay itself is just what you'd expect from XCOM, and with the exception of the timer, and classes being reworked it is near identical. The missions have different goals, and the game focuses more on destruction of cover.\n\n\nIn short: The game is enjoyable, it plays mostly like XCOM EU/EW. It does have a glaring issue in the form of the mission timer, and it is absolutelly littered with bugs.  If you can overlook these two issues you will have a blast.","February 9","true","40.8"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

The XCOM project is still alive though and is trying to mount a resistance movement to find out the aliens' true agenda before overthrowing their government.\nThe game is both an overhaul and a refinement of its predecessor and stands out as the finest XCOM game in recent times despite a shaky release.\n\nPROS:\n\n-the overall graphics are pretty good with nice effects and animations\n\n-good soundtrack\n\n-while pretty cliched the plot flows well and there'd a decent amount of mistery behind the aliens' plans\n\n-the new resistance-styled XCOM really has alot of character and charm\n\n-still sports some top notch turn-based tactical combat made even better by added mission types and better level randomization\n\n-the concealment mechanics are truly superb and provide good tactical depth\n\n-new soldier classes are excellent and great to use: said soldiers are also fully customizable in their looks, voice, stance etc\n\n-moddable weapons are fun\n\n-new alien types are quite interesting and can surprise you with some new abilities, their design and animations are also great\n\n-good length, each campaign'd last you at least 20/30 hours\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n-timed missions can be challenging or annoying, also depending on personal taste: still there's mods to make timers longer or remove them altogether\n\n-some missions can feel a bit unfair in regards to the amount of enemies thrown at you\n\nCONS:\n\n-uneven performance\n\n-long loading times\n\n-some line of sight bugs (like through closed steel doors) can be annoying and ruin your tactics\n\n-camera can be problematic at times\n\n-still has several bugs (a few crashes, audio desync in cutscenes, envirnment destroying itself for no reason etc...)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=629612335\n\nGoing from a worldwide funded organization to a small resistance movement is quite a change and while I wasn't fully convinced at first I must say it works perfectly: you'll feel like a guerrilla squad operating behind enemy lines, facing overwhelming odds and slowly turning into a truly badass spec ops squad as time goes by and promotions mount up.\n\nThe new mechanics Firaxis introduced provide an overall better game experience both in the field- with concealment letting you decide when and how to start going guns blazing, soldier skills providing many ways to get the upper hand over the aliens and synergizing well with each other, etc- and in the geoscape view- with mutually excluding missions prodiving different bonuses and drawbacks, POIs to explore, the Avenger to rebuild and so on. There's just so much to do, most of it is fun and well-designed and the game's brand of challenging, deep combat is simply as outstanding as it is engaging.\n\nThere's a few dents into this great game sadly and most of them are due to a shaky release. There's some line of sight bugs where you can be discovered through solid walls and closed doors,a few AI hitches, shaky framerate, some jarring problems with audio in cutscenes getting messed up and the game can sometimes simply crash to desktop. Even after a patch things havn't improved too much so here's hoping Firaxis gets their act together and finally polish everything up.\n\nEven with all its blemishes XCOM 2 is simply an impressive entry in the franchise and a must buy for both long-time fans and newcomers: it's that good and it's only going to get better through patches, mods and DLCs.","February 23","true","23.2"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","18","33","2","0"

XCOM 2 simply isn't fun to play anymore at the later stage of the game. The game is very unforgiving, and brutal which is fine. However, it also doesn't balance the risk/reward of the game well. Often we are forced to risk the lives of our soldiers for minimal gain, and if we fail, we lose much more than we can recover. This makes the game into a long and hard grind, and more often then not after a few hours of playing I stop because the game just makes me tired and frustrated at it.\n\nFrustating Issues:\n\nConstant Interuptions - The game makes us scan every thing for days to get anything done, and yet it constantly throws interuptions and urgent missions and all sorts of stuff at you whenever you try to get anything done. It forces the player's progress to slow to a crawl.\n\nAlways Outnumbered, Always Outgunned - The difficulty curve spikes insanely quickly after the first few missions, forcing us to always have to field high ranking soldiers if we want to have a chance at succeeding. Yet it makes it difficult to train Rookies, which in turn leaves us without a capable fighting force if we happen to lose our higher ranking troops. And we WILL lose them eventually.\n\nTimers - The game has too many missions with timers on them to play without the Disable Timers mod. Timers forces us to be reckless if we do not want to fail the mission, which in turn causes us to lose soldiers, which are expensive to replace.\n\nOverpowered Enemies Are Too Common - It's completely fine to have strong boss enemies. They make the gameplay fun and makes you feel rewarding when you manage to score a kill on them. One good example would be the first encouter with the Avatar. If done right, you could have your whole team fight the Avatar alone, and it made for some interesting and intense gameplay. However, one bad example would be the Sectopod. The first time meeting it was cool, but later on, the game simply spams the Sectopods and force you to fight one in almost every single mission, and they are often backed up by other units. By having these things be so common, it no longer a novelty to fight them. Instead it becomes a huge annoyance. Furthermore, some enemies are completely overpowered. Not only does the Sectopod have a insane amount of health, it gets to attack twice per turn AND overwatch after that. That is simply not fun. That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nSure, this game might appeal to the veteran hardcore XCOM fans out there, but as someone who just wants to enjoy the game, perhaps it'd be better if they left some of those things for the higher difficulties and made the lower difficulties easier. For now, it feels like the developers did not put any effort into balancing the game, and instead thought "How much can we frustrate and ♥♥♥♥ off our players so that they hate the game from now on?" and designed the game based on that.","March 8","false","38.1"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","18","33","0","0"

It might be salvagable with heavy modding or masive alterations. i would have prefered to give it a average revew but that is not possible here\n\nTHE BAD\n1.the only improvement they have made to the tactics is the timer (on arround 80% of the missions) that forces you to throw away tactics and simply run full pelt toowards the objective most of the time.\n\n2. enemys can shoot you and often do through solid walls and can see you no matter what the lines of sight are.\n\n3. Apart from the odd ocation the enemy runs away they are all predictably dumb following the same procedures no matter what the situation (most often heading to cover and shooting even if falling back would be better)\n\n4. The only time you can get a suprise round is at the beginning, and once that is done with as soon as you see an enemy they see you regardless of distance or positioning.\n\n5. These points mean that the combat is simply a re hash of x-com enemy unknown, with new units and equipment, and if you do not get the right resources on the world map you are totaly ruined. (no enginers when you need them ever)\n\n6. The huge amount of glitches, press the overwhatch button and fire at the enemy, press fire and reload. thankfully these dont happen that often. but the frame rate drops are horrible as well as the eternaly long load screens (The huge amount of time you spend watching your squad in the transport waiting to deploy is rediculous).\n\n7. Poor late game Story, The early story is good and brings you into the game well (play the tutorial mission) but the end game story tells you nothing, and explains even less. It is a blatent set up for anouther game or an expantion and ruins what little stroy there is.\n\nTHE GOOD\n1.

Potential masive potentioal, with steam workshop support from the off there is potential for the  combat issues t be fixed by comunity mods, and maybe if there is enough work make this the A Star game it could have been but only with a lot of wotk.\n\nIn conclution, this game is alright not worth the full asking price by a long shot, and not as fun as X-com enemy within/unknown, or as tactical as the long war mod for said game. the only redeaming feature is that it could be made into a good game but that is really it.","February 9","false","113.9"," 68 of 131 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","68","131","3","4"

Meta as ♥♥♥♥ !\n\nThe game is pretty much a refined version of the first one. If you only swear by the original trilogy and Xenonauts, you might be dissapointed. Still, there are some new nice features.\n\nWith no United Nations to back you up and Alien backed EXALT forces trying to hunt you down, the game flow is a little confusing at first. With your mobile base, you need to scan Earth's various regions to find supplies, troops and more importantly make contact with local resistance cells. This new version of the satelite coverage will become crucial as you try to thwart ADVENTs plans. Indeed, the aliens have an endgame, a doomsday counter called "The Avatar Project", which can't be stopped. It's scarier than it looks as completing story objectives and blowing up facilities will slow its progress drastically.\n\nApart from the cosmetic lifting and the guerilla vibe, two features I really loved are the global revamp of the soldier classes and the concealment system. Every class is back but with a new edge, assaults get a melee machete, supports a cool robot, snipers become gunslingers, etc. It's such a great way to spice up the existing classes and make them much more polyvalent. Since XCOM is now a guerilla warfare operation, every mission makes you start hidden. It's up to you to spot enemies and ambush them WHEN you want it. It's a great way to set up a mission, especially since most of them are now timer-based.\n\nI don't have many problems with the game. The sad motto "Don't spot enemies on your last turn movement is still up or you are ♥♥♥♥ed" is still true and some enemies are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (like the lancers). But most of these complains will probably be answered by a "git gud, f4gg4t".\n\nThe unsung hero of the game is probably Tim Wynn, the new composer. I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at first that McCann didn't make the new score but now I realize it's for the best. XCOM was about mystery and unseen threats which matched the music perfectly. XCOM 2 is all about solemnity and the unshattered pugnacity of humanity. Music is so good it made me swallow a thesaurus.\n\ntl, dr: It's a new version of XCOM 2k12 with cool enemies, tons of customization and MOD supports.","February 10","true","31.0"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","24","45","0","0"

I purchased on launch and my experience has been very smooth. I have a mid to high-end computer and the game runs flawlessly. I did experience some crashing but it happens infrequently. Users with low-end PCs may have issues until the game is better optimized.\n\nThe biggest change that players seem to be complaining about is the timer. The whole campaign is basically on a timer and you have limited time to research, make contacts and hunt down supplies as there are constant alien interruptions. You would think the aliens would have the courtesy to leave me alone for 11 days while I research the plasma rifle that is going to triple their losses in battle. How dare they try to prevent me from destroying their race. All kidding aside, I enjoyed this mechanic as it forces you to make the most of the time you have available and doesn't allow you to rush through the research and create early super soldiers. There are many ways offered to halt and reverse the progress the aliens make essentially giving you more time for your own activities.\n\nThe only real flaw (and it is a major one, in my opinion) of the game is the RNG, or more specifically the in-game indicators of RNG are completely inaccurate and frankly, make no sense. I seem to hit more often with 43% chance than I do with 91% chance. The terrain also effects hit chance in a really weird way and the whole cover system seems to be broken.\n\nOverall I'm 18 hours in and having a blast. I'll freely admit I've re-run some missions that have gone poorly for me in order to minimize the loss of a favored soldier, but half the fun in my opinion is seeing what happens differently during a mission by taking various actions.","February 14","true","29.9"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","24","45","2","2"

The first game was really good and its expansion gave you more to do with the original game.  Without a doubt this game is... more of the same thing.  Which isn't necessarily bad.  It's different which allows you to play differently, but for the most part it's the same thing.\n\nMany of the enemies have had stats adjusted and have been reskinned, but for the most part all of the enemies are the same.  Some enemies can burrow now.  They've added stuns as a mechanic in the game.  They've removed some moves from some units and given some new ones to new ones.  The enemy unit composition although feels different, is roughly the same.\n\nInstead of having to worry about managing countries and slowly losing monetary support from countries you're instead building up a resistence network and can only lose support if you lose a defense mission for that area.  To keep you entertained there are 'pick ups' on the map that you can pick up over time while waiting for enemy attacks or waiting to progress down the rabbit hole of the game's storyline.\n\nI think if you've played XCOM before this game is worth picking up.  If you haven't played XCOM before you might want to just pick up XCOM instead and perhaps pick up this one after you're done with the first.","February 13","true","56.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

XCOM EU and EW are only slightly better in my opinion and that is for the few things I don't like about this game. The game feels similar to EU while simultaneously bringing a lot of new and interesting ideas to the table to keep the concept fairly fresh. Now on to the few things I don't enjoy about the game. First is the performance of the game. I have a pretty good computer that can run most games at max settings at around 60 fps (depending on the game), but this game is the first game to really give my computer a hard time. I constantly have stutters and extremely long load times. fps is around 40 or so. It isn't game breaking but it is very annoying to say the least. The second thing is how a good amount of the missions are done. Remember those bomb missions in EU that were really annoying? That is what, I'd say 50% of the game is. Now hold up a bit. While these still make the game annoying, Firaxis has compensated with making the maps more fluid in terms of being able to move faster and are generally stream lined. I think the enemies are more aggresive leading to faster battles but I'm not entirely sure if they are. Also, some people say they have a lot of bugs in this game, other than the, what I call, "XCOM bugs" where ragdolls glitch and you're guys occasionally get a bit glitchy looking, there aren't any bugs that I've experienced.\n\nTLDR: Good game, performance issues, lots of timed missions, "XCOM bugs"","May 30","true","39.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The lack of 360 controller support is a pain. I'm a PC gamer through and through, but I enjoy using a controller on some games. I like to play with the steam link, and honestly sitting on a couch with a keyboard and mouse on my lap or arm rest is just akward. This is my biggest beef with the game and I probably would have waited for more than 20% off sale to buy it because of this.There's a reason consoles use controllers. I guess they figured being Steam controller exclusive would rake in some money for extra sales so i can't blame them for wanting to make a buck, but guess who isn't buying one of those goofy things now on principle.\n\nThe game itself is fun, nice additions, the story is interesting and the unit mechanics are fantastic and being able to add customizable troops is a lot of fun. But almost EVERY OTHER mission being rushed and having limited turns, and these dark events and crucial missions really drag down the experience with their frequency. Say goodbye trying to researching the tech tree, or at least anything beyond things essential to the story. This is just on normal mode mind you. The workshop seems to just be decorative stuff, voice packs, things about as interesting and game changing as hats and junk in Team Fortress 2. I get it, some people dig that and good for them.\n\nI loved the original XCOM (EU and the original series), and I guess i'd call this sequel good technically, but I just personally can't get into XCom 2. It's harder than Dark Souls (without a walkthrough). Not a challange, it's just being an overwhelming jerk for pleasure difficult, and I feel I shouldn't have to cheat to be able to play the game "fairly" or at pace with the original. While i do recommend XCOM 2 I highly suggest reading reviews, especially negative ones, maybe buying on sale like I did. Don't expect controller support anytime soon unless you have an official Steam one. It was fun, but not fun enough for me to be in a hurry to finish the game anytime soon fun.","June 2","true","26.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For those who are not familiar with the Xcom franchise, it is a series of turn-based tactical games that is well known for its unforgiving difficulty. The Xcom games made from Firaxis are made as a reboot to the series after when everyone thought the franchise was seemingly dead and was made for people who are both new and old to the franchise with of course easier difficulty levels added in to keep newer player from getting discouraged from joining Xcom while the higher difficulties are of course there for the veterans, although I've never played the originals myself.\n\nSo what does Xcom 2 add in from Enemy Unknown? Here's a short list to get an idea:\n-new enemy types, with ADVENT troops being the sucessor to the EXALT forces in Enemy Within and a few new aliens and the old aliens learning a few more tricks up their sleaves\n-base defence, for when the aliens are able to attack you're mobile command center\n-semi-procedural level generation\n-new and improved class abilities\n-the ability to save your customized soldiers in a separate list so you can play with them throughout multiple games\n-weapon customization as a separate upgrade system instead of taking up a utility slot along with visual upgrades (like taking a scope replacing gadgets like medkits and grenades)\n-Steam Workshop Support\n\nSome negatives to consider:\n-PC requirements are pretty high so double check to see if you meet the requirements\n-$60 USD as opposed to Enemy Unknown for $30 USD, unless you buy the Enemy Within expansion for $30 USD without a sale\n-people have said something about the AI doing stupid things every now and again, but I wouldn't really know for sure because I'm bad at this game\n-some visual glitches with soldiers and aliens alike doing some pretty weird things from time to time\n-don't even bother with the multiplayer\n\nHonestly, I feel too lazy to even say anymore since there are way better reviews than this one and there really isn't any reason to repeat what people have already said for about 10,000 times. Would I recommend Xcom 2? For someone who's fairly new to the Xcom franchise, I enjoyed my time with it immensely so what reason do I have to say no other than the negatives I mentioned above along with easy access to mods via the Steam Workshop extending the games' lifespan.","June 2","true","82.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, it's let down by an astonishing number of irritating and confusing bugs. The AI is reasonable, but can get utterly confused.

There are all around improvements from pacing to gears, and the new story line is a lot more intriguing than the last one. Hell, even most of the system changes they made felt like an improvement. Strategy side of the game is as solid and fun as always, while character creation remains to be a time sink. And thanks to a great modding scene, XCOM 2 will have a rather long life span.\nThe game has some technical issues, mostly glitches and weird animations, and some annoying systems such as frequent timed missions, but those are nothing that mods cannot fix.\nOverall, XCOM 2 is a fantastic game that i can easily recommend to any strategy lover and to those who like some challenge and dont get easily frustrated.","May 19","true","62.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

The game is also a little more tense, the addition of time sensitive missions makes every mission with it as exciting as a terror mission. It forces you to adapt to situations and think on your feet more than you would in EU/EW. You can't spend every mission blue moving and overwatch spamming anymore, it forces you to go out of your comfort zone and get really good at the game.\n\nGraphics look nice, but the cinematic camera can get a little wonky at times. You can turn that off in the options menu if it bugs you. Game lags a bit when loading missions even on meaty rigs, and right now MSAA will cut frames pretty hard. There are a few bugs here and there, so far nothing game breaking, mostly visual.\n\nIt's probably one of the best games I've played in the last few years.","February 5","true","70.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The game isn't easy, but the turn timers aren't horrible. For now I'm playing on the second easiest option and that gives me an okay challenge for learning without getting frustrating. I quite often restart missions because I just did some horrible mistakes and try again. But so far I never failed because of timers or anything, on most missions there is time to fight properly and after taking out the enemies still reach the target.\nSame with the avatar timer, at first it goes up and up, but at some point you get a grip on it. I had it go up to two blocks left while preparing myself for the missions and building infrastructure, but then I felt prepared and reduced it again. Some objectives take it down by three, so now I feel a bit more in control.

Blain Cooper from Predator must continue to lead his squad into certain death :)\n\nWell after the whole weekend on X-Com 2 i have experienced many of the tweeks to the game, loving the fact you can add more weapon attachments like laser sights, extended mags etc. very extensive custom look options, the general progress through the game is much improved from the first, more enemy variants and yes it could do with an optimization patch though my aging i-5 is coping ok with some of the fluff turned off.\n\nMe personally im only finding frame rate drops on the squad up screen and base building bit, missions run fine with a few bugs i.e some of the soldier skills dont seem to work properly on the odd occasion, its apparent the game needs patching, it seems to be the trend with most releases these days. If theres one thing ive learnt in my 25 years of PC gaming, its keep your rig optimized though this is no excuse for poor programming. Im enjoying the game experience so far but i am a hardcore fan of the series and dont mind the timed missions as i revel the challenge.\n\nGreat game with a few creases that need ironing out, i tend to buy games now on pre order if there under 20 quid or wait till sales or GOTY editions as like many im not paying top dollar anymore cause you never know what your getting these days\n\nI do recommend a can of man the F**k Up if you want to play this game though lol","February 6","true","56.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game isn't easy, but the turn timers aren't horrible. For now I'm playing on the second easiest option and that gives me an okay challenge for learning without getting frustrating. I quite often restart missions because I just did some horrible mistakes and try again. But so far I never failed because of timers or anything, on most missions there is time to fight properly and after taking out the enemies still reach the target.\nSame with the avatar timer, at first it goes up and up, but at some point you get a grip on it. I had it go up to two blocks left while preparing myself for the missions and building infrastructure, but then I felt prepared and reduced it again. Some objectives take it down by three, so now I feel a bit more in control. I'm not done yet, so I might be wrong of course.","February 5","true","64.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I have a good gaming laptop but still frame drops constantly. The application sometimes crashes. I have encountered auto-saves that the game cannot load.\n\nGame in general:\nI wish the one calling the shots regarding what to put in the game have played the previous xcoms. The old xcom have more content, more things you can do, more research, more vehicles, more facilities.\n•	What happened to the archangel suit?\n•	No more mec trooper\n•	Missing the laser weapons\n•	Not enough depth to the normal weapon you use in the beginning\n•	No more bases across continents\n•	No more interceptors\n•	No more base defense (inside the base, where aliens can kill your engineers and scientists)\nI mean if you want to change some stuff at least replace it with something better. I feel this is a trim down version. And still if the plan is to really trim it down at least make the game kick-♥♥♥ in the sense that it is sleek. But the game as it is far from being sleek. Why do I have to see that useless hologram of the globe every time I want to move my base? And by the way, you keep showing us that but what we can interact with is a map…. So lame…\n\nTalking about moving the xcom base. We could assume that the ship would be a big ♥♥♥ ship but how come throughout the game it was only intercepted once, with no damage I tell you! What happened to the big ♥♥♥ ship the aliens have? Only saucers flying around. And even if you fly pass them they would not attack the freaking flying xcom base.\n\nI can still say a lot of negative things about this game but to summarize. There is nothing in the game that was impressive. It’s a trim down version of its predecessor. No effort to impress the players. If they say they worked on the graphics, well they currently suck with that frame rate drops. Nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing!\n\nI hope they earn a lot from this version so that they could do another one better. Come on guys, if you have to go back to the original game, please do so, there is a wealth of content there, you just need to use that as the base of your content and then improve some. (I still can’t forget that one time I sent an agent via motor bike to an alien site and “Rambo”ed the hell out of the aliens).\n\nI miss throwing those light stick to see the aliens… hayz…. Then *just thought of this now* you could have a research for night vision goggles so we don’t have to throw light stick so we can save mother earth while killing the aliens right?! I mean this game is supposed to be human vs aliens but this version doesn’t show enough human tech (if somebody will say because this version is in the future and alien tech is more advance then I would ask if we discarded our technology for alien tech then why does the resistance need to research alien tech again?).\n\nAnyway I digress, this is my first review here in steam and it is for a game that I love and played since the 90s and I am saying I feel there could be way more than what was given in this version. A very big room for improvement.\n\nWill I buy the next version of the game? hell yes :) but i might not pre-purchase anymore. I thought with the enemy within version being good this would be better but alas it is not, so next time I would not be as excited.\n","March 22","false","107.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I haven't tried any of the mods.\n\ntl;dr version: So many great ideas, but the execution and performance issues make XCOM2 unplayable.\n\nGood:\n- The aliens are incredibly interesting.  Most enemies are basically improvements from EU/EW.  Sectoids and Mutons receive massive upgrades from EU/EW, and there are several new enemies that make you really rack your brain on how you are going to combat them.\n- New twists on some buildings.  The proving ground is fun.  It's mostly a random grab bag of weapons and armor.  The advanced warfare center gives you some pleasant surprises every now and then.\n- Overwatch AI is improved.  No longer will 5 dudes on overwatch shoot at the dead alien the 1st guy killed.  All successful overwatch shots are useful.\n- Everything looks pretty good.  The animation is much less cartooney than EU/EW.\n- Dodge/Graze mechanic.  Pretty cool when it's in your favor, but heart-breaking when it burns you.\n- Enemy reinforcements.  They will really screw up your game plan and make you recalculate.  Much improved over the drop-a-thin-man-in-there-and-put-him-on-overwatch paradigm from EU/EW.\n- Weapon upgrades add another level to squad make-up.\n- Psi-warriors are a unique class.  They are bad ♥♥♥...  and probably even overpowered.  No longer just necessary to "take one for the team" in the final cinematic.\n\nNeutral:\n- Stealth ambushes were a good idea.  Triggering enemies with several squad members in overwatch commences a Boondock Saints-esque cascade of bullets.  However, overwatch is much less effective than EU/EW, and I end up following a procedure for conducting ambushes. *yawn*\n- Lots of turn timers on mission.  They do add to the urgency and difficulty of missions, but generally force your hand most of the time.\n- Mission types are basically the same as EU/EW.  Base assaults, terror missions, VIP rescue, destry the device.  A few new tricks, but they definitely took the don't-fix-what-ain't-broke approach.\n- The Black Market.  It's an evolution of the Grey Market from EU/EW.  The Black Market can be useful, but I just don't get excited about it and it doesn't help out as much as the Grey Market did.\n\nBad:\n- Performance.  Prior to the recent patch, I should have been able to play on max settings/resolution (including 4k) on both of my rigs as they are waaayyyy beyond the recommended specs.  However, max settings made the framerate drop to gamebreaking levels.  I was able to tweak the settings to make the game playable, but it never looked all that great.  I did not experience crashes before the patch.  THEN THE PATCH WAS BORN.  Post-patch, I experienced 1-3 crashes per hour of play (The last one I suffered occurred on the plane ride home from a terror mission on which only one civilian was killed).  The real insult is that the developer added an "auto settings detector" to help us all play at acceptable framerates.  The auto-detect simply dumbed down settings on my machines AND the framerate was much lower than pre-patch.  Just plain unacceptable\n- Some missions seem pre-determined.  I loved the difficulty of Long War.  It was transparent and tactile.  You always knew why you were getting screwed, and were generally rewarded by living by the rules of XCOM.  But the rules of XCOM intermittently get flipped upside-down in XCOM2.  I have played several missions where there are a large number of improbable misses (> 85%) that lead me to fail the mission.  Even after save-scumming with an all-new approach, the overwhelming missed shots lead me to believe that the seed is choosing against me.  This leads to an unwanted side-effect of relying HEAVILY on 100% weapons (mainly grenades) and laughing when my guys miss three 90% shots in a row to end a turn.  It's insulting, and eliminates the fun of having a diverse squad.\n\nVerdict: There is so much to like, but I can't enjoy it because the few things I hate are so very bad.","March 24","false","108.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Tis just not fun unless your on the ground!\n\nIt's not a bad game but I'm really struggling to want to play anything other than the ground missions.\n\nThe ground missions are great (well, apart from doing timed missions constantly) and aspects of it have been improved from the first game.  The new alien designs seem quite cool and the random maps are great as well.  There were a few parts of the game I enjoy until.....\n\n- I am not in a ground mission.  They've put in a lot more complexity in the base/map part of the game but I find it confusing and uninteresting on the whole.\n- The ground mission is another timed mission.  I cans ee why they have done it and it does add a bit more bite to the missions.  Save scumming is the new overwatch now!\n- I had to use a mouse and keyboard as there is no controller support (Steampad doesn't count!).  You can play it well enough with the mouse and keyboard on the ground missions but the UI for the base/map section is difficult to navigate with them.  It looks like it would be easier to navigate with a controller but you can't use one!\n- Easy is very easy, normal is very difficult.  I have played old X-Com and new X-Com and found the recommended difficulty far too hard at times.  When I changed it down to easy the aliens were suddenly made out of butter and it wasn't a challenge.\n- I had to listen to the voice acting far too often.  Some of it is ok, all of it grates eventually because you can't do anything in this game without someone having something to say about it.\n- I had to look at my rag tag bunch of misfits standing with "attitude".  I'm not big into customisation but even I was tempted to use it when I saw the poor models you get as standard.  I'm also not a fan of the posing (but I understand this is more personal preference on my part.)\n- I had to sit through the beginning and end animations again.  You do quite a few ground missions and I got fed up of the animations that I had to 'Esc' through constantly to get past them.\n\nIt's just not my cup of tea to be honest.  The choices they've made have taken a lot of the fun out of it for me and on top of that they have made some decisions that I just don't understand (like taking controller support out of a game which had previously amazed everyone with how well it worked with a controller.)  Shame as I was looking forward to this!\n\nEDITTED TO ADD (as I've now finished it, no spoilers)\n- The ground game really is good fun.  If I didn't dislike the other stuff so much it might have been a recommend (and while it's great, it's not that much of a change from the first one.  It's tweaked very well though.)\n- The story is a bit tonally strange (can't decide if it wants to be a serious game or not) and didn't really like any of the characters.  It's also a bit light until the end.\n- Can't really say too much about the end  as I don't won't to spoil it but....\nThe final mission is jarring as characters appear that you have either not seen, or barely seen throughout the game so far.  The end is a bit of an anti climax (X-Com 1 has a better ending!)","March 12","false","32.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I have a good gaming laptop but still frame drops constantly. The application sometimes crashes. I have encountered auto-saves that the game cannot load.\n\nGame in general:\nI wish the one calling the shots regarding what to put in the game have played the previous xcoms. The old xcom have more content, more things you can do, more research, more vehicles, more facilities.\n•	What happened to the archangel suit?\n•	No more mec trooper\n•	Missing the laser weapons\n•	Not enough depth to the normal weapon you use in the beginning\n•	No more bases across continents\n•	No more interceptors\n•	No more base defense (inside the base, where aliens can kill your engineers and scientists)\nI mean if you want to change some stuff at least replace it with something better. I feel this is a trim down version. And still if the plan is to really trim it down at least make the game kick-♥♥♥ in the sense that it is sleek. But the game as it is far from being sleek. Why do I have to see that useless hologram of the globe every time I want to move my base? And by the way, you keep showing us that but what we can interact with is a map…. So lame…\n\nTalking about moving the xcom base. We could assume that the ship would be a big ♥♥♥ ship but how come throughout the game it was only intercepted once, with no damage I tell you! What happened to the big ♥♥♥ ship the aliens have? Only saucers flying around. And even if you fly pass them they would not attack the freaking flying xcom base.\n\nI can still say a lot of negative things about this game but to summarize. There is nothing in the game that was impressive. It’s a trim down version of its predecessor. No effort to impress the players. If they say they worked on the graphics, well they currently suck with that frame rate drops. Nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing!\n\nI hope they earn a lot from this version so that they could do another one better. Come on guys, if you have to go back to the original game, please do so, there is a wealth of content there, you just need to use that as the base of your content and then improve some. (I still can’t forget that one time I sent an agent via motor bike to an alien site and “Rambo”ed the hell out of the aliens).\n\nI miss throwing those light stick to see the aliens… hayz…. Then *just thought of this now* you could have a research for night vision goggles so we don’t have to throw light stick so we can save mother earth while killing the aliens right?! I mean this game is supposed to be human vs aliens but this version doesn’t show enough human tech (if somebody will say because this version is in the future and alien tech is more advance then I would ask if we discarded our technology for alien tech then why does the resistance need to research alien tech again?).\n\nAnyway I digress, this is my first review here in steam and it is for a game that I love and played since the 90s and I am saying I feel there could be way more than what was given in this version. A very big room for improvement.\n\nWill I buy the next version of the game? hell yes :) but i might not pre-purchase anymore. I thought with the enemy within version being good this would be better but alas it is not, so next time I would not be as excited.\n","March 22","false","107.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I haven't tried any of the mods.\n\ntl;dr version: So many great ideas, but the execution and performance issues make XCOM2 unplayable.\n\nGood:\n- The aliens are incredibly interesting.  Most enemies are basically improvements from EU/EW.  Sectoids and Mutons receive massive upgrades from EU/EW, and there are several new enemies that make you really rack your brain on how you are going to combat them.\n- New twists on some buildings.  The proving ground is fun.  It's mostly a random grab bag of weapons and armor.  The advanced warfare center gives you some pleasant surprises every now and then.\n- Overwatch AI is improved.  No longer will 5 dudes on overwatch shoot at the dead alien the 1st guy killed.  All successful overwatch shots are useful.\n- Everything looks pretty good.

This leads to an unwanted side-effect of relying HEAVILY on 100% weapons (mainly grenades) and laughing when my guys miss three 90% shots in a row to end a turn.  It's insulting, and eliminates the fun of having a diverse squad.\n\nVerdict: There is so much to like, but I can't enjoy it because the few things I hate are so very bad.","March 24","false","108.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You will get shot through solid walls  over great distances meanwhile you will miss some point blank shots. I really do want to love this game, and I usually boot it back up and give it another go.

Tis just not fun unless your on the ground!\n\nIt's not a bad game but I'm really struggling to want to play anything other than the ground missions.\n\nThe ground missions are great (well, apart from doing timed missions constantly) and aspects of it have been improved from the first game.  The new alien designs seem quite cool and the random maps are great as well.  There were a few parts of the game I enjoy until.....\n\n- I am not in a ground mission.  They've put in a lot more complexity in the base/map part of the game but I find it confusing and uninteresting on the whole.\n- The ground mission is another timed mission.  I cans ee why they have done it and it does add a bit more bite to the missions.  Save scumming is the new overwatch now!\n- I had to use a mouse and keyboard as there is no controller support (Steampad doesn't count!).  You can play it well enough with the mouse and keyboard on the ground missions but the UI for the base/map section is difficult to navigate with them.  It looks like it would be easier to navigate with a controller but you can't use one!\n- Easy is very easy, normal is very difficult.  I have played old X-Com and new X-Com and found the recommended difficulty far too hard at times.  When I changed it down to easy the aliens were suddenly made out of butter and it wasn't a challenge.\n- I had to listen to the voice acting far too often.  Some of it is ok, all of it grates eventually because you can't do anything in this game without someone having something to say about it.\n- I had to look at my rag tag bunch of misfits standing with "attitude".  I'm not big into customisation but even I was tempted to use it when I saw the poor models you get as standard.  I'm also not a fan of the posing (but I understand this is more personal preference on my part.)\n- I had to sit through the beginning and end animations again.  You do quite a few ground missions and I got fed up of the animations that I had to 'Esc' through constantly to get past them.\n\nIt's just not my cup of tea to be honest.  The choices they've made have taken a lot of the fun out of it for me and on top of that they have made some decisions that I just don't understand (like taking controller support out of a game which had previously amazed everyone with how well it worked with a controller.)  Shame as I was looking forward to this!\n\nEDITTED TO ADD (as I've now finished it, no spoilers)\n- The ground game really is good fun.  If I didn't dislike the other stuff so much it might have been a recommend (and while it's great, it's not that much of a change from the first one.  It's tweaked very well though.)\n- The story is a bit tonally strange (can't decide if it wants to be a serious game or not) and didn't really like any of the characters.  It's also a bit light until the end.\n- Can't really say too much about the end  as I don't won't to spoil it but....\nThe final mission is jarring as characters appear that you have either not seen, or barely seen throughout the game so far.  The end is a bit of an anti climax (X-Com 1 has a better ending!)","March 12","false","32.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I have a good gaming laptop but still frame drops constantly. The application sometimes crashes. I have encountered auto-saves that the game cannot load.\n\nGame in general:\nI wish the one calling the shots regarding what to put in the game have played the previous xcoms. The old xcom have more content, more things you can do, more research, more vehicles, more facilities.\n•	What happened to the archangel suit?\n•	No more mec trooper\n•	Missing the laser weapons\n•	Not enough depth to the normal weapon you use in the beginning\n•	No more bases across continents\n•	No more interceptors\n•	No more base defense (inside the base, where aliens can kill your engineers and scientists)\nI mean if you want to change some stuff at least replace it with something better. I feel this is a trim down version. And still if the plan is to really trim it down at least make the game kick-♥♥♥ in the sense that it is sleek. But the game as it is far from being sleek. Why do I have to see that useless hologram of the globe every time I want to move my base? And by the way, you keep showing us that but what we can interact with is a map…. So lame…\n\nTalking about moving the xcom base. We could assume that the ship would be a big ♥♥♥ ship but how come throughout the game it was only intercepted once, with no damage I tell you! What happened to the big ♥♥♥ ship the aliens have? Only saucers flying around. And even if you fly pass them they would not attack the freaking flying xcom base.\n\nI can still say a lot of negative things about this game but to summarize. There is nothing in the game that was impressive. It’s a trim down version of its predecessor. No effort to impress the players. If they say they worked on the graphics, well they currently suck with that frame rate drops. Nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing!\n\nI hope they earn a lot from this version so that they could do another one better. Come on guys, if you have to go back to the original game, please do so, there is a wealth of content there, you just need to use that as the base of your content and then improve some. (I still can’t forget that one time I sent an agent via motor bike to an alien site and “Rambo”ed the hell out of the aliens).\n\nI miss throwing those light stick to see the aliens… hayz…. Then *just thought of this now* you could have a research for night vision goggles so we don’t have to throw light stick so we can save mother earth while killing the aliens right?! I mean this game is supposed to be human vs aliens but this version doesn’t show enough human tech (if somebody will say because this version is in the future and alien tech is more advance then I would ask if we discarded our technology for alien tech then why does the resistance need to research alien tech again?).\n\nAnyway I digress, this is my first review here in steam and it is for a game that I love and played since the 90s and I am saying I feel there could be way more than what was given in this version. A very big room for improvement.\n\nWill I buy the next version of the game? hell yes :) but i might not pre-purchase anymore. I thought with the enemy within version being good this would be better but alas it is not, so next time I would not be as excited.\n","March 22","false","107.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I haven't tried any of the mods.\n\ntl;dr version: So many great ideas, but the execution and performance issues make XCOM2 unplayable.\n\nGood:\n- The aliens are incredibly interesting.  Most enemies are basically improvements from EU/EW.  Sectoids and Mutons receive massive upgrades from EU/EW, and there are several new enemies that make you really rack your brain on how you are going to combat them.\n- New twists on some buildings.  The proving ground is fun.  It's mostly a random grab bag of weapons and armor.  The advanced warfare center gives you some pleasant surprises every now and then.\n- Overwatch AI is improved.  No longer will 5 dudes on overwatch shoot at the dead alien the 1st guy killed.  All successful overwatch shots are useful.\n- Everything looks pretty good.  The animation is much less cartooney than EU/EW.\n- Dodge/Graze mechanic.  Pretty cool when it's in your favor, but heart-breaking when it burns you.\n- Enemy reinforcements.  They will really screw up your game plan and make you recalculate.  Much improved over the drop-a-thin-man-in-there-and-put-him-on-overwatch paradigm from EU/EW.\n- Weapon upgrades add another level to squad make-up.\n- Psi-warriors are a unique class.  They are bad ♥♥♥...  and probably even overpowered.  No longer just necessary to "take one for the team" in the final cinematic.\n\nNeutral:\n- Stealth ambushes were a good idea.  Triggering enemies with several squad members in overwatch commences a Boondock Saints-esque cascade of bullets.  However, overwatch is much less effective than EU/EW, and I end up following a procedure for conducting ambushes. *yawn*\n- Lots of turn timers on mission.  They do add to the urgency and difficulty of missions, but generally force your hand most of the time.\n- Mission types are basically the same as EU/EW.  Base assaults, terror missions, VIP rescue, destry the device.  A few new tricks, but they definitely took the don't-fix-what-ain't-broke approach.\n- The Black Market.  It's an evolution of the Grey Market from EU/EW.  The Black Market can be useful, but I just don't get excited about it and it doesn't help out as much as the Grey Market did.\n\nBad:\n- Performance.  Prior to the recent patch, I should have been able to play on max settings/resolution (including 4k) on both of my rigs as they are waaayyyy beyond the recommended specs.  However, max settings made the framerate drop to gamebreaking levels.  I was able to tweak the settings to make the game playable, but it never looked all that great.  I did not experience crashes before the patch.  THEN THE PATCH WAS BORN.  Post-patch, I experienced 1-3 crashes per hour of play (The last one I suffered occurred on the plane ride home from a terror mission on which only one civilian was killed).  The real insult is that the developer added an "auto settings detector" to help us all play at acceptable framerates.  The auto-detect simply dumbed down settings on my machines AND the framerate was much lower than pre-patch.  Just plain unacceptable\n- Some missions seem pre-determined.  I loved the difficulty of Long War.  It was transparent and tactile.  You always knew why you were getting screwed, and were generally rewarded by living by the rules of XCOM.  But the rules of XCOM intermittently get flipped upside-down in XCOM2.  I have played several missions where there are a large number of improbable misses (> 85%) that lead me to fail the mission.  Even after save-scumming with an all-new approach, the overwhelming missed shots lead me to believe that the seed is choosing against me.

There are reviews detracting the pace of the game and the forced time limits in the missions.  For those users who complain about the time limits of the missions think on this.  You are the resistance, you are deep in enemy territory and they have the advantage.  The game does a great job on pushing that on to the player.  You get the strong feel of being the underdog more so then in the pervious titles.  That being said this is where I start to have a problem with the game and the developers and the course this game took.\n\nWhat do I mean by this well lets start with the fact the game is 20 years later.  The resistance has been fighting for years against Advent and the aliens.  So why in the name of all that is holy am I still starting the game off with your typical rifles?  WHY has nothing in the pervious war carried over?  In what universe would a 20 year resistance that had some advanced weapons at the end of the last game AND genetic modifications be reduced to the starting point of X-Com EW.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this is just a slap to the player?  Where is the intense story?  I spent 20 minutes just trying to find out exactly what happened at the end of the last game and I have gotten nothing that actually makes any sense.  Advent took over the aliens attacked and took over.  Really so what the heck happened to X-Coms war against the aliens and the launch on their home planet?  Why are we stuck with nothing at the start? No Psionics no Gauss no nothing we are basically naked against a enemy that has evolved in 20 years and X-Com has not evolved?  I can not believe this as realistic.\n\nThe game so far is good but I am feeling let down by this game.  Lets be honest X-Com the LW makes X-Com better than this.  As far as games go I give this a 7/10 for graphics and feel but I have to give it a thumbs down still.\n\n*Additional Note here that has me a little annoyed as a modder, programmer, and a gamer.  Upon reviewing the game files at length I noticed within the game code alot of notes and options laid out for development of the game.  Why are these not live, why are they sitting there unpolished?  Simple because the developers and company in general don't give a dang about the players.  They want others to finish the work for them like Long War Studios.  IF anyone cares to look carefully they will see long war published the mods in December of 2015 for this game.  So not only do they get the first jump on putting mods out there they have have had the game files for over a month, have completed some in game tweeks the dev team should have done and are well ahead of any modder who now looks to tackle an advanced mod for this game.  Way to go on the developers and publishers of this game.  As a customer and fan of this series you have lost my bussiness.  Simply because of the tactics played with this one game, and if this is the writing on the wall for the future of gaming well gaming will no longer be a secondary pastime but not a pasttime at all.","February 5","false","42.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I installed the game, and it wouldn't load on the computer, I put out a thread on the steam forums, no one replied (Not the game's nor 2K's fault), but I also sent out a support ticket and tweeted at their support twitter, to which they failed to as of yet respond to either. I've waited for the past 3 hours for a response and seen countless other people get responses in minutes, I am disappointed that I was forced to spend $60 and not even allowed to play a lick of content, and I have not been given any help whatsoever. This may not reflect poorly on the playability or gameplay of the game but as of now I cannot say anything good about the game or the service.

I haven't experienced these problems, but quite a few others have, so I would be careful with this purchase if I were you.\n\nI've been a fan of the XCOM games for a few years now. I'm not one of those veteran players that have been playing since Terror of the Deep or whatever, but I had a blast with Enemy Unknown, so I knew I was going to get this game. After playing this game enough to have a solidified opinion, I think it's easy to say that this game is a huge improvement over EU.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics aren't actually that bad for a strategy game. The characters themselves look great, and environments look pretty. If you have the action camera on, then you photographers out there should get ready to take some nice screenshots.\n\nGameplay\nIf I were to explain the overall gameplay in one word, that word would be improvement. The new classes (the Specialist, Gunner, and Ranger) are great replacements for the previous ones, and make the game far more interesting and teams much more diverse. My personal favorite seems to be the Specialist, because how can you NOT find using a drone to take control of your robot adversaries awesome? However, this is where one of the problems with the game seems to come in: there are some pretty rough balance issues here. Okay, first of all, I get that the game is supposed to be hard. I'm not talking about the enemies (besides the Viper and Codex) being over/underpowered, I'm talking about the XCOM soldiers themselves. The Specialist's drone is kind of underpowered when it comes to hacking the aforementioned robots, because the chance of actually hacking it is pretty low. The Psi-Soldiers are really OP, if you haven't heard that already. The Ranger's sword, although awesome, seems very situational. But, to make up for things like this, you have the new enemies. I don't want to spoil them all, but there's a few really creative ones that I'm a huge fan of. The pacing to the game has gotten some mixed reception, primarily because the timers can be really "unfair" in some cases, and this can actually be true if you're stuck on a mission where your target is on the other side of the map. However, the game is SUPPOSED to be hectic and fast-paced. You're running a resistance struggling to survive with the alien threat everywhere. You can't just run in guns blazing, can you? It makes the game a lot more exciting in my opinion. Also, the character editor is awesome. You like giving your characters more depth? Congratulations, now you can.\n\nStory\nI haven't completed the story yet, but I'm pretty far into the game, and the story is actually pretty interesting. I'm enjoying my time trying to uncover the secrets of the Avatar Project, and the new characters have some depth to them, although they certainly don't reach points to other games. Not much else to say, but XCOM 2's story is surprisingly interesting to me.\n\nAudio\nThere really isn't much to say here. The voice acting and music sound great. Obviously not to levels of other games, but this was not the category XCOM 2 was trying to excel in.\n\nReplayability\nAs I said before, I haven't completed this game. However, the mod support was a really good move. That gives XCOM 2 a LOT more replayability. Plus, the game is randomly generated in a lot of ways, so that might keep you interested for another playthrough. The only thing that might turn you off is how difficult the game is, it's fine to admit that the Sectoids can be really frustrating sometimes. *shudders*\n\nVerdict\nAs with most games today, there are a lot of bugs. Nothing game breaking, but minor ones that will make you want to repeatedly bash your skull into the wall. Luckily, however, that and the balance issues are the only major complaints I have about the game (aside from the perfomance issues at launch) and the game improves over Enemy Unknown in a lot of ways. If you're a fan of the XCOM games, buy it. If not, I would play some of the first game to pass the time while the game is patched. Overall, I'm a big fan of this game, and I'm looking forward to what happens next with my squad that pretty much fires every shot while blindfolded!\n\nGraphics - 8.5/10\nGameplay - 9.5/10\nStory - 8.0/10\nAudio - 7.0/10\nReplayability - 9.5/10\n\n.:9.0/10:.\n\n+Pacing fits the mood\n+Awesome class options\n+Pretty visuals\n+In depth character editor\n+New enemies are exciting\n\n-Frequent bugs\n-Some balance issues","February 23","true","29.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Animefreek/recommended/268500/","Animefreek","ＤＪ Ｙｏｕｈｅｉ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Animefreek/","1190 products in account","A bug from the patch 2 weeks ago introduced a memory leak. It hasn't been patched since. I haven't been able to play the game.\n\nAs of the most recent update, the game is now playable. I've even noticed an increase in performance! Wow! Still not optimal, but it doesn't really dip into single frames as often, and crashes are way less frequent. Others are reporting more performance issues though. YMMV.\n\nGame is pretty damn fun. XCOM 2 is more streamlined than Enemy Unknown: Stripped down base management, removal of aircraft, and there are no longer country-specific panic bars, but instead a single global one.\n\nThat's not to say that they haven't added in anything new. Some missions will start you off in a stealth-based concealment status. Instead of groups of enemies gaining a turn as soon as you spot them, they'll only trigger once you enter their line of sight (which, once you spot them, will be displayed on the map when you move your mouse around. Unfortunately, this is currently bugged, and enemies may be able to spot you outside of the visible zone). I really like this concept, but generally the missions you start in this condition will have a lower turn counter. It makes sense for some missions, but it's a slap in the hand to give you this freedom and being unable to utilize it. On the bright side, there are some mods that change the way the timer works.\n\nAnd mods for just about everything else, actually. XCOM 2 is miles ahead of Enemy Unknown when it comes to mod support. If you go on to the Steam workshop (or elsewhere, if you prefer), and you'll find new classes, cosmetics, weapons, enemies, gameplay tweaks, the works. Making this game so mod friendly may be the best change to XCOM 2. Firaxis definitely deserves some praise for their improvements. The only downside is that if you decide you no longer want a mod during a campaign, you won't be able to use that save. On the bright side, there's a mod that lets you bypass that! (though your save may have issues or make your game crash).\n\nIt's just such a damn shame how buggy this game is. There are situations like this where I feel like I should have a flank, but instead the game disagrees[i.imgur.com] and says the alien is in full cover. Here's one where I'm right beside this guy[i.imgur.com]. The inverse also seems to happen- flanks at absolutely incomprehensible angles. Happens to both me and the AI. Some bugs I feel guilty about is stuff like this. That target is behind 4 walls.[i.imgur.com] It's not usually that extreme, but it happens more often than you'd think.\n\nMy first playthrough was on Veteran. The global crisis meter was one bar away from being filled because I was pretty dumb with my build order (PROTIP build a Resistance comms facility early in your base). I was able to completely erase it in about a month's time, and they never remotely recovered from it. It was pretty much a win state for the final two months: I was just waiting for more tech to develop and only a handful of missions popped up. Very anti-climatic compared to how hectic the early months can be.\n\nI really like this game. Should you get this game? Definitely. When the Game of the Year edition is released. The bugs are still present and they'll likely be focusing more effort on making DLC (because this is a 2K game, of there's a season pass). May as well get a cheaper, less buggy game at a later point in time with all the DLC included and better, refined mods from the community.\n\nI'll change my recommendation to a yes when I can honestly tell others to pick the game up. Until then, stay away.\n\nPS why the ♥♥♥♥ can Advent Officers move, use mark (increases enemy accuracy against one of your soldiers) and fire in the same ♥♥♥♥ing turn?\n\nPPS bring two grenadiers, get them Heavy Ordnance, Volatile Mix, and Salvo. Develop them heavy armor. Give one gas and the other acid grenades. Blow up every single wall, floor, and ceiling.","February 29","false","79.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I created a wonderful squad of vibrant personalities that were all from my Arma3 Unit.\n\nPumped up and ready to go, I booted up the campain. After a brief intoduction and tutorial mission, I was ready. I was ready to fight me some aliens.\n\nThe mission started out well enough. I set up an amazing ambush, killed me some alien fellers. But then, then everything went wrong. Out of no-where, one of my guys got killed. Then I saw the culprit, a Psi Warrior. I said to myself "Pfft, I got this". I have never been so wrong.\n\nThat Psy Warrior didn't attack me. No, that would be too simple.  He, with his magical powers, revived my dead soldier and decided to turn him against me. Long story short, I ended up killing most of my squad that day. It was at the very end of them mission, victory was in sight. One click, and the Psy Warrior would be dead. *Click*. My hands went flying! My Squad was dead, but they died for a cause. There was only two survivors, but I won! I had defeated a mission I assumed to be one of those "supposed to fail" types.\n\nThe next few in-game days were spent recouperating. For days, we mourned the loss of those that had given thier life on that day. The two men that survived were promptly promoted and were set to become the leaders of my resitance. And so they did. As soon as they recouperated, another task came about. The first to set foot on the DZ was Adam, the lone recouperated survivor of that first operation. We fought, we lost comrades, but Adam survived that day. He survived the next three operations without a scratch. He was a good soldier, but all good things must come to an end.\n\nThe finial Operation I embarked upon was supposed to be simple. I was to assault a small Alien Outpost and destroy a thing for some reason or another. Like all the missions before it, Adam was the first to step foot on the DZ. He, and his other five compatriots were ready for a battle. We knew before hand that we wouldn't all make it back. Someone would have to pay for our resistance, but nobody wanted it to be them, least of all Adam, the great Combat Veteran of Operation Shattered Hope. Well, as things tend to go, all went poorly sooner rather then later. Adam was injured early on by a crazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a sword. Some of his comrades took bullets from a turret, and some were driven crazy by a Psy Warrior. But we overcame. We faught through. But time was running out. That battle had taken 3 turns, and there was a 8 turn limit before the thing we needed went boom boom or whatever.\n\nI panicked. I sent Adam on what hindsight would tell me would be a suicide mission. Alone with his Nade Launcher, Adam  launched the Nades into the target. Success, Adam destroyed it. But the mission was not over yet. Out of nowhere, a Psy Warrior and an Officer attacked Adam. That's where everything went wrong. Before long, Adam, my Combat Veteran of Operation Shattered Hope, died, so that the others could live. We faught furiously. Turn after turn, we faught, and eventually prevaled. We Evac'd without so much as a sigh. Adam was dead, and everyone else had become injured. It was not a good day for the XCom Project. At base, promotions were issued. recources were gained, and everyone aquired thier new gear. But nobody was happy, for on that day, we won a battle, but lost a friend.

The resistance had been flying over Russia for some time, the land below frozen and dusted with a white powder. It was quite a sight, but knowing my luck, life was about to give me a closer look. At about 14:00 hours our ship was ambushed. A UFO had been tailing us for some time and just launched an attack against us. Fearing the worst, everyone held on as two cannons shot at our engines. To our surprise, we weren't blown to bits, but all the power on the ship was dead... And we were descending.\n\nFalling from the sky, our ship plummeted to earth, engines stuttering. Without a moments notice, our Engineers reactivated our power through our emergancy battery. Our engines came to life and did all they could to keep us from crashing. Surprisingly, we landed without a scratch... Though I wish I could say this was the end of it. Our escape was halted by a nearby jammer that was deployed by the UFO. It halted our systems and left us vaulnerable.\n\nReports of enemy dropships stormed our comms and we soon realized we had little time. We had to deactivate that jammer and get this bird airborn again before we were overrun. Our troops were instantly deployed into the frozen tundra to defend our bird, each one hunkered down and prepared for the first wave.\n\nWhile most of our troops defended the entrace, a demolitions squad of 3 advanced to disable the jammer. CPT. James "Grey" Mckenna, CPT. Lorenzo "Scorch" Costa and SGT. Mark "Ghost" Altman were assigned. As soon as the ship touched down, the three sprinted to disable the jammer. Running as fast as they could, they were met with a massive dropship hovering above them. Snow flurried around and blinded their vision as they charged through to the jammer. In the haze, a MEC and two ADVANT troops decended upon them, guns blazing. The demolitions team were quickly supressed, ducking for cover as quickly as they could. They were pinned...\n\nAfter a long intense fight, the team managed to slice through the opposition and continue their objective. The sounds of mutliple dropships filled the sky and the sound of gunfire flooded the atmosphere as the troops defended the Avenger. Knowing they had little time, the demolitions squad rushed to the jammer effectively wiping out the ADVENT troops protecting it with ease.\n\nOn the other side of the battlefield, bullets were peppering our troops. A hail of gunfire cut through the air, sparking off the metal barricades deployed earlier. Holding their own, our unit put up a damn good fight, slaughtering them as they charged the ship. A field of bodies now laid before them, yet more troops just kept pouring in.\n\nTime was short, and the demolitions team needed to deactivate that jammer quickly. As soon as they reached the objective, they unloaded a hail of bullets, swiftly destroying the EMP. Finally, the AVENGER was free from the clutches, but now the troops had to get back quickly. The team rushed back as fast as they could, dodging gunfire but ultimately getting hit with a few well places shots. Bloody and limping, the team fired back, a hail of bullets firing back at the enemy. As the defending unit covered the teams return, more casulties were inflicted....\n\nSoldiers began to drop, though lucky enough, they survived. But it was clear we were running out of time. As ADVANT troops pressed their attack, our unit began to fall back to the ship with brave soldiers covering our retreat. We were almost out, one last soldier was making their way onto the ship, until... CPL. Shannon Lee was struck with a lethal bullet to the back of the skull. She was dead on impact.\n\nWe the resistance never leaves anyone behind. Another brave soul by the name of LT. Sam "Splinter" Fisher ran to recover her now lifeless body. The pain of the loss struck our troops immediately as LT. "Splinter" carried her inside. The ramp began to close and our ship spun back to life, engines wirring once more. But there was no celebration, only a silent mourning for our lost soldier...\n\nCorporal Shannon Lee was given the Metal of Honor for her bravery in the field. Her performance and sense of duty was more than enough to award her a proper metal. If not for her excellent marksmanship, more of our soldiers would have died.\n\nMay God give you safe passage.\n\n_______________________________ Signing off...","February 5","true","37.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I played XCOM: Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within as well so I will give an honest review of the game.\n\nQuick Overview of Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n\n* Really really fun - Matters because reason we buy and play\n* Good solid graphics\n* Great strategic play - Well thought out - Better than XCOM: EU/EW\n* Lots of options makes for very diverse play\n* Lots of maps - Really good maps/variety\n* Extremely immersive gameplay - You feel like you are trying to save the human race/world\n* Surprises, twists, and mystery - Great story telling so far\n* A large range of different enemies to fight\n* Mobile base and travel is well done and you have to make hard decisions\n\nCons:\n\n* Could take some learning for new players - you might die :)\n* I did find one bug in the game during play so far - It was while in base, under the armory tab, and happened during customizing my units.  When I clicked on the "menu back" button it would not back out of the menu.  I did eventually get back out by switching to customizing another player and was then able to use the menu back.  Have not been able to duplicate this bug, only happened once.\n\n\nI know some do not like the "time limit" or number of turns you have, but I really thought it added to the game and made it a lot of fun so far.  It is an immersive element, you need to accomplish some parts of some missions fast and I liked it.  It gives some depth and weight to your choices on the battlefield and it makes sense from a story telling perspective as well.  It is well done, should try it before you mod it out imo.\n\nI know some have experienced some performance issues, I have not.  My system is good, but not top of the line.  If you have a below average system you will need to upgrade to play this game.\n\nMy system:\n\n* i7 4790k\n* 8GB Ram\n* 120 SSD (game not on SSD)\n* 1TB HD\n* AMD 280 with 3GB video mem\n\nPerhaps the current AMD video card drivers are better for this game than the current Nvidia drivers - I don't know that, but perhaps that is why some are experiencing some lag/stutter issues.\n\n*I have not had a single crash or freeze with this game.\n\nOverall this is a great game and extremely fun to play!  Lots of ways to customize and it's just a blast to play.  I think it is well done.  There are some out there that say it is poorly optimized, however most are probably not programers or developers.  I have electrical engineering and computer science experience and it seems fine to me.","February 8","true","20.7"," 34 of 65 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","34","65","0","0"

I was successful at Enemy Unknown on harder difficulties but find this one frustrating on normal(veteran) and still very RNG dependant on easy. The world map is just as random, spawning critical missions left and right while you are scanning to do a different one.

On lowest settings I still cannot get to 60FPS consistently.\n\nLoad times are excruciatingly long between missions. AI in missions can sometimes just sit there while the engine is catching up.

It isnt a game to go, "eh, idk, looks alright." then spend $60. (IMO) The NPC's kinda wander around and make no sense to why they go to certain places. The first two levels, i had multiple people die on me. Im probably just terrible at this game but the hit chance it says in game is completely inaccurate. if its not, then i had the WORST luck in this game. The game fails to ease you into this style of gameplay. it just throws you in and says deal with it. If you KNOW this is a game you will like and you have played others in the past then go ahead. Apparently, the base management is alot more streamlined making you be able to get to combat quicker. The graphics for the game on ultra are kind of sub-par. Honestly, mid combat looks better than some of the cinematics. Which isnt a bad thing, it just should speak for how bad some of the cinematics are.\n\nTL;DR\nDon't buy it unless you KNOW you will love it.\nIf you aren't sure youll love it, get the older version.

The use of mods has changed my recommendation from very tenuously negative to very tenuously positive. The change from a red to a blue icon may seem dramatic, but in reality it's a very small change that just happened to push the game back into the Recommended zone for me.\n\nI am very appreciative of the feedback, both disagreeing and agreeing, that was put forth in a respectful and reasonable manner, but I do feel obliged to say that none of it convinced me to change my opinion. The decision to very, very cautiously recommend the game was made independently and based solely on more playtime.\n\nOnly a fool never revises his opinions.\n\nThis review assumes play on Normal difficulty.\n\n\nThe Short of It:\n\nAs a lover of the X-COM series, I've had a very hard time getting to enjoy this game, and the fact that I had to use mods to do so still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. XCOM 2 has a lot of great points going for it, but in some ways, Firaxis sabotaged many players' enjoyment of the game, and this is why I can only very, very caustiously recommend the game, and only to players who know full well what they are getting into.\n\n\nThe Long of It:\n\nXCOM 2 is set years after the XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within, and in the time that has passed, the aliens have established a seemingly peaceful (if slightly patronizing) relationship with humanity, creating a global government known as ADVENT. Humanity seems to prosper under the guidance of its alien benefactors, but all is not as it seems, and a hidden Resistance movement, founded from the remains of the old XCOM Project, is determined to expose the aliens for what they really are.\n\nIn the vein of its predecessor, XCOM 2 is a turn-based tactical strategy game, where your small squad exchanges fire with a superiour alien force, and only careful guidance from their Commander can help them survive. Once again, the odds are overwhelmingly in the enemy's favour, except this time, the aliens don't give you any breathing room, not even in the beginning.\n\nWhen you're not commanding your squad, you're constructing your base and researching new technologies, since apparently all the technological advances of the XCOM Project are... misplaced? Forgotten? I don't know. You simply give orders, and the crew of the Avenger, your new mobile base, starts work on the project you've requested, usually taking a set amount of days to complete the effort.\n\n\nThe Right of It:\n\nXCOM 2 improves the most - and really, only - glaring problem Enemy Unknown had, which was its extreme reactivity. The aliens always had the initiative, and the player had to chase after events. XCOM 2 fixes this to some degree, allowing you to decide when to strike at alien objectives. You'll still have to respond to missions (and bothersomely often), but you can be a lot more proactive now.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous, and plays smoothly when not bugging out. Tactical options are once again legion, and the base and world building aspect is fun if somewhat streamlined. Concealment mode is a nice addition, although hampered by a serious flaw, see below.\n\nClasses were well rebalanced. Snipers got slightly nerfed, going from omnipotent to 'merely' powerful, Supports are now much more useful and even necessary, Heavies are much more fun and versatile to use. Assaults still kill the crap out of everything.\n\nLastly, it has a lot of the qualities that made XCOM: Enemy Unknown so good, and those should  never be understated. XCOM 2 could have been even better than its stellar predecessor, if not for...\n\n\nThe Wrong of It:\n\nSome utterly incomprehensible desicions by Firaxis lie at the base of my ambivalent review of this game, most of which end up making the game actively hampering its own gameplay, especially in the early game.\n\nFirstly, and most importantly, making a turn-based strategy game and then making every single action and movement dependent on a timer is a very questionable decision. I agree, Overwatch Creeping was a lame strategy and had to be discouraged, but stringent timers that require beelining for objectives are a draconic measure. Many “seriously players” absolutely love the timers, and great for them, but they tend to forget that the timer is the same on Rookie as it is on Legend.\n\nA throttling timer is great for Legend difficulty, but on Normal, I want a tough challenge, but I also want to have some leeway, to be able to make one or two mistakes without being instantly brutalized, and to be able to maneuver instead of madly dashing for the objective and evac zone. The timer itself is a good thing, but scaling it to the difficulty would have solved so many problems.\n\nEven when you're not doing missions, you're constantly racing against the clock. Completion on the game-over Avatar Project goes punishingly quick, even on Normal, and you'll find yourself constantly chasing after main objectives to avoid getting strangled by yet another timer. Playing a strategy game on Normal shouldn't involve a feeling of constantly having a muton poking a pitchfork in your back to go faster! Faster dammit! Again, great for hardcore players who want to get gut-punched, but not for people who want a challenge without needing to min-max and learn stats by heart.\n\nTo exacerbate this problem, some enemies will make your careful positioning irrelevant by teleporting to a flanking position and then getting a free turn to put a soldier in the hospital – or make that the morgue. Faceless enemies are also highly unfair in the early game, revealing themselves whenever they like and then getting a free turn for an automatic hit. Stun Lancers will throw all caution to the wind and dash through withering overwatch fire just to get a hit in. It can be very frustrating in the early game without skills or equipment to counter it, especially with the draconic hospital times of 15 days or more. Sometimes it feels like “computer decides you take 6 points of damage,” and that's a shame.\n\nAlso important for a new player, the enemies have been bumped up compared to Enemy Unknown, and the early game can be a brutal meatgrinder. Enemies hit often and hard, even with full cover. Sectoids, encountered from the start, now have 8 health and can Mind Control, Mind Whip and Reanimate right off the bat. There's no occasion to warm up or even get to learn the ropes, you're dropped right onto Hamburger Hill and will have to endure serious punishment before you can start fighting back. Expect to burn through recruits quick in the beginning. A character so much as stubs his toe will spend over fifteen days in the hospital, so it'll be very hard to get any promotions in at first.\n\nLastly, the game is very poorly tested and this despite its pushed-back release date. Bugs are legion and immensely frustrating, some having serious gameplay consequences including soldier deaths.  The game also does not bother to explain its mechanics, just stacking objectives onto your cart with no explanation as to how or why you should achieve them. And I think only Firaxis know why they removed all the great Second Wave options.\n\n\nThe Last of It\n\nI wish I could gush about this game, I really do, but I find the decision to put stringent timers on all difficulties to seriously chip the paint, making players feel bullwhipped. As it stands, I can only carefully recommend this game, and respectfully advise all non-hardcore players to use mods to make the timer less brutal on standard difficulties. With the timer's grip lessened, the game becomes more enjoyable to many people.\n\nYes, “you can use mods”, but that's no excuse. Many developers these days have an attitude of “the community will fix it” and it's a bad attitude to have, and not one players shoul defend.","February 8","true","47.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","171"

Fun engaging, flexibility in manuvering your characters, as as well as specific and general skills associated with classes makes the engagements fun and interesting.

That is inexcusable.

Yes in the fact that its a good successor to the other xcom games, fun, interesting and engaging, deep complex combat, skills, and characters, challenging depending on the setting you put it at(set it at verteran or above be prepared to reload the game lol). And then No, for the bugginess of the game.\n\nI would say if you are willing to put up with the bugs, errors, and performance issues; Go for it, you won't be sorry. It is a great purchase.

The use of mods has changed my recommendation from very tenuously negative to very tenuously positive. The change from a red to a blue icon may seem dramatic, but in reality it's a very small change that just happened to push the game back into the Recommended zone for me.\n\nI am very appreciative of the feedback, both disagreeing and agreeing, that was put forth in a respectful and reasonable manner, but I do feel obliged to say that none of it convinced me to change my opinion. The decision to very, very cautiously recommend the game was made independently and based solely on more playtime.\n\nOnly a fool never revises his opinions.\n\nThis review assumes play on Normal difficulty.\n\n\nThe Short of It:\n\nAs a lover of the X-COM series, I've had a very hard time getting to enjoy this game, and the fact that I had to use mods to do so still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. XCOM 2 has a lot of great points going for it, but in some ways, Firaxis sabotaged many players' enjoyment of the game, and this is why I can only very, very caustiously recommend the game, and only to players who know full well what they are getting into.\n\n\nThe Long of It:\n\nXCOM 2 is set years after the XCOM: Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within, and in the time that has passed, the aliens have established a seemingly peaceful (if slightly patronizing) relationship with humanity, creating a global government known as ADVENT. Humanity seems to prosper under the guidance of its alien benefactors, but all is not as it seems, and a hidden Resistance movement, founded from the remains of the old XCOM Project, is determined to expose the aliens for what they really are.\n\nIn the vein of its predecessor, XCOM 2 is a turn-based tactical strategy game, where your small squad exchanges fire with a superiour alien force, and only careful guidance from their Commander can help them survive. Once again, the odds are overwhelmingly in the enemy's favour, except this time, the aliens don't give you any breathing room, not even in the beginning.\n\nWhen you're not commanding your squad, you're constructing your base and researching new technologies, since apparently all the technological advances of the XCOM Project are... misplaced? Forgotten? I don't know. You simply give orders, and the crew of the Avenger, your new mobile base, starts work on the project you've requested, usually taking a set amount of days to complete the effort.\n\n\nThe Right of It:\n\nXCOM 2 improves the most - and really, only - glaring problem Enemy Unknown had, which was its extreme reactivity. The aliens always had the initiative, and the player had to chase after events. XCOM 2 fixes this to some degree, allowing you to decide when to strike at alien objectives. You'll still have to respond to missions (and bothersomely often), but you can be a lot more proactive now.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous, and plays smoothly when not bugging out. Tactical options are once again legion, and the base and world building aspect is fun if somewhat streamlined. Concealment mode is a nice addition, although hampered by a serious flaw, see below.\n\nClasses were well rebalanced. Snipers got slightly nerfed, going from omnipotent to 'merely' powerful, Supports are now much more useful and even necessary, Heavies are much more fun and versatile to use. Assaults still kill the crap out of everything.\n\nLastly, it has a lot of the qualities that made XCOM: Enemy Unknown so good, and those should  never be understated. XCOM 2 could have been even better than its stellar predecessor, if not for...\n\n\nThe Wrong of It:\n\nSome utterly incomprehensible desicions by Firaxis lie at the base of my ambivalent review of this game, most of which end up making the game actively hampering its own gameplay, especially in the early game.\n\nFirstly, and most importantly, making a turn-based strategy game and then making every single action and movement dependent on a timer is a very questionable decision. I agree, Overwatch Creeping was a lame strategy and had to be discouraged, but stringent timers that require beelining for objectives are a draconic measure. Many “seriously players” absolutely love the timers, and great for them, but they tend to forget that the timer is the same on Rookie as it is on Legend.\n\nA throttling timer is great for Legend difficulty, but on Normal, I want a tough challenge, but I also want to have some leeway, to be able to make one or two mistakes without being instantly brutalized, and to be able to maneuver instead of madly dashing for the objective and evac zone. The timer itself is a good thing, but scaling it to the difficulty would have solved so many problems.\n\nEven when you're not doing missions, you're constantly racing against the clock. Completion on the game-over Avatar Project goes punishingly quick, even on Normal, and you'll find yourself constantly chasing after main objectives to avoid getting strangled by yet another timer. Playing a strategy game on Normal shouldn't involve a feeling of constantly having a muton poking a pitchfork in your back to go faster! Faster dammit! Again, great for hardcore players who want to get gut-punched, but not for people who want a challenge without needing to min-max and learn stats by heart.\n\nTo exacerbate this problem, some enemies will make your careful positioning irrelevant by teleporting to a flanking position and then getting a free turn to put a soldier in the hospital – or make that the morgue. Faceless enemies are also highly unfair in the early game, revealing themselves whenever they like and then getting a free turn for an automatic hit. Stun Lancers will throw all caution to the wind and dash through withering overwatch fire just to get a hit in. It can be very frustrating in the early game without skills or equipment to counter it, especially with the draconic hospital times of 15 days or more. Sometimes it feels like “computer decides you take 6 points of damage,” and that's a shame.\n\nAlso important for a new player, the enemies have been bumped up compared to Enemy Unknown, and the early game can be a brutal meatgrinder. Enemies hit often and hard, even with full cover. Sectoids, encountered from the start, now have 8 health and can Mind Control, Mind Whip and Reanimate right off the bat. There's no occasion to warm up or even get to learn the ropes, you're dropped right onto Hamburger Hill and will have to endure serious punishment before you can start fighting back. Expect to burn through recruits quick in the beginning. A character so much as stubs his toe will spend over fifteen days in the hospital, so it'll be very hard to get any promotions in at first.\n\nLastly, the game is very poorly tested and this despite its pushed-back release date. Bugs are legion and immensely frustrating, some having serious gameplay consequences including soldier deaths.  The game also does not bother to explain its mechanics, just stacking objectives onto your cart with no explanation as to how or why you should achieve them. And I think only Firaxis know why they removed all the great Second Wave options.\n\n\nThe Last of It\n\nI wish I could gush about this game, I really do, but I find the decision to put stringent timers on all difficulties to seriously chip the paint, making players feel bullwhipped. As it stands, I can only carefully recommend this game, and respectfully advise all non-hardcore players to use mods to make the timer less brutal on standard difficulties. With the timer's grip lessened, the game becomes more enjoyable to many people.\n\nYes, “you can use mods”, but that's no excuse. Many developers these days have an attitude of “the community will fix it” and it's a bad attitude to have, and not one players shoul defend.","February 8","true","47.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","171"

Fun engaging, flexibility in manuvering your characters, as as well as specific and general skills associated with classes makes the engagements fun and interesting.  It is also a beautiful game.\n\nHowever; the game is a bit buggy, and suffers from framerate dips. I have a 4.2 ghz 5820k 16GB ddr4 2667mhz, 980GTX and i was getting sometimes 15-30 fps at times. That is inexcusable. Combine that with the occasional graphical glitch or black screen with the UI overlay "alien activity" with sound the only indicator the game did not crash.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes and no. Yes in the fact that its a good successor to the other xcom games, fun, interesting and engaging, deep complex combat, skills, and characters, challenging depending on the setting you put it at(set it at verteran or above be prepared to reload the game lol). And then No, for the bugginess of the game.\n\nI would say if you are willing to put up with the bugs, errors, and performance issues; Go for it, you won't be sorry. It is a great purchase.

Apparently, the base management is alot more streamlined making you be able to get to combat quicker. The graphics for the game on ultra are kind of sub-par.

Stuck animations, i.e. the constricted animation not ending after constriction has been released.\n\nWhen Batman AK and BF4 launched they both released in better shape than this game and were torn to pieces by the media and gamers alike, somehow it feels like Firaxis have gotten away with it and I have no idea why.

Even then, it felt really good.\n\nThis was my first XCOM game that I actually played, by the time I had EU, I was already playing this, so that's that.\n\nThe modding community is also great, Bob Ross confirmed for best sniper 2016. Halo armor, MGS Armor, a lot of stuff.\n\nMultiplayer feels really quirky, but it was fun, based off of my one game in it.\n\nSteam controller is also really great on this, if you happen to have that.\n\nEven if this game leaves your life in shambles, this game has a wonderful conclusion that feels rewarding when you reach it, even if you aren't a fan of turn-based-strategy games, I'd still recommend this to anyone.\n\n10/10\n","March 13","true","45.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

There's a lot of new things, and some stream lining elements that make some things outside of combat better. But at the heart is the tactical combat gameplay, and that's really gone another direction from the previous XCOM. I personally do not enjoy the timed mission element on every single mission. I know other people do and that's fine. While this change is different compared to the first XCOM, it becomes a pain when every mission is timed. You have to throw caution to the wind to complete the objective, and the game punishes you for that. And if you fail, then game punishes you just as severly in a different way.\n\nThere's no slow and steady in this game, that tactic is gone. It's now balls to the wall rushing into bad cover and getting nailed. But don't forget to flank! Oh wait, you now can miss quite easily while flanking. Get used to missing even with good shots. I don't think there is even much point to flanking, as you easily get out flanked when flanking. So the risk vs reward isn't there at all. But it seems the AI doesn't have any issue hitting your troops and they will hammer you even when you're in full cover.\n\nThis game is quite different to the first XCOM, and I honestly don't like XCOM 2 at all. I'm going back to the original which had the right amount of risk vs reward to it.","February 24","false","26.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Overall opinion? Holy hell this is a GREAT sequel!!!\n\nWhat you WON'T get... Fighters, Skyranger Upgrades, UFO Intercepts, Gene tweaked soldiers, Tanks/Vehicles, MEC Troopers, EXALT, or The same 6 maps over and over and over again.\n\nWhat WILL you get? PLOT! XCOM 2 actually has a story to the campaign, the mechanics of it can make some elements frustrating, but overall this is a VAST improvement. Did you hate Meld timers in EW? Well brace yourself, XCOM 2 makes a LOT of use of timers, albeit much more generous ones. Aside from the elements mentioned, almost everything else traditional about "XCOM" and similar titles is here, and generally improved upon. Soldier customization, for example, goes beyond what most MMOs will allow you to do with your character.\n\nThe game creates all the maps you play on right before loading so you will never see the exact same map twice. While awesome, this feature seems to result in load times that are just a hair on the longish side for modern games. Maps still generally take less than 1 minute to load and, imo, its WELL worth it to have different maps EACH mission. Which brings me to the next "issue" with XCOM 2, if you want to nitpick, this thing pushes your cpu cores and gpu FAR FAR harder than its predecessor ever dreamt of. I don't know if this is due to sloppy optimization or just that they crammed that much more under the hood, but my GTX 650ti still handled the game rather well, if on some seriously low end settings. Interestingly, the game still looks better than the previous title even on these lower settings.\n\nOne thing I am on the fence about is that, in this title, you are pushed to move. Your enemy is working on its ultimate 'I win' project and it cannot be stopped by you during game play, only delayed. This removes the option to go everywhere, do all the side missions, and finish the "Alien Menace" at your whim. While, at times, it can seem that the enemy will finish long before you are prepared, 2K was very good about balancing out pacing, and your ability to reduce their progress. For example: At one point they were nearly 3/4 the way finished before I did several major missions back to back and pushed them back to zero. As normal, once you begin the endgame you no longer have access to most of the game features and you have to make do with your soldiers as they are with whatever gear you have in your inventory. On the upside, if you are REALLY short handed for some reason, critical missions will allow you to bring wounded soldiers.\n\nConstruction order is a bit trickier in this title than others in the same vein, I nearly screwed myself by ignoring the radio room while pursuing psionic tech and soldiers. You WILL spend a lot more time thinking out the consequences of what to build and when. The developers did a fabulous job of simulating the difference between XCOM as a super-black op with funding from around the globe versus XCOM as a barely existent guerrilla force only marginally better equipped than a militia.\n\nThere are tons and tons of little things in this game that make it an absolutely fantastic TBS, and entry into the XCOM franchise. The addition of a story and some very RPG elements bring the game to the next level, especially when combined with the amazingly robust modding tools 2K provided. The possibilities are mind blowing, and if the mod authors embrace this title, its one we will still be playing 10 years from now and enjoying new stories and user made content. Obviously this also lends itself to giving 2K a huge opportunity for tons of DLC which can help keep the game fresh, interesting and new for years to come.\n\nThis one is definitely a "must own" for fans of TBS or XCOM.","February 7","true","72.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

The graphics were a little quirky, but it sort of reminded me of that final fantasy movie they did a while ago where ghosts had taken over the planet. The futuristic setting however was nice and it is clear that the there have been many advances in 3d character rendering. The story however was strangely interrupted by having to click the mouse on some icons on the screen, but fortunately for the most part, you were told exactly what icons to click and where. from what i gather online, the ending is a little dull and took a large number of random mouse clicking events to get to.. I guess this is a new thing in movies? I didn't appreciate the female engineer or female close combat expert. Nobody believes that women are either good at, or interested in, engineering or combat, so please stop pretending they are. This movie did not crash for me, or use up all my memory, but then, I do have a reasonably powerful computer. At £35 a go, and a 25GB download however, I think there are much better movies out there. I would recommend instead Oblivion, because the graphics are better\nin that one.\n\nWait... this was suppose to be a game? ah well if we are talking about this as a game....\n\nThe original enemy unknown game came with a large box, a full printed instruction manual, a digital carriage clock, and game disks that had fully been tested for bugs.

And also, about 50% of reviews saying that it is buggy and crashes, or won't run on their system, so not even your "one time digital license download product" was good for those people.

I can't even imagine what they were thinking with building a whole class on swords.  And then the melee enemies are just brainless.  They run towards you, hit you with a stun baton that somwhow does the same damage as a railgun, and are just left standing out in the middle of the field.  You auto-hit-auto-crit them and that's it.  Melee only works if they were to get in the same square as you so guns couldn't be used.  Like, you know, every minis game ever made?  That would be cool.  (Like the snake, but without the ability for me to shoot the snake off.)\n\nExplosions.  XCom 1 was super hard because you couldn't rely on explosives.  Destroying the Weapon Fragments was too much of a penalty.  But here it is open season.  Every Grenadier can have a grenade launcher and three plasma grenades.  They automatically destroy just about any terrain.  Including entire houses.  So carpet bomb, shoot the stragglers in the open, laugh at people who use the sword class.  Take 5 grenadiers and a sniper.  There will be no terrain left.\n\nResearch.  I can't pick the kind of grenade I research?  Seriously?  How does that even make sense?  You don't accidentally make a gas grenade while designing a flame grenade.  And if you do, apparently the mistake isn't repeatable because you get a different grenade next time.  And getting HazMat instead of Stasis armor just makes me cry.  (Prevent 2 damage from one type of enemy vs just heal 8.)\n\nStartup.  In Long War, you start with six doods and they have multiple inventory slots you can customize with all kinds of Earth-standard accessories.  In 2, you have four and you have to loot an elite alien soldier if you want a WEAPON STOCK.\n\nMind control. Omg, mind control.  Sectoids with mind control are in the very first fight here.  Besides the fact that anyone who has taken a game design class or has a soul knows that mind control is something you just don't do in a game, it happens in the first fight.  On easy.  And in the final boss fight, you have a 7 man squad, and they have 3 guys with mind control who teleport off screen if you shoot them.  Even worse than 1's boss fight, which is amazing.\n\nWorld map.  Why is there even a world map any more?  You don't set up radar stations to detect UFOs to shoot down.  You just click on a mission icon and click on "Wait here 7 days".\n\nLine of sight.  If you have squidgy rules for what constitutes LOS, don't move the camera down low to show me exactly how bad your math is.  Stay high and let me pretend that the guy did have a shot.  And the icon on enemy for "you can see them from the square you are mousing over" is hilarious when there is no way to get both on the screen at the same time because of camera angle and zoom cap.\n\nSnake guys.  That tongue.  Seriously.  It takes precisely one tongue attack to realize what a bad idea being able to drag my dood through walls and windows and trees and rocks from 50 feet away.  A) Where does he keep that tongue normally?  2) Ten second brainstorm- an abductor alien type with a gun that shoots a short range teleport taser.  Bam.  Problem solved.  No dragging across the ground.\n\nBase building.  The workshop is equivalent to one enginer.  The lab is worth one scientist.  Adjacency bonuses are gone so there is no planning.\n\nProving Ground.  How come some projects are pay once and your team gets unlimited copies and some projects only give you one?  And how come they don't tell you that before you click?\n\nChyssalids. The ultimate terror from the first game is just a gimpy stun-baton guy who hides under ground.  How do they know where to hide, come to think of it.  They can't burrow horizontally.  So it's just a gimick to get a free hand-to-hand attack because their melee is such a great system it should be showcased.\n\nEwoks.  Melee does the same damage to doods in power armor as a rail gun.  I'm sure it is a very nice stun baton, FN-TR8R, but I have power armor and a RAILGUN.

It's true, mostly. XCOM 2 cannot maintain a stable framerate to save its life. Many of the bugs and other issues with visuals return from X:EW. This is true even on the highest end hardware, and its really dissapointing to see a dedicated PC game suffer so much right out the door.\n\nIf you can get past these issues however, XCOM 2 is an absolute blast to play. The new setting and excelent evolution of the mechanics already established in Enemy Unkown and Within, as well as new featues like concealment and a robust melee system, and use them to form an all-you-can-eat buffet of turn based tactics. Yet despite the fantastic new abilites of your soliders and the rival aliens, none of it feels too unfair.\n\nThe RNG is still merciless, but more options for garunteed damage and ways to get the maximum efficency out of your turn mean that you have to contend with it far less often. At the same time, it still definitelty retains the "That's XCOM baby!" feeling of having the odds suddenly flip for or against you in a single bold move.\n\nThe only complaint I see some people having is the turn limit placed on some missions. And while it doesn't bother me personally, I can see some people who enjoy taking their time on missions struggling against it.\n\nThankfully, XCOM 2 gives nigh-unrivaled access to its inner workings, thanks to direct access to the same tools used to build the game, downloadable for free with purchase of the game. Even without these, you have ready acess to easily manipulated INI setting, allowing you to change many aspects of the game with little to no experience necessary. And that's just day one. In a few weeks or months, people will probably be able to customize every aspect of their XCOM 2 experience.\n\nAs such, I highly reccomend it to anyone who enjoys turn based strategy games. If you're worried about performance however, it may be worth your while to hold back a while. After all, the game can only get better from here.","February 5","true","94.2"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

The poor optimization makes my hardware scream for a break after a single mission. I can fulfill the recommended requirements yet I have to run the game on minimum settings to spare my PC and still It just barely manages to stay above 30fps...\n\nThat aside there's just too many game/immersion breaking bugs at this moment. Think it's a good idea to run up in cover and throw your grenade or flashbang? Somehow that destroys the car/tree you just took cover behind likely killing your unit. Get used to bradford/shen/tygan yellling at you repeatedly every mission and with every decision you make inbetween. Fine with your first playthrough but lordy lord do they get stale and annoying to listen to quick. Frustrating and hilarious how the audio option for them does absolutely nothing. Reducing beginner voice over hardly makes any difference. You also should get used to seeing enemies teleport and fall through the map. Often the pods with robots on a higher level than the rest of the map will just dissapear into the structures when engaged and stay out of the fight. Atleast the flying enemies will stay in the fight despite often glitching through the map upon moving...\nLast mission is just snafu in that explosives become impossible to land other than in the tile right next to your unit. Like sure it's supposed to be hard but WTF, they consider this acceptable?\n\nDevs seriously need to fix their game instead of making a fool out of themselves with irrelevant DLC that has actually made the game run even worse somehow!

They responded to this problem by adding difficulty, not by restricting the number of turns available to finish a mission or by making the enemy AI better, but by upping the enemy HP and throwing more of them at you than is reasonable.\n\nI'm on the first terrorizing mission of the game.  My squad size is four.  It's impossible at this point to have increased it to five because there haven't been enough missions to get someone to sargeant rank.  When I move forward for the first time on the map I uncover five enemies.  They each take a volley from my entire squad to take down.  The five enemies are: a sectoid, two commanders, and two stun lancers.  One of the civillians next to me is actually a shape shifter.  If I kill anyone other than the sectoid in the first round, it's immediately resurrected as a zombie.  The shape shifter gets to reveal itself and attack in the same turn regardless of whether or not I get close enough to it to make it transform.  There is literally no way for me to avoid having at least one stun lancer running through my party knocking people unconscious after the second round.\n\nXCOM - you didn't make this game more challening by making it more unfair.

The difficulty is steep but for those who like hard games this may be part of the appeal. Performance concerns addressed below(zero spoilers) -\n\nFor the record my rig is running a Radeon 380 GPU and FX6300 CPU, so nothing too fancy. Upper mid level at best. Now then...\n\nLittle more in depth(NO SPOILERS):\nXCOM 2 goes the opposite direction of the first game in terms of plot. Rather than defending the Earth or, as Sid Meier put it, "playing not to lose", XCOM 2 puts you in the role of the resistance fighters after the aliens won 20 years prior. Some old characters return, with a cast of new ones as well, and the roster of enemies to kill has increased by quite a bit.\n\nGraphically the game looks pretty great. I had lag when I first booted up at the main menu but it was because the game defaulted to maxed out settings. Although my GPU isn't at the very top of the line, it is now running the game quite splendidly with all of the settings maxed except Anti-Aliasing. For some reason that's the only setting that seems to be giving my rig trouble. But it still looks pretty good with that turned down.\n\nSound-wise, it's pretty standard fare. Dramatic music when the xenos spot you, triumphant orchestras when outfitting your squad. It does its work, sounds high quality, and is pleasant to hear but isn't spectacular. But not every studio can afford to hire Jeremy Soule.\n\nPerformance(CPU) could be better. Considering this is day 1 of release I'm not surprised that the optimization is what it is. Loading screens sometimes lag, turns take maybe a second or two longer than you feel that they should, but overall it's not dreadful. I haven't had any freezing in game at all. Compared to some releases, XCOM 2 feels pretty smooth. My old FX6300 doesn't have any trouble with it, and that's a lower-mid AMD chip.\n\nGameplay is what you would expect from XCOM. Fans of the last game will be able to pretty much jump right into the action. Start off with rookies and no special equipment, promote them as they gain experience and skills, cry when your favorite soldier gets killed by a rogue laser... good stuff. The chance to hit with each attack is percentile based, so bare that in mind. Some players may not enjoy that aspect. Difficulty can be adjusted however so if the game feels too hardcore you may still find a level you enjoy.\n\n\nGraphics - 9/10\nSound - 8.5/10\nGameplay - 9/10\n","February 5","true","27.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

That game was XCOM: Enemy Unknown, rebooted from a series once known as X-COM and it went on to win not just the pleasure of old fans but gain new fans as well.\n\nXCOM 2 is the sequel to Enemy Unknown. Storywise, everything that happened in Enemy Unknown was a fake. The Commander was really a prisoner to the alien invaders and Earth has been conquered and ruled by the aliens with a faction of apparent human symphatizers called ADVENT. As the Commander, you're freed at the beginning of the game and once again, it's up to you to lead the forces of Earth against the aliens, only this time you'll be the attacker.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, XCOM 2 is mostly the same. You try your best to keep your soldiers in the best cover you can find and launch attacks on your enemies. What changes is that this time, you start out in Concealment mode. The enemy won't know where you are until you attack or get spotted by them, so this is where strategy comes in as you'll have to pick a perfect opportunity to ambush the enemy. Sounds simple? Well, it wouldn't be XCOM if it was simple now, wouldn't it? This time, certain missions also feature a turn timer which shows how many turns you can take before you fail the mission. With that in mind, you have to get to an objective as quickly as you can while also keeping an eye on the timer. While it may seem like a rush, the timer is mostly fair. You do have enough time to get to an objective, you just need to make the most of Concealment mode. Another new element to the game is the more destructible environment. Putting all of your soldiers on top of a building may not always be such a good idea.\n\nAnd stopping you from reaching those objectives would be the aliens now bolstered by ranks of so-called human volunteers. Some aliens make a return like the Sectoid and Muton but even the ones that returned have completely evolved or have been upgraded. Sectoids are no longer cannon fodder, Floaters have been upgraded to the angelic-looking Archons and the dreaded Sectopods return in a slimmer yet more powerful design. One way or another, the aliens are going to ruin your day, each of them with their own unique way.\n\nAll is not lost however. Your soldiers may be outnumbered and outgunned, but they're no pushovers. The classes are both similar and different from Enemy Unknown. Snipers now known as Sharpshooters not only make use of Sniper rifles but can learn to use pistols like a gunslinger from the Old West. A new class called the Ranger employs a high-risk, high reward combat style to slash the enemy with swords in melee combat. With the destructible environments, the Grenadier basically becomes the most powerful and valuable class you can have in your squad as you can blow enemies off buildings or those hiding behind cars and other explosive objects. Most importantly, you also can blow up walls and obstacles so that you can reach a objective faster. Rest assured, you're going to have a lot of fun doing that.\n\nWhile XCOM 2 doesn't disappoint in its gameplay, it does in it's optimization. You'd think that having it as a PC-exclusive would make it easier for Firaxis to release a more polished game but nope, that didn't happen. The game is buggy like hell, at least it's mostly visual bugs  but still it can ruin the experience a little bit, especially for the last mission. There's also other weird problems like the aliens' turn taking too long, sudden framerate drops and the like but most players didn't experience anything game-breaking. Hopefully, Firaxis fixes the game soon.\n\nAll in all, XCOM 2 is a fantastic game and is a textbook example of what devs should do when making a sequel (not the bugs though). If you're one for great turn-based combat and you can stand the pain of watching your men and women die horribly in combat, then you'll love XCOM 2. Just remember when you miss a 95% shot, that's XCOM, baby.","March 19","true","52.8"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

The mechanics have been shifted past the point of 'frustratingly difficult' to simply 'unfun'.  The randomness generated is not balanced around Ironman or higher difficulties, much less both.  This can lead to, say, your third mission blasting you with three or four Vipers; opponents who stunlock your team one at a time.  When you encounter three opponents who can stunlock you in one pack, and you haven't gotten past a 4 man squad, you immediately lose.\n\nThis isn't a roguelike where I have some option of variety in the first few levels.  RNG can just wipe out twenty hours.  The game is buggy, but more than that; it's just unfun.","March 2","false","36.1"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

The plot boils down to this: extraterrestrial beings have taken over the world and it's your job to take it back. You need to dissect aliens and research their technology in order to find out more about them and come up with ways of defeating them.\n\nPositive:\nThe game plays extremely similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Taking cover, shooting, researching, upgrading your base and many other things feel very similar. There are, however, new features that are all built upon that rock solid base that we, or I, know and love. My personal favourite and in my opinion biggest feature is a stealth mode. You can't Metal Gear Solid the game up by silently taking down enemies, but you can now avoid them, sneak around them to set up ambushes and create massive tactical advantages. The game also features a load of new enemies. Most old enemies from XCOM: Enemy Unknown have been genetically modified using human DNA, making for more powerful enemies than ever before, because YES, this game is HARD. I recommend people who aren't familiar with XCOM play XCOM: Enemy Unknown before picking this up.\n\nSomething XCOM: Enemy Unknown was, in my opinion, already good at got massively improved: character customization! The higher the level of your character, the more you can unlock and the more unique your characters will become. I am a massive fan of extensive character customization and I absolutely love playing around with the customizer in this game. It has a load of options and features something for everyone's taste: wacky, tactical or whatever's inbetween, it's in there somewhere.\n\nNegative:\nI don't have many problems with this game, except for it's framerate. I recommend you watch out with this if your PC has low specifications, because I run it at 30 to 40 FPS, even though this PC can easily handle GTA V on some of the highest settings and still run it at a smooth 60 FPS.\n\n\nMy verdict:\nA solid 8.5/10","February 5","true","55.6"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

There's always some great new, game-changing upgrade just a turn or two away; maddeningly challenging (but not unfair) battles, personality, and a scenario that you can really get into (alien occupation and human resistance).\n\nI really liked the previous XCom as well as the classic Xcom. If you enjoyed those games, I don't see why you wouldn't like this one. If you're not familiar with the franchise, imagine a turn-based strategy version of something like Deus Ex. Don't be put off by "turn-based." This game isn't boring at all, and you will APPRECIATE the time it gives you to plan each move, because each move counts. This game isn't about actions per second; it's about contemplating every possible move and choosing the most viable option.\n\nOne last thing--most games, even ones I enjoy, I look forward to ending them and moving on to the next great game. With Xcom 2, though, I put off the story missions and tried to stretch it out as long as I could. I would've put quite happy to play for another 20-30 hours, and am already looking forward to whatever DLC is planned for it.\n\nIn short: Great buy, even at full price.

I should say I have never looked at FPS counters in games and would only complain if the game was stuttering and impeding my ability to play the game and it isn't, I have noticed some stuttering in the cut scenes and a few times the camera pauses for a few seconds too long but that's it so far - I should also say I have not touched the graphics options so far and am just playing on what the game recommended for my PC on launch so I could probably improve the performance more so if needed.\n\nPeople have also complained about turn timers, I was unsure at first but really like them now, great feeling when you extract your squad with only 1 turn to go!  Makes the game more interesting for me - I used to camp and try to draw the enemy to me in the first game which artificually lengthened missions and did bore me occasionally, I cannot do that any more, at least on the majority of missions and I love it.  The timers also fit the 'guerrilla' theme of the game which I love.  I have noticed there are already mods available to remove and tweak the turn timers as well so this could help people who cannot learn to love the mechanic.\n\nAlso, the fact modding is intergrated through the steam workshop is brilliant as it makes it more accesilbe to people like me and will only go onto enhance the game and increase it's longevity - which will be good anyway as this games is made to be replayed!\n\nAnyway, as I said, for me, I love the game and it is running fine on my PC.

I absolutely hate this game, and wish I hadn't thrown away $60 on such an unpolished mess.\n\nMy main problems with XCOM 2 are (in no order):\nThe game does a very poor job of informing the player about vital mechanics.\nI hate all four characters: Tygan, Shen, the pilot, and Mass Effect's The Elusive Man after about 80 more years of heavy chainsmoking.\nThe game is way too difficult during the first third, especially for a first-time player.\nEnemy abilities are never explained. Unless you know beforehand, you have to risk your pawns' very important lives just to know how to fight enemies you've canonically seen before in some form.\nAttack range is never explicitly shown. FF Tactics: Advance managed to do this beautifully 13 years ago on the GBA.\nTo manually path around hazards, you have to waste a move rather than the game having a competent pathing system.\nThere are too many things happening at any time on the overworld. I have like 6 things to scan, 3 dark events going on, a resistance raid, Avatar Project targets, monthly reports, and research all overlapping each other.\nThe game never tells you that a sniper can't fire his rifle after moving.\nFor some reason, a soldier will be gravely wounded after taking only 4 damage out of 17 health, and I've healed it with a medkit.\nSupplies are too scarce for the first third of the game. By the final third, I contantly had over 2000 that I couldn't spend on anything.\nUnless you've already played through XCOM 2, you will not properly lay out the additional rooms you can add to your ship unless you spend even more time and supplies fixing it.\nAfter you beat it, it plays some cutscenes, and that's it. No New Game + or anything.\nSoldiers' voices will often glitch, and play in a language, sometimes even gender, other than what's selected.\nIt's often far too difficult to click on specific tiles when targeting abilities like melee attacks and grenades.\nIt seems like Vipers can grab you from literally across the map.\nYou can have your engineers build "experimental" armor, weapons, grenades, and ammunition. This actually means that you throw away at least one elerium core and wait 7-30 days for a random item in that category that you may already have.","April 10","false","41.5"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

CLARIFICATION: you can take as long as you want to make your moves, the only limit is the number of turns you get.). Be aware that there's already mods that increase the turn limit or get rid of it completely, so if it's really not your thing, you can easily play the game differently. But I think the frequent time pressure is great and it improves the game. Here's why:\n\n-having to manage time as a resource IS strategic, contrary to some opinions. While it does remove the option to take it absolutely slow and cautious, so far, I've found there's plenty of wiggle room and making a mad dash for the objective is NOT your only option.\n\n-time pressure is thematically very coherent with the game's premise of being resistance fighters. Not having it would create ludo-narrative dissonance.\n\n-what the turn limit basically does is force you to give up the most effective XCOM: EU play-style, which is take it super slow, only activate one bunch of enemies at a time, spam overwatch and reload after each encounter. Unless you didn't care about winning, XCOM forced you to play like that. There were no rewards for finishing early, afaik (there were some rewards for taking risks in the expansion, though). Favouring such a slow playstyle is a bit like wasting the player's time.\n\n-time pressure lets you experience a different, thrilling playstyle the same way playing without saves (ironman mode, iirc) helps you enjoy the game in a different way that you probably wouldn't, with saves enabled. Unless you're super disciplined, you know you end up reloading when your favorite soldier dies. Same goes for taking yet another turn, reload- and overwatch-spamming.\n\nMISC COOL STUFF:\n-A memorial for your soldiers with the option to write them an epitaph. So far, my only casualty's reads: "Whatshername will not be forgotten."\n\n-Enemy Reinforcements: (not sure, if these also happened in XCOM: EU). It totally fits the scenario and it's very exciting to see a dropship come in and worry about what it might bring, as well as very satisfying to set up an ambush for them and wipe them when their feet touch the ground.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nIf you liked XCOM:EU, you'll love this one. Give it a try as it is, and if you absolutely must play ultra-slow, simply use a mod.","February 9","true","70.6"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"

This is everything you expect and 100x more.\nDifficulty is up to 10, but not to the point where you get frustrated, but to the the point where you feel so motivated to complete the mission.\nThe addition of time pressure to the game overall, as the Alien's secret weapon is in construction, time is of the essence, every second and every move you make in the World Map is crucial, don't waste time or you will feel the consequences.\nThe graphics themselves are wonderful, nothing to write home about, but a definite improvement.\nThe newly added character customisation also adds a whole new experience as you can create your own units or even escort units. The customistation is quite developed for a game like this.\nOverwatch ability can also create some wonderful moments which can either make you full of pride, as you witness your units totally wreck the opponent or leave you out in the open for attacks.\nBut as always, games like these arent perfect. The whole chance to hit system still feels ♥♥♥♥ed, but not as bad as before. The whole 'you're next to a guy but you have 60% chance to hit' can be aggrevating. But for me atleast it didn't happen too often. Everyone's game experiences varies in how badly ♥♥♥♥ed they can get because of it.\nThe story is a unique one, normally we're defending earth, but now we are trying to take it back from the aliens. It's loosely attached to Enemy Unknown, so if you havent played that you can still play this without knowing what happened before.","February 28","true","52.7"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

Let me break it down to pretty bullet points for you, in case you need help deciding whether to purchase this.\n\nPROS:\n- Strong theme and backstory, quite a mysterious plot.\n- Looks awesome, art direction is exquisite.\n- Tense! Some battles can really get your heart pumping.\n- Interesting mechanic for the strategy map.\n- Deep and fun soldier customization.\n- Diverse enemies and mission objectives add variety.\n- Long campaign!\n\nCONS:\n- Bad dice rolls can be cruelly unfair. Part of the game, tho! It's XCOM!\n- The first run (with the tutorial ON, that is) is too frantic for my taste. I like to be left alone.\n- Has some performance issues. Firaxis appears to be working hard on fixing them.\n- I've seen a few glitches and quirks. Bugs, that is.\n- Rather pricey, considering the above.\n\nCONCLUSION: 9/10, would name my gunner "Silvester Stallone" again.","February 28","true","75.4"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"

Yes it seemed to take ages loading up missions which was weird and unexpected but it ran smoothly.  However after the last patch the whole damn thing has gone down the toilet.  The missions now take twice as long to load and most of the time crash my entire computer while trying.  Never seen a patch to fix issues actually cause more and bigger issues at the same time, great work Firaxis, nicely done.\n\nAlso in game, when it works, there are stupid issues that have been included for no other reason than to ramp up the difficulty even on easy level.  Snake creatures that have a tongue so long it can lash out and grab your soldier even when the creature is out of range of your guns?!  How the f**k is that fair!  An enemy soldier with a stun rod who can dash further than your soldiers and still attack you at the end of his run?  Introducing more powerful enemy soldiers every other mission while your guys fumble around with the same gear they had to start with despite you trying to research as fast as possible.  This isn't a fair learning curve for a game no matter what Firaxis and some on here may say.  You can make it difficult, if thats what you really want to do, while still making it fair to the player.\n\nAlso, and this really gets me ♥♥♥♥♥♥, why do people give the game a thumbs up then say about all the bugs and problems it has?  How can you rate a game good them complain about it?

You would have to go a long way to beat it and I have to say that Firaxis have gone so far past that mark that you will need the hubble telescope.\n\nIts visually stunning and the gameplay still captures what is all good and great about Xcom games. I have played the first 4 or 5 missions and Im blown away. I have been looking forward to this game for months and im not dissapointed. Shame I have work in the morning and have to sleep with the 11pm launch and all.\n\nStill a few first day bugs which im sure will be ironed out. These relate to cutscenes and mainly experianced with the launch of the skyranger for missions. It goes out of synch but this is a minor annoyance. The soldiers moving animations can also seem a little jumpy at times but not so much that i care so far\n\nSoldier customisations are great and I spent an hour or so messing with my guys and girls some fun looks but also some really cool ones too. Combat is still as good as ever but one little niggle is the cutscene of the soldiers face everytime they shoot. In Xcom you only saw this on a kill so everytime seems excessive but the gun animation and sounds are good. Hacking for in mission power ups is a nice touch as is the soldier panic. When a soldier panics he can randomly run off and take a shot which actually finished a mission for me :) Would like to be able to select my own soldier classes on promotion though as that was great in LW but we will see how this goes.Research looks varied and interesting and I like I can pick up gear from drops of dead enemies rpg style.\n\nAll in all this was worth the wait and I would highly recommend it to anyone with a passing interest in turn based comabt mecahincs.

It's a brand new game!\n\nNow something more serious: Performance updates will surely come, either official from Firaxis or unofficial from the modding community, just give them some time, because the game needs them.\n\nGameplay wise, there are a lot of mechanics that EU/EW didn't have (some were introduced in Long War mod), and many things now work like they were supposed to, like removing overwatch with damage, it was strange in EU/EW to throw a grenade to the face of an enemy and nope, he is still overwatching.\n\nThe randomly generated maps good and gives good replayability potential, which is VERY important in a single player game.\n\nPeople complain the turn limit is the worst thing... I'm not sure about you but going blue move into overwatch (which I believe has been buffed btw, its now 0.9 instead of 0.7 penalty) for all my soldiers isn't exactly what I call "fun", that's one of the reasons turn limit was implemented. You have concealment most of the times and you can rush for the first two turns. This isn't about exploiting the most OP strategy, it's just doing what you think it's the best to do each turn while staying alive.\n\nTL;DR: Good game, buy if you have good PC. If not, stay alert and wait until performance patches come unless you want to play on 30- fps or min settings (it is playable, it's not that bad).

The game itself first and foremost caters to the XCOM: Enemy Within fan, it not only refines the mechanics seen in the previous games but it added new ones as well. The classes are distinct from one another and gives you the player greater tactical choice in your gameplay. But by far the best new item added is the concealment option which pretty much means that your team is invisible to all enemies until they are either detected via patrol or more often than not via an ambush you have setup.\n\nThe story and atmosphere from what I have seen in sublime, the game pulls in no stops from telling you that you lost the previous war and that right now, XCOM are considered terrorists, this is a huge step up both thematically and mechanically as well since the aforementioned concealment mechanic makes so much sense.\n\nThe mods will also bring in so much life to this game, as of writing this, there are 3 main mods that can easily be added to the game via Steam Workshop.\n\n\nIf I have one gripe I would point to the performance, it's not gamebreaking but it is a hassle and it is obvious, I struggle to get a smooth 60FPS with many of the filters turned off, I run an I5 3570K with a GTX680, not the top of the line setup admittedly but it should have handled the game better than it did.","February 4","true","7.2"," 58 of 113 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","58","113","4","2"

Launch day issues have been very minor at best, my frame rate only seemed to drop during loading screens until the mission was loaded then returned to normal 60+. The customizations, difficulty, alien types all add to the vast replayability to the game and there are different paths you can take early on to determine how you want to play, instead of building satelites. Modding adds even far more to the game, and devs have given the tools they used to make the game to modders to expand upon that (name a dev that does that).","February 7","true","95.3"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","22","42","0","1"

I only unlocked a few grenades and some vests on my first playthrough and they went on every mission. Can't wait to unlock new interesting items.\n\n+You can play your own way. I finished the game without recruiting a single Psi Operative.\n\n+Every non-story map is procedurally generated, I have yet to see any serious repetition as I start my 2nd playthrough.\n\n+The new perk trees are interesting and fairly balanced, I did not at any point think I wanted to bring ALL of one class on a mission. Though I did exempt Psi-Ops just because I did not have time to build extraneous facilities.\n\n+The strategy layer is much more complex than the original and the addition of strategy missions for gaining resources along with the task of building a resistance network, recruiting and assigning Engineers to Excavation, Construction or Maintenance, researching specific technologies and dealing with the Black Market makes it an entirely seperate and sophisticated game within a game.\n\n+Character customization is now an incredibly powerful tool that will allow you to create many varied characters and through the game give some extra badass-ness to your best performing soldiers.\n\n+The character pool system allows you to add your family and friends into the game, but still nestled inside the random generation of the game. I recently had one of my friends mind-controlled and shot another friend in the face whilst attempting to escort a 3rd friend to safety as a VIP. This also works with getting attached to a character in a previous game and saving them to the pool for later games as this super badass.\n\nCons:\n- The game bugs out occasionally with the screen being blank or units dancing around the screen, once my screen was blocked by scenery whilst attempting to hack and couldn't see the UI.\n\n- Nothing throughout the entire game prepares you for what you will face in the final missions, it was disconcerting when I first attempted them.\n\n- The main story is a bit weak but the game never focuses on it for long.","February 7","true","73.7"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","24","46","0","2"

You know what? You should play a single player game, I mean a game where you are the only force, and the enemy just watch the magic things you can do! Like... dancing in front of them!\nDo you know that strategy mean to come out with a plan to accomplish certain goals in specific situations? Well the timers make the situation more spcific and more adverse, so that it needs a more strategic plan to solve it! Duh.\nI completed the game on commander difficulty level with Ironman mode, and just failed one mission. The timers were perfect, i never really had to rush into enemies, and sometimes I decided to avoid some enemies without engaging them, and this is strategy! Something you couldn't really do in the first game.\nI really don't get what you want to do in your missions! Moving forward one tile each turn? "DAMN! My best strategy is to advance one tile and overwatch each turn! There are at least 50 tiles between my squad and the onjective. How am i supposed to do it in eleven turns???"\n\nTurn Based Strategy means you have turns in wich you have infinite time to decide your move not infinite turns! But now you want infinite turns too! "Infinite turns makes it more strategic!!11eleven" That's so dumb. Do you even want to setup enemy positions in the map yourself before the mission starts?\nAnd why all the mission are action themed?? I would like to have shopping missions! And can we talk about the research project? Why everything is for killing, or defending oneself from people who want to kill you? I want to craft a burner so I can have my soldiers cooking their food during missions! Oh no! There are turn timers so I couldn't do it anyway! DAMN YOU FIREAXIS!\n\nSeriously, Turns Timers are great. THey make you feel that you don't have all the time in the world and that's good, they pushes you to really think tactically, I did a lot of cool things thank to timers. So stop giving a bad feedback to the software house who gave their fanbase what they wanted, thanks.\n\nThe reviewI decided to complete the game before reviewing it because I saw a lot of complaints about it and I wanted to be totally sure they were silly complaints, and now I am.\n\nFirst thing: Yes, it's true, the game is badly optimized, but it still worked for me, and they will fix it, so wait for a patch if you want it to be perfect.\n\nSecond thing: The gameplay is better then XCOM EU in every possible way.\nThere's a software house here which didn't betray its players in order to make the game mainstream and people complain. Well, that SUCKS, big time!\nThis is more then the same we loved, way better than the same!\n\nDisclaimerI have only some hours of time playing the game because I played with my boyfriend on his steam account.","February 16","true","6.6"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","52","24","46","8","0"

(although with pollution and global warming it sometimes seems we're doing our best to change that).\n\nIt's just as well Earth meets our needs so perfectly because we don't have the ability to travel anywhere else to set up camp anyway... at least not yet (unless you count the moon, but we haven't been back there in nearly 50 years, governments would rather spend their money sending planes to drop bombs on deserts than sending rockets into space to benefit all mankind.)\n\n\nReal-Estate\n\nOne day, we will have the technological capability to travel to the stars, which will come in handy when the Earth becomes a less hospitable place to live.\n\nIt's inevitable, whether it's climate change, lack of resources or the death throes of the Sun itself, eventually, if we want to survive as a species, we're going to need  to get off this rock and find a new one.\n\nThe problem is, even if everything works out for us, if we survive long enough and develop the technology to travel on mass to the stars, we're still going to need to find another Earth-like planet with all the amenities (running water, central heating, oxygen, etc.) that we're accustomed to.\n\nWhatever happens, however we ruin our planet, for the moment, we're all stuck here so we have to make the most of it..\n\n\nSquatters Rights\n\nDo you know why life evolved on earth?\nIt was because we have all of those lovely luxuries here already.\n\nThere's a chance that if we did manage to find another planet that can sustain oxygen sucking life like ourselves, that it is already doing just that, sustaining some alien oxygen suckers that are perfectly happy where they are and have no interest in moving out and letting us move in.\n\n\nAggressive Negotiations\n\nSure, we could ask nicely, but if they didn't want to share there's always another option.\n\nWe've been turning sandy deserts into glassy craters on Earth for a while now, why not just use our military might to clear a path for our forlorn colonists? Desperate times call for desperate measures. We can justify anything if we need it badly enough.\n\nIf the native nuisance is still trapped on their own evolutionary cradle and we have the capability to get there, we're probably going to be more technologically advanced than they are (we'll have bigger bombs) so it shouldn't be too much of a problem.\n\n\nEnvious Eyes\n\nBut what if the tables were turned?\n\nWe're still happy here on Earth, things are ticking over nicely, we've still got petrol for our cars, food for our bellies and oxygen for our lungs, then some alien eyes start to peer greedily at our planet.\nWe'd be unlikely to roll over and give it to them, no matter how big their bombs are.\n\nIt'd be a fight we'd likely lose (unless Jeff Goldblum and his trusty laptop are around to save us with a timely upload of a computer virus).\nBut assuming this technological war or the worlds fluke doesn't come to pass, we'd be screwed.\n\nIt'd take a long time to eradicate all of us though and a submissive populace might fit better with the aliens plans, besides, why make war when propaganda can enslave a people just as easily.\n\n\nA New Hope\n\nThat's where XCOM 2 comes in.\n\nIt's been 20 years since the brief "war" against the invaders was lost, their propaganda machine has been in full swing for decades brainwashing the masses. The aliens are entrenched and the people cowed.\nBut there is still hope. Pockets of resistance strike against our alien masters, there are remnants from the war, from the group that was meant to defend us from this alien menace.\nThe survivors of the original XCOM project haven't forgotten the world before the overlords arrival and they want it back.\n\n\nViva La Resistance\n\nPicking up the pieces of the devastated XCOM initiative, you are tasked with the job of unifying a global resistance against the insidious interlopers.\nIf you've played any of the other XCOM games, especially the excellent 2012 title "XCOM: Enemy Unknown" then you're going to be on familiar, if somewhat prettier, ground.\n\nStarting with a small band of rookie recruits and a bare bones facility which serves as your headquarters (It's mobile this time around too!) you'll need to send out your team to engage in various hit and run missions against the aliens.\n\nIn Enemy Unknown you were defending Earth against the alien incursions, the tables are turned this time as you strike out against the entrenched invaders, attacking them where and when you think it'll hurt them the most.\n\n\nHumble Beginnings\n\nBefore each strike against the enemy you'll need to select your squad from the pool of able bodied recruits you have available.\nThey're all pretty green when you first start out, but the ones that you manage to keep alive will learn new skills and become adept at using different weapon types.\nYou'll end up with heavy ordinance specialists, medics, snipers, etc. all of which will play a vital role in the often punishing tactical battles that you're going to find yourself engaged in.\n\nAgain, just as with "Enemy Unknown" there's a promotion system to reward your best performing operatives, they'll even earn nicknames (which you can edit to suit your tastes if you're the sort that likes to tinker with these things).\n\nMan Making\n\nTalking of tinkering, the level of customisation and attention to detail with regards to editing your team is exceptional.\n\nYou can edit their names and nicknames to make them more memorable (Duncan 'McBig' Donald for instance) , engage in a little plastic surgery to make them look how you want, customise the colours of each individuals armour (I like to use different colours to represent different skill sets, heavy weapons guys in yellow, snipers in black, that sort of thing.)\n\nYou can even select their nationalities (Their nations flag is displayed on their armour) and the language they speak, which you'll get to hear whilst they're chattering (or screaming) out in the field.\n\nIt's not limited to languages  (English, German, Spanish, etc.) either, there are also accents to choose from.\nUnder the British voices for example, you'll find Scottish and Irish accents available to really personalise your resistance fighters.\n\n\nThe First Cut is the Deepest\n\nOf course, this customisation serves to increase your attachment to the little guys, which makes it all the more painful when you inevitably lose one of them in battle, especially if it's someone you've come to rely on, some you've been watching climb the ranks for a while, someone like my first major loss in the game... (You're sacrifice will not be forgotten Sergeant 'McBig').\n\nAs well as the emotional loss of losing 'McBig' to hostile fire,  (I'll make the alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s pay for that!) there's also the strategic loss of losing a seasoned vet and likely having to replace him with a wide eyed rookie who will take several missions to become useful or more likely, wet his pants and get shot the first time he sees an alien.\n\n\nEngineering Greatness\n\nThe aliens have been busy in the twenty years following "Enemy Unknown" too, their genetic tinkering has continued so you're going to find new and improved alien types terrorising the down trodden humans, which means new specimens to capture and fresh autopsies to perform.\n\nResearching alien tech (and biology) found in the field is vital, you're...

(i7 and 970 GTX, 16gb of ram and still struggled) It was a vast improvement over Enemy Unknown which I loved also, but there's one issue that is keeping me from writing out a long and glowing review. Hopefully it's fixed ASAP, because it was just a crushing turn of events for me. I get to the final mission, it's pretty late at night so I decide to save and go to bed, continuing my ironman campaign the next day. Wrong, I go to load the game this morning and it crashes every time I load the game. As this is Ironman mode I have no other saves, and I literally have to restart the game to finish it. Not sure what causes the issue, but to people that do buy it, be wary of saving on the last mission especially if you're on Ironman.\n\nEDIT 2/17/2016: First big patch was released today for the game, it fixed the glitch I had and my game was loadable! I had since moved on and started a new game, accepting it, but it's great to see Firaxis hard at work.

The biggest change is that eveything has been rethemed with the idea that XCOM is now a rouge faction with limited support.\nThis minor change makes most of the unpopular changes from the origional really cool. Enemy pods, limited mission selection, and smaller squads, make a whole lot more sense now.

While Bentley will insist you need to 'review your tactics' at the end of a failed mission, no amount of tactical play will stop the aliens from one shotting your troops through cover. This is complicated by a buggy UI that will indicate one thing, but then something else happens. Like getting hit with status effects (running through fire, acid, poison) and being spotted are not always indicated. Also, a genade's damage radius can be often misrepresented causing you to destroy a mission objective. I've had a hack objective get destroyed because I threw a grenade over it. Camera transarency glitches and other things that cause your troops to move to locations you did not intend further this issue.\n\nThe game seems to let you know from the very start that you should expect casualties. OK, Firaxis. If that's the case then why can't I get more troops? I start with 9, early in the game you can get recruits for free(I got 2). A few missions later (2 died to one-shot crits through cover, 1 died to burning that the game didn't tell me I would get when I moved, 1 got one-shot by an exploding car). Now I've got 7 total, with 4 wounded. Can't even field a full squad anymore and I'm only 5 missions into the game. The game is filled with design contradictions like this. Expect to lose troops, but don't have any good means of replacing them (50 supplies is a lot for a recruit, and more than you have to spare). Time the missions, but moving quickly almost always results in an unfavorable situation. Fail a mission? Now you get reduced income from the resistance in that area. Complete a mission? I hope it was worth the bodies you had to sacrifice. As you progress, the game just stacks the negative consequences against you repeatedly until you can just forget about even playing. Because now you don't have enough troops, don't have gooed enough weapons, and don't have troops leveled sufficiently.\n\nParts of the game are tedious and time wasters. Bentley will constanly tell you what's blatantly obvious. The camera will constantly hover over the objective when you get near it (even though it's marked from the beginning). It's just dumb how much time is wasted and how irritating it is to have to listen to and watch pointless stuff when you just want to take your turn.\n\nI have also found that the game forces you to play a certain way. In XCOM1, you spammed satellites. Now, you have to spam communications upgrades. If you don't, you will end up unable to get to mission areas and losing. Also, certain classes are much better than others. I would put specialist as the weakest in combat (but they can provide nice bonuses). Snipers are versatile if you go the pistol route, but otherwise can slow you down. Grenadiers are epic and can do some great AOE. Try dropping an acid grenade on a flare before reinforcements arrive and watch the aliens stand in place for 3 rounds as they don't want to get the debuff for moving through those tiles. Rangers seem to do the highest single target damage and can be essential to take down high hp targets. I've heard that snipers can do really well with high ground.\n\nYes it seems to be poorly optimized (disable bloom, SSAO and AA helps). I have yet to crash, though. I can live with some minor graphical glitches and a some performance slowdowns for reaction shots. The camera can act up as well, but that's just another annoyance. The thing that is frustrating is the incosistent manner in which some tactical notifications are given. The detection while stealthed for example, can incorrectly show a spot as being safe to move to (even though you can see the alien that spots you before you make the move). The notification icons for burning, poison can decide not to show up.

The game is tense and heavy while also giving you a realm of possibilities when it comes to killing aliens. This time around, your soldiers are on the offensive, and as such, the way you start a mission and set-up an initial ambush on your ennemies can change the odds of a mission. Fortunately or not, things do not always go as planned and the RNG makes for an entertaining but sometimes frustrating game. Ennemies are varied and all troublesome in their own, special way, but your soldiers also feel more resourceful and powerful then ever. The relatively easy to procure Psi Operative Class is so versatile and potentially devastating that you'll always want to have one in your squad. The game can be a little rough around the edges and the mission timers can be a big source of stress, but with the possibility to mod the game to suit your style of gameplay, this point is almost moot. With a few updates from Firaxis and an ongoing mod support, this game could easily be remembered as a classic of PC gaming in the years to come.","February 18","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game introduces enough new mechanics and a very different perspective on the formula from the previous title. New classes, items, mission types and even a new way the geoscape works, which I am indeed enjoying.\n\nThere is a fair amount of "timed" missions, where you have limited turns to get things done, which I think suits the theme quite nicely, seeing as how you're a resisitance, not a paramilitary organization that has the backing of many countries. But this mechanic seems to have not impressed a fair amount of people, and I understand that. I for one like it though, creates a nice tension. there is a mod to fix it though, so if that's an issue, there is a fix.\n\nI am not going to pretend the game runs well however. My specs are not high, and I have this issue where it never remembers my graphical settings at all. I return to main menu or boot up the game and everything is as low as possible. I set mine to mid at best and I expect some frame rate issues on my lower end machine. However, it seems poorly optimised for those with powerful gaming rigs too, so keep that in mind.\n\nI do recommend the game over all, it is a great game. It's just marred with poor optimization, for which being turn based is more forgivable, but not forgettable.\n\nI give it the Chozo Hybrid seal of approval!","February 5","true","132.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I won't give away any plot details, but X2 offers a deeper look into the various supporting characters (not your soldiers) than its predecessor; while  maintaining the general overall feel of Enemy Unknown/Within. With improved game mechanics and animations, X2 truly feels like the next step in the franchise.\n\nHowever, there are some performance problems with the game at launch (especially on lower-end machines); including various memory issues and slow-down as the game progresses and more enemy units start to flood the screen. At the time of this posting, 2K has stated they will be addressing these issues in forthcoming patches so be assured that the problems are temporary.\n\nA big boon is that XCOM 2 is mod-friendly. This is fantastic because, for me, there are a few glaring negatives that can be "ModFixed". The default camera control is terrible and can be utterly frustrating- especially if you want to see from floor to floor of a building or get an over the shoulder view of your soldier without having to spend far too long fiddling with the controls. Another negative, (or positive to some) is the mission timers. IMO, most instances of their use are out of place and rehashed in order to create a sense of urgency. But thankfully, there are mods out there to add either a set number to these timers, randomize the time to keep things interesting, remove them all together- or my favorite; have the timers not start until your group is revealed from concealment. Go Go Mod Community.\n\nIn the end, XCOM 2 is a great game with high replayability and is worth every dollar per hour for the purchase price. If you love Sci-Fi and strategic/tactical combat buy this game; you won't regret it.\n\n9/10 ... 10/10 Modded.","February 12","true","281.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a very challenging turn based tactical game presented from an isometric point of view on the battlefield combine with a global resource management and territory gaining element against a global doom ticker. You have to try and take the world back from an occupying force one territory at a time, and amass resources to improve your base, research better technologies for your soldiers. One a tactical mission scale, you command a squad of 4 - 6 soldiers (you can mod this to be more) who consist of different classes, earn exp and rank up. There are multiple skills for each class to choose from, and a lot of items to equip them with.\n\nIf you're familiar Enemy Unknown/Enemy Within, then this game keeps all the good stuff about that game, and adds stuff to make it even better.\n\nA lot of people are complaining about performance issues. The game is indeed not fully optimized, but will probably be patched soon enough. In general, I meet the system requirements, and even play on mac OS X. I have no issues so far.\n\nA lot of the negative reviews seem to be due to people whinging about the turn timers. Please allow me to give you some context; The developers intentionally put this in to discourage a cowardly and tedious meta that was adopted by many players in the first game. In XCOM, you get to perform 2 actions per turn; you can move a certain distance twice, move and shoot, or move and use a skill. However, if you use your action to shoot, your turn ends (there are ways to change this by ranking soldiers of a certain class). There is a universal skill that all classes have called overwatch; it ends your turn and prepares your squad to shoot at any enemy that paths in sight during their turn.\n\nDue to XCOM being somewhat challenging, many people decided to move half a turn, and overwatch every single turn across every map (maps in XCOM are rather large) because they didn't want their soldiers to die. The devs decided to upend this, and added turn timers to the second game.\n\nHOWEVER, the turn timers are very lenient, you get plenty of turns to reach your objective safely (through your squad being concealed) and to complete it, kill enemies and evac the map with 2 or 3 turns to spare. There are also mods that allow you to tweak these (as XCOM 2 has complete mod support). The people whining about the turn timers are probably the people that I described above. Instead of actually altering the turn timers to be longer, or using the steam workshop mods that disable them completely, they just give a great game a negative review.\n\nWhat do you feel is more tactical? Option A: Moving with stealth, setting up ambushes for enemy patrols, taking them out efficiently from a roof, blowing up the side of a building to reach your objective quick then evacing after a successful mission, or Option B: tediously moving half a turn and overwatching every turn against an enemy that isn't even actively looking for you in the first place? Yeah, I thought so. Anyone saying the timers remove the tactical layer of this game was never very good to begin with. Also, it doesnt make snipers useless. Fully upgraded snipers can take out multiple squads in a single turn if used correctly. Furthermore, on many missions, the turn timers deactivate after you complete the objective, leaving you with plenty of time to mop up remaining aliens for loot and exp. Many missions dont even have timers (campaign critical story mission, and alien retaliation missions.)\n\nIf your pc meets the minimum requirements for this game, and you are interested in this type of game then please try it out. If you dont like the timers, you can easily mod them. This game is incredibly challenging, and has many mechanics to learn, but once you master them, the game becomes very enjoyable and manageable. It also has infinite replay value (and is moddable to be even more infintely replayable)\n\nJust don't listen to the whiners who are moaning because the devs decided that they didnt want people who wanted to cheese the game to be able to do so. Also, the people leaving bad reviews because they found the game too hard are a vocal minority who don't like learning too many things, or having open ended choice based game play that doesnt involve move to the arrow, now shoot that one guy, now move to the next arrow. Head over the XCOM subreddit to see how many people are having so much fun playing this. Other people don't seem to understand how probability works and that 90% is not the same as 100%. There is still a 10% chance to miss, but the majority of the time you will roll the 90%.\n\nYes the game is challenging and hard, but gives you every tool and opportunity to win.\n\nMake up your own mind and don't listen to impatient self-entitled man children with the attention span of a gold fish.","February 10","true","202.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(This is a PC i purchased from Origin PC about 6 years ago with only the GPU upgraded in that amount of time)\n\nI have no issues with performance - even the loading screen the max it ever last was about 1 minute.\n\nI completed the game with only a single crash -and thats probably becuase I have other operations going on in the the background on my PC.\n\nI should mention I did optimize my game with the NVidia Optimizer tool and it was running closer to max quality - not full maxed out but close enough.\n\nPros:\n\n+Nicer graphics than the EU/EW\n+Love the new soldiers classes (ranger is wicked) and the premise of the game\n+Nice World Map\n+Solider Customization is great\n+Modding Community will make this even better\n+Psi Skills are just great and love ALL the moves\n+many more\n\nCons:\n+Game pacing - the only thing I had a gripe with. I found it at times that the Avatar Project moves waaaaaay too quick. Forcing you to constantly play the missions instead of getting a chance to move forward with with the train your PsiOps and run base upgrades etc. I get the point of this being a guerrilla tactics situation but still it is very annoying.\n\n+Boring Boring Boring Base Defense. I hope they change this, only had one base defense mission and I found it boring as hell, the one in EU/EW I found was way more fun and made you feel like you were always up against it. I didn't feel the same way here.\n\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nI love the game - I think the pacing of the game should change and the Avatar progress shouldn't be as aggressive - the aliens already been here for 20 years - so slow it down! Not much but at least 25% to 50% slower based on difficulty level selected.\n\nI will play this again and again.\n\nI love the ending and looks like we are getting setup for  Terror from the Deep!!!!!\n","February 11","true","33.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's buggy as F*k is the only way to really describe the current state the game is in. To give you an idea on my final mission I played it in pictures pretty much.\n\nNow the game is a true master piece! Took me 58 hours to fully complete my first playthrough. Once it’s fully optimized this will be the most addicting game you’ve played. It’s wicked awesome! I did not have a problem with the turn based clock. I welcomed it and enjoyed it a heck of a lot. It forces you to think different then you do with EU/EW and not rely on overwatch so dam much. If you don’t want it there is a mod for that. It is a different game then EU/EW but with the same mechanics. So you can still go back and enjoy those two master pieces as well. Do I recommend you buy this game? Hecks yea! In a month or two once it’s fully functioning properly.  That’s my review and I’m out!\n\nP.S\n\nFiraxis if you read this I think the whole Xcom 2 community should get a new piece of DLC for free.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltycatfish/recommended/268500/","saltycatfish","Salty Catfish!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltycatfish/","287 products in account","XCOM 2 succeeds because it fixes the one large flaw with its predecessor: pacing.\n\nOh, things are still tactical and patience is still important. But in Enemy Unknown, experienced players quickly learned that the safest way to play was at a slow, glacial pace, spamming the overwatch ability (reactionary fire on the enemy's turn) every turn as your squad crept inch by inch across the map, combing it with a net of deadly crossfire. While satisfying, there were few rewards for risk and no sense of urgency at all. The tactical flow was prone to stagnation. The expanion, Enemy Within, took steps towards improvement by introducing Meld, a timed resource that would expire within a handful of turns. Yet even with this incentive, the problem remained.\n\nBy now, you've probably heard that XCOM 2 will, more often than not, impose turn limits on the player. This has been a source of much frustration and negative feedback -- just look around on this page for some examples -- yet this change is not only a positive one, it's the core of this game's DNA and vital to its success. You can still end every turn with your troops safely tucked in cover and all prepared to fire (and there are times where this is still a logical strategy), but the clock is ticking and it's going to take some measured risk to reap each mission's rewards. Hidden alien foes await in the fog of war standing between your starting point and your goal -- whether that's a VIP to rescue, an alien relay to destroy, or a UFO to raid -- which is tantalizingly close yet guarded enough to punish recklessness with severe consequences.\n\nTo complement the renewed sense of urgency, the soldier skillsets and capabilities have seen a significant overhaul. It's mostly familiar mechanically -- you're still taking cover and seeing percentages and screaming as you miss 85% shots -- but an increased focus on melee combat and destructive environments gives you more strategic capabilities that let you move forward towards your objective while maintaining a tactical approach. There's no longer any time to get bogged down in an entrenched skirmish, so the game provides a multitude of alternatives: you can use a grenade launcher to destroy your opponent's cover or rush his position with a deadly swordsman or hack his mechanized units and bring them under your control or...well, you get the idea. The destruction you'll inflict on the battlefield is both visually impressive -- buildings crumble, floors collapse, and yes, cars still explode -- and tactically crucial.\n\nOn the macro level, base-building is functionally similar but given a modern board game-esque overhaul that turns engineers from a simple resource into the pieces in a crucial worker placement mechanic. Do you assign your free engineer to speed up construction or to increase your power supply? Or send him off to clear out more room for a new building? Unfortunately, scientists don't receive the same attention and, consequently, feel somewhat pointless. The first scientist recruited increases your research speed by 50%, but diminishing rewards and a lack of usefulness means you'll find yourself continually opting for missions that reward engineers or supplies instead. The Geoscape has been given a similar gloss of board game paint -- no longer just a fancy hologram showing you where your next mission, the globe now gives you options to pursue additional resources or targets of opportunity. The layout is far from intuitive and the frequency of interruptions can approach frustration (a 5-day scan to make contact with a new resistance cell feels like an eternity) but it's nice to have options.\n\nI could go on about everything else XCOM 2 does well -- the strong skill progression, the balanced classes that make a pistol-specced sharpshooter 100% viable, the smooth escalation of equipment that has just enough randomness to keep things intriguing -- but I want to end by touching again on the turn limitations. Rarely has a sequel taken such a large mechanical risk, one that completely upends the strategies its predecessor and turns the typical XCOM conventional wisdom on its head. And yes, it is absolutely punishing and demands strict execution and the occasional abandonment of your troops on the battlefield...but it's the most important change the game has made and gives XCOM 2 an injection of urgent life. Firaxis could have been safe and given us more of the same -- but as XCOM 2 will teach you, true rewards rarely come without risk.","February 10","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have a solid 200 hours of JUST campaigning, most of it on impossible. I was honestly very surprised about how jazzed up the combat was on xcom2. It's much much different, the game forces you out of turtling and start running for dem objectives. Which i honestly don't mind, just gotta adapt abit.\n\nXcom2 is also changed into a combat based game. Base management is less important but provides bonuses and fun stuff to play with.\n\nThe game has alot of bugs, i feel they rushed the release abit. Gremlins fly underground, occasional frozen enemy turns. The worst bit honestly the intro and the outro for me the video was delayed and the voice appeared before the video :S\n\nIt needs a bit of modding tbh. WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE IT HAS MODDING SUPPORT! Which is honestly one of the highlights.\n\nMODDERS: Please make Anime faces, naked person decals, Asain language (Why doesn't this exist?) and sky combat. It's bound to happen so just be first :P\n\nOverall: I enjoyed it, it's pretty brutal good for dem xcom vets. As for new people, not too sure, maybe take off mission timers? (Which a mod is already made.) Game seems pretty bare bones with some pretty nice features. Seems like there's lots of room to improve upon, hope we get some fine ♥♥♥ modders on the case and they flesh it out.\n\nWould give solid 8/10","February 9","true","85.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bestprofileever/recommended/268500/","bestprofileever","enav","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bestprofileever/","288 products in account","So I have a decent computer and I have to turn the settings down a bit to run this game. The game sometimes locks for a couple seconds in between turns. However, this is a good game I would still highly recommend it. A lot of the negative reviews are people that were somehow unaware that this is an RNG based game and are frustrated, complain about the timers, or are upset about optimization issues.\n\nMaybe I'm insane, but if a game is a bit buggy at launch, but still works I don't just take to the internet to write a scathing day-one review about how I had to turn AA off. Some people's reviews are understandable to where the game did not launch or something or were met with frequent crashes. I get that. I just hate it when people drop a negetive review because of optimisation problems then never bother to change it and artifically drop the rating. If your game didn't work. that's cool. If you couldn't run it on triple-ultra settings with smell-o-vision turned on, then didn't bother to play the game, then give it a negative review, please just don't leave one until you've played the game. Maybe I'm just a butt-hurt fanboy, but I've noticed how a lot more people seem to place flawless optimization over gameplay, which drives me insane.\n\nPeople keep complaining about the timers on some missions, but the reviews seem to misrepresent the entire game as having timers on every mission. Optional missions often have timers associated with them, but people often leave out how you can use a drone to remote hack into several objectives and stop the timer. Major missions and many difficult missions do not have a timer assoicated with them. You can also back out of a mission if it gets to hot or you can savescum through most of them pretty easily. The game is meant to be difficult and people talk about the timers as if having a time limit somehow doesn't make it a strategy game.\n\nAlso, yes, this is an RNG based game. The computer doesn't always fight fair, your soldiers will die, and bad things will happen. Your choices in research priorities, side missions, and dark events will change the outcome of the game later on for better or for worse. You are fighting an alien threat far more advanced than yourself, thus the difficulty curve is supposed to be high. You don't have hardened space maries, a secret weapon, or super powers. What you have is a stolen space ship, a scientist, an engineer, and some guys with guns. This game is hard, but you can always learn the game by playing on easy and saving frequently. If you don't like things there are already a ♥♥♥♥-ton of mods that tweak the game to different playstyles.\n\nAnyway, tl;dr:\n-This game is hard, so try savescumming and playing on easy to get the hang of it\n-There's RNG\n-There are timers, but not on all missions and sometimes there are ways to stop them, and retreating is always an option\n-There are optimisation problems, but it's playable and at the most inconvient for most people\n-There are mods that can tweak the game to your play style\n-The game is hard. It's supposed to be hard.\n-It's a good game and worth playing.","February 11","true","55.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, due to the turn-based nature of this game,\nit can be perfectly playable with a low framerate, and enjoyed nevertheless.\n-----------------------------------\n\nI give it now a positive review, after finishing the game in normal difficulty, because this is simply put the best Xcom so far. Why? I will try to summarize:\n\n1. Put a much intense emphasis on the story compared with the ones before.\n2. It's full of beautiful cinematics\n3. It's much more streamlined but without letting it be oversimplified, decisions can still be tough and meaninful, but not confusing. It follows however a much logical progression\n4. The game gives a much bigger impression of difficulty without actually being so (in normal difficulty)\n5. It's just beautiful, even in minimum settings, you fall inmersed on this universe, and not even talking about the HUGE personalization options.\n6. The characters have much more charisma, and the soldiers are so much personalizable, making you care much more about them\n7. The abilities of both the soldiers and the enemies are all hugely useful. No more abilities that you will never use. And they all just feel right and powerful, leveling up your soldiers is incredible satisfiying. The new psyonic class is just great.\n8. More randomized everything. Decisions, Technology, Maps, Abilities effect... But nevertheless, less confusion.\n9. New mechanics, such as stealth, are really well implemented and works wonders. I've done many allien bases assaults with Very difficult setting, and about 20 enemies including Sectopods, Chryssalids and whatnot, without shooting a single rifle, and a crew of just 3 thanks to this new ability. Not easy, but definitly doable.\n10. Modability. Firaxis learnt the lesson and listened to its clients. Now accepts mods and even has its own public modding tools you can download and create your own mods, maps, etc. Or share your customized soldiers with whoever you want.\n\nHugely recommended and worth your money\n\nTL;DR: Buy it, it's gud.\n\nEdit 2:\nMultiplayer at the moment sucks!

This however - was not the case. Let me explain what happend to m above-mentioned points:\n1 - My laptop can run this game 100%, even given the fact that my graphics card is a bit below the recommended specs. Albeit I play on all the minimum settings, honostly the graphics are really still amazing and more that satisfying to look at. It may be a bit personal opinion as I play a game more for the gameplay (which is soooo so so good), rather than the graphics, but even so...I am really impressed with how great this game still looks even on lowest settings.\n2 - The mission timers, in one word, they are awesome !! I read a lot of people complain, saying it takes tactics aways, makes you stress, ensures you can't play the game like you normally would etc etc, and although I was also not keen on mission timers as I also like to not feel rushed, take my time with overwatching enemies and so forth, mission timers are a great addition. It creates a sense of urgency, while making you stress yes, but in a good..and fun way. It most certainly does not take away tactics, and if you feel it does, it replaces it with other tactics. When your country/earth gets invaded, you have to play by their rules, and these timers mould into this theme brilliantly. I mean for example...if they want to execute someone, they are going to execute them..and it's up to you to save the person if you have what it takes. If not, they won that mini battle, but you can retaliate in other ways. So again - do not be afraid of the negative reviews saying mission timers spoil the game, they don't, and if you truely feel they do, there's mods to extend the timers or completely remove them.\n3 - Performance issues...well honostly, there is a few, but NOTHING game breaking at all. Yes sometimes you wait 10sec for enemies to make their move, or sometimes you struggle for a bit to see the middle floor of a building, but this, for me at least, does not take anything away from the other 99% of bugfree amazing gameplay. Performance issues and fps drops, I have not encountered them, even on my sub par setup. In my 11hours I've had 1 time where my fps dropped noticebly for 2sec, that is ALL. In al honostly, I can live with that if I get a great game like this in return.\n4 - Ahhhh the Avatar Project aka the doomsday tracker. Again..same as my second point, there is ways to stall this "timer". Honostly if you make sure you expand early on and play very slowly and carefully, I can't see why this will ever be an issue....and if you REALLY don't want this tracker..again, there is a mod for that.\n\nSummary:\nAll in all an excellent game, the base building is awesome, the combat is awesome, everything is great and I could not see a reason not to buy this game other that if you are not into these type of games. On that note though, I was also not into these games, not at all. I used to cringe at the sight of turn-based games, then decided to give the demo a try when XCOM Enemy Unknown released on PS3 bakc in 2012...well, look where I am now - praising it's sequal. I think that says enough, whether it is to buy this game or simply try out a new genre...I can promise you it is worth it !!","February 12","true","30.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
