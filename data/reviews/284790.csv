"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/284790/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1198 products in account","Here, we have the second instalment of Nightmares from the Deep series: The Siren's Call. Artifex Mundi keeps upping the game and brings another succeeding HOG in. Compared to the first game, The Siren's Call carries a faster pace in story with just as good puzzles and HOG scenes. In this game, we'll have less undead, more... fishmen?\n\nThe museum curator Sarah Black's adventures in the Caribbean continues. After her remarkable encounter with Captain Remington, Sarah is safely back and prepares for a new exhibition while trying to promote a "fiction" novel about her last encounter with Captain Remington. It is the middle of the night when a strange courier visits the museum to deliver a package. With the content of the package revealed, Sarah suddenly becomes a target again and a central figure in an old curse that slowly transforms the inhabitants of Kingsmouth to fishmen. You are to become a part of the resistance against a corrupt mayor, free a siren and challenge the curse of Davy Jones himself yet again.\n\nCatchy, huh? Yeah, I know. Some might think that Nightmares from the Deep series are basically a retelling of Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Even I thought so when I finished the first game. This one, obviously gathers anecdotes from Dead Man's Chest and On Stranger Tides, but still manages to harbor the Caribbean lore into something curious and genuine. The bonus chapter at the end of the game even presents some foreshadowing about the last instalment, namely the origin of infamous Davy Jones himself. I really expect something a bit different than the movie version Davy Jones. Here's hoping!\n\nI'll just skip praising the quality of artwork in Artifex Mundi games and define with two words: plain gorgeous. It is no big news that Artifex Mundi redefined the HOG genre, especially with the quality of artworks. This one is no different. Aside lovely background visuals with strong nautical themes, character animations are really good in this one compared to the first instalment. Characters have distinct facial remarks and body language. Cinematics seem to improve quite a bit too.\n\nThe gameplay? As a HOG, it is more than decent with presenting different type of HOG scenes, one or two FROG scenes and some puzzle dynamics even in HOG scenes themselves. Puzzles are mostly ordinary with lovely artworks this time. You'd go through the most challenging one within 3-4 minutes. If you are bored with HOG gameplay, you may give Mahjong alternative gameplay a try anytime you wish. To grab all achievements, you'll be needing at least two playthroughs though: one for HOG achievements, one for Mahjong achievements. The map is interactive with "available action" indicators so backtracking is not an issue. We are already familiar with collecting coins and poking a - this time fish-dwarf to tell us the background story. I'm getting used to these guys. Sure they are creepy as ♥♥♥♥, but hey! They are company.\n\nNightmares from the Deep 2: The Siren's Call is a good addition to the series, building up the concept further and establishing a bridge between the first and the last game, and a neat HOG by itself. Pick it during a sale and enjoy!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 4","true","8.4"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","39","43","0","9"

I have no shame in finding these to be a guilty pleasure, because they're a nice change of pace from more demanding games. This one maintains the devs' usual decent standards, with generally good presentation throughout (with some weird exceptions, as though a different artist was roped in at knife-point to fill in certain gaps). The formula does wear a little thin towards the end, and there's a certain sense of going through the motions that's not evident in the first two thirds of the game. You know the drill: explore locations, pick up items, do hidden object scenes to find necessary objects to solve puzzles (in this game, they really like "swap the pieces around so they form the right picture / match the background"), and listen in horror to some stilted voice acting. It starts well, with much drama and a cutscene that they probably blew half the game's budget on (this probably explains the marionette-like animation later in the game), and then settles into a comfortable formula. Towards the end it actually starts to get, dare I say it, quite exciting! I nearly spilled my tea at one point. The dramatic music helps, and threads begin to wrap up towards the big showdown, but it never really challenges you and feels a bit anticlimactic. If you get "stuck" it nearly always means there's a new hidden object scene that's opened up somewhere on the map, and you have to wander around until you find it. Frustratingly, there are occasions where apparently useful objects can be seen in the background art, but which are non-interactive (in reality the location of the object you need is elsewhere). It's sloppy. Removing useful objects (like a hammer) and then requiring you to find another one later in the game is also annoying. However, like its terrible voice acting (one actor is wildly inconsistent, seemingly forgetting the character he's playing mid-sentence on several occasions), it comes with the territory.","October 2, 2014","true","7.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

This time around you embark on an adventure to save a siren and to lift a curse cast upon Kingsmouth that makes its inhabitants gradually transform into aquatic creatures.\n\nAlthough the story is connected to the first game from the series, you don’t need to have played The Cursed Heart to enjoy The Siren’s Call because this game serves very well as a stand-alone game. However, if you find yourself enjoying either of them, I highly recommend you play the entire series, concluding with Nightmares from the Deep:  Davy Jones.\n\nThe exciting plot, the fun gameplay, the lovely concept art, the mysterious atmosphere, the ambiance and music closely follow the style of the first game and are up to the standards that Artifex Mundi got us used to. In addition to what you expect of a high-quality Artifex Mundi game, this game offers a lot of interactive moments (for example the scene in which you have to extinguish a fire), clever plot twists and turns, smooth animations and slow-motion shots. All of these combined make for immersive gameplay and deliver a very pleasant gaming experience.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","January 28, 2015","true","15.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Maybe it was the lack of enthusiasm on my part or the benefit of having a few other Artifex Mundi games pop up between its two pirate themed adventures. but Nightmares of the Deep managed to avoid the vast majority of the problems which brought down its predecessor and could easily sit as one of the developer's most polished works.\n\nIn a lot of ways, Artifex Mundi has "fixed" Nightmares of the Deep by basically retconning the entire first game. It follows a nearly identical premise, features similar puzzles, and has effectively the same structure as The Cursed Heart. In some ways this makes it feel somewhat redundant, as if you've played the prior game there's a constant feeling of deja vu following you around as Artifex Mundi mostly tries to pretend that game doesn't exist. But they've also done so much to improve the originally underwhelming experience that I still found myself enjoying their signature brand of casual adventure game HOGs (hidden object games) and appreciating the ways they'd found to streamline and subtly enhance a familiar formula. It also means that if you never played The Cursed Heart you're under no obligation to before The Siren's Call, as for all intents and purposes this is a second start for the series, and a markedly better one at that.\n\nSiren Call's most immediate upgrade is its visuals, especially that of character faces and animations. Gone are the unnerving lip spasms, clunky walks, and convenient tricks to hide a lack of animation, replaced with actual facial movements and a significant increase in the amount and quality of animation in every area of the game. It might still be fairly tame compared to games with budgets in the multi-millions, but it goes a long way to making Siren's Call stand out among its peers as almost certainly the prettiest HOG I've ever played.\n\nOther fixes are less overt but no less desirable, such as fast travel carried over from previous Artfiex Mundi games which cuts out all the tedious backtracking that was at its worst in Cursed Heart, helping especially in making the end game fetch quest something I actually enjoyed. Contextual puzzle solving has a much larger focus now, with logical solutions that make you feel more like an improvising scavenger than someone that just happened to stumble into a pile of junk with everything you need. They're a lot of small alterations that might not be immediately apparent, but make it hard to imagine going back to the way games of the genre have been for so long.\n\nThe one place Siren's Call failed just as much as its predecessor is its narrative, which once again borrows heavily from Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean. I wouldn't say I expect to find Pulitzer worthy writing in this style of game, but Artifex Mundi's prowess at delightfully cheesy plots remains nowhere to be found in Nightmares from the Deep. Plot holes abound, motives feel contrived and character reactions even more incomprehensible, and in general Siren's Call is trying so hard to be serious that it just comes across as dry and frankly pretty boring.\n\nCompared to The Cursed Heart's list of annoyances though, that's a not insignificant step up in quality, and leaves the inevitable third game in a position to finally bring the series up to the standards Artifex Mundi has set themselves with other games. I'm still not entirely sure why Nightmares of the Deep seems to be the flagship title in their eyes, but if future games can keep in line with The Siren's Call I wouldn't be all that bothered to have a few more of them.","January 28, 2015","true","4.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

The graphics are more colorful and refined compared to the first part. The sound design is better too. The puzzles are fairly interesting without being too complex. It seemed to me, in fact, that compared to the first part the puzzles became more varied and interesting while actually being easier to understand (definitely prettier). The main story is OK, although there is nothing special about it. It is there only to set the mood and create a backstory for the setting, after all.\nThere is a bunch of achievements, which are reasonably easy to unlock, if you are into hunting for those.\nOverall the game is a nice relaxing experience for those who want to play something fun and casual.\nUPDATE As promised I have 100% completed everything in the game (including achievements and extra story) and I can add the following to my review above. You can skip all HOG parts of the game by playing mahjong (there is even a bunch of achievements for those so you might want to replay the game to get them). However, the original HOGs are still much more entertaining in my opinion. I do appreciate that Artifex Mundi offers and alternative solution to those who hate HOGs, though.\nThere is also a short bonus adventure, which adds a little bit of extra game play, but changes nothing on the big scale (no achievements for it too and no grand storyline discoveries).\nIn any case I do appreciate all the additions and variations that are available in the game and thus my overall assessment of the game remains "positive".","October 25, 2014","true","14.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

It is stand alone, and can be played out of order.  However, as with all series games, each game despite its own individuality does build on the previous story and there are previous story references.\n\nStory: Museum Director Sarah Black, who has gained a reputation by breaking a Davy Jones' curse, is brought an 'artifact' by a mysterious man.  The 'artifact', however, belongs to a pirate captain Murray who has made a deal with Davy Jones.  Captain Murray, now mayor of the town Kingsmouth, wants it back.  The artifact powered by the 'magic' of his captive mermaid controls the ship destroying kraken.  The mysterious man, suffering under the curse brought on the captain's deal (along with the entire town Kingsmouth) wants back his humanity and to free the captive mermaid.  He enlists Sarah's aide to free the mermaid and to break Davy Jones' curse.\n\nThis game plays in a very tight linear fashion based on a chase theme.  Once finished with an area the player moves on giving chase.  There is back tracking in this game but not enough to be annoying, or even seemingly out of place.  The flow of the story and gameplay is smooth, each obstacle the goal to overcome as the player gives chase.  As far as any back tracking that does occur, the no penalty fast travel map makes it easy and convenient.  Of course puzzles, hidden object scenes, needed items or things to do can also be deduced from the map.  Your intrepid companion steers the player along the game path as well as through the story, and needs to be talked to prompt the game.  However talking with your companion comes off as a natural thing to do and never seems forced.  In many ways the story is about your companion and your character Sarah is the by-stander, helper and observer.\n\nThere is a wide variety of puzzles and hidden object scenes, and what I have come to think of as Artifex Mundi's trademark (at least in this series): Mahjong.  Depending on personal gameplay style there is enough variety of game choice to not be boring.  No single puzzle or hidden object scene is overly difficult but also not so easy as to be considered too simple.  The hidden object scenes occur frequently enough for the game to be hold the designation 'Hidden Object' game and not fall into the 'point and click' category.\n\nThere are also three sets of 'ghost/shape shifting/extra' objects to look for: octopi, parrots, and seahorses.  The parrots fade in and out at approximately 10 second intervals.  The seahorses are 'ghosts' that appear when certain objects are touched.  The octopi are simply hidden within the background.  Of the three, the parrots are the hardest to find and there are lots of them.  If any thing in this game could truly be called challenging I would say finding all of these extras without consulting a guide would be.\n\nThe bonus chapter gives background to both Captain Murray and Davy Jones, as well as a teaser for the next game in the series.\n\nOne last thing, I thought the chest guardian in this game was very apropos.  Though I did miss the little animation of him taking the coin each time (as it happened in the first game), but I can understand why the action would only be shown once and not repeated.  (I guess I do not mind repetitive things.)\n\nEnjoyed the game and enjoy the series.","August 28, 2015","true","13.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

There are also collectibles to find through the different sceneries but the good thing is you can always backtrack them as long as you don't open the final chest.\n\n(#):\nAs I said in the key features, you need two playthrough to finish the game. One to finish the game with all the puzzles and hidden objects scenes perfected and another one playing the mahjong game instead of the hidden objects scenes. The good thing is you can skip all the cutscenes and puzzles in your second playthrough if you succeeded your first one.","April 11","true","5.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","3"

Compared to other version of this game I see no difference or issues.  It plays reasonably well.  I enjoyed the game.  The voice acting is a little dry but not annoying,  I found the hidden object games and puzzles fun and challenging but not frustrating,  The way they blended the art and cg makes for a beautiful and sureal atmosphere and the story is really well done.  The quality is of the visuals is on a level where you will not have issues with pixel hunting. This game is the sequel to "Nightmares from the Deep: The Cursed Heart", you could start with that one first, or play Siren's Call first.  Its up to you because each is its own seperate story but with a few tie ins.  This game is a great casual game, you can play it for a while and put it away and come back days later, and get back into it with very little effort.  I highly reccomend getting this game.","January 24, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you've played any of Artifex Mundi's other HOGs, you pretty much know what to expect:  good graphics, interesting little story, acceptable voice acting, and good HOG puzzles.  There were two things I don't much care for in this game, though.  The first is the octopi, seahorses, and parrots we have to find in the game.  They're just sitting around in the environment and you have to click on them.  The octopi aren't too bad since they're alway present.  But, the seahorses only appear when you interact with the correct scene element, and the parrots phase in and out on a timer.  It's not a hard quest, but it's a bit irritating.  My second gripe is that in order to get all the Achievments, you MUST play through the game twice.  And, if you mess up, you might have to play through it even again (since there's no saving -- only your current game state).  But, neither of those things is worth marking the game down.  I got about 8 hours of play on my first run-through.  Then andother 1.5 hours on the Bonus chapter.  And then another 3 hours to run through most of it a second time to complete the Achievement.  So, even at it's full list price, the game is worth it.  Of course, look for it on sale.  Recommended.","June 12, 2015","true","12.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

If you don't like the Hidden Object minigame, you can always replace them for a Mahjong match without penalty.\n\nThe animation seems to have improved in this one when compared to its predecessor, but that might just have been my impression. The colourful and lively scenes are a sight to see throught the whole game. The story wasn't very interesting, but some might be into it.\n\nSo this is your high quality puzzle/hidden object title.","December 27, 2015","true","10.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You are aided in your quest by the mermaid's boyfriend (who is kind of a huge weenie). This game continues Artifex Mundi's charming tradition of borrowing heavily from pop culture, with the most obvious influences in this game being Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and the works of H.P. Lovecraft. (I'm serious about it being charming -- I probably wouldn't pay attention to the plot otherwise).\n\nThe puzzles are all challenging without being too mind-bending, although if you play on Expert mode like I do, you might spend a good ten minutes wandering around every now and then until you find the right hotspot that has the next little clue or gadget needed to advance.\n\nI think the most important part of this game, though, is the animals. Early on in the game you meet a cute monkey and give him a banana. And then close to the end of the game you find an ENTIRE ROOM full of BIRDIES. BIRDY BIRDY BIRDY.\n\nI also rather enjoyed putting out the fire early on in the game, and I think Artifex Mundi should have a lot more scenes in their games where I grab a firehose and put out fires.\n\nAll in all, a good buy, and I think even better than the first Nightmares from the Deep game.","January 26, 2015","true","9.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Thankfully the puzzles themselves offer a bigger challenge, albeit at the cost of variety. The quality of the hidden object scenes is more or less the same as in the first game.\n\nIn conclusion, Siren’s Call isn’t as excellent as Cursed Heart was, but it is still a solid, and surprisingly long HO game.","November 18, 2014","true","6.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The back story is enjoyable.  And instead of one long cutscene they've integrated it into the game play - because it doles it out in reasonable chunks you'll find yourself listening instead of clicking skip.\n\nTo get all the achievements you'd have to play thru twice, never click skip, where one time you do the puzzles then the second time play Mahjong.

I'm a huge fan of point and clicks, but I've never been a huge fan of hidden object games because I feel they can get boring quite quickly. But I was happy to see artex mundi games have a great combination of both (and with a option of playing mahjong instead of doing the hidden objects!)  This series is really enjoyable. The puzzles are varied, the plot is interesting and the art style is great. I'd definiteley reccomend!","March 5, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Puzzles / hidden object scenes are good. There are bonus effects like when you click in a certain place, the birds there will fly away, and there are bonus trophies you *can* find but don't have to.\n\nProduction-value-wise this is the best HO game I've played so far (and I've played like 10, didn't play part 1 yet). Not sure about the voice acting: At least the siren's actress is phoning in a mindless job, isn't speaking like someone who means what they are saying.

For me you can also notice that Artifex Mundi had made more games in between as well. Everything is better with this one, even the good things the first had like artwork, ambiance and sound. The only bad things I have to say about about this, is the puzzles and total game time. I completed the game, every puzzle and hidden object location without any hints in less than 3h, and that is with the standard "bonus adventure". Game that are this good are never long enogh of course, but I still can't help feeling a little disappointed in the game length. An "easy" way to increase the game length would be to increase the difficulty of the puzzles in the game. So that you actually would have to sit down and think, now you can see the solution too quick and get moving before you lean forward to see a pattern in the puzzle you were doing. But I shouldn't spend the entire review criticizing the game, it's still a beautiful game with a good story that continue on from the first game nicely. It's a great game, either to start with but more to continue the Nightmare from the Deep series with. 7.1/10","March 22","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzles are mostly good (Though not super hard) and the atmosphere is quality stuff. My biggest complaint that keeps this series from being real good adventure games, and it seems like it might be the case with all of Artifex Mundi’s games, is that there’s not enough focus on characters. Sarah Black could potentially be a unique and cool video game protagonist, she’s a middle aged woman that matches wits with zombie pirates, fishmen, and a Cthulhu-esque Davy Jones, but most of the time she’s just a mute cipher. She barely has any character to speak of and it does take away from the series Overall though Siren’s Call is a game worth checking out if you like adventure games, its fun.","August 12, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I enjoy the game to a certain extent. However, the cons for me were:\n\n1. Four achievements are dependent on playing all the hidden object scenes as mahjong instead. I don't buy hidden object games to play mahjong instead. If it had been match 3, I might have ignored this but I absolutely hate mahjong and these are LONG mahjongs. So, if you want these achievements, you will need to play the game at least twice and if you accidentally play a hidden object instead of mahjong, it will be more than twice! After wasting 2-1/2 hours playing through the second time trying to get these achievements, I gave up and decided it was not worth my time.\n\n2. There are way too many cuts scenes. Even though they can be skipped, I hate to do that when playing the game for the first time because I might miss something. My feeling is that if I wanted to see a movie, I would go to the theatre!\n\n3. Voice acting was on the poor side. In most cases, emotions were either incorrect or missing from the spoken dialog which made it sound cheesy.\n\n4. The "strategy guide" is intergrated into the game... mostly. However, there is no indication that I could find for the collectibles in the game. So if you want the achievements for that, you will have to look elsewhere for help in finding the 19 octupi, 18 parrots and 7 seahorses.","January 14","false","10.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Its a fun Hidden Object game filled with a good story and very colorful graphics. I have beaten the game but have not played the bonus scenes.\n\nI enjoyed the voices for the most part. The Siren I dont know but for some reason I found her voice to be very  irritating. However for a siren she doesnt speak a whole lot. Go Figure. The game does have special things to click on for an achievment in finding all of them. So that was a nice bonus.  The only issue I had with the gameplay that  kind of bugged me was backtracking. A lot of going back and forth. However I still find the game very enjoyable and would rate it a solid 8.5/10 a very solid game and a lot of fun.","August 13, 2014","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Inside the package she finds an artifact, and instantly assailants descend on the museum to rob her. The artifact is stolen. Sarah lowers her head in disbelief as she realizes that again she is falling headfirst into a nightmare from the deep.\n\nNext Sarah finds herself on the shores of Kingsmouth, a forgotten fishing town which holds an incredible secret.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/recommended/284790/","dunetiger","Dune Tiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/","2220 products in account","Artifex Mundi returns to the Nightmares from the Deep setting (piratey horror), but not to the well... okay, maybe there's a little well water.  But it comes from a nicer well.  A shinier well!  It even has a new bucket!  The result is a solid adventure game that is leaps and bounds better than its predecessor, taking many lessons from Mundi's other games since the first Nightmares.\n\nYou'll notice I called this an adventure game and not a hidden-object game.  There is just so much they've expanded this (and other Artifex Munid games) into that to categorize it strictly as a hidden-object game is to do so in error.  First off, like in the first Nightmares, if you don't even like HOGs, you can bypass all of them by electing to play Shanghai instead (still erroneously called Mahjong here, but whatever... I'm over it....).  More importantly, while there isn't an avatar for you to move around the screen and dialogue windows with people who ask you for weird objects for no reason (adventure game basics, people), the game also provides variations on classic slider puzzles, pictograms, cryptograms, and even its own take on Mastermind.  Sure, HOGs are still a big draw of the game, but go on and click through the screenshots and tell me how many actual HOG scenes you see - not many.  Keep in mind, however, that those are only the screenshots - there are plenty in the game so you won't be disappointed if that's what you came for.\n\nThe end result of mashing all of these gametypes into one game would have you thinking that it doesn't work, but AM has finely crafted Nightmares 2 with its own kind of puzzle language and nothing seems out of place.  More importantly, especially when compared to the first game, Nightmares 2's hardest difficulty is actually a decent challenge.  It won't really stump veterans, but no longer is everything sparkly and saying "click me" unless you want it to.  Here you may need to backtrack far just to find the one HOG you waltzed past or perhaps one that activated retroactively just to find what you need to continue.  Still, with a handy fast-travel map, none of it is really all that tasking for players.\n\nAnd what of the extra little bits?  Throughout the game, there are hidden objects for you to find that aren't in the hidden object scenes.  These come in the shape of octopusses (octopi?), seahorses, and silver effing parrots.  While the first two are easy enough to find, the parrots are the WORST.  If you are obsessive about these things, like I am, then the parrots are going to irritate you.  Why?  Because they disappear.  That's right.  They phase in and out of reality for NO DAMNED REASON.  And if, like me, you refuse to cheat, it can be a daunting task to figure out exactly which one you're missing because damn if you remember clicking every single one.  But let me tell you something - I got 'em all.  SUCK ON THAT!\n\nWhere was I?\n\nIs the game perfect?  Nah.  No game is.  Parrots are a good reason to ding the game, but more importantly, I found that some of the backtracking actually was a bit of a problem, especially on the expert mode.  While it's not a big deal to go and find the next HOG you need to work on, the issue arises when one that you've already solved becomes activated again.  Half the time I would just walk on past because I figured I did that one already.  On a second playthrough, this was compounded by the fact that I knew I would have to eventually go to that spot to get what I needed, but each HOG activates on a specific set of events being completed so it could very well be that you can't find anything in that one space, go solve a puzzle elsewhere, and suddenly that space is activated just moments after you were there.  It can be confusing, but again, this really only an issue with the hardest difficulty.  But hey, I can't be all glowing positive, right?\n\nSo let's pick on the story, then.  Very simply, we see the return of the curator from the first game being approached by a man in a raincoat who has some sort of special artifact for her.  In the opening scenes, we return to the museum in the first Nightmares in a nice nod to the prequel, but after a few introductory puzzles, kiss it goodbye and enter the realm of Kingsmouth (like Innsmouth), filled with a population of fish people.  Not that piratey, but still aquatic.  See, some dude named Mayor Murray (really), has kidnapped Caliope, the Siren, and by extension now controls the Kraken, threatening any foreign ship entering Kingsmouth's waters.  It is your job to set Calliope free and save the world or something.  I honestly didn't pay much attention this time around because it's pretty standard fare.\n\nSo, the short version - if you're looking for a continuation of the story because you were a big fan of the first game, you might be disappointed because it's only loosely related.  If, on the other hand, you are looking for a solid adventure game filled with some fun puzzles you can hash out while sipping on your favorite beverage, you'll enjoy this.  Artifex Mundi has really nailed down their craft, and I couldn't be happier for it.","October 19, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a recently converted Artifex Mundi games acolyte I must say that this game made me really impressed. I played the older games from this publisher and they were typical fast, one-time casual games. This one aspires to be something more. A pleasant adventure with a good, heroic story. Really beautiful scenes (even comparing to the previous still good part 1) and even 3-D elements with characters making the game more realistic. Great sound and music at top level.\n\nIt is a hidden object game so let's check that. Quite a number of HOS well drawn (still I would like to see a bit more clutter to be more challenging), interesting twist with assembling objects from parts - that was fun. Logical puzzles and riddles sometimes seemed repetitive (comparing to previous titles) but still well made and based mostly on perception. Since it is a casual type of game, it strikes a nice balance between fun gameplay and a challenge (BUT should be played on Expert mode from the beginning). Adding extra achievements about finding extra items hidden throughout the game was a very good idea that prolongs the fun.\n\nI really recommend that game and wait for more from Artefix Mundi :-)","October 21, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one is an improvement on every level except possibly the voice-overs (which haven't gotten worse, but which i'll characterize as "average - not bad, certainly acceptable"). Most notably, the quality of the cinematic scenes is improved about 50x over its predecessor, and they are (still) used to good effect in transitioning between scenes.\n\ni'm _not_ a point-and-click adventure lover, nor a lover of puzzles, but at 8 Euros for the 3-part series i felt compelled to try this out (based on the positive reviews) and have not been disappointed. Each episose is short (under 6 hours for part 1, and i read that part 2 is under 4 [edit: i must be slow, because i needed just over 5 hours for the main story and had to ask the internet about one of the puzzles because i "just didn't get it"]), and couldn't normally justify paying the full asking price, but on sale it was certainly a reasonable deal.\n\nFantastic graphics, trivial controls, some improved/more advanced gimmickry in the puzzles (compared to part 1), and a lovely soundtrack make this a great casual game for the non-hard-core PaC/HOG players.\n\nPost-finish notes:\n\n- Just over 6 hours, including the bonus mini-adventure after the main storyline.\n\n- fantastic graphics and mixing of cinematics with still scenes.\n\n- the "bonus" hidden items (Parrots, Octopi, and Seahorses) are a nice touch, except that the Parrots come and go over time - they literally fade in and out of view within a scene (very subtly), so it's difficult to spot them and they might literally not be visible while you're looking for them. i manged to get all the Octopi, but not the others.\n\n- the protagonist is a spoiled brat: she refuses to smear jam on bread with her own fingers, and demands silverware for that purpose.

I wasn't disappointed at all. In fact, it's one of the best HOGs I've played in a long time, and that's coming from someone who has played a lot of these types of games. There's nothing terribly complicated about it. The story was the usual "rescue someone in distress" kind of thing. The main feature, as always, are the puzzles. I managed to polish the game off in 4 hours, but again I play these games a lot. If you love HOGs you'll definitely want to get this one.","April 19","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Again despite not liking the pirate theme I actually had a ton of fun playing this one than the first one. I got this from a discount.\n\nIn this Nightmare Of The Deep 2 u will be going into a town to save a Siren and the townspeople from doing somthing bad,\n\nThis is the second game from the Nightmares From The Deep series. Let me tell u that everything was improved with this version than the first one.\n\nThe cutscenes are 100% much better than the first game. The first games resolution in cutscenes was just terrible. Sound is much better. Music was nice to hear. The voice acting was ok. The graphics are nice just like the first one.\n\nOne other thing is that there is a bonud story that was fun to play. The bonus story picks up from when u beat the game. Plus the bonus story leaves of from a cliffhanger.\n\nSo in all make sure to get Nightmares From The Deep 2 as I had a lot of fun playing this HOG. Then onward to Nightmares From The Deep 3:)","June 1","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
