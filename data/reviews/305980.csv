People are used to FPS with a free movement, more weapons and more gameplay. I can also understand that you can get bored with the repetitve scenes. And well, it's true that in the easy mode, you have often sunlight in the eyes and being blind to any enemies. True, the fact that the controller can't be set for player 1 is also annoying as the default keys for the keyboard aren't natural at all for me (AZERTY keyboard...). However, I don't understand the "outdated graphics". Seriously, you don't need CoD graphic quality to enjoy a war FPS! Graphics are good in my opinion.\n\nAnd besides, the gameplay is nervous. Once you progress in the game, you can see more enemies at the screen. And when the Veteran mode is unlocked, some stuf change. Like the fact that the enemy is quicker to hurt you. I'm not used to rail shooter, I prefer "normal FPS" but it doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy it.\n\n\nAnd for the controller thing? Developers will fix that in the next update (well normally).\n\nAnyway, anyone is entitled to its opinion. I enjoyed this game. It's not the Game of the Year. Sure, if you're a lover of great graphics (à la CoD), you'll be disappointed. But I don't think that graphics make a game. Everything is coherent in the game, apart dates. I totally recommend it, not because I'm in love with this game, but mainly because it's still fun to beat high scores...\n\n","August 23, 2014","true","9.9"," 38 of 48 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","38","48","0","1"

The developer made no attempts to hide the fact, so if you read a review from someone who is particularly irate about this, they probably lack reading and visual interpretation skills.\n\nHeavy Fire: Afghanistan is the guiltiest of pleasures. It's more linear than a triple-A shooter, has a setting that's about as overdone as that pizza I left in the oven last night, and quick-time events that would make David Cage blush. And yet, between the story and dialogue that fumbles with both the English language and basic military jargon, guns that look and sound like they were assembled from the imagination of Call of Duty-playing seven-year-olds, and graphics that give off a "Medal of Honor 2010 played on a toaster" vibe, this game... is pretty fun.\n\nIt's a basic on-rails shooter that doesn't really do anything wrong gameplay-wise, in a setting that doesn't do anything new, setting-wise. You'll brease through it in two hours, although there's a "Veteran" mode which amps up the difficulty once you've beaten the main story. You could do a lot worse with five dollars... but you could also do a lot better.","December 20, 2014","true","2.5"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","22","25","4","1"

If you ever want a break from the usual modern FPS format, this is an option that's just as entertaining, but in its own way. This game challenges the player; not always fairly, but usually so. The health meter is a welcome change from being able to recharge health by waiting under cover. Your weapons will sound a bit silly, but they get the job done. This is a game with a realistic setting, non-stop action (except for the shooting ranges) and despite its low price, it's visuals are as breathtaking as any modern game.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the choice of genre: the rail shooter. It's an older style, but age in itself doesn't determine quality. We live in a time where first person shooters are legion, and most operate very similarly. If you ever want a break from that, one option is to try an older style. Would it be more exciting in an arcade cabinet? Yes, and if you tried playing this with an Xbox controller you would have a horrible experience. But as you get past the middle of the game, it gets tough, and if you want to beat the game, you couldn't do it in an arcade cabinet. A mouse and keyboard are the best way to go for this. If you spray and pray in this game, you will get hit even if you kill the enemy. But if you take advantage of the precision a mouse provides, you can get out from cover and have a fair chance of killing him without taking a hit. The difficulty may shock and tick you off if you're used to games where you can press a button to stick to cover and shoot at your enemy without exposing yourself, which is no challenge at all. In my opinion, a quality shooter of any kind is one where you have to make your own cover and get out from behind it to engage an enemy, and this game fills that requirement.\n\nAnd yes, I said difficulty. Some reviewers claim that this game is as easy as Whack-A-Mole. Maybe they're the god-like, all-day snipers of Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat who cause normal mortals like me to stop playing those games out of having no chance of scoring a point. Maybe they only played the console version. Or maybe they only played the first level on normal mode, because the further I get through this game, the more that claim confuses me. The enemy can shoot back, and sometimes there will be little to no pause between the shots of one enemy and the next, making it almost impossible to break cover and shoot back without getting hit. It makes the grenades like precious gems, because they're the best way to clear enemies that won't hardly let you stick your head up. This game does challenge the player; not always fairly, but usually so. Then there are levels where you get in an Abrams tank or an Apache attack helicopter, where the enemy can't do an opium-picking thing to you, and the main challenge then is hitting everything and doing it fast, because you're always on the move.\n\nThen there's the realism factor. Criticisms are: shoot an enemy anywhere and he dies, we're back to health meters and health packs, and the guns are just plain silly. To be fair, the rifles and pistol certainly are silly, and there's no good reason to spend an upgrade point on a new rifle, because nothing changes. Save it for extra ammo, health, grenades and faster reload time. The guns look highly detailed, but the player's small arms sound like Robotron fighting Megaman in the middle of a disco. The guns of your allies and enemies sound much better, and so do weapons mounted on vehicles. As for health meters and single shot kills, a health meter and health packs are much more realistic than many shooters where you just have to crawl under a rock and wait five seconds for all your wounds to heal, and single hit kills are more realistic than needing to put two rounds into a target's head or five into his chest. Think of the ArmA games: no mercy from bullets. I welcome the health meter back with open arms.\n\nNow for the story. The problems that you can't escape from are the sloppy syntax and prose in this game, mainly in the journal entries before the missions. If you're thinking "This doesn't sound anything like a Marine, or any English speaker", then that's because this game was made by Teyon, a Polish video game developer. This is not the first game to have translation problems, but they could have done better on the journal entries (although the radio chatter in mid-battle sounds authentic). There are some other inaccuracies: the uniforms are Army uniforms and not Marine uniforms, and the Marines do not use the Black Hawk or the Chinook. As for the content, it doesn't deserve the hate that it gets from the politically correct about being a game in a real setting like Operation Enduring Freedom. Nobody has a problem with all the games set in the Second World War, where just about every side can be played as. Spec Ops: The Line, where your main enemies are American soldiers, has gotten a pass, so there's no ground to stand on when ridiculing this game for being from a modern American soldier's point of view. If you ask me, gamers could do with a healthy, even if unpleasant, dose of reality in their lives. Instead of trying to make some idiotic moral equivalence between the US and its foes, this game is based on authentic characters. The Marines are experts and professionals, who pull out all the stops to complete their mission with as few casualties as possible. The game punishes the player for friendly fire and civilian casualties, as it should if it wants to be taken seriously. The game doesn't name the enemy, it calls them “rebels”, but if you don't know who they really are, you must be living under a rock. They are portrayed accurately as well: they wear civilian clothes, take civilians hostage and hide behind them, and know no limits as to where they will fight from. Although the places and times of the battles aren't exact representations of real life, the concepts are real enough: combined arms battles in environments like mountains, small villages, big cities, and military bases. If you want something more varied and fantastic, then play Mass Effect or something.\n\nFinally, I believe the game's greatest strength is in its visuals. They stand with the best of modern games. You could only get a better picture of the Afghan combat environment from a TV camera or actually visiting it. Every pocket of a uniform, every feature of a vehicle or weapon, and every contour of a building is superb. You have to deal with the very real problem of natural and artificial light in a battle, meaning it gets in your eyes. In an age where graphics are as advanced as they are, it might not seem like such a big deal that the game has excellent visuals, but how about when it has them and is selling for $5 on Steam? Now that's a cut apart, isn't it?\n\nIn the end, while it may not be my favorite game of all time, it was still a worthwhile purchase that I recommend.","August 27, 2014","true","14.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

Which some are steam achievements! After you finish the 12 operations you unlock, almost a hardcore mode, where you run back through the missions with thier difficulty increased, called Vetaran mode.\n\nPros:Combat System - The game has a highly enjoyable combat system, throwing grenades, destroying tanks and cars, having to pick up ammo drops and grenades, the on-rails part of the game is a hit and miss with some players but I find it really fun to have to know where the camera is and avoid shooting my own teammates.\nControls -  The controls are quite easy to comprehend and arnt all over the place like some other games.\nObstacles - The game is quite inventive with the obstacles it has to offer, the game uses even things like SUNLIGHT as an obstacle so that players cant see some enemies as well, and HF:A also has checkpoints in case you die!\nGraphics - The graphics arnt too amazing as the game was really originally made in 2011, but at that point in time these graphics would be considered well done, and I believe they are decent.\nSteam Integration - Having steam trading cards and achievements are a great edition to the game, that just add that little extra inch that makes the game even better!\nTHE PRICE! - The price of the game is only 3 dollars! And thats not even on sale or in a bundle! Its amazing the game isnt more because it really feels like a 10 or 15 dollar game!\n\nCons:Storyline - The story line in the game isnt too well done, most of the mission statements are short and not very exciting to the player, cut scenes arnt very amazing either.\nSetting - Where the game takes place, in fictional Afghanistan, has been done many times before this and is quite a common setting to see a shooter game bieng held.\nVoice Acting+Sound Effs - The voices arnt too well done and alot of people have problems with the gun shooting sounds, these arnt HORRIBLE to the game, but it isnt a pro thats for sure.\n\nI would rate this game 7/10Heavy Fire: Afghanistan is a great game. If you have played alot of shooters, and cant stand ontherails shooters I would suggest you not get the game because it isnt too far off your classic shooter. But obstacles like sunlight and machine guns, and the low price of the game, and the challenging aspects of the later gameplay really make this game amazing, $3 is a great price for 5+ hours of gameplay and even more if you want to delve into veteran mode. WIth 9 hours of gameplay I still havnt beaten the first 12 missions and I plan to keep coming back and taking on these missions and getting those achievements. I enjoy the game alot and Im sure you will too!\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","March 21","true","8.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I've always thought on-rails shooters were kind of fun, but this game made me question whether they'll ever have a place on PC. After all, playing an on-rails shooter with a mouse rather than a light gun eliminates virtually all challenge. And you probably couldn't play this game with a light gun even if you felt like going to the trouble to configure one, because it utilizes five buttons for its multidirectional cover feature and input commands for QTEs. It isn't a bad game, but at the same time, it's hard to come up with compliments.

The genre has been pretty much dead ever since the golden age of arcades in the mid-nineties, saw a small return with the Wii just to be all but vanished again these days. So, starved for some mindless on rails shooting I got myself Heavy Fire: Afghanistan - hoping it would at least be of somewhat respectable quality.\n\nAs it turns out, this game feels like it was produced for the NES zapper and came right out of 8bit console hell. See, 1987 there was Operation Wolf and 1989 there was Mechanized Attack (the first lightgun shooter I ever played) - both games feature more excitement and fun in the first stage (which roughly lasts 1-3 minutes) than godawful Heavy Fire: Afghanistan. How so you might ask? Well, for starters Heavy Fire has a story that takes itself serious. This is not Schwarzenegger's COMMANDO turned videogame, this is the actual War on Terror turned shooting gallery - not cool in my book. They could have made this good, harmless fun like TOTAL CARNAGE back in the day did - but no, they went with the realistic approach. I am not down with an arcade game having such a serious background.\n\nGood thing the rest is just as much of a mess, so skipping this (if you felt like checking it out in the first place) is no big deal. Seriously, I cannot imagine how to make this game any less exciting. The pacing is slow, there is a lack of some serious explosions and firepower, there is next to NO feedback or hit confirmation, animations suck - as mentioned before, arcade games from the 80ies(!) destroy this p.o.s. of a game. There is also nothing to make this game engaging in any shape or form: no multipliers, no combos, no diversity. Remember those cool combos you could do in Virtua Cop? Not here. Or shooting holes into zombies in House of the Dead? Can't do anything like that. It does have an awkward cover system, but that is about the only thing it shares with Time Crisis. Hmm, what else? Grenades are super-awkward to use, with a big wind-up before your guy actually throws the damn things instead of acting like insta-smartbombs as any person who actually has played GOOD lightgun games would imagine and OF COURSE there is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ perk/level-up system in place (every two completed missions you get to choose EXCITING upgrades like bigger clip-size!). Did I mention they even borked reloading? Don't think so: well, they borked reloading. Instead of it being instant you get a crappy cooldown, forcing you to keep your head in cover, even with faster reload this is not as fast as I would want this to be. Also, ammo is limited. Oh, and we got QTEs - can't have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game without those, right?\n\nThis game has barely anything going for it besides the visuals, which are okayish (though somebody hit 11 on the post-processing) and we got House of the Dead: Overkill on Steam which is so incredibly superior to this that there is NO reason to waste 5 bucks like I did. So, until you want to relive the excitement of Duck Hunt on your NES with PS2 graphics and USA!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/305980/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","VERDICT: Heavy Fire: Afghanistan is a well polished, if short, rail-shooter with cover mechanics, unlockable weapons and equipment, and quick-time events.\n\nFull of quick-moving, adrenaline pumping firefights that occur in numerous fixed locations keeping you on your toes and forces you to take cover, acquire where targets are located, before shooting or blowing them up!  Limited ammo and explosives mean you are always looking to replinish your ever decreasing resources as the sequence of fights never let up until you complete the mission.\n\nBetween missions you can update your equipment and weapons with up to twelve unlocks suchs as better weapons, larger ammo capacity or more grenades.  The enemy A.I. is competant enough to provide a challenge especially on Veteran difficulty.\n\nThere isnt much of a learning curve and it doesnt last very long but in the few hours that you begin and end your mission you will get to experience a lot of fast paced and explosive action.   Being a relatively cheap game it punches above its weight..., I mean cost!\n\nIt best feature is the way it keep the action moving forwards towards a conclusion just like a good novel.  Together with the excellent graphics, atmospheric sound and easy to use controls you get a great feeling of immersion.  It worst feature... well apart from its shortness.... Has to be the awful voice-overs during the mission de-brief... argh!! :)\n\nWill appeal to fans of the genre, achievement hunters or anyone who likes a cheap game.  If you dont like linear gameplay then avoid.  Personally I loved playing through it twice.\n\n\n... MORE DETAILS BELOW ...\n\n\n01. GENRE: FPS Military themed, Rail Shooter w/ QTE\n\n02. SETTING: Modern Day, Afghanistan War\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: You play the role of a soldier in a unit of the United States Army.  You are currently based in Afghanistan fighting a fictional skirmishes against insurgents.\n\n04. GAME MODES: Fourteen mission single-player campaign played in two difficulty settings - Rookie and Veteran modes, one after each other.  Play mostly as (grunt) foot soldier, with a very few missions as a gunner in armored vehicle or tank or helicopter.  These do a nice job of shaking up the action somewhat.\n\n05. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: Game mechanics couldn't be much simpler.  A series of linear firefights that take place in predetermined locations interspersed by sections of fluid automated movement linking each  location.  At each location enemies appear and try to shoot at you.  You in turn shoot/lob grenades, reload, get into cover.  Rinse and repeat.  Cover sometimes provides two or more options in the direction you choose.  This is something of a tactical decision as part of the screen remains open to enemy shooters so you may find you have to change cover position to remain safe.  Intersperced throughout every mission are a number of Quick-time events, introduced to shaken up the regular rhythm of gameplay specifically to keep you on your toes throughout the firefights.\n\nVisual threats are indicated on screen so you can determine which enemy soldier is the biggest threat at a particular moment in the mission.  While additional audio indicators are used to indicated danger from heavy weapons.  Environmental elements such as smoke and sunlight are used to good effect to blind you from possible enemies lurking at a location.  While also adding an additional element of immersion to gameplay.  In addition the constant moving,  swaying, and ever changing line-of-sight, means you never quite have the time and occasion to take a perfect shot.  While the ever constantly changing camera angle greatly enhances the real threat of friendly fire taking place towards other members of your unit.\n\nDifficultly is implemented though a combination of factors the speed at which enemies appear and shoot, enemy numbers and a reduction inresource replenhishments.  As you progress through each mission there are numerous resource refil icons to replenish ammo, health and grenades.  But you have to be quick.  If you miss them you must do without until the mission is completed.\n\nThere is an Armory screen that shows twelve unlockable weapons and equipment upgrades that makes the game easier and more fun to play.\n\nThere is a ranking system that promotes you as you progress through the campaign twice; first on novice difficulty, followed by veteran mode.  This makes for a good learning curve as the harder difficult provides a decent challenge.  Completing missions gives points that total up towards a Ranking level.  The greater the combied scores the higher the rank.  The higher the rank the better the player.\n\n06. ENEMIES: Muhjahadeen and insurgents armed with AK-47s and RPGs.  Some heavy machineguns and rocket launchers mounted on pickup trucks, BTR armoured transports, and Hind helicopters.\n\n07. LEVEL DESIGN: Short, immersive levels. Uses a terrific range of locations so that you are never bored of the surroundings you find yourself in.  Camera sway and movement adds an extra dimension so you never quite feel in control of the situation.  Otherwise the threats are limited to mainly enemy soldiers and a number of heavy weapons or armored vehicles and helicopters make an appearance like end of level bosses.\n\n08. A.I: Robust if somewhat basic.  Then again this genre really doesnt need anything other than an A.I. that provides enough of a challenge for whoever is playing the game.\n\n09. CONTROLS: Excellent mouse and keyboard functions.  Especially pertinent is the mouse sensitivity options.  You may need this if you're mouse moves like a lead ballon as there is no light-gun for PC... :(  Whats a light-gun?  ^^\n\n10. GRAPHICS: Great.  Very colourful and adds to the immersion.\n\n11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: Basic.  A single catchy soundtrack that eggs you forwards.  Some decent weapons sounds, shouts, screams, radio chatter and background explosions add to the immersion.\n\n12. VOICE ACTING: Not a big fan of the voice-overs in this game.  Felt like the voice actors were sub-par but thankly their use is limited only to the mission debriefs.\n\n13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: A breeze on Novice difficulty.  Actually challenging in places on Veteran difficulty.  The save checkpoints and environmental features add to the difficulty in veteran mode.\n\n14. PROBLEMS: No problems were encountered installing, running or playing this game.\n\n15. ACHIEVEMENTS: A good mix of achievements.  Mostly standard achieve x kills.  Complete mission y, etc... All easily obtainable by plaing through the campaign in Novice and  Veteran difficulty modes.  There are a few combo related achievements that may require a replay of a level or two.\n\n16. DLC: None.\n\n17. PLAYTIME: From five to ten hours to play the same campaign twice.\n\n18. LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY:  Fans of the genre who dont mind replaying the same campaign can do so to better their score.  If you're an achievement hunter then you will play through the campaign twice and most likely complete all but one achievement during those playthroughs.\n\n19. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: If you are fan of this genre or are too lazy to play a bon-a-fide FPS then this could be something you should consider.   Especially if you have a preference for modern day military themes set around the recent wars against religious fundamentalism.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Perfect value for money.  If only it was a little longer.  A steal on sale.  An easy recommendation.","July 9, 2015","true","7.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

So... why not take the concept, but allow people to play in the comfort of their own home. Unfortunately, without the virtual gun, and with a not-quite-as-intuitive cover system, this rail shooter falls flat. Whether you play with a gamepad or keyboard and mouse - the controls are slow and sluggish, and the movements and animations just don't feel right. This is exacerbated by the Quick Time Events... probably one of my least favourite mechanics or gimmicks in any game - there is just no need for them, and they don't add anything to the gameplay experience except annoyance.\n\nAdditionally, considering this is on PC... the limitations of a rail shooter are woefully exposed when compared to the vast array of FPS games already on the market: you are directed where to go with no freedom at all except to duck in and out of cover and pop off a few shots. Even in FPS games with very linear levels, at least you can look around a room: not so in a rail shooter.\n\nThe audio for the game is pretty terrible, the weapons and explosions don't sound good at all. They sound generic, flat, and are of pretty low quality. The voice acting complements the poor soundtrack, with the voice actors not playing their part very well at all. This is compounded by the writing: not only is the overall plot of the game short and poor, but the dialogue is also poorly written, and is completely out of place.\n\nThen there are the visuals, which look... reasonable, I guess. Not great, but not absolutely terrible like everything else about this game. Still, the ability to be completely blinded and be completely unable to see anything at all by sun glare and the excessive muzzle flash are both major weaknesses. Realistic perhaps, but definitely not conducive to a fun game.\n\nFor me, the only redeeming factor for the game is the progression, with the ability to pick perks after missions to customise your character.\n\nSkippable. Very skippable.","July 9, 2015","false","3.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","1"

It is easy to be put off this game because of the large number of negative reviews, but most of them are people that are complaining about the fact that it is an On-Rails Shooter, despite the fact that it is clearly advertised all over the store page, resulting in the game having an unfair overall review score.\n\nHeavy Fire: Afghanistan is fun, fast-paced and very atmospheric, qualities that you would hope for in an arcade-like shooter. The maps are really well done creating a very immersive and grim atmosphere, as you would expect in 2011 Afghanistan, the sun is blazing making it difficult for you to get a clear view of targets and there is heavy enemy fire coming from all corners of your view. The chaotic gameplay makes this game more challanging than your other average On-Rails Shooter games too, a perks system and multiple achievements are also nice touches.\n\nThe aiming is a little finnicky at first, but you get used to it very quickly, plus the controls are extremely simple overall so it takes little to no time to master them. There aren't many faults with this game in my opinion, just some minor things like small grammatical errors in the campaign dialog and some questionable voice acting, not to mention the anti-climactic death sequence, but that's about it, nothing ultimately hurting the fact that it's a fun game.\n\nSure, On-Rails Shooters may be from an era that is now long gone, and it isn't as popular or as good as The House of The Dead series for example, but that doesn't make Heavy Fire: Afghanistan any less of a well-made and fun game, just make sure you know what kind of shooter you're actually about to buy before you make the purchase. As far as I'm concerned it is more than worth it's £1.99 price tag, definitely recommend for a few hours of challenging and rewarding fun.","April 2, 2015","true","6.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

That's a good model to crib from, as most of the games in that series are great. Unfortunately, Heavy Fire: Afghanistan misses the mark.\n\nThis is going to come off as a really unfair comparison review. I don't care for writing these, since all too often they boil down to: "Why play this? When you can play this instead?" Also, what's the alternative? The PS2 has quite a few of the Time Crisis games, but you need the console, the games, the Guncon controllers, and a suitable TV. There's also the PS3 compilation pack that includes a couple Crisis games, but you still need the system, the games, a couple of Move controllers, etc etc. HF:A is a game you probably already own via a bundle, so let's try and make the most of it.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with the game is the length. It's about 2 hours long. Content is king but when it comes to arcade games, brevity is the soul of excellence(???). The 2 hour play-time involves a lot of padding. Each of the 12 stages is more of what you'd expect from a rail shooter. Go to an area, shoot all of the enemy soldiers, move onto the next one. This repeats over and over again with hardly any variation. The bad-guys are in different locations, but little else changes. Arcade rail-shooters generally take around 15-25 minutes to complete, and yet they still do a lot more in that shorter span of time. There are different types of enemies, some are on a variety of vehicles, others attack from all sorts of angles. Boiled down to the basics, rail-shooters hinge on the shooting gallery aspect, where your accuracy and reflexes are what keep you alive. It's how you dress everything up that keeps them interesting. HF:A doesn't do this often enough, despite how long it takes to complete.\n\nThat's not to say HF:A is nothing but soldiers firing away. Every now and then there's a guy with a knife, a heavy-gunner on a pick-up, a couple BTRs, and a Hind. Unfortunately the biggest different between the latter three adversaries is the number of bullets they take to destroy. All you have to do is make sure to get behind cover when you hear the machinegun rev up. Part of the problem I suppose is that this game is very loosely based on reality. I can't go into it expecting things like cyborgs, a final boss that's actually a brain in a jar surrounded by laser cannons, a plot to destroy America with a satellite, etc. Still, there seems like there could be a lot more variety. Give some of those soldiers different guns and have them employ different tactics. Most of the time all the enemies do is run to a particular spot and start firing away, only occasionally ducking behind cover. Something as simple as having some enemies running while shooting at you would have added a lot to the game.\n\nAnother problem with HF:A is that it isn't quite sure what it wants to be. The guns you unlock come with larger clips and by the end you've got an LMG and going Rambo on the soldiers. Rail-shooters usually fall into two camps by this point. You've got titles like Virtua Cop and Time Crisis where you're given pistols that require constant reloading, and then on the opposite end of the spectrum there are games such as L.A. & N.Y. Machineguns, Space Gun, and Rambo (the somewhat recent Sega arcade release). HF:A tries to do both (sorta like Time Crisis 3 & 4) but it never really works. For most of the game you just end up feeling like you're over-equipped, so there's no strategy. It's unfortunate that making the player-character into a 1-4 man army would have stretched the narrative far too thin. A game where you walk into an enemy base and destroy everything in minutes would have been far more exciting. Soldiers are pouring in so you gotta shoot them all, then the tanks roll in, maybe shoot some jets out of the sky. Basically this game would be turned into a next-gen Operation Wolf.\n\nSo this definitely turned out to be a comparison review. It feels like all I did was mention a bunch of games you'd be better off spending your time with. You could probably play through at least four of them in the time it would take to get through Heavy Fire: Afghanistan, and they'd all be more entertaining.\n\nSKIP","September 25, 2014","false","1.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

There is a reasonable variety in the missions, in the open, villages, tunnels/caves, on a helicopter, in a tank, etc. so it doesn't become too repetitive.\n\nThe difficult ramps up reasonably well through the game, with an initial easy mode that unlocks a veterans campaign which is reasonably tough although it can be a bit checkpoint dependant - if you miss a health pack just before a checkpoint in a couple of places it can make it very difficult to advance without restarting the level. Other than that the checkpoints are fine, avoiding having to replay too much when you die, but not too close together so you have to get at least vaguely competent to advance (in VM at least).\n\nThe story is functional but fairly forgettable and generic, the on rails gameplay works fine here for me - you act reasonable sensibly, always having cover available (although it isn't usually 100% so you have to pick off a couple of enemies while in cover before you can reload and take on the rest of the scene one by one. You are a bit of a bullet sponge (especially once you have progressed and got the bonus health) but not to the point of immersion breaking - you do feel vulnerable to enemies, especially heavy machine guns and the like.\n\nThere are a few weak points though - repeatedly taking on BTRs with small arms (Technicals, sure), whereas at the opposite side of the scale a certain enemy that takes 10+ direct hits from a bazooka to kill seems unlikely. There are also quite a lot of quick time events where you are nearly crushed to death by a falling object or whatever, but following the instruction is optional - you dodge anyway, you just get extra points (and say "Hoo-ah!"). This leads onto the sound more generally - which is competent, but cliched and repetitive.\n\nOverall this is a decent but fairly forgettable addition to the genre, recommended if you like this sort of "Time Crisis" gameplay, especially given it is not exactly expensive to pick up even when not on sale.","February 23","true","7.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

In Heavy Fire: Afghanistan you play as Will who is re telling his war stories that we relive and play through shooting our way through a war. So how is this game ? This game is bad and thats pretty much all i can say about it. Now as on rails shooter theres not much to say about it. You are put on a track and as soon as you clear out a room of enemies you progress on a track. But the game has many problems. Lets start off with the good. The game has pretty fun gameplay but even that wears out very fast. But now for the bad and theres alot to say here. The game is buggy and the hit detection is horrible. The game looks okay but the resolution problems really affect the game since its hard to tell where the enemies are when everything looks the same. The game is easy and also really short. The story is abysmal. The game also has one big problem. You have to make an account for the game if you want for the game to save. If you dont make an account the game will delete all youre progress. Overall the game is buggy and not fun to play and even though i love on rail shooters i cant recommend this game cause simply put it its not fun at all.

Wow... I've seen some horrible ♥♥♥♥ in my life, as some other state i've played Ride to Hell: Retribution, Rambo the videogame, The Slaughtering Grounds and The walking dead: survival instinct and even when those titles suck, i've enjoy them, but this game it's a total pile a garbage. This game it's like the product of a hobo and dump cannister having a child's puke, a dog eating that puke and the ♥♥♥♥ comming out of the dog it's this game, everything about it is just horrible, when i've got the game (for 2.99) didn't really think that i could see with my own eyes how Teyon (btw the developer of Rambo the videogame) could really make such masterpiece of the art of completly sucking balls. I could go on and on for hours with the totally complete wrong things it makes this game so horrible, and i will.\n\nGraphics: They are pretty much OK for a 2010/11 game, not really sensation but somehow not that bad, thought there are really annoying things like getting blinded by the sun (i could't see the enemies so i just shoot blindly straight forward until they die, and this happends a lot)\n\nSound: The worst thing without a doubt, voice actors were paid like 5 bucks each and they did that, make a voiceover for characters worth 5 bucks, aside from that gunfire sounds is horrible, i've played so many games that have guns in it and never heard such horrible gunshots sounds.\n\nGameplay: Reasonable. just one word for it, it's not good but it's not really that bad EXCEPT FOR THE MOUSE HAVING NO SENSIVILITY AND WORKING HORRIBLY LIKE IF YOUR DPI WERE 50.\n\nMetascore: 0.63/100 - this game isn't even got to scratch 1 point, maybe the price is the only thing right about it.","April 11, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","6","13","3","0"

Don't bother trying to get into the story or listen to the dialogue because that's where the game crumbles. The graphics are very gritty and arcade-y, by that I mean it looks like it was made to be played on the GameCube and not a high end PC, but still, is it fun? Yeah. It's pretty fun to have your own arcade game with a points system on your computer. You get two guns, an M16 and a pistol. A good strategy I found is to let your M16 run out and use your pistol, because your pistol kills everything in one shot.\n\nIs it good? Not close to good, more or less the amount of quality you'd find in an arcade shooter, like the Terminator one but with a difficulty setting and all. I do reccomend getting this game if you can get it cheap, it's a nice little time waster.","November 5, 2014","true","1.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But wtf ... I enjoy it for what it is. It's better than CoD in my Opinion, because this game here is straightforward dumb and linear. So what? I don't have a problem with that. It's a rail shooter you know ... ;)\n\nThe theme somehow reminds me of "Northern Sea Inferno" / "Persian Guld Inferno" whereas the gameplay itself reminds me of "Take'em'out". In did enjoy those two games back in the day and I'm enjoying this game here and now too.\n\nI think the graphics are ok and well enough done for a game like this. I didn't expect to have free movement because I read the game description before purchasing it. I can't understand how many reviewers here keep moaning about this game being no real fps ... Or as we over here in germany say: "Wer lesen kann ist klar im Vorteil." ... :)\n\nThe controls are tight and you can choose to play with controller or mouse. Even the rumble feature is supported and configurable in strength. I personally prefer to play such a game with the mouse because it's much faster.\n\nYou WILL HAVE TO play it with a controller if you wanna coop - yes this game even has a coop. I haven't tried it but I think it would be great fun for an evening instead of watching a movie.\n\nBut even if you're playing alone there are nearly always plenty of other marines with you on the missions so you better watch out to shoot only at the enemies as friendly fire is possible and done easily in the mess of it all. So watch out not to hurt your team mates or your mission may be rated as failure.\n\nThe missions in this game vary a lot in what is happening and the overall action never gets boring. Between the missions you can upgrade your marine by investing points in different tech-trees like more ammo, better weapons and the like. And you will have to play through the whole game at least twice to see them all, preferably using the included Veteran Mode to do the second run.\n\nI got this game on a discount and from what I've seen yet it fullfills exactly what it promised, so I do recommend you to get this game too if you want some oldschool railshooter action without having all the hassle of a full fledged fps going on.\n\n@ngel","October 5, 2014","true","8.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

No video options. Stuck to monitor's maximum hertz. When I mean no video options, I mean like no graphical options like consoles. No resolution, nothing. Guise of the Wolf (which only had a resolution option) even has an option!\n2. You have a score at the bottom of your screen. In my opinion, useless.\n3. It's an on-rails shooter by Teyon, the same people who made Rambo: The Video Game. BUT, because this was originally made for the Xbox 360 in 2011, they get a free pass right? WRONG!\n4. One of the worst ports to PC I've ever seen.\n\nI thought to myself as I saw a bundle with this game in it. "I've beaten Ride to Hell: Retribution, nearly beaten Rambo: The Video Game, played the Slaughtering Grounds and The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct, how bad can it be?"\nOH GOD. So I buy this bundle from bundlestars.com (BTW, great website) for $3.49. I open the game to loud audio and it says, "Controller recommended" so I turn on my wireless Xbox 360 controller for Windows. Ok, three options in the Audio, that's ok. "But I have to use the triggers to change them and press X to accept the options?" From there on, I knew this would be going downhill fast. So I boot up the campaign to see 12 missions and a Veteran mode. I was aparently in the "Rookie" section because I probably would have to beat the game to go into the "Veteran" mode. That's fine. Launching the game, I hear an OK backstory of a soldier and then we arrive on a helicopter to Afghanistan. The first thing I noticed was the sterotype that all Afghans wear either turbans or balacavas. I thought, "Wonderful". The graphics are ok for 2011, so I try to move my standards down a little to that year. When I got into the game though...\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the M16 they supplied me with. When you run out of ammo, you have an infinite extra ammo Berreta they switch you over to when you run out of ammo. I'm surprised they added an actually "ammo" feature. When I shoot the gun for the very first time... I said, "The Slaughtering Grounds and Ride to Hell: Retribution have better sound quality than this!" The gun sounded like you tapped a button on your controller. The pistol has a very small sound. Then I noticed that I was invincible. I couldn't die, like I was a god. My health wouldn't go down (speaking of which there is no difficulty option) and then I got worried. After I beat the first level, I'd rather "masturbate with sandpaper".\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME! $3.00 isn't worth it, heck, it's worth $0.05 for maybe a giggle with your friends.\nRating:\n0.3/10\nThe only reason it gets 0.3 is because the ok graphics for 2011. For people like me who like to play the dark-depths-of-hell games like me, this might be worth it to you. The only other reason I'd get it is if you love arcade rail-shooters that much. Everyone else: STAY AWAY FOR YOUR LIFE!\n\nP.S: RAMBO: THE VIDEOGAME IS BETTER BY INFINITE AMOUNTS COMPARED TO THIS!","February 19, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","1"

It's an rail shooter, which will put a lot of people off. There's nothing wrong with rail shooters and games like Time Crisis, Virtua Cop and Ghost Squad are loved by the people who like them. And I do like me a bit of Ghost Squad.\n\nMany people don't like rail shooters because all they do is point and click, but there can be subtlety to them like Ghost Squad's choice system and Virtua Cop's hidden items and difficult bonus kills. Heavy Fire Afghanistan (HFA) has none of that.\n\nFor starters, it's too easy. You're never really under threat. I cruised through the first two levels, barely taking a hit. I did run out of ammo once, until I realised that one hit was enough to take down any enemy. Even the cover system is barely necessary. You get an exclamation mark above the head of everyone who is about to shoot, so it's easy to just stand there and shoot everyone. Hmm.\n\nThe game is clearly a lazy port and constantly refers to Xbox controls. There's even a bit of laziness on the interface - you can see the edges of button pics and interface items. Nothing terrible, but it shows the lack of care in the port.\n\nI'll probably play this a couple more times before I completely forget I own it. I got it as part of a bundle and so it's kind of okay for that, but it's still a forgettable, easy, empty experience.","February 10, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're unsure as to what this means, it's a bit like those "House of the Dead" arcade machines (or "Time Crisis"), where you don't really control where your character - the only movement you have is to duck into cover.  If you're expecting Call of Duty or Battlefield, you'll be disappointed.\n\nIt's actually not too bad a game.  The animation and graphics are pretty good (even if the effects for explosions are crap) and the makers have made a decent effort in this area.  Voice acting is fair too.\n\nThe cover system in the game is pretty reasonable - not all cover provides total protection from the bad guys.  You may be hidden from most of the enemies, but there may still be one or two that can hit you.\n\nIt's not an awful game.  But it could be better.\n\nAs I said before, the explosions are rather disappointing - they don't look realistic at all (and no I'm not expecting huge fireballs from grenades).  A little more effort here would make the game a bit more realistic.\n\nYou do tend to rely on shooting first-aid kits (for health) and ammo crates (for ammunition) but these are sometime rather difficult to see when half a dozen enemies are shooting at you.  (Ctd...)\n\nThere are a few parts of the game where you reach a checkpoint with low health, and then get killed shortly afterwards.  You have the option to re-start from the checkpoint, but this is with the same level of low health, which then makes it tough to progress from there onwards.  In that respect there are bits of the game where you end up re-starting the entire level, and it gets frustrating.\n\nThere are also a number of quick-time events (where a key will flash up on the screen and you have to press it quickly) that initiate a particular movement (dodging falling rubble for example).  However, I didn't really feel that they added that much to the game, or even that they were very important.\n\nWhen balancing all this though, you have to remember - it's only £3.99 at its regular price.  You could put that much into an arcade game and get about ten minutes of fun.  So for less than £4 you're getting a decent full game, but bear in mind that it's not a big-budget title, and adjust your expectations accordingly.\n\nIncidentally, some reviews and discussions mention problems with getting the game to run and/or stability (ie crashes) but I had no problems at all in this respect.\n\nI'd give it six or seven out of ten.","November 11, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a rail shooter similar to old arcade game Time Crisis (yes, the one with the light gun) where you need to shoot enemies while popping in and out of cover. It plays fast, its graphics looks quite decent, but it is buggy and at certain stages, near to impossible to pass. Even at the price of only a few dollars, it is still hard to recommend.\n\nA rail shooter basically moves for you, stops at certain locations with cover. Duck behind the cover to reload, pop out to shoot (when enemy stops shooting). In this game, if the enemy has the red exclamation mark he's about to hit you, and your health bar only goes so far. The problem is when there are like 6 to 7 bad guys on the screen, 2-3 are shooting at the same time. There is no correct time to shoot (or is there?) As you clear area after area, with enemies poping out from close to far, you have to ration your shots carefully (one shot will kill the enemies) lest you fall back to your pistol. Yes, you do shoot pistols too. Occasionally you get to play with vehicle mounted weapons, same idea.\n\nThe levels are quite decent, actually, look "reasonable" for the area they're depicting, villages, caves, mountain paths, city ruins, you get the idea. But enemies just... pop up, pretty much.\n\nThe only powerups you get are ammo, health, and grenade (only ONE) which blows up enemies on one side of the screen.\n\nThe game is buggy in that exiting the game can sometimes result in the game not starting the next time. The game's "launcher" will start, but as you click "play" both crashed to desktop, no error message. Sometimes change the video options and reinstall Direct X may cure it... until it happens again. There's seemingly no pattern to the crashes.\n\nAll in all, there are better "rail shooters" around than this "topical" shooter rushed out to fit the news cycles.","December 14, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
