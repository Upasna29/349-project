Thought I would give it a shot as it came in a bundle, but all you do is blow up stacks of lumber and steel, not buildings like I was expecting.  I've played older dos based demolition games with more to do than this pile of ##$%.","May 22, 2014","false","0.7"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","40","49","0","1"

I couldn't even make it thru the tutorial because it is such a snorefest.","July 12, 2014","false","0.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It is not anything like a high end aaa release. But it is not nearly as bad as other reviews make it out to be .","October 7, 2014","true","0.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"
