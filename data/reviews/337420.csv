The characters are very likable and amusing and somehow makes me think of Nippon Ichi Software (Disgaea, A Witch's Tale, etc). So if you like that sort of humor on top of fun puzzles, have at it!\n\nThe only thing I'd like to add would be a zoom out option for the puzzles. It only zooms out a bit, but it's nothing too troublesome.\n\nTIP: make use of the game's physics!! (and knocking stuff over is fun anyways)","December 12, 2014","true","3.9"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","37","42","0","1"

The system is average at best and has a number of annoying things, especially the cursor behavior. There are plenty of levels, however, one is no different from another. I decided to stop at the 17th level and the first two screenshots account for all the jokes in the intro...and unfortunately for all of the dialog till 17th level as well. The characters are done nicely, though the locations so far look as if they were taken from some cheap flash online game. The music also starts annoying after a while. All in all, I do not recommend this game.","January 20, 2015","false","1.8"," 42 of 55 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","42","55","0","0"

You need to guide and protect the kingdom’s princess, Mina, as she makes her way to the witch’s tower. As you dive deeper into the land of Vempire, you will meet unique characters such as Yavanna, the Blue Witch, and Gratel Urdan, a skilled huntress. You will face Mina’s enemies and find unique collectibles to help Mina on her journey.\n\nThe game is divided into four chapters, each abundant in missions. With each new chapter, players unlock a new set of magical abilities. For instance, you can turn into a bat or cast an illusion to distract Mina’s enemies. With each new power, there are two modes of play depending on the environment you are in.\n\nThe main point of this game is to protect the princess from those lights because it will turn Mina to stone if she hits any of those lights while running. Oh and you can’t stop Mina from running once you’re ready but don’t worry because Mina will stand and will not move on each stage as long as you won’t press that play button. That way, you can plan ahead and strategize how Mina can get to the next door without her hitting the lights.\n\n+POSTIVES\n\nAnime like graphics\nAddictive\nGreat for brain exercise while playing\n\n-NEGATIVES\n\nGets dull after a while\nDifficulty\nResponsiveness\n\n\nThis game was developed by Light Echo and looks like this is their first game. I have done a little research about them and from so little information I can get, I found out that they are from Poland. Also this is the PC port of the mobile game which was also good from what I hear.\n\n","January 24, 2015","true","15.9"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","0"

But still nice to have a checkpoint for those little screw-ups.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nHowever.....\n\nThe game is not bad but it will get boring. At around level 15 I got bored. I only got to other levels when I played 5-10 levels a day or so, slowly pacing myself through it which seems the only way to play this, in short bursts.\n\nPart from playing it in short bursts, the controls seemed to have changed when I started chapter 2.\nI don't know if this is just me or not but now I NEED to hold shift for my powers to work (why change this?!?) and that includes to move some objects. I don't know why they decided to do this when you just did 20 levels NOT holding shift to make your powers work. Why teach us something and then change it in the next chapter? It does make the levels drag on for no real reason to make the game longer.\n\nYou also collect garlic, 3 per level. But I have no idea what these are for other than just collecting everything. I don't see where they are needed, not even storywise. They don't appear to do anything other than making you be in a level a little bit longer.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nIf you really want this game, wait for the sales. Full-price is not worth it to get bored 10 minutes in. But it does not mean the game is a total failure. It has its perks but the levels are just not motivating to carry on further, even with a new gimmick each chapter the levels all seem the same.\n\nIf you get this game, play it in short bursts is all I can suggest to get the most out of it.\n\nOnly thing that would make me come back to this game or play it longer each day is if they had achievements, something even the small community would like but does not appear it will happen. I think achievements would of suited this game to be honest, specially since you need to collect garlic for no reason!","March 15","false","2.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

The story is not big, it is just as it says at the intro. I have no problem with the music (the game have only one if I remember well) but some people may have.\nThe game play is divided in two parts, plan and act. First, in the planing phase, you move objects to hide light sources. Later in the Acting phase you walk (actually, Mina walks alone, you just use the powers) through the scenery collecting garlic's (three per level) and other items.\nYou have four ability's which have different uses in the planing and acting phase.\nThe game itself is not bad but neither it is great, it is simple and relaxing but sometimes frustrating when you keep loosing on a level, happily it has a checkpoint to save objects (but if you leave the level, the save are lost) if you do not want to organize everything again.","June 8, 2015","true","10.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

You will like this. The game seems befitting of all ages. However there are times this game gets stressful and do read the instructions, it will save you the headache. Reason is that there are a lot of stages and for those who like a challenge try it. There are about over 100+ rooms for you to pass. The game is at best enjoyable. A 4 out of 5.

Gameplay though was not that pleasing, it gets repetitive real quick. Slide suit of armor here, amoire there, bookshelf over there, stack chests and cover window with bats, rinse, repeat next level and on and on....You can't see the whole scene either, you have to move the window covering furniture around to see what lies ahead, which is really annoying. After you get everything in place, click on the arrow and Mina runs and you have to cover the uncovered windows with bats so that she doesn't turn to stone. I really wanted to like this game, but it gets boring fast. 3/10","March 4, 2015","false","1.2"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","14","22","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/337420/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Steamified’s decision to target Light Echo’s Final Dusk came on a recommendation from a number of our loyal readers. They have all played and successfully finished the game before making the recommendation claiming that the game is an under appreciated game that is deserving of greater recognition by the Steam gaming community. The game has already been bundled eight times but the overwhelming sense that I get is that the game was mostly idled for its trading cards. Given the recommendation I decided to contact Light Echo to see if they were willing to have their game be featured as part of the Steamified Revisits series. The developers were quite happy to have their game featured.\n\nFinal Dusk was a success of the Steam Greenlight program. It is a vampire themed puzzle adventure game where the objective is to ensure that princess Mina has safe passage through to the end of each level. This means using abilities as well as environments to your advantage to protect Mina. Each level has two stages. The first involves positioning pieces of each level’s environment such as chests and wardrobes into the position best suited to block light while keeping garlic uncovered so that Mina can collect three each level to . The other stage involves assisting Mina on her journey by using her special abilities to protect her.\n\nWith eighty different levels there is a large amount of game play to play through. Unfortunately with such basic mechanics I found that the game play can become repetitive quite quickly and that the game is best played in short bursts rather than sitting down and playing it through to completion in only a couple of sittings. If you were to play the game I would recommend that you limit yourself to a few levels a day and giving yourself a couple of months to complete the game. There’s enough challenge in doing it this way that you will feel as though you have gotten more than your monies worth by the time that you have done. If, however, you do decide to complete the game immediately you may be putting yourself into a position where you find the game boring.\n\nAlthough the game has trading cards achievements have never been implemented and it is a game that sorely needs them in my opinion. Therefore it is a bitter disappointment that the game lacks them. They would be relatively simple to implement cost very little in the way of development costs and would have added a significant reason for players to want to complete – or certainly play – their game. The biggest problem with the game is the manner in which the game slides screens before each level. I feel that the game should transition much more smoothly than what it does and as such I found it to be very irritating. I would have quite enjoyed additional story throughout the levels as well.\n\nThe game, in short bursts as previously mentioned can provide an enjoyable and challenging experience. I quite enjoy the artistry of the game particularly with how each character is illustrated. The story that was present was suitably cute for a game that can be played at all ages. As such the game is quite accessible age wise. Otherwise the game is a well designed game that makes a solid entry in the casual puzzle game genre.\n\nFor more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com.","May 2","true","5.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I mean who can't like cute anime vampires. However, the game gets a bit boring and extremely repetitive for what appears to be no real goal in the end. The story seems to have been added to be like a visual novel while the actual game is a puzzle that though not extremely hard at first, gets hard enough that you start questioning why you're playing a game and wanting to just read what the story is.\n\nThis game would make more sense as a Visual Novel or as a puzzle game with a clear and well define goal at the end of each stage... not just moving up through hallways within the castle. I'm sure it changes later on but if you can keep your attention that long it may get better... At the time of this review I can't say if it would or wouldn't but based on my experience thus far, its not.\n\nI'd only recommend this for the anime character of the cute princess.","August 17, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although there are a few things I have to nitpick about:\n\n-Preparation phase/ action phase\nDurring the prep phase you can see the whole stage and understand both what to move, and what to do, to get all garlics and keep Mina out of sunlight. The problem comes at the action phase since you must use your mouse to click on moving targets and sometimes you may miss your mark, in case that happens you have to go though the whole prep phase again, and since you have already done everything and figured out everything it will get borring.\n\n-Choice of input device\nThis is more of a personal problem than a problem with the game itself. While the mouse works really well for the prep phase, durring the action I would rather work with a simplified targeting system with the keybord as it would be less easy to miss my mark. This is clearly a game meant to be played with a touchscreen so if you have access to one use it.\n\nThis is basically it, you may complain a bit about the music, but if you dont like it you can just mute it and put anything else to play on your pc.\n\nOverall recomended, highlly if on sale","February 9","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game however was so boring, frustrating, and just down right either easy or unbarably stupid I returned this. One of my many problems with this game is The instructions are just not there in game they don't explain how to play or what you are supposed to do IN GAME, you have to leave the game and go into the instructional manuel to learn how to play and even then does not explain in full what I am supposed to do. Thank you but no thank you If you want to spend 5 bucks on a game on steam go buy Town of Salem it may be full of jerks at times be it is way less boring!","January 20","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is really boring.\n\nI don't care about the girl. I don't care about her parents. I just don't care. I have no interest in saving this girl's parents or vampires or whatever. The intro scene should have me invested in the characters. It fails miserably in that regard.\n\nThis feels like a mobile port, but I don't think it is. I think it simply drew a lot of inspiration from mobile games. The gameplay is fine, it's just... boring. It's unintuitive at best. Moving objects a bit and clicking on windows to dim them for a bit. Once you've played a few levels, it feels like you've played them all.\n\nIf you like the style of mobile games and thought: I'd like to see this on Steam for $5 - it's your lucky day.\n\nFor me, this game is not fun. I don't recommend it.","February 17","false","0.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
