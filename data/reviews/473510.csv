The game is very difficult as is expected from a bullet hell game. It’s very basic, it doesn’t try to do something fancy.  There’s a lot of ships to unlock and each one plays differently, so depending on your playstyle you can choose your ship accordingly.\n\nThe graphics are pretty simple and sharp, colors are decent and for a space shooter surprisingly good looking. Usually space shooters look dull but not this one. The one problem I have with the graphics is the 4:3 ratio, seriously add an option for 16:9 ratio. This make the whole screen has black borders on the sides. Another problem is the lack of pause, seriously, why would you not include a pause feature is beyond me.\n\nThe music in this game is very good, most of the soundtracks are really good and pleasant on the ears. The sounds of the ships, guns and kills are also good and will remind you of the 8-bit era shoot em’ ups.\n\nThe game play is very simple. This game is addictive as hell as once I started playing I couldn’t put it down for quite some time. It’s one of those games which are so simple but super addictive, think Flappy bird, you just keep coming back for more and more. The game starts off reasonable but as you keep playing the difficulty keeps increasing, it even says so in-game “Difficulty up”. So as you keep playing more and more enemies will spawn and more bullets will start flying everywhere. The game will score you but there are no leaderboards, this sort of game requires that in my opinion.\n\nYou start off with one basic ship. There are 6 categories of ships. Light, medium, heavy, shotgun, sniper and chaingun. The ships speed/weapon power/gun type depends on which type of ship you choose, for example playing with a Sniper ship will have 1 very powerful shot then after a second or so you can shoot again. The Heavy Ship will have heavy rate of fire but a bit slow to move around.\n\nYou unlock more ships as you progress through the game. Since every ship that’s purchasable through the hanger requires scrap. These scraps can be collected by playing the game and kill enemy ships. Furthermore, there are 4 tiers of ships you can buy. Common, uncommon, rare and legendary. The common ships are the ones you start off with and to buy the other 3 tiers’ ships you will need to level up. For uncommon you need to level up to level 10, for rare, level 25 and for legendary, level 50.  This is a lot of grinding and in my opinion I lost interest in the Rare and legendary items. There’s a total of 24 ships which includes 1 of each type of ship in 1 of each tier.\n\nThere’s a large variety of enemies too, there’s an eyeball shooting huge bullets at you, astroids, invisible ships which can be only shot down when the re-appear briefly, non-shooting dashing ships, ships with random bullet spread shooting etc.  The enemies drop these stars which you can pick up to increase your score. Even if you go near them your ship should pick them up like a magnet.  If you don’t pick them up they will disappear. So, there Is a neat little risk/reward thing going on with this system. Some gameplay can be found below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687339635\n\nAll in all, a very decent game and will give you plenty of entertainment. If you don’t mind grinding a lot you can also unlock new, much powerful ships. There's a lot that can be improves but the game is currently 49% off and at this price it’s a bargain.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a Steam key for review purposes and it does not change my opinion on it.","May 19","true","3.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

It seems that the game has a fair amount of content that is inside the game, however there are some issues with the game that doesn't really make it fun to play.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay itself focuses on only a single game mode, which is fine since this game is suppose to follow the kind of arcade style. Upon entering the game there is only one objective for you to accomplish, which is to basically shoot everything and get the highest possible score. That's it, now I feel like some people would argue that this isn't enough for a game but I feel like it is only fitting for the game to have one gamemode since it is following the arcade styled shoot em up.\n\nI feel like this game had a lot going for it, I actually thought that the game was in Early Access when I first got to the main screen. Why? Well for a arcade shoot em up game like this your main focus would be to have a leaderboard to compete against your friends and others against the world. This game doesn't have this feature unfortunately, and therefore I feel like the game is lacking in that sense. I don't really feel the need to play more than I should because I only have my own high score to beat, in some games beating your own highscore is enough to make you play more of the game than you initially intended. But this game just feels like it really, really needs a leaderboard. I feel like without this essential leaderboard that the game itself hasn't got much replay value at all.\n\nOne of the main feature a game should have is the ability to have a pause menu. Well this game doesn't have that. Why I really don't know, but it just missing from the game. So if you are in the middle of a run doing really well but you need to take a break well your out of luck. Seriously please add a pause button for this game.\n\nSomething that they added to the game was the ability to level up and the large amount of ships that you can be. The ships have different types of shooting, so some of them have just a spray of bullets, while others are more accurate like the sniper class that has high attack but low reload speed. So the game is really nice in the way that there is a lot of different types of ships. This seems good, until you actually realise what you have to do in order to unlock all of these ships...\n\nNow how does leveling up have to do with unlocking ships? Well the way that you obtain ships is by gather enough scrap, which you obtain by destroying enemies, and going to the Hanger and buying a ship. There are 4 different types that you can buy. Common, Uncommon, Rare and Legendary. You will only be able to buy from the Common pack to start with, in order to unlock the others well you will have to level up. Uncommon lv. 10, Rare lv. 25 and Legendary lv. 50. Now seeing as I have been playing this game for about 2.4 hours I am only just turning level 10. I'm not in the slightest bit motivated to unlock the other ship packs. I feel like this just drags the game on and forces you to play loads to unlock everything.\n\nThe graphics of this game are somewhat standard, the background when you play is just a still image. I personally would've really expected maybe twinkling of some of the stars so that it adds a bit of life to the game all together, The sprites of the ships are good, seem a bit plain at times but mostly all good.\n\nThe music of this game is a bit weird, sometimes the music would really suit the game that suits this type of gameplay sort of fast paced. While other times I feel like the music is just weird and really doesn't suit the gameplay at all. This is mostly for the music in-game. While on the other hand the music on the menu screen is a really nice opening to the game itself.\n\nPros+ Nice retro styled shoot em up\n+ Only one gamemode (a pro in my opinion following the traditional retro feel to the game)\n+ Lots of different types of ships\n+ Sprites of the ships are nice\n\nCons- Needs a leaderboard\n- Unlocking ships requires you to be a certain level\n- Low replay ability\n- No pause button...\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsThe final verdict of this game, it seemed before I played this game that it was going to be a very fun and addictive arcade shoot em up. I guess my expectations were too high, the game is fun if you play it for short intervals but it gets fairly repetitive over a long period of time. The game does, however, have a nice variety of ships and a nice retro feel to the game. Overall, I would recommened this game if you are a fan of arcade shoot em up.\n\nRating: 5.1/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow DeductionsReviewClub curator group here.","May 16","true","4.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deviationtv/recommended/473510/","deviationtv","Chocolate Sponge Cake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deviationtv/","802 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThis review is created for  Deduction's Review Club .   I received this game for free, however, my review is unbiased\n\nThere is also a video counterpart to this review, which I highly recommend you check out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJpIGtmp_Oc\nGal-X-E was released on the 14th of May, 2016, and was developed and published by NodziGames. It's genres are Sci-Fi, Shoot-em-Up, Indie, and action.\n\nGal-X-E is a Sci-Fi shoot em up, and resembles what you might have seen in an arcade back when those were the cultural norm.\n\nEnemy space ships, asteroids, flying garbage and... well, an eyeball that shoots missiles at you willrandomly spawn and attempt to kill you. Some are indirect and shoot in random directions, while others will target you and attempt to shoot you down.\n\nFrom what I could tell, there is no storyline to Gal-X-E, your sole goal is to survive for as\nlong as you can. I myself am not good at Gal-X-E, however, I could not find any boss fights, which would have been very beneficial to the overall enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe graphics for Gal-X-E are very cartoony, but games in this genre all seem to have very basic graphics, not that cartoonish graphics are a problem. The controls feel very smooth and don't stick, leading to a very nice experience during gameplay.\n\nAs you play Gal-X-E, you will collect scrap which you could use to unlock better ships, in a fashion similar to unboxing in CS:GO or TF2. You use your scrap and unbox new ships, however, you can still unbox a ship you already own, effectively wasting your hard earned scrap, just like in CS:GO or TF2, only the ship is a crappy item and the scrap is your real money. Anyway, off topic.\n\nSome suggestions I'd make to the game, although they aren't downsides, are if I were the developer I'd include a pause screen, perhaps an online leaderboard (since the only game mode is survival), and steam achievements for completionists.\n\nThere is one obvious downside to the game which the other reviews on steam don't the audio. The sound effects are decent and very fitting with the sci-fi genre, however, the soundtrack is, unfortunately, unoriginal. Like Girlfriend Rescue, another game I reviewed, the music used is\ncreative commons. However, in Girlfriend Rescue, there was orchestral music that was\nill fitting, but in Gal-X-E, the music is very fitting with the theme and is actually\nmusic that I like. Where does the music come from? NoCopyrightSounds, my favourite\nrecord label. One song I could easily recognize which was used in Gal-X-E is\ncalled Frag Out by DJ Assassin, and if you own Gal-X-E, listen to the soundtrack and\ncompare some of the songs to those on NoCopyrightSounds.\n\nRating:\nGraphics: 6/10\nAudio: 4/10\nGameplay: 6.2/10\nOverall: 5.4/10\n\nEnjoy the review?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonstomper/recommended/473510/","moonstomper","Puddy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moonstomper/","86 products in account","Hello, I would like to start off this review with an apology to Gal-X-E's developer(s). When I wrote the original review, I was biased towards the fact that this was an indie game. Many of the original issues I listed have been addressed, which shows that NodziGames really cares about his players.\n\nGal-X-E is a space shooter that looks to bring back some arcade nostalgia. Does it do it well? Yeah! The game frequently reminds me of other space shooters from the 80s.\n\nPROS:\n-Controls are smooth and work well.\n-Nice graphics.\n-Gameplay is fun.\n-Works with Windows 10 and doesn't have any kind of lag.\n-Nice backgrounds.\n-The music grows on you.\n\nCONS\n-Akward full screen, but it still works.\n-Lots of grinding when it comes down to it, but you can have fun while you grind.\n\nFINAL SCORE\n7/10 (Pick this game up if it's on sale!)\n\nI appreciate all the trouble NodziGames went to to make a fun game like this!","May 14","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"
