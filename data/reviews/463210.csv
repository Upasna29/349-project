The graphics are simple, two-dimensional, but they have something… they look attractive, creative and very charming. The atmosphere is about basically going through 40 different maps, where you must reach the bank and kill the bosses. Throughout the maps you will find everything that a normal city has, alike: buildings, streets, cars, nature objects, etc. The audio is pretty much basically the pain sounds of the enemies, as well as yourself, the car sounds, and mostly the weapon shots. The music is pretty nice, the game contains a long soundtrack, which is being played through the maps, and at the begging of every mission there is playing a victory soundtrack. The gameplay is literally shooting as many enemies as you want, driving cars, and basically doing destruction. The engines and the mechanics are alright, the enemies move well, they tend to come from many sides to you, but what I dislike is that the cars get stuck from time to time, even in passable places. Overall, it’s a pretty nice action-indie, as well as a level-based game.\n\nStrong Points\nSimple but well-designed 2D graphics\nPretty nice soundtrack and SFX\nRelatively challenging gameplay\nHigh amount of enemies and cars\nWeapons will constantly change\nPretty nice level-based gameplay\nMany bosses and talent point\n40 open-world levels to explore (20 normal ones, 20 hardcore ones)\nThe ability to load levels in normal mode\nWeak Points\nA bit too repetitive sometimes\nNot enough enemy types\nYour car gets stuck from time to time, even in passable places\nGeneral Ratings\nGraphics: 8/10\nAtmosphere: 8/10\nAudio/Music: 8.5/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nStory: N/A\nEngines/Mechanics: 8/10\n\nPersonal Rating: 7.8/10","May 7","true","3.0"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","20","26","2","0"

A solid 7.5/10.\n\nThe simplicity of the shooting mechanics with the ever increasing level of difficulty gives you a challenge where you never quite feel in control. Just when you think you have an advantage via a new, more powerful weapon, or strategically distributing your "Talent Points", the game throws swarm after swarm of gun-toting baddies. With the occasional missile launching hummer. And thats just on normal difficulty.\n\nI am willing to over-look the repetitive nature of this game and wonky driving mechanics because every other aspect of this game is near perfect for me. The visuals are entertaining, the audio is very fitting and whimsical, and game play is blissfully utter chaos. I highly recommend this game if you are remotely considering it.","June 1","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very fast-paced gameplay behaving like a top down bullet hell shooter. Your goal is simple. Make your way between banks in a city and fight a boss inside each one. Each boss uses a different weapon, and after each bank you clear, the number of enemies on the streets and their difficulty increases. There are several weapons you get to use, drive cars, and even level up and improve some of your stats.\n\nThe art style is simplistic, but very charming. It looks like scribbled drawings of a small kid, which is a nice and unique style I've not seen before. To complement that, one of my favourite things about the game is how all the sound effects in it seem to be done with voices. The music is pretty nice and light-hearted too.\n\nThe game can get a tad repetitive, so it's mostly fun in short bursts, but considering the mechanics and the aesthetics are executed nicely and the game is very cheap, I can definitely recommend it.","April 30","true","1.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Well you can already see the graphic, so you can decide for yourself if you like it or not.\n\n2. For the sounds it's all made with the mouth which could get annoying really soon. If you mute the game and tap out for a moment (since there is no window-mode our other options) and then tap in again, the sound will be back on. The you first have turn the sound back on and mute it again and hope you weren't shot in the meantime.\n\n3. Now I read that the game was called “Crisis” once. But now it's called “state of anarchy”. So it should have the same name everywhere and not be called “crisis” in the taskbar and the sound options and suddenly “state of anarchy” again in the task manager.\n\n4. It get's repetitive really soon, since it's always. Run to a bank, kill the boss (who sometimes gets easier than the last) and run to the next bank. With only a few different enemy types.\n\n5. At the start of the game you can either run or select a game mode. There it's a little confusing when you reed that you can start at level 8 and when you select it, you can only choose between the first 5 levels. Although that's apparently your character level. So I guess I just didn't understand that at first. But if you start at level 1 again you keep your character level. And while you loose your weapon, you keep your abilities. So a real new start isn't possible.\n\n6. The last point is not about the game but: Did the developer seriously evaluate his own game?","April 29","false","2.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","4"

The difference between this two a game saving, in a hardcore mode you will not find a save, so if you die in this mode, you should start all from first level. In a normal mode if you die, you should start only from the current level. Gameplay is that: you should following a arrow to the target zone and on you way killing a enemies and picking up money or health pack what they dropped. You pass a current level when you kill a "boss" and pick up a some upgrade what he drop, for example more damage for weapon. Also when you move beside objects you can use a car for this.\n\nThe graphic looks very simple, this is hand drawn styled and looks like a little boys draw. Sound are simple, but enough good.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+various weapons and enemies\n+some humor\n+well fitting drawn graphic\n+steam cards\n+cheap\n+character developing\n\n-not for everyone\n-after longer time can be monotone\n-no steam achievements\n\nWell this game dont want be more than what is it.

Even at it's low price, the game still feels like it costs too much for what you are getting in return. As mentioned above, this game has very binary and tedious gameplay. It doesn't feel like you do anything or progress for the most part. All this game is, is just about slowly running towards your next building made of something, and then killing the same guy over and over again, just with a slightly different weapon each time. While also shooting the same enemies attacking you on your way. There is also nothing special about the artstyle or any visual aspects of this game. It feels very simple and binary to me. Even though i have not mentioned all of the things in this game, i feeel i have covered the most important ones. And as a final point, i would like to say that even if you don't mind the price, i feel the game is not worth your time with so many other much, much better games out there for you to try.

I use relaxing in a different sense, relaxing as in, easy to get a hold of and there is a sense of accomplishment killing wave after wave of faceless grey citizens.\n\n\nYou go from bank to bank and each successive bank has a boss, and if you defeat the boss you get a new weapon.\n\n\nThe music and 'sounds' and sound effects are rather goofy and fit into the game perfectly.\n\nYou get to drive around a car and crush people beneath the tires, oh and you can fire your weapon too, whilst driving.\n\nYou get talent points, using which you can gain certain abilities and improve on them - character development.\n\nWhat more can one ask for? I don't have to think twice before recommending this game, if you're looking for something fun, simplistic and funny.\n\n\nRating this game on a scale would be rather difficult as to what criteria would one use and in what sense would each point imply on a definite scale? Still, I will give it a shot\n\n\nA strong 8 out of 10.","April 27","true","0.4"," 12 of 37 people (32%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","32","12","37","10","0"

I may have little playtime to back my opinion but believe me, its worth more than most games out there, so if you want to try it out for yourself, go ahead. Its short (unless you consider 40 levels long) but a pretty good game.\n","April 27","true","1.0"," 8 of 32 people (25%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","25","8","32","6","0"
