"http://steamcommunity.com/id/malwick999/recommended/351910/","malwick999","Huhxyz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/malwick999/","90 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAlright, only about 2 hours in on this so take this with a grain of salt.\n\n[Positives]\nI like it. Why I don't say love is because I am still only at the beginning but can definitely say it's making a great start.\n\nTo start the Ai in this game is a lot better then most I see of similar genre. While in other games you must single out each individual unit to give them a task and actually get them working in this game the vikings just get up and do it. Want a new tent built? Great all the units that were standing by the fire get up grab some timber from the woodcutter and get on it. Another great thing about the Ai is that there are specific jobs and they immediately fill those jobs and get to work as soon as the building is up. Now does that make the game easier? No, it just means there is a lot less time consumption on simple tasks. You still have a capacity of vikings to feed, arm, and shelter.\n\nCombat. Alright let's get down to what's trying to kill you. Now in most games like this you'll have enemies that roam around the map and well try to kill you a disrupt your work. As far as I have gotten this isn't the major issue. In this game you have a basically end "battle" to each level. You choose when to engage in this battle but you never know what's gonna pop out and take a swing at you. Now don't think it's just the portal, there are still some enemies that I have seen lingering around the map. So it's still safe to say you won't be putting off making some battle ready vikings till the very end of your work. Also a big plus is they took into consideration that maybe your assault fails and the portal is now open. Well, you can construct and altar burn up some resources and you'll calm the attack down. So the final battle doesn't HAVE to be an all or nothing deal. Then again I didn't use it I fight to win! I also believe you can simply use the altar to make peace and have a non-aggressive victory as well.\n\nResources. Through the game you'll find you'll need to find food and materials. This can be handled by building a Wood Cutters Shack, a Quarry, a Fishery, and a Hunter's Lodge. Now while you can replant trees it is a slow process but you won't run out of wood, the quarry I haven't had any issues with running out of stone, the Fishery will catch fish to feed your people but it isn't the fastest process, and the hunter's lodge while faster then the Fishery it does warn that if you kill too many of the animal they will not be able to repopulate. SO, mind those resources!\n\nConstruction. As I said before the game does an amazing job with the Ai and contruction and even getting the people working in on it. Now for the buildings however there is quite a bit of challenge given you are set on more difficult terrain. There are some locations you just can't build on and others that are optimal for building on. This makes choosing your building locations much more difficult especially considering how resources need to flow through your area. Also a big plus by my standards: PATHS don't cost anything. Seriosly I can't stress how annoying it is for paths to cost X amount of resources when it's just a dirt path.\n\nAs for the art and style of the game. They hit the nail on the head. It fits perfectly and the scenery is simple and enjoyable. A nice cartoon-ish setting fits the casual play of the game and doesn't overwhelm you. Also a fun bit in the background that you'll love is each time you open a portal a volcano on another island explodes. I mean who doesn't love exploding volcanoes... that you're not directly beside.\n\n[Negatives]\nAlright no game is perfect but, some mistakes can be forgiven.\n\nNow you have to manage feeding your vikings and taking care of their needs. The problem I found was I have no way of knowing what they are complaining about until I see some in game identifiers. Like when you don't have enough homes for them. You'll start seeing them sleeping under trees. Also when there isn't enough food you'll just see a speech bubble pop up over their heads with a hunch of meat in it. Now while this isn't a major issue and does actually make you pay attention to your npcs I can see it being a problem when the towns become much larger and making sure everyone is taken care of becomes a much bigger task.\n\nAnother issue I had was the camera angle. While I did manage it and got by quite easily with the problem I had it would still be nice if I had more freedom with the camera to better position paths and building construction.\n\nAlso, been told this was a bug, but a some of my vikings were tring to make bows which requires sticks. They kept breaking the sticks for something along the lines of 5 in game days. I honeslty thought they were just failing a crafting recipe.\n\nThis may be a personal problem but later in the game you will run into a neutral mob called a boar. Now these things are big and at first glance quite intimidating. This deterred me from building near them and I even made some early game fighter vikings to try and fight them. Turns out that boars are just the second thing a hunter will hunt for after all the bunnies are gone. Blame that one on just being new.\n\n[Personal Notes]\n\nI will be continue to play this game. The maps are beautiful, the game is casual, and most importantly fun. You don't need the major strategy of an elite pro gamer to make it through levels but you still have to think it out and make plans. That's the right kind of difficulty for a game you can sit down to after a day of work and enjoy. Worth a good looking into and if you need a fun casual thinking game I highly recommend this.","August 24, 2015","true","33.8"," 137 of 170 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","137","170","0","0"

I like the theme with the vikings being banished and trying to prove them selves by building and going to Valhalla.\n\nYou construct and and survive going from one island to another through the use of portals, but to use the portals you'd have to either fight the guardians or appease them by giving them an offering.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqZrmWyvgdg\n\nIt's easy to pick up and understand what it requires you to do. The UI and controls are easy and intuative, and the overall quality is nice. Plus it looks beautiful once you have a lot of constructions build, especially at night.\n\nThe one complaint I have so far is that I can move my camera more upwards, so no being able to look from a more of a top-down view is really bugging me. There's also a good amount of optimization that needs to be done which I presume will happen over the course of the early access stage.\n\nOverall it's a nice game with nice progression that I'm happy I bought. Just needs a few tweaks to make it more enjoyable, like that damn camera control.","August 24, 2015","true","3.5"," 94 of 124 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","94","124","7","2"

It would have to be the older Settlers games. Except instead of controling romans. You control Vikings, Already, thats a much cooler type of people to play with . Do keep in mind that it is still beta. So some glitches, and other unfinished things are needed. But besides that, the game is uber fun. each viking requires sleep and food, and thats the only needs they desire. and technicly they can provide both of those by themselves by sleeping under a tree, or picking berries from a bush.\n\nThe story goes that Odin is angry at the Vikings for some reason, so when vikings die, they don't "really" die, they go in some sort of purgatory viking world, where if you die, you just get swooshed to a island, and you must fight for your honor. How does a viking get into valhalla? Easy, so building and killing grants honor points, and each viking how there own seperate bar of honor. when they reach 10000 honor points, they ascend into valhalla.  Heres the pretty good part, when a single viking performs a task that would grant honor points, all other active vikings also get the honor points. So its really a group effort situation.\n\nIn resume. beautiful graphics,  AI i would say is 80% smart, you get to build beautiful viking villages, and the game technicly has unlimited gameplay, since every time you beat a map, a randomly generated map will be created for your next level, and they do indeed get harder and harder.\n\nso far so good\n\n8/10\n\neNjoy ^-^","October 5, 2015","true","128.9"," 65 of 85 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","65","85","6","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/351910/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Valhalla Hills will remind many older gamers of titles like The Settlers and Culture, which is the normal given that the development team that creates the new Viking driven experience had a hand in the creation of both those already classic titles.The entire game is built around optimization, with gamers asked to carefully control the movement of their characters and the location of their buildings to create communities that can thrive and exploit the environment around them. Valhalla Hills manages to walk a fine line between excessive complexity, which is always a temptation for the city-building genre, and a lack of variety and is suited both for long-term fans of the main mechanics and for those who discover them for the first time.\n\nThe narrative here is a pretty simple one, albeit quite funny and suitable for the temperamental gods of Norse mythology that inspired it: Odin’s in a pissy mood after his son Leko fails an “exam of the gods,” so he slams the door to Valhalla shut. Unable to rest their weary bones inside, the honorable Vikings are forced to turn to Leko — demoted to the unflattering position of “God of the Builders” — who will attempt to redeem himself by leading the heroes up the eponymous mountains. You can do this one of two ways: by opening the magic portals of Valhalla to fight the enemies within, or by appeasing the gods with tributes. And by building: doing tons and tons of building.\n\nFrom the bright, cartoon landscapes to the roly poly design of the little villagers, Valhalla Hills doesn’t take itself too seriously, which is not to say the game is simplistic, shallow, or easy. In fact, there are a number of interconnected systems to monitor and master. Each level begins with a procedurally generated landmass and the player’s task is to build a thriving community that will eventually — either economically or militarily — unlock the magical portal and the bridge to Valhalla.\n\nLike The Settlers, the player does not directly control the little Viking villagers, instead controlling where buildings are sited, the types of buildings, and the optimal paths between resources and structures. The population is autonomous and while the player may lay down a series of building sites, the workers will determine the build order. A good strategy is one that does not give the easily distracted villagers too many options.\n\nWhile each level invariably requires an early build sequence that includes finding a source of raw materials and food, then crafting a workshop and tools, once the basics are established the choice becomes how to deal with the monsters or hostile warriors that spawn through or guard the portal to Valhalla. The military option requires building barracks and forging and upgrading weapons, which of course require advanced workshops and rarer materials. Less bellicose players may choose to build a series of temples to control and placate the enemy, but that path also requires an escalating series of constructions and upgrades. Both strategies are viable options and on the middle and later maps, both require a vibrant, well-managed economy.\n\nValhalla Hills has two basic modes: a “campaign” mode in which structures, upgrades, and game systems are introduced slowly, over a number of progressively larger maps; and an “open” mode in which all options are available from the start — as well as all monsters and other enemies. There isn’t much of a story beyond the opening cinematic that explains the premise, and while tooltips pop up every time a new structure or mechanic is introduced, neither is there a tutorial proper. Experienced players of The Settlers or other city builders can probably intuit a lot what they need to know, but it will take all players some trial and error and less than optimal results before the systems become clear.\n\nOnce you do get into the flow of this game however, you will truly be able to appreciate what it has going for it. The graphical quality, while simple, is smooth and refined, striking an unexpected balance between old-school sensibilities and modern-day sharpness. The maps are fully articulated, allowing you to move and zoom freely about their entirely and providing a hexagonal grid only when it’s appropriate, allowing a more consistent sense of immersion.\n\nThe music of Valhalla Hills is… alright. It’s soothing, adequately produced and thematically appropriate, but not memorable. Considering this title is mostly about magicing buildings into existence, large orchestral scores would’ve been strange, granted, but something a little more unique and stylish would have been nice during those times when I was hurrying up to wait.\n\nOn the point of action, there isn’t a great deal of it. Most of the fighting you will encounter is when your brave followers decide to press onward to through the next portal toward Odin’s side. At these times, and depending on how you play it, guardians may appear to challenge your vikings to prove their worth. These battles are mostly a test of your preparedness and foersight, not of your tactics or formation of units. Niko is a builder, not a fighter, and it’s at these moments that it shows the most.\n\nThis is honestly a very well built game and a pleasure to play. It’s not really all that complex or burdened with layers of technicalities of its own design. It feels inviting and wants you to have a good time poking around with your options in search discovering new features to add to your fun. But the lack of a strong tutorial system slides it to a farther end of the learning than I think the developers intended. You sort of need to have a strong grasp of RTS games like this one in order to feel confident any time soon, and that’s not the kind of thing a newcomer may want to put themselves through.\n\nOther should-be-important details, such as how to accrue Honor, a type of passive meta-stat required by Odin for your vikings to be accepted into his kingdom, goes largely unexplained even after it becomes necessary. I cleared the first few maps being told how impressive my Honor score was with no idea what that meant, how to check it, or how I could do it again.\n\nValhalla Hills is all in all, a strong little RTS, with enough going on under the surface to satisfy most fans of the genre. Its style is fitting enough and the game endears itself to you and keeps you immersed. Valhalla Hills is a solid game that anyone who has ever played The Settlers will enjoy.","May 1","true","19.7"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","40","45","0","0"

The lifetime of each map is something around 20 minutes (It's longer the longer you play, because there are more challenges on your way to the portal). The flow of the game is something like this: You start a game => it generates random map (with random size defined by unlocks) => you build your village => prepare army/satisfy gods => enter a portal => you unlocked new things => start over (or you can alternatively continue to build your village, but trust me, you most probably don't want that).

However, that task is easier said than done.\nMany obstacles like underworld guards will come to block your path, in which you can approach by two different ways: either battle it out with them or by appeasing them with your sacrifices (in which these are the common goals that is required for you to clear a stage).\n\nThe most important part before anything else is that you must teach and guide your people on how to survive and live through the lands and accumulate honor to prove your worth to Odin in order to ascend back to Valhalla.\n\nThe Pros\nFun and Satisfying Gameplay - Though the game requires time to play through, the end result of your actions is quite satisfying as you see your little town of vikings run smoothly, which is further complimented by the beautiful graphics of the game.\n\nCharming Art Design - A perfect cartoonic design that presents a charming appeal regardless of audience age is showcased throughout the game. It is also quite a view to see when the game transitions from day to night.\n\nGood Audio - The game presents an atmospheric audio that suits the theme of a city-building simulation that is played and executed in a serene and melodic fashion. The kind of soundtrack that is pleasant to the ears even if you are hearing it for long periods of time.\nThe Cons\nInsufficient Story Depth - Aside from the introductory setting, there isn't really anything that follows up to make it more immersive story-wise, and having only two goals of either battling the guards or appease them through sacrifices to clear a stage doesn't really help in that sense.\n\nWeak Tutorial - For someone that is essentially a beginner with city-building simulation games, it took me quite a bit of time to figure out how to play out the game efficiently, which is the result of me skipping out on the tutorial itself (though it is present at any stage of the game) since the large amount of text didn't seem too interesting and I assumed that you can figure the game without holding on the ropes. However, for those seasoned people out there, this may not be a problem for you.\nThe Verdict\nFor those who like city building simulation games and would like to try out a more fantasy take on that kind of genre, this game is perfect for you!\n\nFurthermore, the game developers are quite active in terms of updates which could lead on this game being better and more accessible for other gamers.\n\nIf you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.","April 15","true","12.9"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

The graphics are good, it doesn't crash, it seems well made in most respects. But it has some serious balance issues which make it very frustrating, and in a way you can't solve with your own skill.\n\nIf food gets low, your society will fall into a spiral where the people making food are too hungry to work but won't eat the little food that comes up. Civilian vikings will walk halfway across the map to sleep under a tree (instead of the closer trees), then aggro a bear and decide to stand there and punch it until they die. You're constantly fighting the terrain, trying to build a mine that can reach ore (and after it takes 20 minutes to build you realize its range is only 2 octagons and it nope, no ore).

A good mix of fantasy and building makes you interested throughout the game. You start out as a few Vikings on an island and must give them the resources they need to survive the wilderness and deadly foes. Build huts to allow them to get rest, build  woodcutters to supply wood, quarry's for stone, fishery and hunter for food, military for recruiting to fight off the enemies that come from the portal. Once you defeat them you gain more things to build.\n\nPros & Cons\n++  Pros\n+ Great graphics\n+ Charming atmosphere\n+ Enjoyable and rewarding experience\n+ Plenty of options to play the way you want or to speed up process.\n\n-- Cons\n- Not enough tutorials\n- Ai are almost always just running around or doing nothing\n- Repedative play\n\nSummary  	This is a great game, and is very much like a mobile game. Almost relatable to Sims or clash of clans. None the less the works great for PC and runs well and responds to everything and optomizable options and graphics to maximize performance of your game-play.\nReplay-ability is strong, with you every growing and evolving population of Vikings. You learn to build different building and give more of your people to have places to work to get an efficient flow of any resource you need to keep them living and to fight.\n\nPersonal Opinion 	This was a toughy at first because I had no idea what I was doing and the tutorials did not guide me enough to fully grasp the way the game was meant to be played. After a little while of playing, I slowly learned what I was supposed to do and was quickly up on my feet and had all my Vikings up an working. The graphics are very charming and makes for a smooth game-play and less stress on the eyes for those of you that binge play.\nThe fact that you can speed up build process and harvesting was wonderful, and the pause button allows you to get up out of your seat without having to worry about random attacks on your unarmed Vikings, and take a look around your village to check and see if everything is going as you expected.\n\nFinal recommendation: 	I was *iffy* at first but the true game-play kept me playing long enough to understand what I needed to do. I soon fell in love with the ease of play but great excitement of the battles. I Recommend this extremely charming fantasy strategy game and I will be playing this very often!

So far, I've really enjoyed Valhalla Hills - it has that charm, and more. It is still early-access so I'm not sure if/how my few cons will be addressed, but here they are:\n\n- the game starts to get a bit choppy once your island gets more populated and you have a few buildings going, but then again I'm playing on a laptop, so this may not be a huge deal\n- seems to be no way to control what goes into a stockpile, which isn't a huge drawback. Each stockpile can hold multiple stacks (of up to 5-10 items, so far), but they only have a number of stacks they can hold. The basic stockpile will gladly hold 6 stacks of 5 logs, which is inconvenient if you wanted to have it store food or something\n\nSo far, those are my only two issues with the game!\n\nPros:\n- the pacing is good. The quests slowly introduce you to each building, but it never feels like a chore, more of a guided sandbox play, which I enjoy.\n- the military aspect isn't difficult so far. There's a few dudes to beat when you want to unlock the gate to finish each level (if you choose to go military route - can bypass by sacrificing goods at the altar). Some missions have baddies roaming around, but they're fairly easy to deal with and so far they do not respawn.\n- the animation is good, and I enjoy watching my little dudes march around, like the old settlers games.\n- there is an interesting variety of buildings so far, and I am still unlocking more, which gives good incentive to keep playing\n- the graphics are really nice, even on lower settings!\n\nOverall if you like a chill-out-and-build kind of game, this is it. Lots of fun and I am looking forward to playing more.","October 28, 2015","true","9.3"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","0"

In fact Valhalla Hills has been developed by Funatics Software - the same company that made these games, so it's to be expected. They've taken a well-loved pair of franchises and changed things up a little, in parts for the better - in parts for worse.\n\nNormally games of this genre involve building up an army and destroying the opposition, In Valhalla Hills there is no specific enemy you must defeat to win the level, there is however a wide variety of enemies that are standing in the way between your settlement and your objective. To win the level in Valhalla Hills you need to enter the portal that lies at the top of the mountain and it's usually guarded pretty heavily - there’s also the option to win economically with a sacrifice (basically a bribe to the guards).\n\nThe aim of the game is to get your Vikings enough honour to enter Valhalla, which in a way makes some aspects of the game feel like a grind. Once a level is complete it's on to the next level to grind more honour! But I’m getting ahead of myself, let’s examine some game mechanics.\n\nProduction chains are pretty good actually, I'm happy with them. For the production chain of generating resources for buildings, we start with the basics - logs and quarry stone. These are good starting point for building your settlement and will be sufficient for a while. As you progress you'll need to refine these materials with another set of buildings, turning logs into planks and quarry stone into stone bricks. This is as far as the construction materials production chain goes, every structure in the game can be built with either; logs, quarry stone, planks or stone bricks. Like i said I’m happy with that, it's one step beyond what Settlers 3&4 offer but not a rabbit hole of complexity like in Cultures - a nice healthy middle ground. However this is the simplest production chain there is, it just gets more complex after that... mostly in a good way. There's a few irregularities I’ve noticed in the current build (v1.02.01) such as the kitchen, which takes the separate food items your Vikings have produced and combines them into a single unit of food (bread and meat become sandwiches) - this makes life easier for your hungry Vikings, but the nutritional value of the sandwiches is less than the sum of its parts - its wastefulness is a bit irritating!\n\nThe games AI seems to be a bit silly sometimes, they will stray too far and get attacked, after a bit of fighting back and losing health, they run off, then it seems like the AI resets and they head back to their exact previous location! The cycle of fighting, running and returning usually continues until they die. This issue is exacerbated by the inability to directly control your Vikings, they're off on their own and can't be commanded, Perhaps this is a feature, forcing you to quickly produce some troops and clear the local area - it's an RTS after all.\n\nSpeaking of the inability to control your Vikings, I get the feeling that Valhalla Hills is trapped in an identity crisis between the highly personal attachment to the Vikings that Cultures offers and the sense of distance from your people that Settlers has, where people are pretty much numbers and nothing more. It's a strange aspect to the game - You can follow your Vikings and rename them, but you can't directly control them and for the most part you have little influence on their daily activities.\n\nFinally, if we think back to fighting up to the portal and the other main objective of the game - grinding enough honour to be worthy of Valhalla. I get a sense of "what’s the point?" there's currently no campaigns (once again, reviewing build v1.02.01) and no multiplayer. The only justification you have for your actions is the 2 minute long intro animation that plays when you load the game. There's also a feeling of "Where’s the sense of accomplishment?" once you make it to the portal, A little bit of music plays and **VICTORY!** appears on the screen, accompanied below by a [Next level] button, then it’s on to the next level to do it all again. There's currently a real lack of a feeling of accomplishment, it would be nice to see a statistics page like Setters 3 and 4 have. Show me the number battles I’ve won, show me the number of buildings I’ve built, rain some Godly Nordic lightening fireworks from the sky, something - anything!\n\nI'm really on the fence as to recommend this game or not, it's definitely got a lot of potential. A thumbs up as of right now? Perhaps not. Please bare in mind that I’m biased because I love this kind of game, I’m a big fan of Cultures and I've been playing Settlers 3/4 on a weekly basis on my YouTube channel for over a year now. If you love the RTS genre, or you're a big fan of the Cultures and Settlers franchises and you're looking for a modern revamp then YES, give this game a try, I think you'll really enjoy it. If you're unsure, or you’re new to these kinds of games, then NO - perhaps save your money and either wait for a sale or first try one of the other similar titles available, I'd recommend you take a look at Cultures 2, Settlers 2 (10th anniversary addition), Settlers 3 and Settlers 4.\n\nHope you found this review helpful!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/351910/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","TLDR:A pretty solid and gorgeous town management game inspired by norse mythology that, unfortunately, in terms of story leaves something to be desired.\n\nValhalla Hills is a real time town management game in which you play as Leko, son of Odin, who instead of being a distinguished and devoted warrior as his ancestors, prefers to spend his time building houses. Because of this Odin banishes you to live among the mortals on Earth until you regain your honour.\n\nThe game offers you two different modes to play, Classic and Open. Open mode offers a more challenging experience in which you have every building unlocked. On the other hand, Classic mode gradually increases in difficulty and unlocks more things as you play, and it is thus recommended to new players.\n\nOn Classic mode, the story starts nice and interesting but it quickly falls short and lacks any depth by only having a nicely put introductory cutscene. I still haven’t beaten the game but, from what I’ve played, there is no connection between each mission in terms of story, which I find to be rather disapointing.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game plays very simple, different colors when placing buildings, and other elements of the UI make the game somewhat intuitive and easy to understand how everything works out. Still, it has been a while since I’ve played one of these management games, and so, I must say that the tutorial and instructions that this game gives you do not really teach you some essential things, other than what some buildings do, and because of that it took me a while to learn how resource and tool distributing systems worked out.\n\nAt its core, it plays like most town management games out there, especially ones like the Settlers series. You start with a small number of vikings, which you have no direct control of,  and a handfull of resources and from there you need to figure out the best way to prosper and expand your little settlement. Usually this means building basic resources buildings such as woodcutters, toolmakers and hunters or fishermen right off the bat and, afterwards, making sure you have a steady supply of resources coming from these places in order to feed the needs of your settlers.\n\nOn each mission the objective is always the same, you have to open a portal to Valhalla. First, you need to get a unit close to the portal in order to activate it and, after that, you need to deal with the guardians that come out of these portals. This can be done in two ways, by simply killing them with your soldiers or by performing sacrifices.\n\nPros:Gorgeous looking visuals\nNice and cheerful soundtrack\nRewarding gameplay\nCons:Barebones story\nSomewhat lacking tutorials\nRepetitive levels and gameplay\nOverall thoughts:\n\nValhalla Hills is overall a very good and pleasing title, it looks, sounds and plays great but sometimes I just wish it had something more going for it. Some of its mechanics are not well explained on the tutorial sections but after thinking for a little bit, you should start to realize how certain systems work. Eventually, you might also come across certain situations in which your vikings are wandering randomly with no idea what to do or take some time to perform a certain task, this can get somewhat infuriating but the fact that you can speed up time helps a lot. And last but by no means least, I really wish each mission was more varied other than just a bigger island to fight for and expand through and that the story was told by little bits spread across each mission, or establishing a link between them.\n\nVerdict\nIf you’re a huge fan of the genre and you’re looking for another city management game with a wonderful and charming setting I’d say you check this one out. Despite its lack of story depth and somewhat repetitive levels, at its core Valhalla Hills stands strong on its own. Eitherways, I suggest waiting for a sale because I think that the current price is somewhat high for what it initially offers.","April 21","true","8.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/recommended/351910/","drpixel","DrPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/","3726 products in account","Product received for free\n\nYou know, people always make out the Vikings and Norse mythology in general to be a complex web of intricately-woven tales of honor, bravery, and combat. I mean, with some badasses like Odin, Thor, and Loki included in the mythology, it's pretty difficult to not be interested in their crazy tales. But.....what about the mythological figures no one talks about? Like Leko, the supposed son of Odin and the god of building? Does that not ring a bell? Well, I don't blame you, I'm pretty sure he's fictional, and he's coincidentally also the protagonist of this game.\n\nThe BreakdownValhalla Hills begins with a brief cutscene describing the story of the game. Leko, that guy I mentioned earlier, has been banished from Valhalla by his own father, Odin, because he wasn't into fighting people or something. Poor bloke! Anyway, he now sets off to regain his father's favor by being honorable through whatever means possible. And by that, I mean building stuff and fighting stuff using his little Viking minions people.\n\nSee, Valhalla Hills is a randomly-generated strategy game primarily focused on building with a side emphasis on combat. It's up to you, Leko, to open and enter the portal on each map through whatever means you choose. This may mean fighting the portal guardians using your Vikings or offering them various resources. Personally, I primarily like to offer resources because fighting can be pretty challenging. Regardless, just managing a town itself can be quite the struggle. You start with only a few Vikings, but by building a complex web of inter-connected buildings the process of maintaining a bunch of happy and healthy Vikings can be quite the struggle.\n\nThis is mainly because of the nature of the game. Valhalla Hills is not a story-based or progression-based RTS like what  you may be used to. Instead, the only story is given in one short cutscene, and the rest of the game plays out in randomly-generated maps with an arcade sort of feel to them. Each map could take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour to complete, as it just depends on if you want to rush to enter the portal or not. However, depending on how you complete this task can alter how you play. If you want to fight your way to the portal, that can prove to be quite the ordeal because you would need to first build tools, harvest resources, make homes, make even more buildings, find a way to feed all of your Vikings, and finally make some soldiers to fight the portal guardians.\n\nHowever, this is one area where I feel like the game is a little weak. It can be very, very difficult to properly balance soldiers with food production. See, soldiers eat a bunch of food even while just sitting around, which is frustrating because it requires a constant and large supply of food to them. Yet, they can't leave their military camp for some reason, so they need to have food near them. Yet, since you can't order Vikings around or move the soldiers' camp, you need to either only use them defensively or build your town far out near the portal. I know this sounds odd, and to me it really is. It basically makes the option of fighting the portal guardians basically implausible because it'd take ages to be able to build a town large enough to both place soldiers in a path all the way to the portal (which is typically far away from your starting area) and simultaneously feed them all. Sure, after a while you can unlock couriers to transport food near soldiers, but it's still a hassle, and it's frustrating trying to do a military-based run, which takes some of the fun out of that aspect of the game.\n\nHowever, despite that, attempting peaceful runs is still quite fun. It's both challenging and enjoyable to try and balance the needs of non-military Vikings while keeping them busy. When you get a successful, bustling town running finally, it's a joy to just sit and watch all your Vikings go about their daily schedules. In that sense, the game can be really rewarding. Yet, there's even more rewards given to successful playstyles in the form of unlockables. And wow, this game has a ton! Only after a few hours of playing, I've unlocked a bunch of hats, buildings, environment types, and even new enemies. It definitely helps increase the replayability of the game, which is important for arcade-style games like this that caters to people who don't want to play for hours upon hours (though that is certainly an option). Though, if you do decide to keep at it and play for a while, eventually some of your Vikings will reach Valhalla itself. This is because every Viking gains honor as you play, and when they reach 100,000 they'll ascend to Valhalla. I don't think it does much, but it's still a nice addition.\n\nAnd y'know, there's a lot of little intricate details that the game includes that are quite nice just to have. Each building explains what it does and there's a mini-tutorial given at the start for most of them. In addition to that, the depth of the seemingly simple economy is quite impressive. What seems like a simple progression of getting resources --> feeding vikings --> fighting stuff/collecting portal offerings is much more complicated than that. For example, if you only have 1 fisherman but have 50 Vikings, they'll eventually go hungry, causing them to work less and less until they stop working entirely, at which point you may become doomed to failure. Or, if you chop down too many trees but don't have someone who plants new ones, you'll struggle to get more wood which can collapse a large part of the town's economy. Likewise, if you hunt too many animals and don't have an animal breeder to balance the food supply, your townsfolk may starve eventually. Sure, these are all small details, but they add up to make a fun, challenging, and engaging experience.\n\nThe game may be a little complicated gameplay-wise, but it certainly isn't graphically. Everything has a simple, cartoony look to it that I think actually works quite well. The Vikings look cute (and you can give them hats!), the environments look simple but lovely, and the animations and lighting all flow in a nice, cohesive manner. In fact, I think that's the key to this game's graphical beauty: everything just flows nicely. Unreal Engine 4's lighting capabilities probably helps with that too. Yet, despite the game's aesthetic beauty, it still runs quite nicely, at least from my experience. My computer is a little old, but the game still ran very smoothly with no issues whatsoever. Sound-wise, it's what you might expect: some nice, pleasant tunes and standard sound effects for stuff like building placement. Nothing really stood out to me there.\n\nProsFun, challenging, and rewarding arcade-style RTS gameplay focused on city building on a randomly-generated map (though combat is an option)\nLoads of replayability in the form of dozens of unlockable buildings, environment types, enemies, and hats\nBeautiful graphical cohesion - a big, successful town simply looks gorgeous. Thanks Unreal Engine 4! (oh, and it runs nice too)\nSteam achievements, trading cards, and cloud save support\nConsStory is largely non-existent besides a short initial cutscene\nThe gameplay can become somewhat repetitive after long play sessions, so it's best played in short bursts\nMilitary-focused playstyles will suffer from a massive drain on food supplies, so be warned if you're interested in that aspect of the game\nValhalla Hills can be a highly challenging experience, especially for those who are interested in focusing on combat. Yet, it's still certainly very satisfying to play, from witnessing the gradual progression of a tiny settlement to a bustling, sprawling city of Vikings. If you're interested in arcade-style RTS gameplay that's both fun and rewarding with beautiful graphics as well, this game is definitely worth checking out.\n\nFinal Verdict: 8/10","May 28","true","5.3"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

It's what the past 2 Settlers games should've been; simplistic economic management with overwhelming personality. Graphically appealing with an absolutely beautiful art style and an amazing soundtrack as you build up your small Viking village outside the gates of Valhalla. The whole concept of the game is to build up your village so that it can support a small force that is strong enough to defeat the guardians of the Portals. You start with a group of about 5 vikings and you generally end the mission with a significantly larger numebr. You'll unlock new buildings and aesthetics as more achievements are accomplished and missions are completed. As the game drags on, you'll eventually have some pretty large cities. All in all, I really like this game. The devs clearly love their project and have put a lot of work into it and it has clearly paid off.

It still has a few bugs to squash (then again what game doesn't) but Funatics seem activly involved on the forums so that is a very good and welcome sign.\n\nThe game play is simple enough not to put you off, yet complex enough to keep you interested. None of the levels have been overly complicated so far, however I am not that far in and it is getting progressivly more difficult.\n\nThe "Normal" mode trains you how to play the game, progressivly unlocking items as you go along so as not to overwhelm you. There is a sandbox type mode that has everything already unlocked but if you don't have a good grip on the game yet this mode should be avoided to start, unless you like pain, confusion, and rage quiting.\n\nGraphics wise the game does enough to look good (built on UE4) but doesn't have any un-needed fluff or eye-candy, which can be seen as a good or bad thing.\n\nOverall I'm excited to see what this game still has in store and what updates are just around the corner.\n\nIf you like settlers, ANNO, Tropico, Cultures, and games of that nature this is right up your alley.

I played the Original Settlers back on the Amiga and it was my favourite game EVAR. I played all the later Settlers games and loved them all too. So when I saw this, I was over the moon.\n\nHowever, I have not been at all grabbed by this game. There seems to be no point to it at all. No "hurrah, I beat the level". No particular difficulties to overcome or objectives to achieve. The only thing you seem to do is repeatedly fight your way through portals, with the nebulous overall goal of eventually (through building, fighting etc) getting each of your little dudes up to 100,000 honour points so that they can individually get into Valhalla.\n\nI know we've seen "Set up a town, go through a portal" before - but there were always challenges in they way of that. Here there seems to be no challenge, and it all just seems terribly...pointless.\n\nI am wrestling with the decision of whether or not to refund this game, and I have NEVER refunded a game before, that is the measure of how disappointed I am.\n\nFor those that are interested - the graphics are ok, but sadly the music is dull and not in the slightest bit catchy.

It's definately a good Settlers 2 type game with beautiful graphics.  It runs extremely smooth and is worth the money you pay.  There's loads of good points but no one wants to see fluff in reviews so ill just list minor issues\n\nminor annoyances :\n- when attacking you just end up building roads everywhere to help your military get to where they want to go (maybe consider removing terrain walk speed slowness for hunters and military units as it just get's messy and it's a little annoying)\n- Mouse scroll zoom zooms to where the mouse is instead of the center of the screen (I find this annoying, but im just nit picking this one)\n- all maps encourage you to just bum-rush the stage instead of enjoying a nice long building experience.  So what i find is that i destroy the dwarfs and all their open portals early, then "enjoy the game," but while im "enjoying the game" i just think....  "why dont i just go to the next level, what's the point?"\n- The maps are always pretty much finished before you even begin mining Iron Ore, so the iron axes are pretty much useless, unless you're just RP'ing\n- Kitchens are useless.  Maybe you should impliement a lock down on food within the kitchens to prevent hungry workers from taking ingriedients and eating them.  I understand you are meant to build kitchens far away from your main base with couriers going to it to manufaction "10" food for your army, but feeding large armies is never a problem that requires this.  Also the food requires "4+5+6" foods and all you get is a "10" food...  I get this makes ur guys work for longer, but it's just not worth it at all.\n- on huge maps, armies occasionally cannot find their way to new camp locations placed far away from the previous location so they just stand there bugging out until you move the camp back to a closer location\n- as cool as the Ice giants look, they are far too weak, you need to buff them considerably\n- Underwhelming feeling of victory at the end of stages.  you open the final portal, kill the 20 guards and you're riddled with feelings of "Well i could have just done this 45 minutes ago if i wanted to..."  There's no "back and forth" struggle or surprise setbacks (i know you have the dwarfs, but you can see all their doors so you're always prepared or camping the opening doors).\n- "Unlocked all Achievements" achievement can be obtained before all achievements have been completed (lol wot?)\n\nHopefully the upcoming DLCs address some issues with the game, but overall, it's highly enjoyable and recommend it for all builder/management loving gamers","December 13, 2015","true","52.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

Build, fight, and prove your worth!\nStory/Premise.\nYou are Leko, son of Odin. You have been cast out of Valhalla because, unlike the other Vikings, you prefer building to pillaging. In order to make your way back to Valhalla, you need to regain your honour by leading a ragtag group of exiled heroes through a series of maps and portals until you've amassed enough honour to ascend to Valhalla.\n\nThe introductory cutscene is the only actual bit of story you'll get. From then on, you clear map after map in order to earn honour.\n\n.Game play.\n-Main Menu-\nIn the main menu, you can view your individual Viking's progress towards returning to Valhalla. Once they've earned enough honour and ascended, they can be called back down with increased combat prowess.\n\nYou can also start a new map, continue your game, and change the options (graphics, sound, the standard stuff). Additionally, you can view your progress towards unlocks here, which are presented in the form of in-game "achievements"--some of which are also Steam achievements.\n\nLet's jump in with a new map.\n\n-Resource management-\nWelcome to the hills, God of Building! Here in this verdant collection of islands, you'll be building a settlement and fighting off enemies and wildlife. Your Viking brethren will literally fall from the sky and, once they've landed, they'll gather around your starting crystal and wait for you to build.\n\nWhen you build wood cutters and quarries next to wood and rocks respectively, Vikings are automatically assigned to the task of harvesting. These materials are used to build other buildings.\n\nFood is the most important of your resources to manage, however, because, without it, your Vikings won't work. That means no building, no hunting, no fishing, and no harvesting. Everything screeches to a halt and your Vikings can die from hunger, which means you'll likely have to restart the map. This can be done by simply clicking "restart" in the main menu.\n\nAt first, you'll rely on the berry bushes that grow in each level. They'll soon run out, however, so you'll need to assign hunters and fisherman. Those wild animals and fish can be exhausted as well, so don't rely on them too much! Build farms and bakers so that your Vikings can have a viable food source.\n\nThe other materials can be refined in order to build more complex structures. These can also be used to create tools, which make more complicated tasks such as farming and bread baking, possible.\n\nVikings can also be considered a resource. You can request Vikings by building homes for them, which increases the max amount you can have at once. Take care because there's a max number of Vikings you can request, shown in the top, left corner of the U.I. If you send a bunch of them to their deaths in battle and have hit your cap for requests, you won't have enough Warriors to clear the map unless you shut down production buildings and stretch your workforce thin.\n\n-City building-\nAs you progress, you unlock more options for sustainability in the hills. You begin with the ability to hunt and fish, which can exhaust its supply and run out. Once you've stripped an area of You quickly unlock more reliable options like baking and farming, which are self-sustaining. These, however, require refined materials. You also unlock things like foresters, which can replace the trees your wood cutter cuts down.\n\nIt's important to plan where you're putting your buildings. The terrain, which is sometimes more uneven than others, will hinder your placement: when you go to place a building, you're presented with three colours: green, yellow, and orange. These affect the building cost.\n\n*Green-- the regular cost to build.\n*Yellow--slightly increased cost in order to build an additional platform to compensate for the terrain.\n*Orange--Greatly increased cost in order to build an additional platform to compensate for the terrain.\n\nIn true city builder style, you have no control over your Viking brethren. You can suggest tasks by placing buildings, but it's up to their discretion--and range--as to whether or not they'll hop to work. Once placed, a building has an effective range, which can be increased by linking them with paths. If your buildings are not in range of each other--say, your mill, tool maker, and wheat farm in range with your bakery--then they won't function.\n\n-Battle-\nWarrior units differ from your regular Vikings. They can take a beating and they also won't lift a figure to build or harvest. They'll still take up your food, though, so it's a good idea to limit your number of warriors until you're ready to go on the offensive. They are key to clearing the map. After you complete a random task--i.e, build a certain building or collect x amount of resources--you're allowed to open the Portal and face the enemies that await you. You have to defeat these Portal Guardians in order to use the Portal and go to the next map.\n\nBattle consists of watching your Viking Warriors clash with various enemies--from wolves to otherworldly spirits. You don't play any part in it, but you can cheer them on as both parties take turns whacking each other.\n\nAfter you've defeated the Portal Guardians, you'll be rewarded with a mass of honour and transported to the victory screen. In the post-battle victory screen, you'll see all of the nifty things you've unlocked by completing various objectives such as clearing various size maps or killing a certain number of enemies. Unlocks include more buildings, which offer more survival and combat options, map types, and terrains. You can also see your progress towards other unlocks by clicking an arrow to the next screen.\n\n.Soundtrack.\nThe music is soaring and peaceful--a lot of wind instruments. It's the same throughout your building and warrior-rallying, changing only to reflect when your followers get into fights.\n\n*I found the fight music to be a little grating, especially when it shifted frequently between the two tracks every few seconds because my warriors tended to wander about and stumble into combat on larger maps.\n\n.Graphics/ Art Style.\nValhalla Hills is lovely. Your Vikings are stubby, cartoonish little men and women babble gibberish. The landscape--whether bright green and rife with life or crystalline white and flush with snow--is vibrant. Snow falls, the wind blows through the trees, and the waves lick at the shore to create an immersive atmosphere.\n\n.Longevity/Difficulty.\nYou can clear maps in a few minutes or in over an hour depending on size. You can easily rush the objective or just sit around and develop a lovely little settlement--it's up to you. No two maps are the same so there's plenty of replayability if you just want to do a quick run or if you want to go on an honour collecting spree. Some maps are a juggling act. You'll need to prioritize getting  steady source of food, but you'll also need to manage building resources so that you don't run out and get stuck without the ability to build anything.\n\nThere are two modes, Classic and Open Game. Classic scales in difficulty as you unlock achievements and ease your way in. Open Game allows you to dive right in with everything unlocked from the get-go and is significantly more difficult.\n\n.Bottom Line.\nValhalla Hills is both fun and engaging. You can play for a few minutes, or for a few hours and no two maps are the same so you'll spend your time figuring out how best to position your buildings. With two game modes and a variety of map sizes, you'll surely get your money's worth of game time. For fans of the city-building and strategy/RTS genres, Valhalla Hills is a definite yes.","May 18","true","2.4"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","22","33","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/351910/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Valhalla Hills is a city builder game where you play Leko, son of Odin as he tries to regain his honour back in his fathers eyes by helping mortal Vikings to build, survive and become worthy enough to enter Valhalla.\n\nThe game starts with a wonderful little story about how Leko ends up banished from Valhalla as he displays signs of creativity and enjoys building and doesn't seem to care for the traditional fighting ways of the Vikings. Odin tells him to go to Earth and become the God of the Builders and not to return. Leko, however, decides he can win a place in Valhalla with his father if he can just regain enough honor.\n\nValhalla Hills is reminiscent of some of the old great city builder strategy games but with it's own nice little spin. Rather than having every building unlocked for you from the start, you have to unlock them over time by regaining honor which you do by completing missions or various objectives. You do have the option to play in 'Open Mode' which allows everything to be unlocked from the start but this is significantly harder and I would not recommend this for people just starting out. The classic mode has a nice difficulty curve and teaches you what you need to know as it goes on, explaining each building or new feature to you as you unlock it preventing you from missing out on what vital buildings do.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty easy to learn if you are familiar with these types of games. You are guided through the basics like how to build, building speed, managing resources and such and each time you unlock something new, build a building for the first time or there is a new event it is explained. There is also a nice colour grid to help with placement which speeds things up a lot. Despite saying this, if you are new to this genre you might struggle. Though there is a lot that is explained to you there is also a lot that is missed out. I've played this genre for a many years but ended up making two crucial errors early on which messed up two entire missions because something very simple wasn't explained. This can become a huge problem which I'll explain further in the cons.\n\nEach mission starts you with a few Vikings, some resources to get you started and an end portal on your map and your goal is to reach and open the end portal either killing or appeasing the guardians on the way. Your Vikings can be assigned various roles but from there onwards they will handle their duties themselves with no extra input from you (most of the time). They have basic needs as well and will require things like food and sleep with some extra needs/perks like some booze for the soldiers to keep them happy and strong. Its your job to build these things to fulfil the needs of your mortals so you can conquer each map and bring yourself closer to going home.\n\nThere is a nice selection of buildings from what I've seen so far but I feel the shape and design of the map can limit how you place them. The maps start of fairly small meaning your first few 'villages' will look fairly similar because certain buildings have to be placed near others for them to work successfully.\n\nDespite me enjoying myself a lot so far there are some cons I would like to mention because they are noticeable. The first is that the story starts very, very strong and I was excited to play through and see more about Leko's struggles but from what I've seen there is no more to the story. The missions themselves start with no further addition to the storyline and it seems that the opening cutscene is all there is to it. This is very disappointing because the start itself was very engaging. My second issue is the fact that if you build wrong, even one building, chances are it'll mess up your entire mission. Resources are very scarce and once you have used one up you are screwed. For example, the woodcutter has a certain range where he can fell trees and there are only a certain amount of trees dotted around the map, once he destroys those trees that building is useless and I'll have to build another using logs (which can only be made in a woodcutter). If I have no logs, like I did then I'll have to demolish a building to get some as it's the only way I found to get more. Except, I had other buildings I had placed to be built and you cannot control the build priority at all so they started building those using up all my logs again. In the end I had to restart because they had all started to starve because they couldn't build the bakery. This needs to be fixed. You shouldn't require a basic material to build a building that can only be obtained from that building. This forces you to build some things in a very specific order. My last gripe I think is directly related to my previous one. You have to create each tool you need yourself rather than it being automatically created if you have the resources. This becomes a very boring thing to do over and over again but I do believe this is in place because of how limited your resources are and to stop you using up everything making tools when you need buildings first.\n\nOverall I think Valhalla Hills is a fun game with some great features though it's lacking in any story depth. I do feel that the $30 price is too high because of this but the game is 100% worth it if it goes on sale. Another great genre edition perfect for those who are familiar with but prefer a more relaxed take on the city builder strategy genre.","April 22","true","5.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

However it's not enough to prompt hours and hours of gameplay.\n\nThe lack of a central story or progression in game leads it to fall short. Basically it's the same thing each time with what seems to be random generated small, then slowly larger islands as you move up in level/progress.

But the AI of the little Vikings you manage, is not very robust. Examples: Viking goes to sleep under a tree where ice guards patrol, he gets attacked, and tries to fight for a bit before running away, not towards safety, but towards an area he will be cornered, he manages to survive, but then goes to sleep in the same spot over and over again, eventually dies. Same Viking, prior to his death, doesn't chop down trees closest to the village, wanders off to where wolves or the previously mentioned ice guards were. If attacked, the vikings will run around in stupid directions, often towards something else that will want to kill them, and then go back to try and fight the same things when they have maybe 20% health left.\n\nBut, even when you take this borderline suicidal behaviour into account, the game is able to keep me interested. If the Vikings running off and dying like fools is likely to drive you mad, don't get the game, if this behaviour won't give you rage, or will satisfy the sadist in you, then buy it.","December 12, 2015","true","11.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Generally speaking it has alot of same feel and functions that you would hope to play with in a basic colony builder. I found myself falling into the familiar - yet fun - routine of trying to sort out basic problems while optimising my little village(s). Where the game started to take off more me is in the exploration you find yourself doing on maps and the constant randomness of the maps you play on. Because of the constant change I feel like trying map after map so it gets high marks for replayability at this time.\nDownsides at the moment - seeing as I'm reviewing this in early access - is that the 'end game' is pretty empty at this point. The few items like iron weapons and gold as an example are a nice perk for your warriors but certainly not necessary as you can just chug mead like a good viking and just have an uber army easily. The Kitchen - which  requires a solid amount of infrastructure to produce - is something that I enjoy from other games like Anno 2070 where you try to build up resources to have a cool pay off at the end. The problem is that at the moment this is one item - and it barely works even if you throw hordes of resources at it - which I found aggravating for an 'end game' item.\nGame is a great deal of fun the first 8-10 hrs. - then I began to imagine how modding and an increase items and building to construct would really help the game. The gameplay is fun along the lines of Banished but without the community and fun items to build at the moment.\nWould recommend - but it will need to be taken as a 8-10 hr. game in early access.","October 10, 2015","true","22.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Still it doesn't have large amount of content (lack of update tho)\n\nStunning graphics and art style, it is just near damn perfect. In fact character designs, level design and building design/models are incredibly good enough. Gameplay is very simple and easy to play as a casual gamer. (Easir than Tropico,Anno and other city builder games, I assume.)\n\nValhalla Hills starts with a level and when you clear it, get to the exit, other levels starts to get bigger and a bit harder with different enemy types. You usually do make some buildings. That buildings does not feel important sadly. You just need some things to get for portal and exit the level... And yes you have to take care of your people (aka Vikings).\n\nAs i say before the gameplay is like ; Make buildings, lead your people to exit portal and find it, then get what it need or fight, clear the level and exit. Very simply and easy gameplay, fair enough to learn (on normal). You just have to make the building in the right place and make some adjustments.\n\nThe point is ; yeah I do recommend this game. Valhalla is out of early access and still needs support. But It has a bit limited gameplay and content. Levels gets boring and starts looking like as the same (everyone says it, but it is true.), Buildings and people are not really prominent. There is some issues with updates. If you have money and you're looking for a game that you'd play for a weekend or a few week, get it.\n\nI do not know about the game's future. But it got halloween and some updates. I hope it'll get more updates and more content(s). Still, I trust to Funatics Software since they're the group who is behind of Cultures. Game gets updates more or less...

You have the mind of a home-builder, to give your fellow drunken friends a roof over their heads, where you will have the skills to build Production, Logistics and combat. These three functions will allow you to build houses, military, woodcutters etc.  Every work will be assigned automatically to a viking, where we can expand it's tools. By putting down either a home, or any kind of work related, the current building can be placed on the map, but be aware, that the map will limit you for space and offers green, for less rescources needed, yellow, for more. When you have finished building and designing your home, then we are taking the next step. A army to defend and attack the portal, you will face Guardians that will stop every single viking. By killing them, wins the current game. After that, you have a option to either move on and get new buildings or either continue with the current home you made.\n\nOverall game design, the game looks stunning with it's use of UE4 engine. The design of vikings and atsmophere really gives the feeling of it's time, where you want to keep playing. The interface is friendly and extremely simple. Unfortunately this game does not offer any kind of Co-op / Multiplayer which i could imagine bring more fun to the games content.\n\nIf you like taking care of fallen vikings, be the builder and brain to recover drunk energy to fight the guardians and return to Asgard's gates, then this game is definitely for you.\n\nHere is a demo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gma4TVCTNjk","August 25, 2015","true","3.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","10","15","3","0"

It has a great artistic design that looks good and the sound design is just as excellent. I'm not a huge fan of the Viking era but this game grabbed me.\n\nThe maps start out small and grow as you progress closer to Valhalla. I've logged about eight hours of this review and new buildings are still getting unlocked, which is impressive for an early access game.\n\nThe economy is simplistic yet challenging to maintain if you don't pay attention, mindlessly grow your village. Buildings all tie together as well. Making bread for example requires you to build a wheat farm, mill, and finally a bakery which makes for an engaging way to lay out your village.\n\nEvery map is randomly generated so every new map will be different but never game breaking and allows you to progress. The game is basically a viking themed settlers game placed on randomly generated maps.\n\nOne thing I think the game could greatly benifit is from including competitive MP like a race condition to Valhalla (per map) or just simply battling each other with army camps.","August 26, 2015","true","3.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I though it would be a bit dull. However bought it on a sale. It turned out that due to environment hostility, nice music, smooth graphics, hand-tuned game mechanics, handy GUI and random maps it is really enjoyable and playful, sometimes challenging. It's not simple to develop your settlement the way that does not disturb any hostile creatures. You have to invest a lot in your small army. You have to plan resources and keep everyone dry and full with food. And you enjoy every minute since it's simple, handy and colorful. Althouht, do not expect this to be a smart city builder / sandbox of any kind. This is more like an RTS - 20-60 minutes rounds following each other. So it's also time-friendly - a very important feature for me.\n\nEarly Access Note: the Vikings are sometimes a but stupid. But that's playful and it's kinda improves the challenge. They take food from the wrong place, disturbing all the creatures on the island. They sometimes craft instruments for too long (at some point in time it was fixed with other production chain - I didn't really understand was that and update or a level-up). But thanks to developers the game looks finished. I do not understand why they state as early access.","November 23, 2015","true","8.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

No i can't. But keep an eye out for the game where its heading!!\n\nBut lets get a little bit into the details why i choose to not recommend this game. I will first make a list of positive and negative issues here and then discuss it a little bit later:\n\nPositive:\nNice graphics and cute look\nGood Music\nEasy to learn\nNice atmosphere\nNegative:\nRepetitive small maps\nAI still a little clumsy (Early Access!)\nNo deep production chains\nMissing Ui element like worker overview\nSo what to make out of this list. First i wanted to keep it short and put down what came to my mind first. I think this game has some potential but will disappoint a lot of people. If you are a strategy, building management simulation enthusiast with games like Anno Series, Cities Skylines, Settler and so on you will be bored pretty fast. I am one of the biggest fans of the early settlers series (2+3) and even like Anno or Cities Skylines but Valhalla Hills (VH) looses in every department to this games.\nThe maps are too small, There is no real development of your settlement and the production chains stay shallow. You'll lack integral UI Statistics about your workers, their needs and item Priority.  Overall the game stays shallow.\n\nTBH i first was hyped when i read Settler developers engaging in this project. For me it looks like this game is a development of a Game Engine and proof of concept perhaps for a new Settler Game. If it is so, plz tell your customers. I feel like they want to get some bucks for engine development from light minded users.\nThe Engine looks nice and Music and Graphics for VH are really cool. So take the engine and make a new SETTLER plz!!! With maps like in S2 + S3 and then mix in Research and stuff like in S7.\nBut i will have an eye out for the game from time to time and check where its heading. But i believe it will not offer a deep simulation experience.","February 1","false","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

None of the features I was hoping for have been implemented. This game was developed by the same people who are responsible for the Settlers 2 and it's nowhere close to that quality.\n\nThere's no campaign and no long-term replay value at all! You only get an infinite string of random maps with zero progression besides unlocking structures piece by piece. Once everything is unlocked, there's no incentive to continue.\n\nThe logistics system is awful. Is it too much to ask for a Settlers level of quality here? That game is 20 years old!!! You can't control the supply chains, you can't really follow the logic behind it either.\n\nFinal verdict: Play the free version of "Settlers 2 Gold" (abandonware) with the fan-expansion "Return to the Roots" instead of this tablet garbage.\n3/10 points\n\n\n---------- original review -------------\nReviewing: v.0.10.16 (August 29th)\nGenre: Settlers meet Facebook.\n\nI'm a huge fan of these kind of strategy games since the late 1980s. When people remember the good old days they tend to forget how shallow most games were back then. Modern games like Anno 2070 are the exact opposite, overladen with depth at the cost of sheer fun. If a single map takes 4-5 hours to finish that's not an achievement, it's a sign of bad game design in my opinion.\nThe challenge is to hit the sweet spot between intuitive fun and complexity.\n\n"Valhalla Hills" is still in early access which shouldn't be forgotten here. In its current incarnation it leans heavily towards simplicity. A little too much for my taste. The progression is slooooooow almost to the point where I feel a little insulted. Not a big deal though because you'll eventually unlock the more complex production chains.\n\nThe real problem right now are the utterly missing feedback tools. There is a statistic screen that doesn't really help though. Example: You start a level and have 10 vikings right away. No one tells you what is needed to satisfy their demands. NOTHING! You're probably going to build some huts to give them a place to sleep. Some food production to feed them. Hmm... so you're producing 5 fish. What exactly does that mean? Is 1 viking eating 1 fish per time unit? If so, why are the fish simply being stored in the fishery and not being consumed? Somehow my vikings are feasting on berries they collect without having a berry collecting building.\nPlease give us analytical tools so we can understand wtf is going on!\n\nThe positives:\n- Visuals are absolutely stunning, pros at work!\n- Had no ctd yet\n- smooth gameplay\n- overall very professional feel\n- devs used to work on "The Settlers 2" which makes me confident of things to come\n\nThe neutrals:\n- no a.i. opponents => you can/will play at your own pace which can be both positive or negative depending on your personal taste. Nobody ever complained about that in city builders for example. I would prefer having other tribes nearby with whom you can trade or fight. Would be intriguing if you need resource they have a monopoly on. Choice: trade for it or fight over it. Unfortunately I don't suppose it will be implemented.\n\nThe cons:\n- too shallow right now\n- difficult to assess cause and effect due to lack of analytical tools\n- forgettable music, mediocre sound effects\n- no cohesive campaign yet. That was a bad surprise. In the main menu you can only select to play a new map which then is randomly created. The progression only consists of unlocking new stuff. I was expecting a campaign map with scenarios attached to each other. This needs to be implemented!!!\n\n\nConclusion:\nLot of work to be done. The technical foundation is extremely good so there's hope. The devs can purely focus on improving gameplay instead of having to deal with technical issues.\nI can only give a moderate recommendation at this point. Only bought it because it was on sale for 16 Euro and I trust the developers' skills and dedication. Wouldn't have bought it for 20 bucks.\n\nRating for the tested version: 6/10\n\nWill update this review. Will increase the score if the devs meet expectations and lower to a thumbs down if not.","August 29, 2015","false","7.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

Valhalla Hills doesn't has a story-mode aside from the short story of being the cast out son of Odin who needs to build his way back to Valhalla. Instead, you play on randomly generated maps where you start at the foot of a mountain. You have to build a base and prepare your vikings to open a portal at the top of the mountain to advance to the next map. The units are vikings you cannot control directly. If you encounter a map you can't win or you don't want to play, you can simply generate a new map, but you loose the progress of the current one.\n\nNew buildings, biomes and stronger enemies are unlocked while playing by a kind of achievement system. On one side it gives the the game some progression and it doesn't bombard you with too much information, on the other side, the beginning is too easy and feels repetitive. It takes around 6-8 hours to unlock everything, but I hope the developer will add more content because it gets quite repetitive after 4 hours.\n\nAs I've mentioned above, the building part is quite nice, but the victory condition requires some more polish. After building the first few buildings to get building materials and food, you can assemble a little military force and start fighting your way through to the portal. the portal is usually guarded by several enemies that can either be killed, or you can sacrifice materials to bribe them. Sadly, the difficulty to produce these materials varies wildly. I had a few games in a row where I had to sacrifice water and plain old wood, very basic materials to bribe the strongest enemies. Other times I had to produce high quality products to bribe weak enemies, so fighting was much easier. The developer should put some more work into this ending to make it more satisfying for the player. Building a large and expensive monument could be a solution.\n\nThe mentioned fighting system isn't very fun either as it is partly luck. each unit does a fix value of damage to the enemy, but sadly you can't tell your units whom to fight first. The difference between winning and loosing a battle isn't preparation and tactics, but the luck of which enemy gets attacked by your stubborn vikings first, and if the enemies focus your vikings or if they spread their attacks over your units. Even worse: it can happen that a viking gets hungry on the way to war and wanders off to get food or sleep while the other are fighting. This makes fighting kind of luck based, something I don't really like in a building game. Some general orders for your vikings would be helpful.\n\nThe game uses the Unreal 4 engine to produce a good art style.The game is held in a cartoon style with exaggerated animations that can easily create the aquarium effect well known from games of the settler series or city-builder games. Sometimes you just want to take a moment and watch your vikings while they work... typically German, I know. The game looks especially nice during night time when all the different houses have torches in front of their door. The sound is good and fits the setting, yet nothing special.\n\nAll in all, Valhalla Hills show a lot of promise in it's early stage. It still needs a lot of work, but the team has a lot of knowledge in building games and a strong publisher covering their back. I look forward to seeing new content. If you like the genre, it is already worth a purchase.","September 12, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Almost immediately requested a Steam refund.\n\nThe touchpad doesn't work at all: as soon as I touch it at all, the viewport zooms in as far as it can, and then I cannot zoom out at all. (Unplayable.)\nSo, I dragged out an old trackball I had in a closet; but there appears to be no way to tilt the view with the mouse *anyway*, despite having gotten zoom working. For reasons unclear, the pointer occasionally jumps across the screen, or ends up somewhere slightly other than where I'm trying to move it at the end of the movement, leading me to click in the wrong place. (Unplayable, ugh.)\nOn a *literally top of the line* trash-can-Mac-Pro (that's dual AMD FirePro W9000 cards! Although this isn't a gaming machine, I should seriously never be *able* to make any game play slowly on this workstation), the interface is laggy, and the graphics strangely jumpy. (Not unplayable, but at least unpleasant.)\nI'm genuinely sad that I can't speak as to whether the game is actually any fun; although I struggled through the first three tutorial missions, the vast majority of my time and effort went into trying to place the mouse pointer where I needed to, to click whatever interface-element was dictated by the tutorials; I was barely even able to put any effort into paying attention to the instructions themselves.\n\n(The one takeaway I *do* have for non-Mac gamers: the interface *is* a little backwards and strange; it seems very unpolished, in terms of user-experience. This almost feels like it was designed to be a tablet game, and then the decision was belatedly made to port it to the PC?)","December 4, 2015","false","0.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","1"

Place buildings, establish production chains, develop infrastructure through roads and couriers and recruit geologists to find ore. Its pretty much the basics of the game where the obstacles are found in the terrain, wondering dangerous animals and various enemies.\n\nUnfortunately it´s another game which presents the challenge in form of building restrictions, the terrain is not always pleasant and you may not be able to put up your chain of production where you wish it to be. Why do I state "unfortunately"? Because I love these type of games along with pretty base building and always hope for a different challenge rather than space restrictions.\n\nYour vikings will tend to themselves, gather the necessary raw materials and build the tools necessary to do their jobs. When you build a military camp you decide the number of vikings stationed there and their roles, you move the camps around to danger areas to fight foes and back to safety so your battle tired vikings can rest.\n\nI will recommend this game with the carefull notion that not every aspect of the game seems polished in regard to ressource management, sometimes your vikings will starve with food nearby and there are a few problems with fetching items, but overall I have not yet runned into major issues. It is still a ton of fun to build your village and see it prosper.\n\nI will recommend watching a youtube video or two and visit the forums.","August 30, 2015","true","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It also has Culture's in it but I don't remember enough about the game to really see this part of it in this game.\n\nThe graphical style fits the game, its relaxed yet has a lot of atmosphere, it has most of the buildings you expect. Woodcutters, Sawmills, Wheat farms, Mills, Bakery's etc. There is also the military side of the game but here I start to feel the lack of the game.\n\nYou see, I never feel like I am in any kind of trouble, if you played the old settlers, you knew that at some point the AI would swarm you and destroy you quite easy if you are to laid back.\nIn this game, there are no Romans or Vikings or Egyptians, just beings that live underground and come out of it, starts building towers (without units in it..) and then spread its influence across the map, but it never really attacks, I never ever build a guard tower, 9 military units suplied by gold to increase damage and brew to increase health is enough to win the map.\n\nThe AI of your own Vikings aren't that clever either, they don't spread goods around when your start to build a lot of buildings, quite often I see a gold mine have 5 ores, yet my smelters aren't full. The couriers that they give a tip for, to use when the map gets larger and more populated, are very bad at actually moving goods around. This with the fact of some key functions, like being able to manually say what items to store in storage buildings doesn't help, and you end up with 20 sticks in it, which aren't that usefull..\nForresters like to start planting trees not near the building itself but far away for some reason, and you can't put where they work yourself like you could in the old settlers.\n\nAll in all its fun and yet frustrating, its not bad but not good either. Perhaps, future DLC will add or improve. So while I recommend it, I would say a 6/10.\n\nPlayed on\nOS: Win 10\nSSD: 120GB 840 EVO SAMSUNG (windows)\nSSD: 1TB 840 EVO SAMUNG (games)\nPSU: Corsair AX860i, 860 Watt voeding\nMBB: Asus MAXIMUS VII RANGER Z97\nRAM: Corsair 16 GB DDR3-1600 Vengeance\nCPU: Int Core i7-4790K 1150 Noctua NH-D15 cooler\nGFX: Gigabyte 980Ti Gaming 6G\nSFX: ASUS Xonar D2X/XDT PCIe\n\n\n","February 16","true","35.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But at the moment it's simply too unbalanced, and the AI is Frightening poor. You can have half of your population running around trying to eat the same apple, to the extend that they end up starving to death... Beside that, the balance is mostly based on how much food the different buildings produce. Currently it's at the 'Banished' Level, at which you will need 40-50% of your population in the food making chain.\nlastly but not least. Being unable to choose when you want new vikings to join your settlement (beside limiting it by building houses, which brings on a whole other kind of problem). Is in my opinion not the smartest, if starvation befalls your city for a period, it can permanently kill off a huge amount of your max population you can have in your city. Because the darn stone just keeps spawning more and more people.\nThese 3 things really feels like a thorn in my side while playing. If they are corrected (or looked into), I would Love give this a thumps up, and yell to all my peers to go buy it or they will miss out in something amazing. But currently it's simply too.. wonky.\n\nAlso this might not be needed, but.. It's a settlers game kind of game.. It's lives up to that in every way.

There are some interesting buildings to unlock and the portals are also interesting. There is some fun factor in the game. The maps start small and grow larger and hiller as you go. I still play cultures and settlers (not the last one).\n\nBut the main challenge of this game is the food..The consumption of food is over rapid. The production of food is slow. So, you will get blah and blah are too hungry to work. There is no balance between the production of food and the intake of food. I was told bread is better for your vikings..So stupidly I played until I got a bakery going. It made no difference. The little vikings would pick up 1 to 2 things and go zooming around to eat food, wash, rinse, and repeat. As far as I could see there was no difference between bakery, fishing, wild berries, and wild mushrooms..No buffs. This is also bad because you are alloted so many vikings. I suppose if you stuck with the basics and just built food buildings it might even out (but I seriously doubt it).\n\nThe space alloted to buildings is wacky. I am not talking about map size (maps you start small and they get bigger as you complete the map).\n\nThe game has potiental, but I doubt the food will change. If you like food challenges ..this game is for you. If you are looking for older settlers or cultures .. this game is not for you. I had an easier time defeating the mobs from the portal than feeding the vikings..\n\nTo me the game would be okay for maybe 10 bucks..not the price shown.\n\n36 Vikings - 4 fisheries, 3 Hunters, and a bakery could not feed 36 vikings. Just LoL..FAIL! I also noticed that the vikings will go way out of range to get food, but won't walk 2 buildings away to get fish.. Berries are no help because the idiots don't give them time to grow back..This game fails because feeding 36 vikings shouldn't be an issue ..Pathing is horrible.. They carry 1 item at a time..1 ♥♥♥♥ing item.. XD.. To date this the most horrible balanced game I have wasted money on..\n\nIt is NOTHING like Cultures or earlier Settlers games..infact it is an insult to those games..","November 28, 2015","false","7.9"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

The pacing is really slow - both in the sense that you will want to keep the game on fast forward at all times, and in the sense that buildings very slowly (one per mission). I keep hoping that it will get more fun when I finally get to the point where there is some strategy to consider, and it's slowly getting there, but it's taking ages to get fun.\n\nThere is also the issue that missions generally don't work very well; nominally there is a boss fight, but odds are that the wolves roaming the countryside are far deadlier, resulting in a rather unticlimatic game with a "peaceful" option which doesn't work because you still need to build a large military to deal with the afore mentioned deadly wolves.\n\nFinally, there is the pointlessly tacked on valour mechanic for the vikings.\n\nIt's not terrible, but I can't recomemend it because it takes so long to get interesting.","January 5","false","8.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","2"

It's ridiculous. It's hard to tell if your production capacity meets the requirements of your population. Even if you go nuts and build farms, mills, bakeries, and kitchens, inevitably your f*cking vikings starve when there is food nearby. You can take the advice given on the forums and keep everything in a local vicinity, connect everything with paths,overproduce food and even store it in containers- however, your vikings will still f*cking starve. You'll spend hours collecting resources putting food production at the forefront of your priorities.. and your f*cking vikings starve. There's not even an easy way to tell if your viking's will even have enough food.\n\nI wish I had not bought this game and instead kept my $20 bucks and used it to feed a real viking, because at least then I'd have some control whether it f*cking starved or not. I think this game has finally broken my early-release game buying, most games suck when their done why on earth would they be any good before their final stage?\n\nI do like that you can rename the vikings.

There's a LOT of potential to be had from this game.\nSince it's still early access, there's bound to be more stuff comming, and I CANNOT wait for that. (Unless this is DayZ in disguise, huehue)\n\nTL;DR\nNot bad game, much potential.\nIs in balancing process, so feels too easy.\nDoes not feel incentivised to build huge production chains\nWould not recommend in current state (state of balancing), but keep a lookout on the updates. I, for one, cannot wait to play it when that part is done :)\n\nIt pains me to give this one a thumbs down.\nReally\nIt reminds so much of the older settlers games, which will always be my favorite series in this genre.\nThe problem is, after the first 20 minutes, it's just the same every single map.\nAlso, it's the developers behind the game series Cultures, another great series.\n\nIn each map, or island, you have to open a portal and get through it. This can be done by either fighting the portal guardians, or making a sacrifice.\n\nThe problem here is that the sacrifices take a max of 5 minutes per map, and the same with fighting. It's just way too easy, and kind of boring in the end, even frustratingly so.\n\nFor the most part, I haven't had to construct any interesting production chains, since even though you can build a long chain to bake bread, the sacrifice only needs like 15 wood logs, the easiest resource to obtain.\nSure, I could just build myself those chains, but with zero reason, there's zero incentive.\n\nAs I said, having to vote this down pains me.

One of my earliest memories is playing Settlers 2.  So my judgement is biased.\n\nIt has good and bad.  I like the viking dudes running around in the wild, doing manly things and just hanging out, scratching their man beards and what not.  I like the 3D style of building a town uphill towards the top.  I like the graphics, the lighting, day/night cycle, battling ice peoples, and everything has a real historical reference.\n\nBut I don't like how damn annoying it is.  You drop a foundation down and just sit there and tap your finger, and stare at friggin Ragnor, while he's rolling around in the grass, checking out a butterfly, like "BUILD the STUPID building man!"\nThere is so much waiting around, and not a lot of user interaction.  You have to wait for the tool to be available, then for the lumber, then you put down a foundation, then you have to wait for it to be levelled, then built, then the worker gets there.  You wait, you wait you wait some more.  It's also kinda laggy and the loading screens are like 3 minutes.  I can run GTA 5 no problem, and this games graphics are almost non existent.  Like I mean there is actually nothing going on that requires CPU usage.  There is also some weird debug graphics glitch thing that popped up and won't go away.\nI dunno.\n\nYes, I push fast forward a lot, but that's no fun.  Everyone is scrambling around and that really breaks immersion.  The game is just too anal about doing things in a certain order.  If I build two lumberjack huts, and I STILL have to wait for lumber in the second level.  Nope.  I'm out.\n\nIt's not really a good game because that supply system makes it boring, but if you don't pick it up and play it, your kinda missing out because there isn't any game like it.","January 26","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
