This version runs great on Windows 7 - you will be able to crank it up to resolutions like 1920x1080 and still have good performance. The controls/movement is still super fluid even today, no real CFG tweaks needed either to make this run optimally.\n\nThe online built in does not work, I believe to play with other people you need to use a service such as Hamachi.\n\nAs far as content, you are able to find hundreds if not thousands of custom maps/missions/mods online - giving this game really hours and hours of play time.\n\nSO, yes, Ghost Recon still holds up to this day and runs great on todays computers.

Do you have any idea what is this ♥♥♥♥?\n\n"B-but I've p-played Rainbow S-Six and..."\n\nDon't even start. You think Rainbow Six is the unsurpassable work of Tom Clancy's history with video-games? Guess what, you're wrong. If you buy mother♥♥♥♥ing Ghost Recon, you're in for the ride of your life. Ghost Recon is the apex of Clancy's strategy shooters. Rainbow Six series was a mere distraction.\n\nIn this baby you play as a team of highly trained, combat-ready soldiers from the fictional Delta company, part of the not-so-fictional 5th Special Forces Group. Google it up, kids. These guys are so good they call themselves Ghosts, as in "I'll kill you, your friends, your family and no one will ever know who did it". When ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan in Georgia (the country), the Ghosts are called in to kick some russian ♥♥♥. Turns out ♥♥♥♥ has hitted the fan way harder than expected, and you get to kill ultranationalists all the way to the heart of Russia itself.\n\nNow, to the gameplay. You liked the strategy system in the Rainbow Six series? All that planing ahead, sending the teams in the exact same moment into a room full of terrorists? Well, ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥, that's for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Ghosts get to do that in the field, as the moment call for it. Ogranize your team from anywere, anytime, and you're good to go. It feels amazing, the gameplay is quick and action-packed or slow and strategy-full, as you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wish. Wanna go in guns blazing? You go get them, champ. Wanna stealth the ♥♥♥♥ out of the stage and kill every living soul before anyone spots you? You got it. Complete all the missions the way you want, you control the whole ♥♥♥♥. And don't forget to keep as many of your guys alive as you can, since they get upgrades and become ungodly soldiers if you get them through ten or so missions.\n\nThe engine is the same as the other Rainbow Six's games in the same generation, so don't expect anything out of the ordinary. Graphics are a little outdated, but who cares about graphics anyway? Right guys? Right...? Well, at least I don't. The menus look like ♥♥♥♥ on most screens these days, but the game itself supports high resolutions, so you won't cry tears of blood from watching so many edges and pixelated ♥♥♥♥. Animation on soldiers and vehicles are actually pretty great, even better than your "next-gen" FPSs from nowadays.\n\nMultiplayer is dead, forget about it. It was never good anyways. Trust me, I've played it when it came out and went straight back to Return to Castle Wolfenstein. The singleplayer campaing is where this ♥♥♥♥ shines.\n\nAll in all, this game often gets crazy cheap on Steam Sales and is worth every cent, including Island Thunder and Desert Siege. If you are not a fifteen years old kid who can't stand ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics and hard, thinking-heavy gameplay, you WILL like this game.\n\nOh, one more thing. There is only one Ghost Recon game, and it is this one. If you ever mention the sequels in front of me, you will be dead to me. That ♥♥♥♥ ain't Ghost Recon.\n\nGameplay - 10/10\nSoundtrack - 10/10\nGraphics - 6/10\nContent - 8/10\nChallenge Level - 9/10\nReplayability - 4/10","July 6, 2014","true","10.2"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","94","49","52","15","5"

Unlike most FPS Action games, however your stealth and health are far more important as a few shots will instantly kill you. But this gives you a great and realistic simulation what is like to be in a live fire zone, and you can crouch and prone to camoflage in woodlands and deserts.\n\nIf you are also a real life Veteran Soldier or a Marine then you will like this game to show a bit of action - as well a bit of training!\n\nThe key parts to this game to winning is stay silent, spot enemies under your radar wisely and allow your Team AI players camp in a safe distance vantage point for sniping. Also you will need to be aware of needing LAW Rockets required to blow up enemy Tanks in some missions, as those monsters can actually ice you instantly.","December 10, 2013","true","18.2"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","0"

You control a squad of elite soldiers with their own stats that will improve over time. The game has perma-death so you'll have to be careful with your veterans or else they'll be replaced by rookies.\n\nThe game is also fairly hard for todays standards if you play on normal/hard. You get killed in 1-3 shots, so you must use your brain. If you survive a shot you may get penalties, like moving much slower or being easier to detect.\n\nIn my experience this is an harsh game where you constantly have to think of how to make your squad survive the next mission, instead of just blowing things up 24/7. If you can look past the graphics it's a very nice tactical experience, particularily in co-op.\n\nThere's a mod called "Heroes Unleashed" that will add more than twice as many weapons to the game, fixing the weapons variety issue.","November 16, 2014","true","3.2"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","28","33","4","0"

Re-installed it in 2006 and oh boy, what a joy it was !\n\n► The graphics don't matter here, it's a 2001 game so you can't expect much but you can set it to high resolutions. The good thing about its graphic engine it's the way in which both the enemies and your team can blend in a huge variety of environments. It is sometimes very hard to tell an enemy from a bush for instance, forcing the player to advance slowly, recon the area with the right team member, use the binoculars or the sniper before assaulting a given objective. Despite its age the game provides you with a great variety of environments starting with open woodlands under clear sky, cities, farming areas at night, snowy mountains, foggy marshes with low visiblity ahead and so on. And if that's not enough for you there's Desert Siege and Island Thunder , the game's two add-ons, adding desert environments ( DUH ) and treacherous jungles. This kind of variety is rarely seen in most tactical shooters , making Ghost Recon a must have for any player who likes the genre.\n\n► The A.I is also great. You may experience some pathfinding problems with some of your squad members ( especially in closed environements such as houses - they sometimes get stuck behind a table or block your way upstairs, which is annoying but it doesn't happen that often , you may even finish the game without having these problems. But then again you can control any of your squad members and get them out of the way. ) The enemies have good reactions when a firefight starts, you will see them splitting up instead of sticking together like magnets or just married couples. They will try to get behind you, they advance a little, they stop for a few moments, they go right, they go left and you cannot predict the path they will take in order to find you and kill you. So hiding behind a rock and waiting for 20 russians to pop in one by one so you can shoot them is a no-no. Even in easy difficulty you'll find it challenging ( especially if it's your first time trying this game ).\n\n► Speaking of challenging, let me say a few words about something I didn't like in this game. You can save your games. Now it might sound stupid but save game options for this genre tend to ruin the experience a little bit. It is way more rewarding to finish a mission without saving your progress, it forces you to think twice before doing something, but if you fail 30 seconds before completing the last objective then it is very frustrating to start it all over again. Saving your progress is good for players who are new to tactical shooters, but the more experienced you get the less help you want to get from the game. And speaking about help, there's a radar at the bottom of the screen telling you if there are enemies around you. It doesn't tell you the number of enemies, the small circle turns red if you're approaching an enemy ( or being approached by it ). It also tells you from which direction the gunshots are coming, which is another small cheat. The problem with these tools is that they are distracting. I sometimes get shot because I spend half a second watching my radar to check the coming direction of the gunshots. Other than that, the HUD is alright, it shows your stance, level of injuries, remaining ammo and weapon used. The remaining ammunition in the magazines is another thing that should have been removed..\n\n► Overall the gameplay is good, simple but effective. You can bring up to six Ghosts to the battle, and assign them to Alpha, Bravo and Charlie squads. This gives room for nice pre-planning, you can therefore create a recon squad equiped with silenced weapons, an assault squad carrying assault rifles ( DUH ) and a sniper squad involving the sniper himself and a teamate to protect his back. This is one example among many you can use before pressing the start button. During the mission, you also have access to a tactical map, which is actually a very basic one offering you the possibility to adopt different behaviours ( Assault - fire at will /// Recon - Don't shoot /// and so on ) . You can assign waypoints to the teams allowing you to coordinate an assault for instance. But then again, careful with that tool, if the squad you're not controlling gets stuck behind a rock... there goes you planning. The map could have been greatly improved but it hasn't been, and that's a shame. Finally, the map menu also shows where your troopers have been injured. Being shot in the leg will make the Ghost move slower or will be forced to walk, whereas  an injured arm will greatly reduce his ability to shoot accurately. The objectives you have to complete stretch from capturing a high profile colonel ( and bring it back to the base - yes, you will have to go all the way back to the insertion area so pay attention more tangos incoming !! ) , blowing up planes, clearing an old castle's courtyard, assaulting a farm and a house, destroying tanks, rescuing NATO soldiers and so on and so forth. The diversity of Ghost Recon is amazing for such an old game !\n\n► It comes with 15 singleplayer missions , which is not that much but if you buy the add-ons you'll have enough for weeks . It also has a multiplayer, which I haven't tried, yet. You can also replay the missions, trying different approaches, using different squad members such as specialists ( you can unlock them by completing side objectives and they are very valuable squad members, they come with higher skills in every domain ( stealth, weapons, command, endurance ). You can upgrade the skills of each Ghost by assigning skill points, earned at the end of each mission. I recommend to upgrade the stealth skill as much as possible, I'm just saying...\n\nAs a conclusion I would say that this is one of the best tactical shooters out there, and it comes at a cheap price !

Command up to at least three squads on very long missions.  The game is very unforgiving at times depending on how you play through the game.  Being very ballistic and balls deep will get you killed.  Taking your time and including various stealth tactics will reward you with survival.  Beating the campaign is pretty hard, pending on what difficulty you play on.  Recruit gives you the feel of the game letting you ease in and take control, Veteran makes you think before you do and plan out your attacks, Elite harder enemies, and mission timing needs to be precise and accurate for a successful mission.\n\nThough this game is old, the core gameplay is great.  GR's today really don't give you that scratch for being an amazing squad leader.  Going back to this game after not playing it since its release sends that great nostalgia and memories back into the brain.  Playing with friends is awesome, letting you play tactically and communicating amongst each other.  Brings back the old days, playing split-screen on the PS2 and Xbox.  This game is worth the money towards it and its DLCs.  Don't forget the large mod pack that's out.

You get shot with one bullet, you either die or get a crippled arm/leg/chest which causes you to lose good aiming in case of arm and cannot run/walk and properly if leg. If you die you will controll another soldier that you've bring with you and that dead soldier will remain dead forever trought the rest of the entire game.\nA.I. is very good, your squad members are not stupid and neither your enemies, even if enemies dont know where you are they'll shoot in the direction of where the shot came from in case you are camouflaged and they'll split and search for you. The game structure is also amazing, you pick the men and weapons you want divided into one to three platoons to execute a mission (you can go alone if you want, one man platoon), when playing you can control the other platoons over the map with many intuitive orders or directly change the soldier you are playing. The soldiers will get awards and medals that reflect their deeds in battle. If you end a mission with an injured soldier he will remain injured unless you let him out of the next couple missions you'll do so he can recover.\nThe weapon sounds and soldier movements are excellent.\nAll of these missions can be done with as many friends you want or play against each other in defensive maps.\n\n10/10 for being realistic and the only of its kind, the other ghost recons are all commercial (brainless shooters like COD and etc) and suck a lot when compared to this first one because thats what sells best.

I've had wonderful history with this game especially since giving little 8 year old kids an original xbox with this game is a wonderful idea. But as I played this when I was little gave me common sense believe it or not to know that a person holding a firearm is a deadly person and to not approach them or even concider conversation with them unless they're millitary "good guys" Anyways off topic. This game is extremely fun with a long ♥♥♥ campaign PLUS DLC which adds onto the overall rating. Also, there is mods out there to make the game even bigger and more fun. I would recommend singleplayer only on this game where I have never been able to play the multiplayer version, so if anyone wants to play message me! I love this game.

The attention to detail is present in the story, environments and artificial intelligence. Movement and weapon handling feel tactile and make sense. The strategic aspect of this game works well, allowing you to control up to 3 teams in real time. You are able to move them around the environments and adjust their rules of engagement. Enemy A.I. is generally quite smart and is fully capable of eliminating you and your soldiers. They will flank when you least expect it, toss grenades at you, take cover, suppress you, assume better positions, etc.\n\nMost missions in the 15 part sequence of events based around the Cold War truly feel like Special Forces military operations that would occur in reality. Most importantly, you feel involved, and that these missions you are carrying out are only a small contribution to a much larger war effort. Ghost Recon allows you to choose 6 or less Green Berets and/or specialists of various backgrounds (military and ethnic) per mission, either rifleman, support, demolition or sniper. These soldiers can be upgraded upon finishing a mission in the fields of team leadership, weapon control, stealth, and physical endurance. Your A.I. companions generally adapt to situations accordingly, meaning that they will take cover and return fire when necessary, or take a better position. So you don't have to worry about Bravo team on the opposite side of the map.\n\nNow, after a long 10+ years of not playing co-op, I am happy to report that emulating LAN with Hamachi works perfectly and is very, very easy to do. Co-op is great fun (obviously,) and if you cannot handle the wrath of the big boys in Eastern Europe by yourself with a buddy, this game allows 7 A.I. soldiers to aid you in accomplishing your objectives. The two expansion packs both contain an 8 mission campaign, set in their respective locations. These are well worth 5 bucks each and I recommend those as well. Owning the expansions opens up the door to an incredible modding scene, which requires a whole new topic of discussion.\n\nIn the end, Ghost Recon hasn't aged a day. The game feels and runs great on modern machines. GR strikes the perfect balance of military simulator and first-person shooter; stripping away the unwieldy mechanics of games such as Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis and ARMA, thus presenting a more polished military tactical shooter (that means fun.) This Tom Clancy series debut remains as intense and immersive as it was when I played it back in 2005. Ghost Recon is authentic, memorable and brilliant. The pinnacle of squad-based battlefield combat. For anyone seeking the real deal, look no further.","October 16, 2013","true","157.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/15300/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Tom Clansy's owned Ghost Recon is a tactical shooter in which you get to control the squad during the mission itself while being able to take control of any of them. Yep, one of realistical tactical, where you die from one shot. It was developed by Red Storm and published in 2001, with being ported onto various consoles in following two years, that are Xbox, GameCube, PS2. And yes, it was made by same people as who made Rainbow Six few years ago, and now they were challenging players by moving action from close-range to long-range open combat. Just like Delta Force, but with fog. And squad tactics.\nAnd yes, it got two more expansion packs that you can buy on Steam as well.\n\nTechnically, well, it's actually fine. Sure, game came out before widescreen monitors happened, but engine can support such resolution and allows you to select it from options. Main menu and such will stay as blocky low-resolution 4:3, but as soon as you get into gameplay, it will switch to what you set in options. FOV however will not increase, so people are still chubby.\n\nNot sure about multiplayer. Never got to playing it and Internet browser in the game itself appears as completely empty. No wind, no tumbleweeds. Perhaps server browser is broken. But as far as I am aware, it's dead. And multiplayer was the main positive point of this game, so we are left with less positive single-player.\n\nSo, the plot is that in 2008 ultra-super-hyper-nationalists come to power in Russia and are now going to conquer and merge with countries that were part of USSR, starting with finding the way to take on Georgia. Funny how game predicted thatin 2008 there will be conflict with Georgia and Russia, though it wasn't the one where Russia is your everyday demonized baddie. Anyway, you then go and take on various mission to kill people and do objectives, being world's judge. Until you beat final mission. And then get thrown into main menu immeditly. Because screw you, it's realistical tactical lack of ending!\n\nGraphics look kinda nice, I dig the enviroment for sure. Death animations do the job. Lack of gun in view is silly though. Music is fine, just randomly placed in main menu and then sometimes playes when somebody in your team dies.\n\nYou got 15 single-players missions to complete and boy, it's not going to be easy. And it wasn't supposed to be easy. As fun as it could be. Anyway, you look at the map which doesn't tell you about verticality, then pick your platoon out of 6 members, that is divided into 3 squads, each having max to 3 people. Mind it, you can order only to whole squad, so better keep specialized people, like sniper, in separate special squad. And Demolition for enemy armor and mission objectives. And Support for having big magazine. But mostly riflemans. You can actually auto-assign people, and game handles it well, even though it never picks anybody from Specialist category. Who are powerful soldiers who may even have unique weapons.\nYou can get Specialists by completing bonus objective. Where game can screw you up, because it ends mission as soon as either you done all main objective or if killed all enemies if last objective was moving to extraction point. That, and soldiers who died in battle will not reappear. At least they level up between each mission.\n\nAnd so you will run, you will walk, you will duck and crawl toward enemy, to get into position to shoot them all. Well, mostly running, otherwise you will run out of patience on these big maps covered in fog. And lean around. And notice threat indicator at the bottom of the screen showing red. And snipe enemies. Who will then run toward trees and hide and wait for a moment to lean around and put bulets into your dumb AI teammate. Who you will thankfully kill first. Until you realize that somebody threw grenade and you will be hopelessly trying to switch to each member and micro-manage them to run away. But they all die and so you restart mission as you don't want to have even less soldiers to pick in next mission.\n\nA thing to note, is the way that they did aiming thing. You see, unlike other games, the aiming will drop when you are turning around. Actually, turning around punishes you more than just walking slowly! As a result, it makes flanking more important in this game.\n\nWith no planning phase for giving actual order, like in Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon lets you control team during gameplay. Just bring out the map, choose the squad, and click on a map, setting waypoint and where they are supposed to look. Then erase it and do it again, as map UI seems to be unreliably at selecting the team for some reason. But at least I prefer to be able to do it during gameplay. You can also set rules for each team, one for movement: Stop, Move but stop if being supressed, Move at any cost. And rule of engangement: Recon, shoot only if shot back, which is good for ordering troops to get into good position around enemy point. Assault, shoot accurately, sometimes, which is good when on the move and don't know where enemy is. And Supress, which makes them trigger-happy, good when you set them to defend or assault from one position.\n\nAnd well, now that you wonder what tactics there are, here is what to expect: Always come from unexpected side. If you need to assault inner building, then switch to soldier on one side, kill one enemy, switch to soldier on opposite side, kill another enemy and so on.\nAs far squad tactics, well, they aren't reliable. But expect to use them to cover your flank. And sometimes to assault base while staying in one position. And moving people them around on map to get closer to objectives, so you could then control a soldier from squad, with others being like your "lives".\n\nYep, AI teammates aren't reliable and soon you will feel divided. As it turns into mix of FPS action and Strategy game where you can't trust either part. Because sometimes AI can actually save you, but it's rare. Most often you will be wondering why your squad keeps being wiped out, then quickload and see person ignoring 9 sneaking soldiers, after all he is behind tree, he is INVINCIBLE!\nThe fact that command map shows no verticality in level means you will have to manually position them anyway, often.\n\nOh, and yes, I said quickload. Which means that there is quicksave. Which means that you can shove tactics into armor's rear and quickscam your way to the victory! No, really, Rainbow Six or Delta Force never allowed you to do it. But I guess that this cheapness counter-balances against the game's cheap difficulty where enemies can always aimbot you up. For knowledge is the main decision point in this game, and if you know what to expect, you don't need to crawl. You come in and kill all ten of them. Quickloading many times to get out from ambush.\n\nAnd let's be honest. Most of people who praise the game had it as the first game. And others who praise it do it because of how difficult it is. Mostly of how you can die randomly easily. And thus is somehow makes you feel better if you somehow manage to pull though. Not sure, I didn't feel anything like this, just a chore. Because well, when I died, I didn't feel that it was always fair, thus I just didn't care and reloaded a save.\n\nBut I still can recommend the game. Well, not fully. Mostly above average. Because sometimes it works and makes you feel rewarded for positioning your team properly. Other times, it just screws you.\nActually, when you just play some missions separately - it's a blast of trying to survive and setting good positions and tactics! Then there are some missions that feel messy and less fun. Look, stealth mission! It's just that main campaign, which makes me feel that I must be overprotective as it punishes you if your soldier dies by not having him in next missions, is where I just start to abuse quicksaves and grind it and get impatient.","September 25, 2015","true","19.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

I recommend this to everyone who seeks a challenging and strategic type of shooter. However it is recommended that beginners play the training mission first.\n\nIn Ghost Recon you have to be careful before you take each step. It's like being a soldier in real life, where if you run out in the open you'll get spotted and shot within seconds. Enemies are often equipped with camo suits so they can hide themselves between trees, bushes and dirt. The same realism applies to the damage dealt by weapons, most of the time kills are achieved with 1 shot (except if you hit arms or legs).\n\nAlthough the game is based on levels, the map design makes it feel almost like a sandbox game. There are always many ways to complete the objectives. Not to mention that the quality of the foliage and nature environment is phenomenal for the date the game came out. There are also different classes and weapon sets that you can choose, which means variety in your playing style. In most games where you choose a class, you can only do that in multiplayer. You can also boost the stats of your soldiers after every mission, which in my opinion makes it a little more balanced because of the AI being challenging.\n\nDefinitely recommended.","December 29, 2015","true","13.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","1"

Especially, I liked the multiplay mode playing in the large field. Compared to today's FPS, this game feels competely different in combat. Due to the characteristic field of view, you always feel like being a sniper even with an M4 assault rifle. Due to this, there were a lot of campers online in those days. Nevertheless, camping in this game makes sense because Ghost Recon is made for that. When I was playing online in those days, no one got mad for camping because everybody knew that it's the basic strategy of this game and if you keep running around in the field you simply get shot. Probably, you would have to spend being prone all the time and move like Big Boss in MGSV to get closer to enemies. It sounds boring for some of you but if you like the movie "Sniper" (1993), you would love this game even today. It would be difficult to play the multiplay mode today, but the singleplay mode is still enjoyable since the enemy AI are extream sharp shooters wtih AK-47. Don't play this game like Call of Duty. Just take time as much as you like to complete the missions. That's how you truly enjoy this game.","May 19","true","20.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I could remember the old Windows 2000 computer powering up, and the big screen box with the visible pixelated graphics. Playing Ghost Recon on that computer was the best childhood i had... Because there was nothing like it either before or after. (Besides the release of Rainbow Six up until Lockdown came which, in my opinion, was a total piece of ♥♥♥♥ for the PC.) The wide open spaces created fear to both me and my friends of getting shot from God knows where. The slow pace of it all forced you to tread carefully, instead of taking a run-and-gun approach. The multiplayer was fantastic. I remember playing with a couple of my friends (as well as fiends, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and pure disgusting enemies just to prove it could beat them at something,) over LAN and Internet once I got this game, and it was great. We usually play coop, since that was the main point of the game, but we also game a try of the converseriel gamemodes (excuse my spelling) and found a whole 'nother world behind it. It was great....\n\nAnd then this came along.... The original game.... The original thing. At first i hesitated to buy it. I knew that all the multiplayer servers were down since the death of gamespy, but that didn't stop me from getting the game and it's expansion roots...\n\nAnd it was just like my childhood. There wer tons and tons of community servers to play on. The gaming was high definiton, rather than the good ol' 2000. Succesful mods gave the game a big bang, not to mention the community servers for those mods. It... was... EPIC!!!\n\nSo i urge you, both Ghost Recon fans and not, to buy this game. It is worth your money and your while.\n\nOh, and a word of advice...\n\nStay the ♥♥♥♥ away from Ghost Recon Wildlands.\n\nThank you","October 3, 2015","true","7.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Expect stellar gameplay with a variety of missions ranging from the jungle to the desert, weapons and customization. The campaign(s) are straight forward with a realistic approach focusing on establishing a democracy in a war-stricken land. The gameplay if a first-person shooter with a few HUD items along with a tactical map on which the player can direct his/her troops. Don't expect to get attached to the characters unless the player renames them after close companions in real life. There is a small skill tree on which the player can update units' skills including "Leadership", "Marksmanship", and more. Once the player's soldier dies in that campaign, they lose him and his skillset forever. There are a few classes to choose from with specialized weaponry corresponding to each class which makes each class valuable in its own respects. The multiplayer is dead, unless the player play it with a friend; unfortunantly, this is where the game shines. Strategizing on the map allows for dynamic gameplay; putting the player and their friends' minds together really makes the player feel as if the player is operating in a real spec ops mission. One of the downfalls to the gameplay has to be the difficulty, I recommend saving often with the "quick-save" and "quick-load" features; one wrong move can put a world of hurt on the player's team. Expect to run this game at a solid-locked 60FPS with ultra-high graphics. There is still a pretty decent modding community providing the player with extra campaign missions including a WWII campaign! Even though this game was made way back in 2000, it is still the most tactical game on my list.\n\nPROS:\n+ Solid Gameplay\n+ 60 FPS\n+ Variety of Mods\n+ Easy Integration of Mods\n+ Great Multiplayer With Friends\n+ Endless Hours of Gameplay\n\nCons:\n- Brutal Difficulty\n- Dead Online Multiplayer","August 24, 2015","true","16.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

What is Ghost Recon? Now it is a series displayed by the corporate greed of Ubisoft and has become a CoD esque action shooter. But, when the first game was released, it was a tactical shooter; you know? The kind where taking 1-3 shots will kill you, where movement is limited and where running in the open was a death wish.\nI am getting off topic. Why do I recommend this game? It's simply the best Ghost Recon, in my own opinion, feel free to disagree with me. But I believe Ghost Recon 1 is the best. The reason for this is its amazing sound design in 2001; real recorded weapons, amazing soundtrack, etcetera. Its heart-poundingly delicious gameplay where if you mess up, a single bullet can end you. So the game has the Dark Souls esque, trial and error system; before Demon Souls was released, might I add. Last but not least, the game still has a tiny bit of multiplayer life left on GameRanger.\nNow for the flaws: The AI can either be stupid, or insanely smart, it fluxuates. The Multiplayer has BARELY any life left, but if you are lucky, you can play an MP game. The graphics are also abysmal; even in 2001 when this game was released, the game had decent graphics, but it wasn't the same as some games at the time; even some on consoles!\nAll in all, this is a MUST PLAY! The game is simply too fun to ignore! I even had a friend who played the demo and became addicted, so much so that I am gifting him his GR soon!

This game is as relevant and riveting today as it was when it first came out. It makes no bones about what it is: A pure tactical simulator, geared toward getting your team out alive and completing objectives from rescuing hostages to full-scale assault on armored patrols.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is that, while it has good singleplayer, the AI of your team cannot often be trusted. Sending the computers into combat situations often results in friendly casualties, meaning it is best to take control of the squad you're sending into battle at one time. This is just my experience of course, but it does hamper you in that you cannot have two teams conquering two objectives at the same time.  However, they can act as sentries if placed right, and will defend points and shoot enemy soldiers with great accuracy, just not while they are on the move.\n\nReally though, this isn't a big issue, all it means is that the missions take a little longer, and even so, time flies when you are having fun!\n\nThe AI of the enemies is very good, and they'll give you a bit of a bite even on recruit.\n\nThis is not an arcade shooter, its a milsim on a tactical level.

Since then the development of military FPS have rocketed away from what was – back in 2001 – quite an advanced game. Both the original game and its expansion packs (Desert Siege and Island Thunder) was built around huge maps, the management of a small team of six soldiers and sharp punishment for not thinking tactically and proceeding with some caution. The enemy had a deadly aim, even if their AI wasn’t always on top.\n\nThen came various games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, Ghost recon Future Soldier and Sniper Ghost Warrior, and more work and less time to play made me give away my Ghost Recon Gold collections box to a friend. It was just by pure chance that I earlier this year suddenly discovered that Steam sold the original Ghost Recon with its official expansion packs for “pennies” and I could not resist buying it. It can be a risky business to return to old pleasures; like a movie or a book, you remember from the past, but I found myself enjoying the gameplay as much as I did back in 2001.\n\nIn addition, with the mods like frostbite and CENTCOM you may have hours of fun. Just forget about the old graphics and focus on the thrill of the mission.\n\nMy advice: Play it on elite difficulty for maximum challenge and fun.\n","August 9, 2015","true","52.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thekelsoo/recommended/15300/","thekelsoo","Tarbomb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thekelsoo/","170 products in account","In my opinion Rainbow Six 3 improved. This is my favorite tactical shoot hands down, even to this day. I can do nothing but recommend this, even to newbies of the genre. It will be hard to get into, and is by NO MEANS like any of the games succeeding it, this is a true squad based tactical shooter and brutally unforgiving, and I mean more than unforgiving.\n\nSo what is it? Ghost Recon (and the accompanying DLC) at its heart is a squad based (six men at once) tactical first person shooter. This means one bullet or so and you die, and the enemy dies. On occasion you may get injured but that is determined by your stats.\n\nThe game revolves around four classes. Support, Rifleman, Snipers, and Demolitions. Each with a wide array of weapons to choose from. You will create a squad of six men and utilize these roles before each mission (there are around 12 missions in the base game, and these missions are LONG, not to mention re-playable) after each completed mission (missions consist of various goals, some optional, optional goals earn you specialists which are basically soldiers that come with new weapons and a higher stat average) each surviving (and trust me, you will have alot of men die) soldier will earn one skill point to spend in four fields. How you spend these skills will let Billy Bob BillyboNilly survive longer on the battlefield, and will be what makes you throw your keyboard to the floor when little red riding hood gets ♥♥♥♥ed trying to peek around a corner, oh wait thank god she's injured now lets just crawl behind thi- Susy no!\n\nSo yeah, I'm sure you get the point behind that. Now, you may be asking, how does the port hold up after so long? Well actually pretty great! The controls are all rebindable, although some things are a little old this is quite easy to get used to. It supports modern resolutions albeit poorly at times, and the menus are all rendered in a very archaic resolution. Squad management works quite well, and the UI is easy to get used to, as well as the map, so it isn't all bad.\n\nAnd what about the gameplay? Well as I have mention this is a squad based tactical shooter, you move quite slowly even when sprinting, and you die incredibly quickly, especially when new. You have to plan out everything, this isn't Battlefield or COD, there is no run and gun aspect here, you run you die. Primarily what you will be doing is organizing your squad and dishing out orders, maybe you'll set up a sniper and a support to go up a hill and provide suppression, while a Demolitionist fires rockets up the enemies ♥♥♥ and two rifleman move upwards and breach a house. Maybe this all goes wrong and you aim that rocket wrong killing poor Roger Rabbit and subsequently attracting the enemies to your position, its all part of the plan, and let me state this. You will have so many stories to tell from playing this game, of plans going wrong to pure moments of bliss.\n\nStory sucks don't pay attention to it\n\nAlso buy the expansions, they add amazing new content and are done right in so many ways.\n\nNow for what is wrong, the enemy AI is at times unfair, you can peek a corner and just get destroyed and it sucks. The Squad AI does hold up well though, and is actually quite competent! Con number two is that some of the ways you use the explosives are wonky and often may get you killed in the beginning until you get used to them (have no fear they are by no means necessary in alot of missions). And that is really all I can think of, the level and map design is supreme and the missions are hectic and keep you on your feet at all moments of the night. Overall this game is the kingpin in my opinion of tactical shooters.","August 1, 2014","true","58.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It brought back so many nostalgic memories for me! I used to play this game back when I had a PS2 and I had a blast while playing it! So when I saw that it was Steam plus it was on sale, I knew I had to buy this game to relive the good old memories! I'll admit this game is hard even on Recuit difficulty but I still was able to beat the game and it was an amazing experience! Anywho I'll break the game down for you fellow gamers out there.\nThe game was released back in 2001 so don't expect beautiful fancy-pantsy graphics like off of Unity Engine games. The game requires a lot of strategy and tactical precision/decision making when you're doing the missions. Don't expect this game to be like Call of Duty: Black Ops because there is no regeneration and when you get shot, you die immediately which to be honest it's pretty realistic. Anyways if you feel if you're up for a fun challenge then I recommend you buying/playing this game and I guaranteed you'll have a blast while playing this game. Ahhh.......... it feels good to relive those childhood memories!

Runs with no issues on Windows 10.\n\nThe graphics and sound still hold up well. The game is showing its age in areas from a gameplay perspective, but never in a way that greatly detracts from the experience provided you can adapt to some of the issues. For example, squad commands are limited and given from an overlay and you can't direct your squad to a position from the first-person view, which is a little clunky. In addition, your squad generally feels like a backup selection of playable characters that tag along with you as opposed to a group of AI you'll feel you can often use tactically and trust to perform without getting themselves killed.\n\nOther issues I had included the way the game occasionally cheap-shots you by spawning a tank or truck full of enemies out of nowhere, which rolls up to your position in complete silence; and whilst the large, open maps still feel unique and fun to play on, you can't climb or step down many hills or cliffs, which tends to limit your tactical ability.\n\nStill, as I said, none of this greatly detracts from the experience as it really never feels hugely misaligned with the gameplay--they're more just indications of the game's age. The atmosphere and intensity remains intact. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a playthrough if you're into tactical shooters.","May 28","true","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In this game you might not feel as if your with a team, but it kinda gives you the sense of how it would feel if you went into combat for your first time. You get shot like two times your dead type of feeling. Thats not the only thing that makes the game so extraordinary. You can send any of your squads into a area to finish off any hostiles, but be warned if you do this, you have a chance of losing a squad or squad members. Every member you pick will get certain stat points so you can build up there weapon handling, stealth, endurance and etc. There are five types of classes you can pick from, Sniper, support, rifleman, demo, and specialists. You can make up to three squads Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie, but heres the cache, you can only have two members if you pick to have three squads. If you pick two squads you can have three members in it. I love that you can pick what type of members you can assign into your squad. The only thing that sucks is that if you get one of your guys wounded they stay wounded when you progress in the game, so they are pretty much dead if they get shot one more time.","May 25","true","27.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Everything looks like everything else; the enemies blend into the backgrounds, as do your own forces. You will spend entire hours manually shifting and manuvering your forces around the maps just for the oppertunity to pull off a dozen killshots or less, most of which your squads may grab before you. Each of your units is equivilant to one life; loose them all, and you lose the scenerio. You also lose some combat effectiveness, but it's so tedious manuvering your squads that sometimes its easier to send one squad scouting around the map until it's slaughtered.

The enemy is as clever as though it's a real person playing against you! Also, your teammates can think for themselves whether or not to shoot, and when to stay in recon mode. The teamates have excellent leadership skills, too!\nAs for Multiplayer, servers don't exist anymore. However, if you have a friend who also plays Ghost Recon, it is fun to host a server and play with them!\nThough an individual ordering system isn't available, group-ordering has never been easier! Teammates choose the shortest road when given orders to assault or suppress, and choose the safest road when given orders to go 'Recon.' A cool part is that the team-leaders show signs with their arms and hands when giving orders, instead of talking!\nThis may be the first Ghost Recon, it may not be as advanced as 'Future Warfighter,' and it may not show a gun on 'First-Person View,' but it's still an investment that is not bad to make!\nMy opinion: Buy the game!\n"Long Live Tom Clancy!"","January 16, 2014","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Players have a map, and a team of men, and must apply critical thinking through mission analysis in order to be successful.\n\nThe game also has an outstanding damage model that still outshines most shooters; A single 5.56mm round will kill, and players can sustain arm and leg wounds that affect their ability to shoot and move. Third person animations also reflect player damage in the form of limping and visible blood stains and gunshot wounds.\n\nThere is also an RPG-like system that allows players to develop their Ghosts and apply personal attributes that will improve their performance.\n\nMy only big gripe is the use of a reticule system instead of a first person weapon. Unlike Ravenshield, there is no on-screen, first person weapon. There are only a series of recitules that can be zoomed in to simulate weapon sights.","July 31, 2012","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/15300/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","Years years ago, when I finally had my second computer (my first computer, that I got back when I had 5 years, was just obsolete at that point), this is one of the games that came with it. And let me tell you, even back then I knew this was a great game. Does it hold up for today's standards though, after SO MANY YEARS? Well, yes. You can keep reading, and find out why, but as usual on my reviews, I'll start with the bad stuff:\n\nSadly, the worst part of the game is also the best part of it: The difficulty. Have you played other FPS games? Back then, FPS games were all about being a generic American hero who could take 9001 bullets, carry over 10 guns at the same time, jump insane distances, run like hell non-stop, and basically be a God. This game was one of those that stopped and did the complete opposite. Enemies die in one or two shots, yeah. And so do yourself. Gameplay is slow, enemies at times come out of nowhere, you get the idea. While people like me would love this, I can tell a lot of people would NOT enjoy it's difficulty at all.\n\nAnother thing that might turn people away are the graphics. Now, while I don't really hate them, the game has not aged well at all on that matter. Leaving how pretty the game is, there seems to be some weird bugs and glitches related to the game and graphics: At times stuff can be seen weirdly clear through the fog, both enemies and allies trying to shoot people through walls, parts of enemies clipping through solid objects and more of the same kind of stuff. Also, while the gameplay can be played in Widescreen, which surprises me for a game this old, the menus run in 800x600, which is just weird.\n\nThe last thing I will complain about this is the AI. Everyone seems to be a bit... Stupid. At times soldiers act in really weird ways, and the enemies can also act in unpredictable r#tarded ways as well. Infact, in the 4 missions I've played so far, I've also gotten teamkilled by my teammates 3 times, because they seem to enjoy using the grenade launchers at close-range. And I'm not even joking with that, the AI really loves that weapon.\n\nAll of that being said, what you have left is a gem that still packs more and better Gameplay than 70€ sh#ts we get today. Just to remind you, this is a game that got close to KILL CALL OF DUTY AND MEDAL OF HONOR (which killed itself anyway, rofl). It's all about being stealthy, taking enemies properly. You have a squad of 6 soldiers, which you can control and jump from one to other if you feel like changing. There are also 4 kind of soldiers, without counting the Specialists, which you unlock by winning missions. You're given liberty to do the missions as you please. Wanna rush them with machine-guns, or rather snipe them one after another? SUIT YOURSELF!\n\nThere's also multiplayer... But well, it's an old game. Good luck finding people to play with. I played once a few years ago with a friend using Hamachi, and it was indeed insanely fun. If you do find people, then you'll enjoy it. People call this "Like the Dark Souls of FPS", but I find that dishonest. It's just what a serious FPS should be, not these sh#tty casul CoD games that you could buy these days. That being said, ignore the sequels. Some of them are decent, but Ubisoft has destroyed it with the Free2play title which is filled with Pay2Win bullsh#t. They deserve no respect for that crap, so play this one instead. It's cheaper, it's better, and it even feels more rewarding.\n\nOh, and you're killing Russians, so you could always go full ♥♥♥♥ and be an idiot, if that's your thing.","October 17, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played this game many times over since the early 2000s, and it still plays great. Even if the graphics are slightly dated, the game play more than makes up for it. You have to be smart and tactical in your approach to combat and as such this game is a rarity nowadays. If you don’t plan the approach, more often than not, you will be spotted and taken out. This is also an open map style game so you can achieve your objectives from many angles, only helping its tactical appeal. Another interesting aspect is the ‘command map’ in which you can control other squads and have them move as a separate entity. Each squad has maximum of three members and you can have 3 squads but a max of 6 total characters. Each of these characters is playable through selecting him or her in the command interface.\n\nThis game truly is the pinnacle of the genre so if you’re not hung up on graphics but are interested in realistic combat, then this is definitely the game for you.","April 2, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good luck and I hope you will have a ton of fun reliving the good old days of Ghost Recon before the pile of ♥♥♥♥ they threw at us.\n\nIf your someone who is all about the graphics this game isn't for you, If you want to play a now old school game then this is a must. If you do buy it and want to team up for a game go ahead and add me.","October 16, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Got this sweet piece of action in steam now, one of my favorite first person shooters going way back. In Ghost Recon you control a squad of 6 or less soldiers, whom can be divided in up to 3 teams. You can build your squad from demolition experts, snipers, support specialists, and if you have completed missions with great zeal, you have access to special soldiers. These units are usually equipped with special weapons and gear (oicw for the win!) and have better stats than your average g.i. Joe. The game contains 15 single players mission in a fictional campaign occurring in east europe, where Nato forces (the good guys) clash with Russian ultranationalists. Also there is some sort of multiplayer available, never tried it out. Great game, although a bit short(?).","August 7, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Have you ever seen a video of an African army in real life fighting? It's quite different then in this game. Instead of fumbling around yelling tribal chants, the army in this game has 100% godlike accuracry. They make the American Sniper dude look like a blind ♥♥♥♥♥. Where are they training these guys? How did Kony 2012 suddenly gain such an overpowerd army?  You will order around your AI team, and they are actually pretty smart considering this game came out over 10 years ago. THe graphics are dated, but they are not that bad. If you don't mind rage quiting and are fond of old memories, pick this game up on sale.","November 27, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pure trial and error. The entire game is a pixel hunt, even if you're a sniper. You will develop eye strain trying to find the small group of 10 pixels that just killed your teammate from halfway across the map. That being said, the game is very rewarding for those who can figure out the correct order of objectives and the 'sweet spots' where you can shoot the enemy but the enemy can't shoot you.","October 24, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
