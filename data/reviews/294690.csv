It has a bigger and more fun cast of characters than most of the Putt-Putt games and there's a bit more problem solving. It's still a very easy 45 minute game for children, but in terms of reliving your early youth, this is one of the ones to pick up.","July 23, 2014","true","1.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child’s first venture into PC gaming.\n\nPutt-Putt Joins the Circus didn’t really stick in my memory like the other titles. Much like Putt-Putt Enters the Race, I was beginning to grow out of these games and I think that is mostly to blame. The Circus is certainly not the best title in the series but it’s definitely better than the Race.","December 2, 2014","true","0.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

I find that the way you get to click on things is absolutely thrilling game-play. I especially like it when Putt-Putt says things like "Wowee-Zowee", because I feel it really adds on to his heroic character. In fact, Putt-Putt is an amazingly deep and fascinating character that I believe he should probably be the star of every video game ever. That said, I would highly suggest this game to anyone looking for a well-rounded and thoroughly entertaining video from start to finish, so get ready to smile and cringe as Putt-Putt goes about his intense quest to join the circus. I'd give it a 7/7 for the quality of the game, and an 8/7 for the artwork.\nAs you can tell this is clearly a real review of the game, and I was most certainly not laughing loudly the entire time I was writing this.","May 27, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Surprise nostalgia. This one doesn't have much randomization to speak of in the slightest but makes up for it with a longer runtime than average, though the puzzles aren't particularly more difficult (they might actually be easier than ever before, really.) Plenty of diverse characters on display too and a pretty decent setting. I found it fun enough, perhaps my favorite of all the humongous games I've been playing recently, so~","August 13, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This plays the same as any other Humongous Entertainment, around an hour worth of game play depending on the randomization of the game's puzzles. Or at least thats true for Saves the Zoo and Travels through Time, where items needed or where you can find certain things is different between play throughs.","November 19, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
