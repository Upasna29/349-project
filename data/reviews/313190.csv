You can even remap up/down mouse so you aren't nosediving when you mean to climb.  Tanks fly up and flip over when blown up.  Don't get me wrong, I love arcade-y helicopter games (Desert Strike, anyone?) but this is definitely on one of them.  Bought it for $0.49 and I regret it.  Why are all these 'Publisher' games on Steam while good games by indies sit in Greenlight?","November 30, 2014","false","0.3"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","24","27","0","0"

I found it to be unplayable with a joystick because there are no dead zone settings and the helicopter is extremely twitchy (at least with my joystick).","December 13, 2014","false","1.0"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"
