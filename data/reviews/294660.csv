Even though I am nearly an adult, I still enjoy and absolutely adore this game.\n\nJust as the name implies, the zoo is in trouble, and it is up to Putt-Putt, along with his pet dog Pep, to help out. From icy terrain to the heart of the jungle, Putt-Putt must save animals scattered throughout the field.\n\nOne of my favorite things to do with each Putt-Putt game is that you can change the color. It's a little feature added to the series, but I always liked how you could paint this little fellow. (I always color him blue).\n\nDespite the dusty years, Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo, and all games for that matter, continues to shine. The memories left behind gives nostalgia a warm welcome.","July 3, 2014","true","0.9"," 63 of 70 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","63","70","2","0"

Its nice to see that older games can come to sites like Steam in order to work on newer computers. This game is very low paced, which is great for smaller children. Its your typical 90's point-and-click game. Most objects that you click make funny actions and sounds. Its a unique feature that you dont see in many games now days. It gives you a smile. It really doesnt last that long, probably lasts about 1 hour at most, but its still somewhat fun. If you have the time,  want to get your child into gaming, or just in the mood to play a low paced game, heres a good game to play.","July 3, 2014","true","0.9"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","49","54","0","0"

These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child’s first venture into PC gaming.\n\nPutt-Putt Saves the Zoo is the pinnacle of the Putt-Putt Franchise. Between that absolutely brilliant opening theme and the best arctic exhibit in all of gaming, Saving the Zoo will forever hold the trophy for best Putt-Putt game of all time in my mind. To this very day I will shamelessly replay this game and enjoy it every bit as much as when I was a child.

When Skeeter the snake told me about the glorious coils of the beyond, I knew I couldnt go back to the man I was. Anyone going into this experience has to know that it is an allegory for modern capitalism in american society. Mr. Baldini represents the man as he tries to suppress the inevitable and glorious proletarian revolution. Im also pretty sure he called me a racial slur. Once you get to the zoo, you are greeted by another ethnic stereotype as "Outback Al" orders you too return the animals he views as his property. This is doubtless a reference to Joseph Conrad's classic work Heart of Darkness, as Im like 90% sure hes a Belgian stereotype. The next pitfall of the borugeiosie scum is the food cart. I spent at least 50 minutes of my playthrough trying to solve the "cheese squiggly" puzzle. After that I met the monkies, who enjoy jazz and hanging out in trees. I tried using the rope to no avail. I dont want to spoil the entire game, so i'll only give you one last juicy tidbit of advice; To get the best ending, be sure to save the hippo instead of the snake. Only that way can you use his skin on the final boss. All in all, 4/10 it was ok I guess.","January 29, 2015","true","1.8"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","87","40","46","49","0"

I looked through all the choices and saw most of my favorite Humongous titles, buying each one. However, much to my sadness, I did not see Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo, which happens to be my all-time favorite. Ever since that day, I periodically checked Steam to see if they'd ever put it up and sure enough, today, I saw it and instantly bought it! I couldn't be happier! The game still stands the test of time and is as great as I remembered it! The style, the voice acting, all the little stuff you can do and listen to... It's perfect. Thank you Humongous for bringing me so much joy as a kid AND an adult. I'm so glad I know the good that you did in the early 90s and I think it helped me and many others become better people.\n\nAnd thank you Steam for bringing these joyful, colorful games to your roster.

Everything about this game screams quality and adventure. A much improved third-person view, amazing music, a living breathing world, a menu-system that's amazing and a game filled with interesting stuff to do. Truly a masterpiece.\n\nThe dynamicness and sheer volume of random quests means that the open world aspect is never the same thing twice. And if you forgo the linear main quest and faction quests to craft your own adventure, the games replayability value increases ten fold. However, I would issue a warning to my fellow low graphic computer folk. The fade in and out range of enemy NPC's and whatnot can make this game extra challenging if you prefer the stealthy approach to combat. Nevertheless, it can be compensated for with sufficient wit and guile on your part.\n\nPros:\n-Stunning visuals\n-Vast landscapes to explore\n-There's just so much to do\n-So much detail in the game\n-NPC's feel very much like individuals\n-Quests have their own interesting storylines\n-Great soundtrack. (Always sets the atmosphere perfectly)\n-Great voice acting\n\nCons:\n-Bugs (They are pretty rare)\n-Fairly repetitive dialogue (Understandable considering the amount of things in this game.)\n\nTLDR: It's the best game I ever played, and I would recommend everyone to buy it. It formed the basis for games like Skyrim, GTA and Final Fantasy.   10/10","June 21, 2015","true","2.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","69","11","16","11","0"

The animation, writing, sound quality, art style, and almost every other element of these games just looks and feels SO much better than even the games that were released 1 or 2 years earlier.\n\nAs a result, this game is actually not too bad.  Yes, it's still a kid's game, so it's not exactly challenging or even super interesting for us adults, but it's still pretty fun if you are playing it for the nostalgia.  If you missed the HE bandwagon as a kid and want to see what the fuss is all about... well, personally I would skip Putt-Putt altogether, because the other series are a lot more fun for anyone over 8 years old.  Regardless, this game is still pretty charming, and I think that most people can enjoy themselves even without nostalgia to provide extra hype.","March 27, 2015","true","0.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Each of the six animals needs an item to rescue and it's not as linear as the other games... even if it's a 45 minute long game for children. This one is a big step up from the first two, which I still do like. It has a pong/hockey minigame that's the first kinda fun minigame in the Putt-Putt series! This was also the first Putt-Putt to make me legitimately laugh at a dumb joke as an adult.

Of the ones I played back then, this one was also probably the biggest time sink.  I just played it in about an hour, which included playing the story, taking photos, and mucking about with the mini games.\n\nThe game is pretty self explanatory, but regardless: Putt-Putt has to save the zoo by helping the animals find their places.  Of course, this might have some adults raising their eye brows, as you likely come ot realize that not only is the actual zoo keeper oddly unorganized, but the zoo seems fairly hazardous to a visitor's health between the swing entrances, accidents, etc.\n\nBetween exploring the areas, clicking on everything, playing the games, and more you could spend quite a bit of time with your child on this game.  The main point of the game is teaching about the animals, clearly, along with some problem solving skills (How do you warm something up?  How do you fix something that is broken?).\n\nAlso, when it comes to the credits, don't exit immediately.  Just as with the rest of the game, there are things in the credits for a player to click on, to hear noises, watch animations, and even see the people behind the voices of the game.","July 29, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But I was solely disappointed.\nNot only can you not drive in this game, but you can not do burnouts OR skids. You are a deranged car with a mouth and eyes with a dog in the back.\n\nYou click on areas and your flamboyant car drives to that location in the most UNCOOL way ever. The car spins like its made of jello then flies to the direction with a dumb smile on its face. The voice actor for this car is also extremely annoying, I turned off the sound and tried putting on subtitles but I couldnt find how to do it so I guess these developers hate deaf people and dont want them playing their garbage racing game where you cant even race.\n\nSo you might be asking "Well it has cars in it, what type of racing game is it?"\nI'll tell you: None. It's not a racing game at all! The racing is replaced with click movement, the power-ups is replaced with an inventory. The inventory, you ask? Well it is basically like the trunk of the car, but since the car doesn't have a driver (which makes no damn sense) he has to have hooks installed so that he grabs stuff. Why not just have a driver? The incompetent writing doesn't stop there though.\n\nNot only is there no action, or subtle sexual undertones; but there is also no words to describe how bad this game is.\n\nThe only people that would like this game are fat losers, because theyve got fat loser trucks in the game too.\nNot one relatable character. I searched high and low for a sick army truck with slicked back hair or even a surfer truck but NOTHING relatable to their core gaming audience was even found.\n\nFinal Score: I give this game 3 out of 10 brooms. Broom broom broom! (Revving the engine)\n\nIf you want to go REALLY fast try out the new Need for Speed™ game on Origin™, for the low, low price of $49.99 USD.","April 1, 2015","false","61.2"," 32 of 97 people (33%) found this review helpful 87 people found this review funny","33","32","97","87","5"

The way the narrative strives to socially commentate on all of the world's worst issues and it's incredibly accurate depiction of war and poverty is only the beginning of why this game deserves Game of the Year Edition 1995. My particularly favourite scene was the delivery of a very powerful line by Putt Putt as he says "I'll have some Cheese Squigglies, please". You can just tell how much emotion the voice actor put into this role considering Putt Putt has been suffering from PTSD since the aftermath of "Putt Putt Joins the Parade".

This Bioware game used to be an Xbox 369 exclusive, but now it's on PC (with mod support).\n\nThe Story:\nAfter waking up to finding his father murdered, Putt-Putt goes on a daring mission to find out who killed her dad. The story puts Kill la Kill to shame. I highly recommend it for fans of horror and romance.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nA lot of people compare this game's combat to CS:GO, but this game was actually the first FPS game ever made. You can also 360 MLG Trickshot some scrubs, but that takes serious skill. I constantly practice this game with my friends. I even landed a triple collateral once.\n\nThe Verdict:\nBuy this game. This game is up there with classics such as Dream Lights 2: Electric Boogaloo, and Carl on Duty: Black Cops.","October 26, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
