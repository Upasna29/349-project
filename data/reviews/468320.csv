Their idea of a fun level is giant chunks of the coarse awkwardly disappearing and re appearing while you power up your shot. Multiplayer is only local, because that is a ♥♥♥♥ing thing somehow in 2016. Camera angle is fixed and awkward and you have to click a ready up button for each hole. dumb","May 11","false","0.3"," 274 of 286 people (96%) found this review helpful 80 people found this review funny","96","274","286","80","15"
