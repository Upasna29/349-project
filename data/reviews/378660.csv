Featuring a real life tough-as-nails protagonist who was literally cut from the cloth of the Noire genre, Elliot Ness, the man responsible for bringing down the notorious mob boss Al Capone with his group of untouchables.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=487116956\nThe Noire genre is often characterized by wise-cracking cynical tough guys who often find themselves embroiled in incredibly bleak situations and Blues and Bullets hits the ground running right from its opening moments which feature missing children locked up in what looks like someones underground dungeon. With one of the children managing to escape from their holding cell the gamer is then given the opportunity of trying to save one of the other children or make a bolt for it. Suffice to say it doesn't end particularly well and sets up a disturbing and dismally bleak opening for what is looking like 2015 slow burn for the year.\n\nWhile the Noire genre is often criminally under-looked when it comes to gaming what does exist in this cannon is all of top notch quality. Some of the best games ever released come from this genre - Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father, Grim Fandago and L.A. Noire immediately spring to mind - so it would appear A Crowd of Monsters have their work cut out for them if they wish to join this esteemed club but based on the first episode of Blues and Bullets I have no doubt whatsoever that they won't achieve the same kind of critical plaudits the above mentioned games all received if they can keep this kind of momentum going in future episodes.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=486923915\nTaking on the role of retired cop Elliot Ness the player is pulled into a world of kidnapping and sacrificial murder when he accepts the job from his former nemesis Al Capone, whose granddaughter has been one of the children kidnapped. While the first episode starts out slowly things soon pick up when you come across the first murder victim whose life has been brutally snuffed out and it is left up to you to scour the site for clues that tell you exactly what happened and hopefully lead you further down the rabbit hole. The investigation portions of the game play out very much like MURDER: SOUL SUSPECT where you search for clues and then arrange them into a sequence that makes sense. It's a simple process of investigation but effective. The game also does spice things up every now and then by plunging our former hero into gun-battle situations but thankfully these are not overused since this is the kind of game where the narrative needs to remain within focus and not get bogged down by its own game mechanics.\n\nBlues and Bullets is also one of the most visually arresting games to come along in a long while. Captured entirely in black and white with splashes of red that literally cause many of the scenes to pop immediately reminded me of Sin City. I absolutely adored the art style and as Elliot Ness moves from one location to the next there are enough "WOW" moments to keep the player pushing on for more. I particularly loved the gun battle where Ness's thoughts where visualized as words dropping from the sky in which he could take cover from behind while shooting a host of baddies. This was without a doubt one of the absolute highlights of the first episode and something that almost left me speechless in the way it was delivered. Blues and Bullets also comes with a stirring bluesy soundtrack that is worth picking up alone. Having the voice actor who reprised Geralt of Rivia in all The Witcher games taking on the role of Elliot Ness was also a stroke of genius because his voice seems tailor made to fit that of the legendary law man.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=487108002\nNot everything is perfect though. Elliot Ness's pacing seems a little off and it takes some getting used to his walking speed which feels like you are controlling the worlds oldest turtle. Animations can also come off as incredibly stiff and the lipsync feels like it needs a bit more work but honestly these are just nitpicks because Blues and Bullets is shaping up finely to be one of this years greatest adventures. Who knows - maybe one day when the whole season has run its course it can sit proudly with the likes of Gabriel Knight and Grim Fandango. Here is holding thumbs it does. Fans of episodic adventure games rejoice because there is a new possible classic on the horizon!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","July 26, 2015","true","3.5"," 145 of 174 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","145","174","8","15"

This is a Noir/Detective game that has similar gameplay to Life is Strange and LA Noire. What you do is that you are a detective by the name of Eliot Ness, the former leader of the Untouchables as you look for clues as you uconver the mysteries of a missing girl.\n\nVISUALS\n\nThe visuals are amazing in a indie Unity title. You might of never even knew it was a Unity game until you saw this post because even I had to do some digging to find this out. The game has a black/white look to it with a splash of red just like the movie Sin City. The game's overall design really reminds me of Bioshock 1 with its classic look but with it's own originality. The enviornment down to the models have been done beautifully. You would of never thought this was made by such a small team. This game is true art.\n\n\nStory\n\nThe story is riddled with the mafia, murder, and mystery. What can I say? It is simply amazing. The first episode of the game as stated by developers took "150 pages" to write up. The story lets you chose what you want to say and how you want to act during certain situations giving the player choice and to be able to put themselves in the shoes of Eliot Ness. The story is filled with refrences to Film and video games, its just brilliant to me how well this was put together. You will be surprised what this mystery turns into as you play Episode 1.\n\n\n\n\nSOUND\n\nThe voice actors do an amazing job in this game, never did I sit there laughing at a bad performance. The actors do a great job representing their role within the game world. The soundtrack is actually exclusively written by a blues muscian from my research into the game which is really cool. The opening track was written just for this game and honestly it sounds AMAZING.\n\n\nHonestly I give it a 9/10 for Episode 1\n\n\nCheck it out :)","July 23, 2015","true","3.5"," 77 of 83 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","77","83","6","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/378660/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Blues and Bullets is an episodic alternative history noir game developed by A Crowd of Monsters. The first episode was released in July 2015 with the second due to be released in March of 2016.\n\nI will keep this review updated with each chapter I complete.\n\nGameplay takes place in third person as you control Eliot Ness, the police officer who caught and locked up the great, Al Capone. Eliot has now retired from being a cop and runs his own diner, called Blues and Bullets.  This game reminded me quite a bit of L.A Noire as you search for clues for a crime. There is only one crime scene to investigate in this episode but it is a gruesome one at that. There is a small element of gun play, which is very basic at best; it is done via an “on rails” mechanic similar to that of Time Crisis or Blue Estate. The gun play so far has a very small part to play in the game overall.\n\nGraphically, the game is represented in a black and white noir style visual. This art style just looks awesome, whilst the graphics themselves aren’t stunningly good, the black and white tricks your eyes into thinking it is better looking than it actually it. The animation is slightly on the poor side, but nothing that can’t be ignored.  Eliot is voiced by none other than Doug Cockle (the voice of Geralt from the Witcher franchise), and the rest of the voice acting is all done to a very high quality.\n\nI was completely hooked onto the story right from the start of the game, there isn’t a slow ramp in excitement like most adventure games like this, and you get right into the nitty-gritty from the get-go. The ending of episode 1 leaves you wanting more as the plot takes a huge turn of events. There are plans for there to be another 4 episodes released, I am hoping they speed up the development cycle of them, as I think 9 months between episodes is a bit too much in my opinion.\n\nThere isn’t any aspect of difficulty in episode 1, the only real puzzle can be completed with just a matter of trial and error and the gun play scenes have checkpoints at every corner so even if you do die, you don’t have to replay a whole lot of content. I am looking forward to see how they make the gameplay elements of this game have more of a challenge in future episodes.\n\nEpisode 1 took me just about two hours to complete; this was with finding all interactable objects throughout the scenes to get an achievement. I found out at the end of the chapter, that finding all of these objects unlocks a “Bobble head” mode, which is always a classic cheat mode that used to be included in game. It will be interesting to see whether you can activate this mode in future episodes or whether it is only to be used in episodes you have already completed!\n\nSadly I did have a couple of technical problems with Blues and Bullets. I suffered two random crashes of the game that took me straight back to desktop, with no error message or warnings. There were no signs that the game was suffering performance issues, it did only happen when completing a scene, never mid gameplay. Thankfully the game saves at the end of each scene you complete, but this does leave room for game save file corruption.  The game can be played with keyboard and mouse; normally for third person view games I opt for a keyboard and mouse controls, especially ones with any form of gunplay, sadly I could not do it with Blues and Bullets. Firstly the onscreen controls do not show any keyboard controls; only Xbox controls. Secondly, the cursor in game has a fairly big glitch where it just shows as a blank white square. You have to move your cursor to the bottom right hand corner of the screen for it not to be visible even when using a controller.\n\nTo sum up, Blues and Bullets is so far a very interesting adventure game that has a lot of potential. Hopefully the technical problems are cleaned up before the next release of the series comes out. If you are a fan of the Noire themed films and games, this game is definitely going to be for you. It’s a fairly quick paced game which is something that a lot of adventure games can’t boast about so even the casual players amongst you will definitely get some enjoyment here.\n\nIf you are on the fence about the game still, you can purchase just episode 1 for £3,99 which should give you a good amount of content to see whether you will enjoy the rest of the series, provided the developers don’t change it drastically or you can purchase the complete season for £14,99. Right now I would be completely happy paying £14,99 for this season, it does a lot of things right and the only negative points are technical problems which will hopefully be patched in the future.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Just perfect.\n\nMusic  8 of 10\nThe music is consistent with the era the setting takes place , think of 1920ies. Jazz tunes and so and classical suspense background music and sounds. Really nice.

Getting approached by a strange yet familiar character while on shift at the local diner brings an opening to get back into the game and bring some justice to his small piece of the world.\n\nOpening episode was like a good book, hard to put down page turner that ended with a bang leaving you wanting more. Similar to the telltale series a playthrough will take around 2hrs. While movie-like by nature, you do receive tasks to arrange a puzzle-board containing collected photographic evidence along with including some interesting albeit easy gunplay segments. Would like to see more options with dialog choice in future eps and perhaps open areas up for further exploration. Given some of the detail a lot of it felt glossed over and short lived.\n\nPerformance issues seems to have been fixed as of last patch, check the forums to be sure. Gamepad would be suggested but keyboard/mouse is managable, No controls needed to be mapped so the option was not available. Resolutions scaled upto 4k+ and the game provided several presets for shadows and otherwise, should run on a range of systems.\n\nWith aesthetics that seem inspired by Sin City/Max Payne, wonderful soundtrack and great voice work from memorable characters including Capone himself. Blues in Bullets is a series worth recommending taking a look at, just don't expect much of a challenge.

Some choices you make might matter in next episodes, so think wisely. No puzzles, other than a murder scene where you have to complete the puzzle of the murder. A shooting action scene, that is pleasant enough and a few QTEs that are easy enough and just add to the tension of the moment.\n+ Good duration for an episode, seemed longer than a telltale one, especially if you take your time and examine everything it's around 3 hours.\n\n- Very slow pace at the beginning, even for an adventure game.\n- Hope next episodes will add more to the gameplay variety, especially puzzles (that will be relevant to the story though).\n\nBlues and bullets seemed like another story driven adventure game that lacked something vital gameplay wise, like most adventure games that come out these days. But after the first half or so, the game started to shine, especially the murder scene was incredible, although a bit brutal and morbid, so children beware. Dark game in all aspects, in the same level of quality as telltale games or the recent life is strange.

For Episode 2 review, see here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/384380/\n\nIn a world where you can find hotels in the sky and mob bosses in submarines..., well, eeer, let me rephrase that. In a world where Eliott Ness stepped down as a cop and opened a diner, he's contacted by an old friend to help him to find a member of his family. But it seems that the clues are pointing you towards something more darker than it seems...\n\nThe game is an episodic one, so only the first is released now and setting the story. The opening is showing children captive of a strange sect/cult/maniac. You're taking the control of a little girl first before switching to Ness. Even if for now, the plot needs more explanation (because it's the first episode), you're directly thrown into that dark world and waiting for more after that cliffhanger.\n\nAnd the gameplay is similar to Telltale: you choose your answer, you make decisions that will influence the story (though I'm waiting for the rest of the episodes, because I've chosen to be the gentle and helping player and not the bitter or bad one). You have also some Quicktime Events, though they're not the core of the gameplay.\n\nBut contrary to any Walking Dead or The Wolf is Among Us - I don't know for the other series -, you're also having some shooting sequences (you cover, you aim, you place your crosshair on the bad guy and you shoot) in a pure rail shooter ambiance. You have also the Clue Mode and the Investigation Board when you need to find what happened earlier: you look at the clues, you find the number required in order to be thorough and you're putting the right clue in the right place on your Investigation Board (though I don't know the English name as my interface was in French).\n\nThe real strong point is probably the graphics: everything is in black and white, apart for every item that may be in red (blood, carpets, lipstick, clothes, etc etc..). Even at one moment, you get a rail shooter sequence between words that appear! Everything is made to put you into a dark ambiance. The soundtrack is also very good, very '40 - '50.\n\nAnd I'm very impatient to discover the second episode. That game has a huge potential. It's really enjoyable, even if you're not in an open world.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/378660/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","I do not really review episodic titles without having all episodes at hand with a complete walkthrough. With Blues and Bullets I did an exception as the title with its heavy noir atmosphere kept calling me. "A Crowd of Monsters" made an interesting and enjoyable game and I'm sure we'll hear more about them in the future.\n\nIn the center of the game we have Eliot Ness who is based on the real Eliot Ness - an agent who enforced the Prohibition in the early 20th century and was famous for being part of the so-called Untouchables, a group tasked with getting Chicago rid of its corruption and - most notably - putting Al Capone behind bars. Here, the story is fictionalised - Eliot has already retired when he gets a visit from one of Capone's henchmen. The kingpin wants to bury the hatchet and offers the agent a job most unexpected: finding his granddaughter as Sofia Capone was kidnapped.\n\nThe game is completely monochrome to provide full immersion into its noir-esque world - safe for some objects / areas that stand out due to their vivid, red colours. These either highlight story-related (important) characters or interactable objects or just represent cosmetics (such as Eliot's red tie). Flames also appear in their natural colour - still, I found the game a little dark so I suggest you increase the brightness a little. Too bad there are not many graphics options in the menu - they could have really toned down on the lens flare.\n\nThe accompanying music and voice acting are both excellent. Eliot's voice I immediately recognised - he is voiced by none other than Doug Cockle (Geralt of Rivia in the Witcher series). The rest of the cast are also really good - the game offers a film-like experience and the slow but interesting detective sequences get replaced by fast-paced shoot-outs with exploding barrels and Tommy gun wielding goons.\n\nThe game is similar to any Telltale games: we interact with objects, pick between conversation options and sometimes make choices. Unfortunately, similarly to any Telltale games we are almost always led to believe that picking the other answer during our next playthrough will yield different results. Another Telltale similarity - the main menu shows our choice in each chapter and we can check how we fared compared to the rest of the gaming community.\n\nI didn't like how the camera worked in the game. It moves along a set route which limits the places we can go. It makes it a tad bit difficult to notice all the interactable objects. A little more freedom in the detective sections could have been better. As for the detective sections - each episode contains a relative big section with explorable rooms. Interacting with each object and their parts (e.g. opening a suitcase and checking its contents by rotating it in every direction) allows us to complete the board; Eliot's questions that should be answered by picking the right clue.\n\nThis is a great game! I do not believe we have many in the noir genre; for Blue and Bullets many talented developers and artists assembled. The game, at this point, has only one letdown for me: the release date of its episodes. Episode 1 came out last (2015) summer while the 2nd one only this spring. And we have 3 more episodes to go on. At this rate this does not bode well; hope they can cut down on the difference and bring the series to full fruition this or early next year.\n\nPS: The the rest of the episodes (3-5) will be reviewed later after their release.","May 16","true","6.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The textures are detailed enough, but the animation can get a bit unrealistic at times.  For the best graphics experience, go to Options and make sure the graphics settings are set to your native resolution. When I started the game it chose a lower resolution for me and I didn't realize it until I had finished the game!\n\nThe game plays like a TellTale adventure game (e.g. Walking Dead). You partake in dialog choices and there are a few real time action events where it's basically a Simon Says reflex test to press the correct keys within a certain time. There's also a shooting mode where you get to aim and shoot at certain targets.\n\nAn  interesting feature this game has is a clue-deduction system. There is one murder scene where you collect clues and finally link them all up in a kind of mental branching whiteboard. It's quite easy really, once you have all the clues. Much simpler than in the Sherlock Holmes Crimes and Punishment version where the wrong clues can lead you to the wrong conclusion. The game will block you from using the wrong clue.\n\nStory-wise, it's pretty good for a crime mystery but I feel Chapter 1 is too short. However it's got me interested enough that when Episode 2 comes out I'll definitely play it.\n\nConclusion: Decent game, unique look, but I think it's still not as good as The Wolf Among Us's Chapter 1. Although I enjoyed it, I'd advise buying only Chapter 1 first to see if it's to your taste.","October 10, 2015","true","2.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

In many ways, it's a solid example of how an episodic game should be handled.\n\nThe game is set in an alternate history version of 1955, where famed Untouchable Eliot Ness has since hung up his gun and opened a diner called Blues and Bullets in the fictional Californian city of Santa Esperanza. Infamous gangster Al Capone is out of prison after 19 years, but rather than come after Ness, he buries the hatched and hires him to find his missing granddaughter, Sophia, who was kidnapped very recently. Whether Capone has mended his ways or not remains questionable, but Ness, whose career as a cop ended with an unsolved series of missing child cases in the 1930s, is willing to set aside their differences to solve a case that has haunted him for two decades.\n\nThe game's monochrome noir art style is excellent, and the added red and warm hues in parts gives it a very artsy flair that reminds me of Schindler's List. The story is very heavy in this game and there is plenty of drama, but for all the scenes where you aren't blowing away badguys in an insane fire fight, you'll be drawn into the characters and the colorful world around you. Your choices do drive the story to a point, and what's really neat is that you can see how the choices you make compare to those of other players.\n\nThe gun fighting...Oh boy. There's A LOT of over-the-top fighting, particularly once you get into Episode 2. One of the mobsters even makes the sort-of fourth wall breaking remark "Come on! There's only two of them!" which plays off the trope of how one or two people can somehow kill a small army all on their own. Still, it's over the top, but it's really, really fun.\n\nEpisode 1 will set the stage for you quite well, and introduce you to the game's system of solving mysteries, and Episode 2 will really delve into the backstory of some of the other characters.\n\nThe only mechanical flaw I encountered was when running the game at 3840x2160 (4K). For some reason, the crosshairs on the gun in the action scenes felt "off" and the gun was not firing at what I was aiming at. Reducing the resolution back to 1080p fixed this issue, so it seems the game was designed with 1080p (or less) in mind. Hopefully this will be fixed in Episode 3. That, and some sluggish controls in places were the only real faults I found.\n\nOverall, if you like a good story and dig a nice detective noir drama, you really should get "Blues and Bullets." With three more episodes to go, there's plenty to look forward to!\n\nFrom a scale of 0 to 10, where 5 is "average," this game rates in as:\n\n==========================\nVERY GOOD...... 8.5 / 10\n==========================\n\n\nGameplay videos of Episodes 1 and 2:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5FwRA3mozA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2FkosZ69QU","May 27","true","7.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

This time we're going way back to the prohibition days, in an alternative-history story! Blues & Bullets is an Episodic Adventure a-la TellTale games. Blues and Bullets certainly brings it's own style to the emerging genre though, and seems to be building up into a pretty good game.\n\nVideo Review (Where I butcher the name?!?!):\nhttps://youtu.be/-lASZ4i0XQ8\n\n(Press Copy/Serial Key provided via Dev/Publisher of Title)\n\nMy takeaways are as follows:\n\nPositives-\n\n+ Good immersion and set/background visuals\n+ Fitting Soundtrack, also helps capture the era\n+ Very engaging story\n+ Plays out like a very good movie/show\n+ A pretty fun Shoot-Out sequence!\n\nNegatives-\n\n- Character graphics are sub-par and frankly, a bit rough\n- Camera is stiff in locations to essentially hide the ugly/non-existent parts of levels\n- Lost my progress after upgrading from Episode 1 to Full Season (cry)\n\nThe camera thing bugs me, but only so very little and in certain scenes. Even that is a nit-pick. The character graphics could be better, that is not so much a nitpick. This, to me, is the only flaw to the game so far. That, and the fact that I have to start over because my save was erased after upgrading from just Episode 1 to the Entire Season. All in all, Blues and Bullets is a great story and will pull you in. Well worth the money.\n\nVerdict:\n9/10\n\nHappy Gaming!","April 29","true","6.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The characters all have personalities that are portrayed in a great way by the voice actors, none miss the mark.

There are as many abandoned episodic games these days as completed ones, so unless you're Telltale and have a proven track record, you don't get the benefit of the doubt until you've proven you deserve it.  The game has technical problems, and they need to fix it as they do more episodes.  I'm running a GTX 970, which can run most games with no problem, but the scene in the murder house turns into a slideshow, and there are no graphics settings available to turn down.  The sunlight rays coming through the windows cripple performance in that part.  The fixed camera angle and not being able to use the mouse to look at what you want to look at is pretty annoying.  That said, this game looks great, the start ot the story is intriguing, the voice acting is quite good (Geralt of Rivia as Elliot Ness!), so I'll wishlist the rest of the episodes and wait to see if they deliver.","October 10, 2015","true","3.1"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

If your looking for a game that is quite intriguing, throwing past historical characters and events with a new fictional setting and story, and like decision making games then i suggest to check this out. It took me roughly two hours to complete the first episode so that being said if you buy the five episodes for fifteen(on the sale right now) you will get probably around 10 hours of game time which is a good deal( I believe). The art design is rather unique and the voice acting is exceptional but a little spotty with the visual representation at times,the soundtrack adds to the unique feel of the game so i would say it is quite good. BUT, the episodes are taking some time to be released so if you are eager to see the full story in one playthrough you might want to wait for them all to be released. Overall, (based off the first episode) i would give it an 8/10.

The tone is far more fantastic, though. You play a retired cop in a dieselpunk alternate history who gets pulled back into a case, and it's a bloody one. As appears to be the norm with these sorts of games, the controls are absolutely wretched. It's particularly bad in this game due to certain sequences where you need to be very precise; be prepared to spend ages playing the accordion on WASD and randomly waving your mouse around trying to get your crosshair in the sweet spot. If the controls don't make you rage-quit first, you'll enjoy a fairly interesting storyline and an inspired take on the hard-boiled Frank Miller aesthetic. Certainly worth giving the first episode a shot if you're into detective stories or urban fantasy.

Get passed those opening sequences and the game grabs hold of you and doesn't let you go until the end of the credits accompanied by an emotional blues melody.  The game is an episodic noir tale with Bioshock Infinite “Burial at Sea” dlc elements combined with the sort of moody tone of the first season of True Detective,.  On top of that you play as Geralt of Rivia without the Witcher senses.  The art direction is wonderful too!  Right when I thought I had seen all that the episode had to offer, it surprised me with some great aesthetic decisions that made me giddy.\n\nSome cons.  At first the dialogue is rather stilted.  Don’t get me wrong: the voice acting is wonderful.  It’s the pacing of the dialogue that is stilted, and the animations are rough.  But this is common in video games given the way sound bytes are edited.  Can’t be too picky.  You get used to it very quickly though.  Other than that….the experience is great!

The devs are Spanish so maybe they did it because they didn't feel comfortable enough to do Chicago, regardless its fine) where in Al Capone survived his time in jail and enlisted his old nemesis retired G-Man turned diner owner Elliot Ness to find his kidnapped granddaughter.\n\nThe game has a really nice atmosphere, they do a good job with the black and white aesthetic. It's also  been creative with the few twists on history it’s done so far, such as the Hindenburg disaster never occurring and the zeppelin getting bought by an eccentric millionaire to turn into a luxury hotel. The writing is good so far, Ness is likable and it’s overall interesting enough. The game is clearly going to be a mix of classic film noir with the first season of True Detective. The voice acting is solid as well, Doug Cockle, Geralt’s VA, isn’t far from home playing Ness.\n\nGameplay-wise it’s a little bit too railroaded for my liking to truly laud it, but so far the investigation segment was good enough to not feel braindead easy, but it still pales in comparison to Sherlock Holmes: Crime and Punishments. There are also shooting segments but these are solid enough to shake things up without ruining the pacing of the game. Adding to the railroaded feeling is that you can't really explore certain areas, you have to follow a preset path and you run into a lot of invisible walls if you don't, but on the flip side the devs take advantage of this to make some nice fixed camera angles, it lessens the game a bit but its not a deal-breaker. As far as choices go the game really hasn’t gotten into the nitty-gritty yet but you can at least roleplay Ness, whether this really affects character relationships is yet to be seen. There really isn’t any really complex dialogue segments yet either.\n\nOverall it has better gameplay than Telltale’s recent fare, but I feel it needs more to really stand shoulder to shoulder with the current new adventure game greats. While it hasn’t instantly impressed me like Kentucky Route Zero and Life is Strange, it still got me to buy the whole season because if at the very least if it keeps up the quality of the first episode it will be a solid adventure game worth playing.","July 23, 2015","true","4.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

Rest assured that this episodic adventure game from a Spanish team really picks up and shows promise in a genre long forgotten by gamers. Right off the bat in the first scene alone, the game has this stark contrast between black and white with touches of red dotting in once in a while. It's poignant and nostalgic and serves the setting well but mostly it's to mask the really crude texture work hidden in the darkness and the poor shadow work, though this isn't made with a big budget, so it's understandable. What the game gets right in the first few minutes it's the score. It's noir soul basically but the tracks in this game are very powerful and more fitting with the dark undertones of the game. The protagonist, Elliot Ness (who seemingly sounds too much like Geralt of Rivia) is your typical down on his luck detective with a love for violence and whiskey. It's typical in films and tv but seeing this sort of character in gaming with as plenty of backstory is rare and it's breath of fresh air to walk in his shoes. The writing also follows up on the positive side with it being relative to the genre once more. Sardonic quips and comebacks mixed with self hatred and dark comic saturate this game, and it works fantastic. Each character has their own identity though they have yet to be fully fleshed out since this is the first episode. The dark nature of crime noir gets a notch up in this game with one particular sequence being bathed in blood and gore so caution for those weak in the heart, this is not a game for fun.\n\nThe mechanics in contrast to this game however reveal the weakest aspect of the game. I understand that there are limitations given the small company, but even moving the character felt sluggish, shooting (while not an important aspect) was incredibly stilted and uneventful, and the animations range from passable to awkwardly stilted. The choices made in this game have yet to bear fruit, but I doubt I will be making a second run till the next episode fans out since you pretty much play the same scenes through and through. The games I can compare this most to are Life is Strange and The Walking Dead since they too were episodic and focused on your choices. Blues and Bullets is instantly captivating and compelling from the start and rears you into an adult tale of missing children and violence that has me excited for the next episode.\n\n+ Dark, superb writing, brings out the distinct characters\n+ Powerful soundtrack that evokes the noir feel\n+ Atmosphere and visual design is top notch\n+ Pacing is excellent, has me pumped for the next episode\n+ One of the better usage of the Unity Engine, considering its saturation of the market\n- Sluggish movement, animations, and shooting mechanics\n- Game performance is subpar, my decent machine failed to keep a consistent 60fps\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: This game really surprised me. I didn't expect to enjoy as much as I did, which considering I really ignored the adventure genre. But the non-technical aspects of this game, are on par with the likes of Life is Strange (my current GOTY), though I have to say the writing for B&B is better.\n\n\n","August 17, 2015","true","2.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Steam, Metacritic or anywhere. From the first episode that I have played all I can say is that if you enjoy games like Telltale where you have to wait for the next episodes to come out like a tv show you will love it. This like Telltale gives you the option to say whatever you want through 2-4 choices. The graphics may not be Unreal Engine 4 material, but it brings something else to the table that most games don't. It's only colors can be seen is in black, white and red. The art style is really cool and nicely detailed.  This game is a game where your not fully into it because of the beginning but, in the middle or towards the end. In which I felt the same way watching Breaking Bad. It felt a little slow in the beginning but, it picked up after things started to make sense. Once you learn the plot and character along side the setting you will be more then just hooked on this game. The beginning is slow for a reason and a good one too. I saw this the first day it started to sell on steam. I checked it out then bought it earlier today. All I can say is that this game has a nice story to follow along to and it will get more interesting as the other episodes come out. The good thing out of this game was now I can say I spent my money well and can't wait for the future of this game.

In this episodic crime thriller you go through almost L.A. Noire style investigations.. searching the areas for clues, forming a conclusion, and attempting to find witnesses. This game is also paired with a mediocre shooting mechanic that is reinforced with the art style and music, overall that mechanic isnt that bad (: The only negative thing I would have to say about this game is that occaisonally there are some very clunky animations but that might just be a result of its new release status or maybe the devs are but a small team.\n\nOverall, this is a great game if you love it where your choices matter and you want to help catch the supernatural criminals.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lainiweiz/recommended/378660/","lainiweiz","Laini","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lainiweiz/","980 products in account","Blues and Bullets is an adventure game that reminds me a lot of LA Noire and Telltale's The Walking Dead.\n\nThe game sees famed detective Elliot Ness, now retired from the police force and running a diner, pulled back in to solve a case of missing children, one missing child in particular.\n\nIt has quite a heavy focus on narrative, often times when in control of Ness you are limited to very small areas and can only walk around looking at a few items of interest before continuing with the story.\nConversation trees and dialogue choices are the main part of the gameplay, some choices more important than others but in a similar way to The Walking Dead you're often forced to make quick decisions and even when time wasn't a factor and I didn't feel the decision I made would really effect the story one way or the other I still found myself pausing to think, which to me is always a good sign.\n\nAside from that there are a couple of brief QTE sections and you'll get into a couple of shootouts, which are sort of on rail sections that I feel work quite well. Ness will move forward once you've killed the current enemies before stopping at the next piece of cover for you to repeat the process.\nCombat involves aiming, popping out of cover and shooting. You can occasionally move from one piece of cover to another (there is no direct control though, you simply hit a button and Ness moves) but other than for a bit of variety there doesn't seem to be any point to this.\n\nThere are also crime scenes (or rather a crime scene in this first episode) for you to explore.\nI hope that in future episodes more areas can be like this one was, a lot more open with a lot more to inspect and uncover.\nYou walk around looking at areas, occasionally zooming in to a specific location, like an overturned table, to look for more clues. These are all placed on a board and you need to match the right clues to the right heading.\nFor example, which clues tell you how the assault happened, which clues prove there was a witness, that kind of thing.\nNothing overly challenging and there's no penalty for choosing the wrong clue but exploring the environment and gradually piecing together what had happened kept me interested.\n\nI really like the game's look, black and white with small dashes of colour here and there. It's very striking and fits the mood and theme very well. Performance was a little sluggish on the highest settings with a Radeon HD7800 series but absolutely fine on medium and the game still looked great, for the most part.\n\nThere are a few rough edges, animations are a little iffy in places, there's the odd graphical glitch and some people might find the pace a little slow but the story and the characters are pretty strong.\nVoice acting on the main cast is very good and although this first episode is just kind of setting up the characters and the plot it's definitely got me intrigued.\n\nIf you can overlook the slow pace and some slightly rough edges I'd say it's well worth checking out.\nIf length is a factor I should note Episode 1 took me just under 3 hours.","August 7, 2015","true","3.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

You play as Elliot Ness, former leader of the famous Untouchables and search for... Al Capone's grand daughter, who has been kidnapped. Game plays almost exactly like The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones - you interact with objects, make a lot of difficult choices and take part in some quick time events (and even shootouts). You may feel the low budget from time to time, but apart from that, the game is top notch.\n\nFirst of all it has a fantastic atmosphere - you are not sure if everything is happening for real, or if it is some kind of delirious dream. In this alternate reality, the famous Hindenburg zeppelin has been turned into a hotel floating above the city of Santa Esperanza (by a guy named... A. Ryan; Bioshock, anyone?), hight tech submarines are stationed in the docks and gruesome murders are being commited by a cultist of an extraordinary strength, who is able to torn victims arms with his bare hands. There is also a case of missing children, that have been abducted by a strange sect, whos members are wearing bird-like masks. Story looks very promising and dense.\n\nThe graphics are nice as well - developers know how to operate lightning, depth of field and colors to create something unique and intriguing. Voice overs are ok as well - the performance of two main characters is really good and pleasant to hear. Music is awesome, though it has almost nothing in common with blues.\n\nThe first episode lasts for about two hours and features several choices that will have consequences in the future. You can buy it for 5$/€ and it's totally worth it. If you like it, get the rest of the episodes without paying twice for the first one, as there is Episodes 2-5 pack available.","August 16, 2015","true","2.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

The story was very engaging and was the equivalent of a book that makes you keep saying "one more page". The voice acting, in my opinion, was very good, the added gameplay elements other than just dialouge selection were an added bonus, the music was incredibly well done, visually I think the game is beautiful, and for the most part the animations were fantastic.\n\nThe only real quarrals I have with the game is that some of the animations (mainly facial) could have been done a little better. I also felt like the base movement speed for your character is a little slow. I can't imagine anybody walks that slow in real life, however there is a button for a "jog" which helps but there are portions of the game where you're forced to walk at his slow speed.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the first episode and like I said I can't wait for the other episodes to actually be released because I like where the story is going. I'd also like to add that the game reminded me of the movie Sin City so if you like that movie you'll probably enjoy this. So finally my actual rating for the first episode would be a solid 9/10 I highly recommend checking this episodic game out!","August 26, 2015","true","5.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Within the first few minutes, I actually cared about these completely normal people. That's very rare for me.\nThe main gameplay consists of walking around, interacting with objects, and making choices during dialogue, some of which will be remembered for future sections of the game.\n\nThere are also shooting sections in the game, which I enjoy much less. They're on-rails, meaning you can't actually freely move around. You have the ability to switch between cover, reload, aim and shoot. Although you don't have much control, these sections are still a welcome change of pace. The destructibility in the environment add to the intensity of the fight.\n\nThe entire game has a stylistic effect, where everything is in black and white. The only colour you can see, is red. It helps bring out the noir-ish vibe the game is trying to get through.\n\nThe music is awesome, and really helps with the authenticity of the feeling and setting.\n\nOverall, a really great game, with very well written characters and story.\n\nRecommended!","August 14, 2015","true","5.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","7","11","2","0"

The main problem is that you never feel like any of your decisions have any type of consequence. It doesn't matter what you say to a person or what you do to them, because you feel like the eventual outcome will be the same regardless.\n\nThe same goes with the movement parts of the game, you control Elliott Ness and move him from on hotspot to the next (very, VERY slowly) and when you arrive at there, it has no bearing on the game at all (look at a picture, use a soda machine – completely pointless) There are a couple of arcade shooter scenes added into the mix which livens the game play up a little, and there is one part of the game where you get to play detective and work out how a crime was committed, which could have been great, but again there are no consequences for guessing wrong, you just select another option and try again with no penalties.\n\nThe game does seem to have an excellent story, is well acted and has a good style, but the game play is just so slow and tedious, you might not want to play part two (if it ever comes out)","December 11, 2015","false","3.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The story starts the setup with the quintessential noir setup, but if you aren't familiar with the tropes, don't worry. Even if you are, things get a little different. This game has a few flaws, including the semi-locked camera angle, mistimed dialogue with character animation and some of the quick-time events are a little too quick. But these are minor gripes, with solid acting, gorgeous animation, and decent writing. But above all, the soundtrack really gets you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/duckweed/recommended/378660/","duckweed","DuckweedMafia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/duckweed/","1829 products in account","I've been trying to find a game like this for years.\n\nI won't get into the story because others have already given a background but it's done quite well. The writing is outstanding and captivating.\n\nAs for gameplay, it's great if you just want to relax without being rushed into things. Even the action segments where fellas are shooting at you is extremely easy and uncommon. I think I recall about three or four "shoot the bad guys" moments and you don't really have to watch health or ammo for the most part. It has a casual feeling to it but in a good way if you're looking for a somewhat interactive, choose your own adventure type story. The options feel like they have weight and the main character is easy to relate to.\n\nSteam says I've played for 90 hours but I'm only part way through the second episode, much of the gameplay time is idle.\n\nTechnically speaking, I haven't encountered any glitches or crashing. It's running at 60 fps steady on a GTX 770.\n\nI'd love to write a more indepth review but I can't really do it justice. I'm thoroughly enjoying the story and look forward to playing it after work. A tumbler of scotch goes great with this game and the lack of "ACT NOW OR DIE" moments in the game makes it a good, stress-free, enjoyable experience.\n\nI've personally chosen to keep the main character sober, contrary to the above paragraph. I haven't encountered a game with characters so fleshed out and well written like this. The decisions feel like they carry more weight than Game of Thrones by Telltale. I'd love to pick up similar games like this because it's now one of my top ten. I really love it.\n\nPros:\n+> Fascinating artwork\n+> Noir atmosphere\n+> Brilliant writing\n+> Relaxed gameplay (no rushed feeling)\n+> No technical issues encountered (no glitches or crashing in 90+ hrs of gameplay)\n+> Feels like a 60 dollar game for 20 bucks!\n+> The digital comic DLC is really well done!\n\nCons:\n-> The controls/camera can feel a little rigid or clunky but it helps with immersion.\n-> Some people might scoff at the sparse action sequences. I prefer it for relaxing gameplay but others may find it boring.\n-> I haven't noticed a section that compares your choices to other players but I could quite possibly have just missed it like a colossal dummy\n-> Episodic games leave you wanting more. This is more of a downside of the entire genre but when I finish episode 2 I'm going to be dying for more and I'll likely have to wait several months for completion.\n-> I wish you could reference your info board at any time, not just select areas. It would be nice to go back and see your entire case history laid out. This is a really awesome feature but, probably for immersion purposes, you don't really have an inventory type screen where you can reference it at any time. Unless you can and once again I'm a colossal dummy.\n\nI hope more people buy the game because I would love to spend money on a sequel or another title in a similar fashion. The game is incredible.","May 27","true","112.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978704804/recommended/378660/","76561197978704804","Hans-Dieter-Karl-Heinz-Holger","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978704804/","168 products in account","So I've bought all 5 episodes during the Lunar Sale for around 12€. I should have read the news, which said, that only episode 1 was out, but whatever. Let's get started -  I will update my praise and criticism with every episode  as far as possible. Please read the verdict at the end. There you'll find the conditions under which I can recommend buying this game.\n\nEpisode 1\nBefore I go into detail, I have to bring up one thing that's been bothering me from the moment I started the game: the very limited options you have. There's only around 6 resolutions (none of which is fitting my monitor presets), you can't fiddle with AA leaving ugly edges everywhere ruining the atmosphere in the process and so on. You are only allowed to roughly adjust options for your system which is really lame, since every PC is different and you have no control over how smooth your game is running. Mine had framerate drops every 20 or so seconds, which is obviously annoying to say the least.\n\nThe art style of the game will remind you of classics like Sin City with its unsaturated colors but red. Maybe overused, but a fitting style for this game. It underlines the somehow depressing atmosphere of the game. Unfortunately, this atmosphere is ruined by the insufferable camera managment. It is okay to force a certain view of the situation on people. But I've only found it acceptable if not necessary in point&click adventures, where you are usually not navigating around a 3D world. In Blues and Bullets the camera changes in the direction the player is supposed to go (see "hand holding" later on) and it feels horrible when you want to track your way back, because it feels you really have to force yourself against an invisible wall, that only breaks after a few seconds of stubborn walking against it. Why not give the player the option to actually use the mouse and look around to enjoy those gorgeous ambients and surroundings you guys created? Why not only limit this artsy stuff to cutscenes? That would suffice big time! Let's see some improvement, please.\nThe walking speed itself is atrocious - like a snail on weed you waddle forward. You can "run", if you want to call it running, but it won't make much of a difference. This is something I'd like to see fixed as well. Those two aspects and a missing mouse control make it far too easy to work through the game, objects of interest scattered around the game world are not only displayed at once, but you are lead to them through the camera presets. There is a lot of holding hands going on just with those mechanics, unfortunately.\n\nThis game features a detective story, which is neat. Personally, I love detective stories and am fond of point&click adventures. This is, where the game shines but also leaves potential. As you investigate you gather different clues which are - within an extra ingame menue - displayed as a pin board, which obviously represents those used in police investigations. As you collect clues you have to sort out which clues go where on the board. For that, categories are preset ("course of events", "used weapons", and so on) and unfortunately the number of clues is preset as well. It would be nice to not know how many clues you can (and indeed need to) find for one specific field of investigation. This way your story would maybe have more holes than be a clear picture of what happened. This is not a must have, but you have to be punished somehow for not sorting everything out correctly, otherwise the game would be even more linear.\nInvestigating objects reminds me of L.A. Noir, where you get a clear view of the object and you can interact. Again, it is just too obvious (a big red eye appears and fades in at a certain point) where to click to progress, which could also be done more subtle.\nA true detective has to get into firefights. Those are nothing but painful. You as a player are only able to cover or shoot with such a slow and unresponsive mouse that it is scary. There are not many action scenes you go through, but you are being navigated by a script, meaning you can't run yourself. For my taste, this is not mandatory for this game. Why not let the player explore at least a bit? There is so little exploration as it is, why not let us run and gun around when we have the chance to?\n\nWhat I also liked, were the choices you could make during dialogue. Those were either spontaneous, just a choice of going about things (rude, friendly, sarcastic, etc) or even game-influencing. The last one I admire, because it would mean, that there are, in fact, consequences from your choices. This I can't confirm for sure as of yet, since in ep1 there might not be consequences yet. Those may as well occur during the following episodes, which would be very promising.\nDialogues themselves often feel petty and from time to time even absurd. It is not necessarily the voice acting, but the content and how it is presented. To be fair, during ep1 there is a clear rise in quality of those talks, which puts me at ease for future episodes.\n\nLast but not least the story: It is a mix of reality, fiction, mistery and crime, which is interesting to say the least. I would go as far as to say, that it is a creative approach in story telling. Yes, story telling, this is the main focus of the game, which makes it feel like a movie for the majority of the time. I am okay with it - I mean, I put up with it, because it does it quite well. Not overwhelmingly perfect but well. There is some kind of character development and there is a nice mistery behind the story with character conflict and ominous people and circumstances, which get a grip of the player.\n\nVerdict of Episode 1\nOverall, I would only recommend Blues and Bullets to players who enjoy a more "talkative" game with little to interact except crime scene action, which might be the most playing you will be doing. It is really linear with a movie aspect and nicely staged scenery lasting around 1 hour and 10 minutes, which is short. So short, that you should only consider buying during sales. I payed around 2.40€ per epsiode, which is the limit.","February 11","true","1.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The gameplay is pretty linear but it's very story-oriented (you make choices but they don't affect what happens that much). I've only played episode 1 but I would definitely play the rest now once they start getting released.\n\nThere are inspection scenes (like in most detective games) and you have to link the clues yourself. The game is black & white (with the exception of things that are red, like blood, very reminiscent of Sin City) and has a noire kind of feel with grimey crime scenes and Al Capone encounters.\n\nI would recommend episode one of Blues and Bullets to fans of detective games, Telltale games and Life is Strange to a certain extent.","December 10, 2015","true","2.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Think the speed of Soul Suspect or Life is Strange.\n\nThis game is perfect if you aren't in the mood for Max Payne shoot 'em ups or COD set pieces.  If you want to chill, investigate, look around break for a change.\n\nSO glad I returned my AITD pre-order and got my money back so I could buy this.  Well worth the wait.

The story, graphical style, gameplay, music and voice acting all was great.\n\nThe game follows the story of Eliot Ness, who is an ex-cop and gets involved into a mystery. Eliot has the same voice as Geralt of Rivia, which is a nice bonus :). Episode 1 will tell about his past also. It's a mature story with bloody moments and delivers a cinematic experience.\n\nGameplay is a bit similar to Life is Strange or TWD, where you can choose what to say and interact with objects to see what Eliot thinks. You will do some detective work and lots of walking, as can't go faster all the time. Also you cannot move the camera freely, but only the character. I'm really looking forward to episode 2, I thought first that all of them are released as I only bought Ep 1 but I was wrong. Episode 2 was supposed to release in late 2015 I think, but it should be out soon according to devs.","January 16","true","5.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedLegs13B/recommended/378660/","RedLegs13B","RedLegs13B","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedLegs13B/","34 products in account","I recommend this game to anyone who likes Noir, Detective, Mystery, and Story-Driven games. I quite enjoy the storyline, the way it's broken into Episodes fits the game atmosphere perfectly. And i'm not one to play Episodic games either, never bothered to delve into them and usually those games aren't amongst the types I enjoy playing. Blues and Bullets was a different story though, it caught my attention. Now this game is far from perfect so here's my list of Pros and Cons when it comes to Blues and Bullets:\n\nPros:    The fantastic soundtrack that was superbly put together Damien Sanchez! Kudos! Made the experience that much more enjoyable and is honestly my favorite part of the game\nA new spin on the legendary Eliot Ness & infamous Al Capone, 20 years after the events of his takedown\nThe Noir game atmoshpere, very fitting\nThe mysterious events and twists that occur in the story\nThe detective gameplay when investigating (could of been better, but it's a pro IMO)\nCons:    VERY LINEAR gameplay, not much is in the players control at all and there's set paths. For example, in all the shooting scenarios the player doesn't get to control where Eliot runs to or hides behind for cover. The game does it automatically after the player kills "X" ammount of enemies. It'll hop on over to the next cover, and so on, until a cutscene is activated.\nShooting; where to begin?\n-Hit detection is sub-par. An enemy can have his elbow or top of his head exposed when behind cover. You can aim right at those exposed parts and nothing happens\n-The aiming is very sluggish\n-The weapons don't seem realistic in the slightest and it's obvious not much thought was put into this game when it came to shootout scenarios and realism when it came to the weapons themselves\n-4 weapons in the entire game SO FAR..... A revolver, Thompson, Sawn-off pump action shotgun (which you never have to reload....), and a Gatling Gun (which according to Capone in one scene is from pre-prohibition era)\n-It's just not fun at all to do in this game...\nGraphics: They're nothing to brag about, similar in look to something you'd find in older games 4yrs back. Now I know that a huge studio with lots of dough didn't develop this game and you can't expect devs who aren't to produce something with graphics on par with say, GTA V or Far Cry 4, but i'm just saying..\nAll-in-all it's not perfect, but it's not terribly crappy either. The game is more about the storyline and the mystery that is to unfold as the episodes go on, rather than the linear gameplay and action sequences. I see it as more an interactive story really. I will be buying the other episodes as they release, the story has me intruiged for sure.\n\n-Perhaps you'll take a chance on this game like I have-","May 26","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I also greatly enjoy film noir. Mix those two together with a design style that is lovingly ripped from Sin City and this purchase was a no-brainer. I've only played the beginning episode (I'm not sure the others have been released at this point), but I am hooked and ready for the rest of the story.\n\nI will keep this brief and spoiler free.\nPlaying as Eliot Ness, retired from the police, you are hired by Al Capone (stay with me, this is an alternate reality, remember?) to find his kidnapped niece, Sofia. That's the basic beginning plot and that's as far as I'm going to go with the story.\n\nThe gameplay is straight adventure fair. Easy for anyone to jump in and play. You basically use one button to interact with everything. This works very well. The fighting elements of the game are very well realized. There are QTE events as well as more arcade-like gunplay sequences. For those who fear arcade-like sequences, take heart as they are not difficult, but are very well staged to make Ness feel pretty bad-@$$. Also, choices you make affect what happens later in the game. So far, the choices I have made seem to have little effect, but some of it was a very nice touch, so kudos to the writers!\n\nSpeaking of stage, this is where the game shines. The sets are stunning. The black/white/red color scheme is used to great effect. Every scene looks absolutely gorgeous and feels like a film noir. This is also partly due to the game designers choice to lock the camera. While I find this a bit annoying, I understand why they did this. They can control the camera angles so that each scene is presented at its best and they keep the noir theme running throughout. This is a narrative story, afterall.\n\nAnd what about the story? So far, the writing has been excellent and the story has got me hooked. The only minor gripes are that the acting does not always live up to the writing. Al Capone is a bit ham-fisted, a bit too over the top. Some of the secondary characters feel less like professional actors and more like friends that chipped in to lend their voices to an indie project. But the actor who plays Ness truly shines. He is perfect, and that's the most important thing.\n\nWhile the set graphics are absolutely out of this world, the character design and execution is a bit hit and miss. Ness, again, is beautifully realized. But some of the other characters do not quite have his definition, they feel like they were created in far less time and do not quite sit in the scenes as well as he does. All of the character animations are a bit stiff - it is clear they were all motion captured, but there's something missing to truly elevate the animation to AAA level. Lastly, the facial expressions are sorely lacking in this game. This is a game where you are talking to a number of people and their reactions and expressions can really help to engage the audience even more. Unfortunately, everyone looks like they have all been recently shot up with Botox.\n\nAlright, but if these graphics seems so terrible, why are you giving it a thumbs up? Because the game is fantastic! My comments on the animation are minor quibbles. The animation isn't terrible, most people may not even notice. I work in 3D for a living, so these are things I notice. This game is about story and atmosphere and it does both BEAUTIFULLY!\n\nMy minor gripes with the game do little to tarnish it. Anyone who enjoys a good story and phenomenal atmosphere owe it to themselves to pick this game up.\n\nEDIT: I almost forgot to mention one of the coolest mechanics of the game, when Ness goes into "detective mode." The designers did a really nice job utilizing a simple one-button ui while still keeping it completely engaging. You encounter a grisly murder scene and are given an opportunity to deduce what happened. You search the body, the rooms, in order to gain clues which you then place on a virtual crime board (essentially, Ness is piecing it together in his head). It is extremely well designed and a lot of fun to play through. It's also quite a disturbing scene visually - but so brilliantly done.","February 7","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I really liked these as they gave you less time to consider your options and therefore made it a more personal decision, more of these and maybe even less time to make the decisions would be great as they would become more influenced by the player’s personality rather than a logical decision. More exploration is definitely welcome and an increase to movement speed. It felt like I was just slowly plodding around areas with no purpose until the set pieces began which as far as I could tell was just a way of extending the already short playing time.\nI picked the game up for £3.99 on steam which is pretty good for a two hour episode even if it did feel a little short, there’s an option to get all 5 episodes for £15 or just episodes 2-5 for £12.99. I’d recommend picking up the first episode to try out as I found the story very engaging and I’m definitely interested in seeing what’s going to happen and if you like it you can grab the remaining episodes from there. Overall I’m giving blues and bullets a solid 6 out of 10, the price point and the story are big plusses for me but the movement, lack of exploration and basic combat detract from the overall experience, however this is expected from episodic story games like these.\n\nFor my full review check out  Ouj Reviews...

So, i'll go into some detail below.\n\nPros:\n- It's unique\n- Excellent art style and visuals\n- Music\n- Period accurate dialogue\n\nCons:\n- Crashing. (This is subjective - may just be me.)\n- Length.\n- Time between episodes.\n\nI love the way this game plays. It's like an old detective film had a baby with a video game; however, my main complaint is the crashing. It's crashed twice on me in less than an hour. It's the only game I've ever ran that has crashed on me.\nThe game is pretty short so far. Only about two hours in length to get through the one released episode. Now here we come to the biggest issue this game suffers from. That is the time between releases of the episodes.\nEpisode one was released in July of 2015. Now the Second is set to release in March of this year. That's eight months between each episode.\nI can understand if they have a small team, and they likely do. I'm not new to the episodic format. I'm usually waiting on Telltale Episodes all the time and played Life is Strange episodes as they released. I just find eight months to be a bit excessive.\n\nRating 8.5/10\n\nAmazing game with a slow release schedule. Catch it on sale.","February 25","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Right from the very beginning the player is drawn into a macabre story of pure evil. It is really engrossing, and down right chilling.\nYou play Elliot Ness the now retired and aged detective responsible for putting away Al Capone. Now running his own little cafe and trying to stay out of the detective/police life. This doesn't last very long though and he finds himself working a case for the very man he put away. It's friggin excellent so far. I say so far because you only get to play the first act...takes about 3 hours if you try to get 100% completions. The gameplay is very slow and subduded probably making it easier to find the clues associated to the case that Ness is trying to solve.\nThis is one very cool game that I hope they don't screw up during the next act. This is every bit as cool as LA Noir as far as the atmosphere, the music, and the voice acting. It is cool.

I really liked these as they gave you less time to consider your options and therefore made it a more personal decision, more of these and maybe even less time to make the decisions would be great as they would become more influenced by the player’s personality rather than a logical decision. More exploration is definitely welcome and an increase to movement speed. It felt like I was just slowly plodding around areas with no purpose until the set pieces began which as far as I could tell was just a way of extending the already short playing time.\nI picked the game up for £3.99 on steam which is pretty good for a two hour episode even if it did feel a little short, there’s an option to get all 5 episodes for £15 or just episodes 2-5 for £12.99. I’d recommend picking up the first episode to try out as I found the story very engaging and I’m definitely interested in seeing what’s going to happen and if you like it you can grab the remaining episodes from there. Overall I’m giving blues and bullets a solid 6 out of 10, the price point and the story are big plusses for me but the movement, lack of exploration and basic combat detract from the overall experience, however this is expected from episodic story games like these.\n\nFor my full review check out  Ouj Reviews...

Noir adventures are my jam but even if you aren't a fan of the genre I'd recommend this for the incredible graphics, music and story. The game starts off in a suspenseful situation and you're given the whole timed decision consequence scenario that is well known among Tell Tale games. Though I haven't really seen any deviation in how the story plays out through different choices. The story plays out rather quickly as you can be in a calm conversation in one episode then thrust into a fight some couple minutes later.\n\nThere's a few gun fights that play out simply in an aim and shoot, also featured are a few quick time action events. And if by chance you do happen to die the game is very forgiving and restarts right before the event. In addition there are also detective-esque moments where you will have to piece together what happened at a crime scene. There isn't any side quest deviation but you do have branching paths of Eliot Ness and another individual which slowly become connected.\n\nDespite the monotone graphic style with sparing use of red there are incredibly detailed and vibrant environments.The episode played out in just over 2 hours and the game does leave you at a bit of a cliffhanger at the end but it gives you enough stuff packed in the episode so that it's never boring. The music and voice acting also does a great job of getting into the feel of the era. It's as polished a game as you would expect from any of the top tier developers. I did experience a little bit of lag at certain areas but nothing that hindered my playing too much.

I found the track pad really sticky no matter how much I turned up the sensitivity, so for things where I needed the trackpad I ended up using the mouse instead. Also the run function wasn;t in the default controller config so you have to set it.\n\nPros:\nMostly works OK with controller port\nAmazing atmosphere\nGreat story\nVery clear objectives\ngreat characters and voice acting\ngreat (so far) for casual gamers, if you're not the best at button mashing you can still manage this game\nstoryline was well paced\n\nCons:\nIt did crash for me a few times\nCan't skip the cut scenes which can be frustrating if you accidentally click in to one you already watched\nthe walking is super slow and even when you run (which you don't always have the ability to do) it's slow\nI wasn't a fan of the vocals, I'd have preferred just the music. It tried to be bluesy but came off really winey\nwould be nice if you could look around 360, I found the movement a bit clunky\nJuly 2015 - March 2016 for the next episode release seems a realllllly long time. I am a slow gamer but it still only took me 2.5 hours to get through the first episode.\n\nOverall I really would recommend this game to all levels of players. It seems to be a bit like choose your own adventure, but the cut scenes you can't skip might make it tedious to replay. I can't wait for episode 2.\n\nEdited for Episode 2:\n\nStoryline was intense! I wish it was a bit longer so we could find out what happened with SC a little more. Still can't make Elliot really run very well. Again, it crashed for me a few times. Some of the objectives were way too obvious, others not obvious enough.\n\nThis is a really psychological horror type game in that the underlying themes get creepier and creepier.\n\nCan't wait for episode 3.","February 7","true","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Eliot Ness, the former leader of the legendary Untouchables, wished only to spend the rest of his days working in his diner, not dwelling too much on the cesspit of corruption his city, Santa Esperanza, had degenerated into.\n\nBut things rarely go as planned.\n\nWhen children suddenly start to disappear and the police just simply a blind eye, Eliot decides to take the law into his own hands, track down the culprit and bring him to justice by any means necessary, even if he has to abandon his dreams of a peaceful life and again get embroiled in shootouts with the usual array of assassins and hoodlums.\n\nHelped by various characters from some unexpected places, the player must guide Eliot through the increasingly morbid and decadent scenarios searching for clues to solve the cases in the five episodes of this season's Blues and Bullets.  - Recommended!","August 13, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Whilst there are choices to make its really just about the quality of the story telling and the story in this game.\n\nFor those who have seen the untouchables or know about Al Capone and Elliot Ness the alternate history of them working togtether should be a very appealing storyline in it self.\n\nGraphically its like playing your way through Sin City and anybody who dosnt like that idea must be not just colour blind but BLIND! Its done extremely well.\n\nThe voice acting is great and soundtrack fits the feel of the game immensly well.\n\nI bought episode 1 on sale for £1.99 and it took around 2 hours to finish on a casual play through with a couple of beers and a glass of good whisky....... Money well spent I felt like I was playing a £30 title and cant wait for the next episode.\n\nOverall I'd give this 9 out 10. Extremely suprised by the overall quality and finish of this game.\n\nTry it , especially while its on sale for £1.99 its a no brainer, enjoy :-)","February 6","true","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I found the track pad really sticky no matter how much I turned up the sensitivity, so for things where I needed the trackpad I ended up using the mouse instead. Also the run function wasn;t in the default controller config so you have to set it.\n\nPros:\nMostly works OK with controller port\nAmazing atmosphere\nGreat story\nVery clear objectives\ngreat characters and voice acting\ngreat (so far) for casual gamers, if you're not the best at button mashing you can still manage this game\nstoryline was well paced\n\nCons:\nIt did crash for me a few times\nCan't skip the cut scenes which can be frustrating if you accidentally click in to one you already watched\nthe walking is super slow and even when you run (which you don't always have the ability to do) it's slow\nI wasn't a fan of the vocals, I'd have preferred just the music. It tried to be bluesy but came off really winey\nwould be nice if you could look around 360, I found the movement a bit clunky\nJuly 2015 - March 2016 for the next episode release seems a realllllly long time. I am a slow gamer but it still only took me 2.5 hours to get through the first episode.\n\nOverall I really would recommend this game to all levels of players. It seems to be a bit like choose your own adventure, but the cut scenes you can't skip might make it tedious to replay. I can't wait for episode 2.\n\nEdited for Episode 2:\n\nStoryline was intense! I wish it was a bit longer so we could find out what happened with SC a little more. Still can't make Elliot really run very well. Again, it crashed for me a few times. Some of the objectives were way too obvious, others not obvious enough.\n\nThis is a really psychological horror type game in that the underlying themes get creepier and creepier.\n\nCan't wait for episode 3.","February 7","true","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The gameplay is nice and focused, even if the movement is a bit slow for my tastes, and the use of the Sin City-style palette works nicely for the most part, turning even the opulent Hindemburg Hotel into something deeply dark and lurid.\n\nCombing for clues and working through dialogue is pleasantly direct, with little room for real error or combing a room for one elusive item, something a few games still fail to get right. The shooting sections, although basic, are still entertaining enough, and have the flavour of the old-school rail shooter to them which was a nice little moment of nostalgia for me at least.\n\nBest of all, frankly, is the writing. The mystery unfolds in a few directions, rather than just pointing us in one direction explicitly, and it's refreshing to see so many genuinely competent characters - Eliot lends a steady hand and a weather eye, whereas Milton proves not to be just a comic foil, but also a very guarded and intelligent individual who always seems to be ensuring that he has the upper hand, just a little.\n\nIs it perfect? No. The character models can look a bit dippy, and the pace and style of the game isn't going to appeal to everyone, but if you're a fan of Life Is Strange or the Telltale CYOA games, and you fancy something chock full of trenchcoats, mobsters and gothic-noir horror, this comes highly recommended. Try the first episode, see if it's for you.\n\nAlso, the reward for completing chapter 1 made me wet myself. You saucy buggers, you.","July 28, 2015","true","4.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Not in the snarky "haha, this game is so bad, X would Y" sense laughable. In the sense that it tries to make a noir-ish detective story meets grisly cult-inspired murder story meets alternate history 50s story, but fails at doing any of that in a competent way.\nDialogues are silly. Scenes are set up in a very amateurish way, mostly abusing the good old fly-by camera games loved to use in late 90s-early 00s, to the point that it sometimes feels like an actual person recorded the flyby with noclip and smoothed mouse. Visuals and animations try hard to look cool in the black and white plus red style, but looks outdated and "meh". Interactions are painfully slow and don't feel meaningful at all. Future episodes might redeem this, but so far it doesn't seem like they will, at least in any way that will also work with competent storytelling.\nI honestly kept foing through the game after initial shock of the "is this for real" kind only to see if it gets any stupider. It does. And the game might actually be interesting in the "is this seriously released as a paid product in 2015?" kind of way. Unless you value your time and money, of course, and spend those on something better.\nOh and from the technical perspective - it ran fine for me, but don't even bother trying to play it with kb+mouse if you have a gamepad, as the mouse is there just to say that it's supported, the game doesn't use it in any actually good way (like, say, Telltale games do).\nOverall, it really feels like a student project that tried to become something more, without the developers having skills, budget and experience to make it something more.","October 18, 2015","false","3.5"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","22","43","0","1"

At its core it plays like a modern Telltale game, mainly involving dialogue and choices, but it also takes notes from LA Noire in its aesthetics and occasional shooting, while the investigation gameplay is heavily remniscient of Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments, in which you search crime scenes for evidence and then piece them together on an evidence board yourself. The graphics sometimes have a bit of lack of polish, being an indie game, but the art style does a pretty good job of of covering the flaws, and the somewhat stilted character animations are made up for by the generally pretty good voice cast, particularly thanks to the voice of Doug Cockle (probably better known by his real name, Geralt of Rivia) as the main character.\n\nThe premise is an alternate history story about Eliot Ness, one of the real-world investigators responsible for the arrest of Al Capone. The story isn't exactly as grounded as its real-life inspiration would suggest, and certain scenes feel oddly out of place compared to the rest of the game, but for the most part it's well-told and pretty interesting so far, and left me looking forward to the next episode. The first episode spends a lot of its time setting up the story, so it feels somewhat linear, but it opens up enough later on to suggest that further episodes will do better with the pacing. Overall Blues and Bullets does a pretty good job for a first episode from a new studio, and while it is somewhat risky to buy an episodic game from a non-established developer, I thought it was worth giving it a try.","December 30, 2015","true","8.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

The noir astmosphere is extremely well done and grabs you into the world. The artstyle of being all grey with only the color red standing out makes it visually striking. The story is just beginning but has me intrigued. There is only one section in the game but at this section you must look for clues at a murder scene and put the pieces together for yourself. It's not really that difficult but it's a good start. Doug Cockle as private detective Elliot Ness is good casting and everyone else does a decent job as well.\n\nAs for the flaws, while the artstyle is very good graphically it's nothing special. Not terrible but not great either. Lip synching is also inconsistent with the character models mouthes not always lining up with the words they're speaking. The biggest issue I have is with the controls. I used a keyboard and I was limited to moving with the W S A D keys for walking and only E is used for observing items of interest. The mouse is only useful for the investigation sequence and except for the main menu is a white cube that you should get out of your way by putting it in the lower right had of the screen. This becomes really annoying during the shooting segments since it doesn't go away when the crosshairs who up when aiming. There also quick time events but only two of them and only the W S A D keys are used. They aren't bad but just unexpected but thankfully few and far between. If anyone has a controller, use it instead of the keys and mouse. The computer controls can be adapted to but it's a frustrating start.\n\nAn overall very interesting title that I can recommend even with its rough edges.","January 1","true","4.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And the level of acting is reminiscent of games from the 90s or some local dinner theater production (especially the cop at the diner -- they actually picked this guy on purpose?). Beyond that, the player will do such breath-takingly thrilling things as:\n\n*Shuffling very slowly from the diner counter to a table to take an order\n*Shuffling very slowly back to the counter to get the order\n*Shuffling very slowly back to the table with the order\n*Shuffling very slowly from the diner to the car\n*Shuffling very slowly from the reception desk to Al Capone's office\n\nCome on, the main character is supposed to be in his 50s, not his 90s!\n\nThe graphics are kind of cool, albeit gimmicky; but beyond that it's just not a very good game. Even the scary parts are just more of your standard serial killer boilerplate, about as scary as a junior-high haunted house.","November 29, 2015","false","0.7"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","3"

I also saw that no new episodes have been posted for the last 6 months so I believe it will be a long wait for all episodes to be in. I didn't know you can prepay for a game (especially since it is not such a popular game), so I requested a refund for the rest of the episodes, but as I have played for more than 2 hours (on episode 1!!) they did not refund me!! You should only have the option to purchase episode 1 and clearer information should be posted so as to not mislead people into thinking they can play right away episodes 2-5!!!\n\nEpisode 1 Review: I think the episode 1 is very good, good story and characters.  The controls are difficult to play with and cannot be changed, also there is no control of the viewpoint of the character with the mouse, I think its a bit awkward. Also, you cannot save where you want. I liked the black, white and red theme of the game, I thought it was original. I also like the music and atmosphere of the game. It is a mixture of Mafia II, LA Noire, as well as Sherlock Holmes.","November 29, 2015","false","12.3"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

The game resembles a big eintopf of washed out cliches from noir movies, spiced up liberally with the red pepper of the genre - blood, namely quite revolting sadistic scenes. I am not trying to moralize or something, I can see them justified sometimes, like in the Silent Hill series, but here the game just does not provide any good reason to stomach them.\n\nThe esthetics and the main protagonist are straight up borrowed from the Sin movie, the anthagonist in the episode is borrowed from the cover of the SW:KOTOR 2 game, the constant noir whining is borrowed from Max Payne, and I have seen the thug-intellectual character somewhere before too, only I don't recall where exactly.\n\nThe strongest point of the game are probably the investigation scenes where you examine a scene and try to find clue and reconstruct what has happened. The problem is you can achieve it by mindlessly clicking on everything and then trying all the combinations. Then you have the story and the dialogues borrowed from Telltale games that try to create the illusion of important decisions. And lastly, there are very mediocre shooting gallery scenes which are just bad, and the game would be better without them.\n\nThe graphics are barely functional, and the black and white style helps to hide the fact that there are barely any textures on the objects. Despite that, the game has some glaring performance problems even on very modern hardware, which is quite unfortunate, especially since it also crashes occassionally. I never judge a game just by how it looks, but the barely adequate graphics combined with outright wooden and stiff animations sometimes really detract from the playing experience, especially during conversations (facial animations), and during the shooting sequences.\n\nIf you love noir movies and are an avid consumer of cliches, change the verdict to Yes. For me, however, the game left a foul aftertaste. It's not that it is strictly bad, but it is too mediocre to leave a lasting impression.","March 11","false","6.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I was really excited about the concept of this game and I'm familiar with episodic, choice-based games. After playing for nearly an hour, this is what turned me off from the game:\n\n1. There must be a bug in the menu, because my controllers wouldn't work properly. The menu responded very slowly to my inputs with the analog stick, or not at all. When it prompted me to adjust the brightness settings, the slider went all the way to the left and any time I tried to adjust it to the right it went back to the left. I had to quickly pick my setting and exit out before it could revert back. I had the same issue in the graphics settings. It just cycled through the options very rapidly, making it impossible for me to change anything. I could not select an episode using A. It did nothing. I couldn't go back with B either. So I switched to mouse and keyboard and it worked fine.\n\n2. The opening sequence was weird. I see where an interesting concept was laid out, but it didn't grip me, just confused me.\n\n3. The game is like a patchwork doll of past, present, and future. It can be done and done well, but here it just feels odd. It's like a weird futuristic 50's era. Sounds cool in theory, was not done well in practice. The world just didn't feel authentic.\n\n4. The game crashed on me twice.\n\n5. I got distracted by my phone several times while I was playing. There's a lot of nothing going on in between the somethings.\n\n6. Movement is awkward using a keyboard. The camera angle is a pain in the ♥♥♥ at times.\n\n7. Most of the voice acting is subpar.\n\n\n\nPros:\n\n1. The best thing about this game is the main character is voiced by Doug Cockle, better known as Geralt of Rivia.","January 2","false","0.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Instead you'll find a terrible mix of different genres. I can't say for sure is it a quest, an action, noire detective or a horror (they even placed something like Max Paynes painfull memories). The game mode jumps from one genre to another with no decent reason (each mode is badly realized). The plot is twisted (in a bad way) too. It also jumps from one genre to another. First it dumb action movie Commando like, then it noire movie, then it James Bond movie, horror movie Silent Hill like, e.t.c. The characters motives, actions and dialogues are making no sense.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterwriter42/recommended/378660/","masterwriter42","masterwriter42","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masterwriter42/","357 products in account","I can't honestly recommend this series. It's an average noir thriller that tries to be like Telltale's games with a Sin City filter, with all the cliches you've come to expect. Episode one was okay, but went downhill with episode 2. As of the time of this review, that's all that's out. The graphics are alright, the sound design is above average, and the story so far isn't that great. The shooting segments weigh the game down, feeling like something that should have been left in the early 2000s, and you'll die sometimes because even though you were aiming right at what you needed to hit, the dodgy hit detection made you hit the wall next to it instead. All of this leads to an unpolished product, and something they did at the end of episode 2 was a classless decision that drained what little respect I had left for the game. That's the thing, through it all it kept my attention, but I haven't really enjoyed the experience. If I hadn't bought the season pass, I'd have stopped buying episodes at this point, there's far better products for your money on Steam. So, no, I don't recommend Blues and Bullets.","May 21","false","4.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

My major gripe is the slow pace Ness moves and the sometimes out of sync voices when characters move their mouths.  We shall see what the  other episodes bring so I would recommend buying the first episode and seeing if the gameplay is right for you.\n\nAlso, while the game does present you with ways to respond to other characters (a touch of Telltale), I have not seen any consequences for those choices as of yet.  I've posted gameplay on my channel if you would like to see what I'm speaking about.\n\nFor now I'm going to have to not recommend this game until it really "wows" me.","October 13, 2015","false","6.2"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"
