But still a pretty okay strategy game.\nOne of them Strategy games with an Avatar commander, I kinda like those types of games.\n\nIn this case you directly control a battle mage, or rather his astral projection, and of course you direct the troops. You can arm your army with special equips, your troops can drag items, and you can do quests for towns and of course delve into the story. And ofcourse the mage can also cast some spells from his projection.\nThere's also a level system for the mage. From what I've seen so far it's per campaign level.\n\nThere's a few slight issues with the controls; turning the camera for instance can be a bit troublesome, which is annoying because you do have to keep a good eye out. And if one guy of a troop gets stuck somewhere, the whole troop walks slow as hell and is hardly of any use until you get them back together... So you do need to keep an eye out on that.\nBut that's the only trouble I've seen, the rest of the game seems to be fine.","November 20, 2014","true","4.0"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","35","38","0","1"

This game seems to be one that everyone missed even when it's on sale in Christmas. The 66% approval rating is kinda low mostly because there seems to be a bunch of people have problem running this game and posted it in review.\nHowever those reivew were posted sometime ago and I don't seem to have any issue running it on my Windows 8.1 and Lenovo thinkpad.\n\nI will give it a thumb up so maybe there are more people try thie one out.\n\nIt's a fairly simple game that you are have a Astral body that floating around controling an army and do spell action. (remind me the hand that in old Dungeon keep games). It's quite a bit more hassal to get use to since we all use to just have a god eye view of most strategy game and just mouse to point and click. This one force you to turn around... move to get better view of the battle field.\n\nYou summon creature, Cast spell, Heal Troops, level up Troops, upgrade Troops, Destorying Lairs to stop monster respawn (like Majestic). You can also help towns garther resource to upgrade to offer better troops and items.\nYour Astral body cannot pick up item but your troops can.. they can equip item... drink potions.\n\nEverything in this game seems a bit off our normal comfort zone of command click since everything just seems a bit usual. Do not despire.. play it a bit more and give it a bit chance to prove it self.\n\nThe first map is quite boring but once you move on to the next few it gets better.\n\nIt's only just over a dollar right now in store.. give this one a try. It even offer trading cards. (someone please play and trade with me so i can complete level 1 badge.)\n\nLow Budget game that will probably make you spent quite a bit time to complete each of the levels in single player. (which i will spent eventually after i get my trading cards from other games.)","December 23, 2014","true","1.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","17","22","4","0"

But much longer story with 4 campaings instead of 1 makes it much better. And as I gave 9/10 for the last one, I will have to give this one 9.5/10, as it is certainly better than the previous one (:","June 27, 2015","true","37.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I can't tell about the other languages, but at some parts English voice overs were not so good. Despite all this I do like the game. It's something different and the story kept me interested. The characters are interesting and the game has a lot of diversity.\n\nSince the store page has some modified screenshots here's one of mine: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=648719732\n\nIt's a combination of RTS (real time strategy) and RPG (role playing) genres. This is an add-on to the game  Battle Mages , so it has almost the same interface and graphics, but the game is a stand alone installation. It has some changes though, but I won't go into them right now.\n\nBattle Mages: Sign of Darkness delivers a lot more game play and story than the first game did. It has four different campaigns, each having their own focus on the main story. They each offer a different character, different combination of skills and availability of resources and troops, so you can experience the diversity the game offers.\n\nYou play the game by assembling an army, to complete quests, fight enemies to make the world a safer place and help those who need it.\n\nYou have a wide variety of available troops from human, orc, elf and goblin races including close range fighters, long range troops, mages and even heavy artillery. You buy your troops in towns. As you fight enemies, you and your troops gain experience. Your troops get stronger with each level of experience and when a unit reaches level 4, you can upgrade them to a better unit, but some units can't be upgraded and have only one level. Upgrades can be done in any available town of the right race (human troops get updated in human towns etc.). Not all kind of towns will be available though, since you will travel to far away lands.\n\nYou aid your troops with spells, healing and empowering them, summoning Magical spirits to aid them. You also have a wide variety of damaging spells you can use on your enemies. Spells require mana to be cast, with no mana you can cast only the spells you put in quick access (F5-F9, F10 summons Magical spirit and can't be changed). After casting a spell from quick access, it takes a while to regenerate. When you gain experience, you can use it to learn new spells, learn new skills or upgrade your max mana, mana regeneration or maximum army size and more. When you reach a new level, a new set of spells gets available.","March 19","true","11.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
