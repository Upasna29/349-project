It's a classic asset-flip, yay! Wan't to recreate Endorlight? Well, all you need is GameMaker and this\nPlatformer Roguelike Engine[marketplace.yoyogames.com] asset from YoYo Games' marketplace for $33.99 ONLY $16.99. Now all you need to do is doodle over the default sprites and recolor the tiles a bit and you're done!\n\nOriginal review follows:\n\ntl;dr:\nDo you recommend this game?No:\nit's unoriginal, even taking into account the early stage of development\nthere are a lot of issues, that not "early development" issues, but rather just plain lazy things (all graphics look blurry due to using the wrong texture filter, etc.)\nit's someone's first attempt at a game in Game Maker, and while there's nothing wrong with Game Maker, the inexperience shows clearly\nthe developer feels shady (deleting discussion threads, recommending their game on their curator account, moderating the forums under a different steam profile etc.)\nsome features reported in Greenlight all the way back in November are still missing from the game.If you feel the game looks promising, instead of buying it now, follow the game and see where it goes once it develops, but I'd definitely recommend against buying at this stage.\n\nActual reviewEndorlight is a dungeon platformer that's clearly heavily inspired by Spelunky. Your goal is to navigate short levels from the top to the bottom, find an exit and procede to the next randomly generated level. There are enemies, spikes and pick-ups on the way, and beyond what you'd expect from any platformer game you have wall-hugging, wall jumping, a horizontal ranged weapon and two different melee weapons. There are three tilesets fro the game, the third of which is used for every level beyond level 3, and five or six enemies, most differing only in their appearence, speed and hitpoints.\n\nThe game is in early alpha, but even taking that into account, the concepts the game presents feel unoriginal, and the game has a bunch of issues, that result from laziness or incompetence with the engine (Game Maker) including a very wonky control configuration system, blurry look due to using the wrong type of scaling filter on the sprites and tiles and UI issues (item's drawing over oneanother etc.)\n\nThe game is also VERY easy. There are way too many health pick-ups littered throughout the  levels and the enemies are too easy to dodge most of the time. I usually give new games a change of one game over or one hour if there are a lot of deaths, in the one hour that I played Endorlight, I made it to level 159 or something, had so many health-upgrades that they covered my gold total, and finally died because I started playing one-handed while playing Trivia Crack on my phone. The game feels less like an alpha or pre-alpha, and more like an "engine test", but given that it's using Game Maker, I'd say the engine has already been quite thoroughly tested. I'd say the biggest challenge the game provides stems solely from the controls feeling laggy (not floaty, I actually enjoy some inertia in my platformer controls, but actually laggy) and the various small glitches (there are two shoot buttons, both fire where the character is facing, except if your standing next to a wall, in which case the character fires away from the wall).\n\nThe game is in early development, but in my playthrough, I never once encountered many of the features advertised on the games Greenlight page way back in November including the Digger enemy, the knife weapon or any inventory.\n\nOutside the game, Endorlight has been Recommended by four curators, one of which has more than 10 subscribers. That one being Vantom's Giveaways, whose admin - vantom - is the user who submitted Endorlight to Steam Greenlight. The recommendation doesn't do anything to disclose this. Make of that what you will.\nThe developer also seems to delete discussion threads without any explanation or reason. They are using a wonderful PSD template from Designercow's  awesome 80's Style Text Mockups[graphicriver.net] pack, available on Envato's graphicriver store. I pointed out that they've made a small mistake when customizing the mockup, forgetting to move the glow/flare "blobs" to overlay on the logo's stroke outline, resulting in a weird look. The thread was summarily removed without explanation.\n\nSo, in closing. If this game interests you, I'd recommend checking out the free Game Maker version of Spelunky instead, it has a similar aesthetic, but offers much more to discover and is a very polished game. If nothing but Endorlight will do, unless you're a personal friend of the developer, I'd hold off on buying until at least the features that were supposedly already implemented during the Greenlight phase are realized...\n\nVideo demonstrating some of the menu issues, and a few gameplay clips to illustrate the monotony of the gameplay.","January 6","false","1.0"," 145 of 159 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","145","159","7","24"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenTomator/recommended/428430/","GreenTomator","GreenTomato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenTomator/","1598 products in account","I'm going to be a little brutal here. Yes, I know the game is EA. That does not mean I need to agree with EA in general or the fact that games can come out unfinished just because they are EA. They cost people money (I got this in a bundle not the free giveaway), therefore the product needs to offer an acceptable value for what we pay.\n\nNow, here's my review:\nThe game tries to be similar to others on steam such as Spelunky. And that's great; if you're going to make a game, take inspirationg from the best in the genre. Aiming high is very commendable and totally fine.\nBut the game missed the mark with so many things. First of all, you have everything you will ever need right from the start like many varied weapons and infinite arrow. Secondly, non of the challenge you get from a game like Spelunky. you can easily take a number of hits and still be ok in Endorlight. And finally, non of the charm or character of a game that someone's worked on. There is simply nothing compelling about this product.\n\nBefore anyone plays the game, I highly recommend they remap their keyboard controls to something more practical, the default controls are very impractical. But default controls aside, the wall jumping mechanic in this game is somewhat halfassed, and gives you the impression that the only reason it exists is because the randomly generated levels can occasionally be impractical. "Instead of fixing the programming and making the levels manageable, we'll just allow the players to jump up walls to get out of the crap levels we generate. And therefore save ourselves some work." When you have wall jumps and no proper wall slides, or game mechanics that prop up and benefit from it, that's what I'm going to think.\n\nNow people may get the impression I hate everything about this game, I do not, the look of the game is fine, some of the sprites are actually really nice. The attempt at making a Spelunky like game is something I find very welcome, I love Spelunky. But when the attempt is so bad, it's an insult to real games. So forgive me Spelunky, for mentioning you here. It's like saying my rusty trashbin looks exactly like the satelite NASA launched in June - the difference is that big. This game is broken in a lot of ways. It does not draw me in and make me feel like "I'm going to do this level this time". The controls are clunky and the jumping is iffy. I already have an axe, a whip and infinite arrows the moment I spawn, there's nothing I want to collect or find. And of course, because the game is EA, we have a lot of missing content, like the gems and gold we collect for no reason at all, we simply do not need them.\n\nEDIT:In the comments below, it was brought to my attention that this game contains premade assets, which explains a lot.\n\nPros:- An interesting game on paper, as an idea - not so much in practice\n- looks ok, some sprites are nice though there's a lot of repetition in the level\n\nCons:- Controls aren't great\n- Responsiveness not great\n- The wall jumps suck\n- Not as challenging as it could be\n- Missing content\n\n3/10","February 17","false","2.8"," 62 of 71 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","62","71","2","9"

Opinion is subject to change.I don't think the game's worth the buy right now, in alpha, but this is a work in progress - hopefully the next updates will spice up things a bit.\nOh, and check IndieGala, got this from free out there, maybe it's still avaiable, you'll check the game for yourself.\n\nSo... Uhhh... where do I start...\n\nIf you buy the game and then decide to moan about how unfun and boring and repetetive it is, it's your fault. What you see in the description and screenshots/clips is all true. No lies.\n\nThe thing is, what you see there is also everything the game has to offer.\n\nNo story/lore/anything.\n\nFirst off, I'd like to mention the plot of the game. Lack of it, anyway. You're that little purple-haired guy (who's really fast btw. Like, too fast IMO) with an axe, a whip and a bow. And you're looking for an adventure. Or treasure. Or a sandwich. Or actually I've no idea, there's no story at all - not in description, not in menu, not in the game itself. You're just dropped in some underground-dungeon-thingy, now go and get those sweet hi-scores. Not every game needs an engaging story, that's true, but at least some background on what's going on would be nice. Though if developer decides to not care about it all, that's fine - it's the gameplay that matters most here.\n\nSo, what am I supposed to do in the game?\nWell, that's pretty simple. You spawn at the top of the level, you're supposed to get to the bottom, get through the door to the next level, rinse, repeat. In meantime there's gold to pick up, monsters to slay (or avoid, since they give no gold) and spikes to fall on. The player has three weapons at his disposal - axe with a miserable melee range, whip with a mediocre range (though you can't hit anything in melee) and a bow with a range that probably covers the whole screen. Someone in reviews said that all weapons deal the same damage, but I don't think it's true - a crate needs two bow hits to be destroyed, but axe needs just two.\n\nGets boring/repetetive/monotonous quickly, no permanent unlocks/upgrades/achievs/anything.\nThere are no ways to spend gold, no achievements, no upgrades, nothing. Once you die, you don't even get to see your score - you're just booted back to the main menu. This combined with the boring and repetetive gameplay (if you passed to the level 3, you pretty much saw everything the game has to offer, except for the bosses, which I'll go over soon) makes this game not really worth the 3 euros dev is charging for it.\n\nLack of content..? I mean, after 15 minutes of playing I saw everything the game has to offer, what the hell!?\nThere are 3 "biomes" as the dev calls them. I'll simply call them "plain" (1st level), "green" (2nd) and "red" (3rd). Plain and green don't really differ that much aside from looks and music, but red is just pure hell (we'll speak about that later, honey). I didn't really count, but there are ~10, maybe more enemies. Also clay pots, crates, small chests and huge, red chests. And spikes. And bosses on every 5th floor, which are a joke - they are simply big enemies who have lots of HP. Spam the bow, if he gets too close, walljump high, run to the other side of the room, spam bow. Bosses are a joke.\n\nAnd that's it, everything in the game. Well... almost everything.\n\n2 much michael bay On the subject of explosions, and why there's too many of 'em in the game.\nOkay, so terrain is destructible. That's cool, though player doesn't have much control over it, he has no pickaxes or bombs. So, how do we destroy terrain?\nWITH EXPLOSIVE CRATES AND ENEMIES OF COURSE.\nIf you ever get to play the game, here's a protip : never, EVER destroy crates with an axe. Not even with a whip, still too close. Destroy them with bow. Really, half of the crates are filled with explosives, they explode (actually, sometimes they drop a bomb which explodes a while later, but it never happened to me when destroying a crate, while being in range of explosions. I'm either uber-unlucky or it's a bow-exclusive thing). And explosions take off half of player's HP. So, watch out for crates.\nAnd on 3rd level, there's that red biome, for which "Hell" would be a fitting name. Because there are not only crates, but also those insanely quick monsters, that explode. On contact. Touch them, just graze them, they go boom. And 50% HP less. And with other enemies in red biome taking lots of HP (at least compared to previous enemies), this makes Hell red biome a real pain in the ♥♥♥. And after level 3, 90% of levels are probably the red biome (best try : level 7 reached, I'm not masochistic enough to play this more). That makes this game a really frustrating expierence. Or maybe I'm just that bad.\n\nBut there's 2 player mode!\nHalf-♥♥♥♥♥. The second player is identical to the 1st one, no split-screen or anything, camera is centered on P1 like in single-player.\n\nAnd that's all. No way you're going to be sober AND spend 3 euros on the game. It's not worth it AT ALL right now. I mean, it is kinda fun for a while, but gets boring and frustrating quickly, and there's not enough content to warrant an attention span longer than ~15 minutes. And after those 15 minutes, you're going to say out loud "wow, this game sucks."\n\nThat said, this game is an alpha, dev seems like a nice guy who's just starting out with game-making (though if I was the one who's starting out, I'd rather making something completely free instead of charging 3 MOTHAFOKING EUROS) and things that are supposed to be included in future updates (shops! new biomes! BOMBS FOR THE PLAYER!) sound promising, and the game has some potential. We'll see how it turns out. If you're simply looking for a good game that's in a playable/enjoyable state right now and don't care about helping the dev catch bugs, shape the game etc., spend your 3 euros on something else.","February 15","false","1.1"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","38","42","0","0"

Besides what others have pointed out (that this game is nothing more than a game-builder engine which someone bought and then uploaded as a game itself), this “game” as a game just doesn’t play properly... probably because no one fine-tuned it and made it into an actual game.\n\nGameplay:\n\nI love a good challenge, an unforgiving game with no save spots, no instructions, and no care for fairness, but this isn't that. The main difficulty here will be trying to use terribly clunky and poorly responding controls to navigate a very bland cave. It didn't take me too long to figure out that there were exploding blocks or that you could wall jump, both of which are pretty important pieces of information, seeing as you'd likely be stuck in the first 10 seconds of play without either, but the controls are so terrible you're likely going to be falling into the same holes over and over anyway. Which brings me to level design, which, is obviously randomly generated, but the algorithms and settings it uses are a bit large. You’ll often be stuck in large crevices and holes that you will need to wall jump out of or running long jump off one platform to the next, to the next, to the next with very little margin for error. This of course, would all be fine if the controls were more responsive. Everything seems a bit delayed and a running jump will randomly decide if it wants to register as a jump or you just running off a ledge. This gets increasingly frustrating as you’re trying to run jump and wall jump your way out of these endless overly large gaps and ditches.\n\nPrinciple/Scam:\n\nThis game is slated to leave early access this month, despite being released 2 months and 15 days ago.. of which its entirety it has existed as a ‘buy it off the shelf’ game engine with little to no alterations. I don’t think anyone will be shocked if in the remaining few weeks of this month that the promised additional features aren’t added and the game doesn’t leave early access.\n\nIt’s no surprise valve does a poor job of filtering through these greenlit and early access games, and here is a prime example. This is someone who bought an engine, made no alterations to it, and put it on a distribution platform as early access/beta… while technically correct, it is literally the very bare minimum qualifications for that definition. Posting code and concept art as a “beta” isn’t far off.\n\nI’m not entirely sure if this is just some kid who is overly ambitious and didn’t quite understand that this isn’t newgrounds, or if this is someone who legitimately has malicious intent and wanted to see what kinda crap they could exploit through early access and make money. I think it is $100 to register a game on a steam, and $40 for the engine, so s/he only needs to sell 47 copies to break even. Either way, it’s a terrible “game”, and should be removed from steam either way. This isn’t a virtual refrigerator for children’s game doodles, and it definitely isn’t a platform to sell engine’s to the consumer as games, even if it is “in beta”.\n","March 7","false","5.8"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","2"

Take this review with a grain of salt as problems can get fixed. After my initial experience, I'm in no rush to play it again or rewrite a review.\n\nEndorlight is a 2D retro-style rogue like platformer with broken controls that make the game literally unplayable. While the game is still in what it calls its alpha stage, its still a released product for money and a game this broken is a giant issue even if it can be fixed at a later time. An early release with this many problems can kill a game to the point that the developer might as well scrap this and start a new game.\n\nTo cover the game quick, you're put into a giant side-scrolling map that you need to platform and fight your way to the exit door. Each map is different and generated for you. Its a formula that's been done before and cloned before. In fact Endorlight uses a rogue-like platformer engine that does nothing to set itself apart from the out-of-the-box game engine.\n\nThe game has that retro-style old school charm with good chiptune music and a great art style. That's why this game is such a big disappointment. I want to play it, yet its unplayable in its current state.\n\nSo what's wrong with the controls? Every few seconds the game forgets your controls or nothing responds for another few seconds. Its as if the controls have just turned off. I can alt + tab out of the game and the keyboard still works. When I hop back into the game, the controls are non functional until it decides to let me play.\n\nThere are controls for jump, enter, shoot and melee, but it seems like shoot is the melee... only for a while though. Then the game changes its mind and lets the shoot be the shoot button again. Its baffling why this is such an issue and it hinders any sort of enjoyment out of the game.\n\nOn top of that there are rewindable keys, which is great, but each time you go to rebind them its forgotten what all my keys are. Oh and the cherry on the sundae is the fact that getting out of the menu requires you to restart the game. You'll get a new level generated for you and its just a frustration. Endorlight has two player support, but only keyboard controls for one player, and no keyboard or mouse support, so figure out how to control the second player.\n\nWhen you do get control of your character, the jump is springy. Hold down the jump button and watch your character leap over and over again. These jumps are quick and the game plays a little too fast. You can scale a wall with your wall jumping ability, assuming the controls work. The melee attack can go through a wall and out the other side to hurt an enemy.\n\nIf you are hit, you are dead and death kicks you back to the menu. Since this game is in its alpha stage, there's just nothing here outside of a hand open willing to take your money. Do you believe in this game enough to give your money based on the great look, good sound and potential to have fun?\n\nEndorlight has potential, but this cake needed more time in the oven rather than putting frosting on batter. Even with the game's cheap price, avoid the risk of buying it until the developer makes the right updates to even play the game.","January 10","false","0.5"," 32 of 44 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","32","44","0","8"

Is anyone really surprised?  To sum up what is obviously wrong with this game:\nThe platforming involves a lot of wall-jumping that seems out of place in a roguelike, and gives the game something of a badly implemented Meat Boy ripoff feel.Enemies all went to the goomba school of villainy.  They simply walk (or, rarely, hop) back and forth, typically staying on one platform, and damage you when they touch you.  This goes for bosses, too.  Also, they'll often explode in your face if you're not careful.  For that matter, chests and crates will also explode in your face.When the dev says 'bow', what they actually mean is 'magical rail gun'.  It has unlimited range, shoots in a perfectly straight line, fires rapidly, pierces any number of enemies, can be fired mid-jump, and never runs out of arrows.  Factor in the lack of enemy ranged attacks, and the frequent explosions, and there's rarely a good reason to use the other weapons.  To say it is overpowered is an understatement.   It makes combat easy and dull, and enemies are only ever a threat if you accidentally fall into a crowd of them.  Even 'bosses' will go down in a matter of seconds; just spam the rail gun.\nExplosions destroy terrain, a power you yourself lack (as yet).  It's unlikely, but this has the potential to trap you and leave you unable to progress, which did come very close to happening to me.\nBear in mind, this is an early access game, and there are clear signs that it's a work in progress (e.g., you can collect gold from chests, but have no way of spending it), but even if the dev does fix the glaring issues and expand it a little, I can't see it ever becoming a good game.  Nothing about it shows promise - not the art, not the gameplay, and not even the planned features mentioned in the early access blurb.  Certainly not the story, which is completely nonexistent.  It's just yet another indie roguelike.\n\nUpdate after reading other reviews:  Also, it's apparently just the demo game that comes with the engine it runs on, plus some minor cosmetic changes.  Is this even legal?  I mean, maybe - just, maybe - it'll grow into something more, but as it stands, it looks like the dev is basically charging for a reskin of someone else's lame game.","February 25","false","3.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

He has 3 weapons and can jump.\n\nIt seems like there is not a Story to this Game at all and if there is the game takes no time in explaining it. You will be set in a dungeon with a couple of hearts and if you die you will have to restart the whole thing again. It doesn't seem very hard to get to the end of the level either.\n\nWhat annoyed me personally the most is, you first go into a normal coloured area and afterwards into one that burns your eyes out. It seems in General like the Developer just took a few colours and set the Game after it and the areas. There is no such a thing as "multicoulured" everything is one colour shade or 2 colour shade. I hardly found a bit with more than 3 colours.\n\nI know this is early access but it seems like a toddler could off done that as well if you give him a tutorial and a few colours.\n\nAlso I noticed, one of the Sound bites sounded like it was stolen from the Minecraft Beta.\n\nSo far I do not recommend this game for any kind of price but if you get it for free, than take it. Why? Because its just another Game that fills up your Game Counter.","February 13","false","0.2"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

Not recommended.\n\nIn a little bit more depth, Endorlight is basically a Spelunky-style platformer with randomly generated levels, but with everything else that makes Spelunky actually interesting stripped out - you fully heal between levels, and money is currently useless, leaving the only truly "useful" pickup as hearts, which permanently increase your maximum life by 1 heart.\n\nSo it's basically just about dropping to the bottom of each map while seeing if there's any hearts on the way, and fighting a boss every five levels. By the standards of really early platformers, like ones for the NES? It'd have been pretty good. However, in 2016 there are hundreds, if not thousands, of better games in the genre, including very similar games in Spelunky and CaveBlazers - the latter apparently being by the designer of the engine this game is based on. Buy and play one of those instead.","April 28","false","0.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slowacki/recommended/428430/","slowacki","Slowacki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slowacki/","1605 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is an early access review of the state of the game on 17.01.2016\nEndorlight is a rogue-like dungeon explorer in the style of Spelunky (ish), but rather watered down. The game's point is to (at least for now) pass from one almost same level to another, while gathering gold and gems on your way lower and lower.\n\nConcept As I've already said, the game is inspired by Spelunky (seems so). So gather monies, kill enemies, avoid traps and get to the end of the level. That said, at this moment, it's like Spelunky without some of the crucial features like: shops, bombs, ropes, bosses and pretty much - a point to all of this. You've got 3 weapons to use, but to be honest, axe and the whip feel almost the same (I think there might be slight a difference in the range?)\n\nGameplay The gameplay is pretty smooth and reactive, haven't noticed any glaring issues here. That said, there are a few minor annoyances. The gold and gems are unpickable for a while after falling out of a container, which made me go back to repick the items which I thought I had already picked. Another thing is the lack of possibility to break chests/pots/crates while standing on them, except by using a bow(?). There's also an issue with the whip that its range is actually shorter than the animation indicates. The last thing that really annoyed me, however, is not a bug is that the spikes will always instantly kill you when you fall on them, but there's a certain height, if you fall from they don't do anything to you. Sometimes the level design forces you to climb on a wall and jump on spikes and it's a guessing game if they will one-hit-ko you or will you actually manage to land safely.\n\nLevel DesignAs far as I noticed the levels are generated procedurally on each playthrough. Quite often you might find areas that are not accessible without being lucky with a bomb monster or a crate with a bomb. There is also a possibility that an unfortunate bomb will leave you trapped in an area and you'll be forced to restart.\n\nGraphicsThe game looks pretty nice at first, if you like the oldschool pixelated graphics. After several levels it gets really dull though because you'll always visit levels in the same biome.\n\nMusic and SoundThere's only one song and, as far as I know, you can't turn it off. It gets repetitive quite quickly and you just stop paying attention to it or mute the sound altogether after a while. There's also a problem with sounds being played every time you press the attack button, instead of when you actually take a swing.\n\nContentAt this point, the game is really poor in terms of content. There are basically 4 types of enemies (+ a few reskins that just have more hp or slightly more damage on touch). You can gather gold, but there's no way to make any use out of it. There are 3 biomes, two of which share the exact same pool of monsters and neither happens to have anything that stands out from another (apart from the color). There's also no sense of progression - you can just jump down each level and proceed to another as there's not much point in killing anything or gathering gold anyway.\n\nOverallThe game is at very early level of development and you should buy it only if you want to support the process of creation (hopefully). There's just no point in playing the game at the moment, as the amount of content will only keep you in it for half an hour or so (unless you're waiting for the cards to drop).","January 17","false","0.9"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","1"

It goes perfectly straight, through enemies, has unlimited ammo and basically the same damage as melee weapons.\n-Some levels are upright impossible. I met spikes occupying the only way, enemies spawning in my face and falling traps. And no, there are no checkpoints. Restart and restart and rage quit.\n-Some enemies are just terrible. In levels 3-4, super fast white things that deal touch damage and explode in your face when you kill them. Cats that deal more damage than half of all your health, and are often impossible to avoid. I never got in level 5, but it is probably even worse.\n-Money is totally useless, except as score.\n-Crates and chests either give you useless money or explode in your face.\n-There is no explaination of anything.\n-Walljumping is painful.\n-The graphics are so blurry that they make me blind.\n\n-At least the music is somewhat good.

You see, there are crates and enemies in this game that explode and change the environment around them. This would be all well and good if it wasn't for the fact that you will find that sometimes those explosions will trap you and/or make the exit completely unreachable. Sure, you can save game, go to the main menu, and continue, but that'll put you back at the beginning of the level. It's not game breaking thanks to that solution, but since whether a crate will have explosives in it or not is completely up to RNG, it's definitely annoying.","April 9","false","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And its not just items, sometimes jumps, and spikes the spikes i have fell right on and nothing happened then slightly jumped on for instant death, its not very consistant. Overall The game doesn't seem hard enough honestly, especially if you have played spelunky.\n\nI do like the fact that it is a 2 player game, and the Music loop is dope a touch of 80s and upbeatness.\n\nI wish the arrows shot in both directions since you use them both for arrow keys, this way I could do a fade away shot while falling backwards but its all good lol.\n\nI like the colors of the backround on the title screen however I wish some part of it was animated even if it was just the name glowing or the backround slightly changing tone, Maybe a title crawl with a backstory that would be cool. Instead of a huge box with controls have some sort of picture from the game and a smaller box with the controls it would luck much cooler with these adaptaptions.\n\nI don't recall seing a store to spend money anywhere?\nAdd a store, add bombs to blow up walls and other cool gadgets like spelunky lol\n\nOverall game isn't bad just think it needs some work.\n\n6/10 in current state, I could see it 8/10 if adjustments are made making this have potential to be a great game.\n\n\n\n\n","January 11","true","0.4"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","9","20","3","0"

Right this second, it's still worth the price tag to kill a boring afternoon.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzDWWibyUrI\n\nIt's difficult to review Endorlight when its so early in development, but I feel like this is a game people should really take a look at - especially for the price. It's too simple to complain about anything, and since this is "pre-alpha" and it's hard telling when this review's being read, I'll try to just touch on the current foundation that's laid and speculate on the potential of what the game could be. On the tin it looks like another indie platformer with permadeath but that's not accurate at all.\n\nWhile the levels are currently short and compact, they're randomly generated on every floor. The monsters, traps, crates, chests - everything. In the future this completely random level generation can bring on some really interesting layouts rather than just a sea of magma with platforms to jump across. The character's wall-jump ability makes it seem like we could see some very vertical and challenging levels and boss fights as we go further, and with certain enemies exploding on death and taking out terrain it's possible to dig (or explode via planned bomb weapon) your way through. I imagine this goes for the enemies, too (planned digger enemy). With all the variety, some levels might be a sort of "race to the finish" because of falling platforms (planned feature) and how many enemies there are at the start (a load of baddies led by a digging enemy as the fuse?) while other levels require a bit more finesse and tactical jumping to get through unharmed. While you could just rush toward where you think the exit is (it's not made obvious by the map - probably intentional) you'd be hurting yourself in the long-run with all the missing loot. Enemies don't currently drop anything, but crates and chests are strewn about the levels and give gold upon destruction.\n\nGold currently has no use, but it's pretty obvious this is intended to be currency for the yet-to-be-introduced shops. I imagine shops will be selling heart containers for more life, potions to heal you, arrows for the bow (surely it's not always infinite ammo?), ammo for the gun (planned weapon), bombs (also planned weapon), etc. Taking your time and saving your gold as you progress can be difficult on some levels due to the layout and enemies, but would be worth it. I'd like to think the shops will be alone on their own level to prevent a player from seeing a shop and THEN wanting to full-clear to afford the wares. While this isn't a major thing, it'd be nice to see some reward / punishment for different playstyles. Hauling it through every level to get deeper may have its benefits (maybe?) but taking your time yields shop goodies, but at the risk of losing your life to the enemies that are everywhere.\n\nThe enemies are really simple currently. You standard slime with raptor-like capabilities regarding its jump, the thing that blows up on death, green, uhh... things that aren't really that aggressive, etc. They vary by appearance but the general premise is the same - don't get touched by one. It's dangerous to use your melee weapons so the bow it a great go-to (unless the terrain is really bumpy as you can't aim vertically and there's no arrow drop or "charging" the bow for adjusting trajectory) but at the cost of arrows, which are currently infinite. The melee weapons might double as tools, but right now there's nothing to tool. A gun, hatchet, and bomb are planned weapons so it's hard to tell what the enemies (and bosses) will be like, but it sounds like staying at range is the way to go.","January 20","true","0.7"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","0"

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!\n═══════════════════════════════════\nOVERVIEW\nEndorlight\n\nThis game is in an alpha state at the time of this review, With that being said, it is still rather fun to play. It has many similarities to games like Spelunky or Steamworld Dig. It is a platfomer that utilizes procedural generation to construct the level and place enemies. You get 3 weapons to use which makes it rather fun: (1) axe for short range, (2) whip for medium range, (3) bow for long range. You decend each level to reach the exit while picking up treasure along the way. It offers local coop which works well with the wired xbox 360 controllers I have (I am not able to vouch for other brands). Just as a warning, there is friendly fire.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/428430/\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\nPros\nLocal coop\nVariety of weapons\nBoss fights\nCons\nBoth players in coop use the same sprite\nThe deadzone on the controller joystick needs to be adjusted by the devs to avoid ghosting the player\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nThis game is in alpha at the time of this review, but is still very playable. The local coop was fun and the friendly fire added a bit of nostalgia for games from the 80s and early 90s. If you like coop platformers like Spelunky or Steamworld Dig, this game is one to keep on your radar. For $3 USD you can support this developer in creating a great game.\n\n7/10\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow  Lot's O Giveaway's  group curations  here !","February 27","true","0.5"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","0"

There is no way to beat it. From my point of view, it's not much to look at but has some cool music and has a nice Retro feel to the game.\nI got this with a Steam key and I don't advice paying the full price for this. There really isn't anything worth plaything the game for except for some Steam cards you can get from it.\nPersonal score: 4/10 but I'm recommending it yes simply because it makes a nice game to play when on-the-go and doesn't take that many MB to  download either.","March 9","true","0.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

There is not point in playing it - you can collect gold but there is no use to it, you can battle monsters but there is no reason to do this as there is no levelling system, you can go down but who cares?\n\nReally, this may be a good game, but mister Developer, please consider doing some changes. Please try Vertical Drop Heroes game and see why it's so rad.\n\nI give thumbs down to this version of the game.
