I can now replay 20 of these to achieve a star for completing them with a single attempt. Presumably, the other 30 levels are either too easy or depend on blind luck, much like a pachinko machine.  (Or maybe there were only 20 levels, and the numbering is weird? Who knows.) There are two or three challenges where you need to think out of the box.\n\nThere's no storyline, the game has been designed for touch interfaces to the point where there's no task bar icon, you need to enter your name using the onscreen keyboard, and you drag or click on everything, which doesn't exactly suit levels like the one with the two flippers.\n\nI can see this being a good-looking very short (45 minutes) time-waster on a touch device, but for a desktop game it feels overpriced. If you like the art style, try Little Wheel[www.kongregate.com] instead, for free.","August 3, 2015","false","0.9"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","28","33","2","1"

Not that it’s so difficult, but I needed some time to think.\n\nHow unfortunate that as humans we are only able to grasp a concept through comparisons, games perhaps being a more extreme example of that limitation. But to compare based on the most superficial aspects is just ridiculous. Those who see Collisions on the Store Page, then immediately think “Limbo” clearly got no further than a quick glance. Those saying “NightSky” are perhaps a bit closer to the mark, but still quite a ways off way off. (Actually, I’ve yet to finish either of those two games. Collisions is much easier, considerably more inexpensive.)\n\nCollisions is a very nice game all on its own. The goal is perhaps the simplest possible, while also a metaphor for all life: move a ball from Point A to Point B, then again and again…. through some 50 levels using the simplest of mouse clicks and drags. If you want the challenge of NightSky (now I’M doing it!) you may be disappointed, because Collisions is essentially a pleasant way to spend an hour or so, whether you’re an 8-year old child, or an old person with time on their hands, such as myself, who doesn’t always want to start the day with a life or death challenge. (But then again….SPOILER.)\n\nNone of these Collisions challenges spend more than a moment even in the neighborhood of seeing the shadow of rage-inducing off in the distance, but can nonetheless be satisfying to resolve. If you love pinball as I and most of my friends do, you’ll see that the DEV must as well to base some of the most interesting (IMHO) levels on hitting a ball with a flipper, so s/he must be pretty OK. Some levels aren’t challenges at all, but simply movements on the player’s part to create a mood, or teach an action that may be encountered later. In fact, if I still taught or had grandchildren I would likely use this game for bonding, or perhaps for evaluating a child’s abilities. (Or even an adult’s.) A very good diagnostic tool I should think, mostly because it really is fun. And so much easier to continue to the next level than to contend with the challenge of walking away while still wanting to see what comes next.\n\nOne of the more enjoyable aspects of Collisions are the comments (often hints) placed on each level. They display some of the humanity of the DEV, and they are as welcome as they might be out of context in this review.\n\nThis is one game that should be played to the very end, as the ending is both amusing and disturbing, and is a great comment on the degree to which we assign meaning to our lives (my ID being a similar comment), and the world we live in….for now. If you can get this game for $2, it’s a must buy.\n","August 3, 2015","true","5.1"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","18","24","2","7"

The design is quite nice but derivative and the graphics fuzzy. There are 50 levels, some take only a couple of seconds, some take far too long due to the inconsistency and exacting demands of the physics system.\n\nYou goal is to move a black ball from entrance to exit via hitting it with pinball paddles, opening and closing sliders, setting up rebounds and most importantly timing everything correctly.\n\n47 of the 50 levels are quite simple while of the other 3, one requires the pixel perfect arrangement of two sliders to set up a ricochet, another requires you to use a demolition ball to hit the ball into the exit and is endlessly frustrating while the third requires you to release another ball to hit the main ball twice but sadly due to the mentioned, we'll call it randomness to be nice, if you release the ball at the same time you might get it on the first try or the 100th and there is really nothing you can do to improve your chances.  I quite liked the arkanoid/pinball level even if the control system couldn't really handle it.\n\n\nAnother in the long list of minimalist hour long puzzle games on steam, some are great, some are terrible and some are just meh.

Not only will you NOT DIE hundreds of times over, as you are surely doomed to do in Limbo/Feist (your "character" in this instance is a ball making its way through semi-industrial, pinball-styled "landscapes")...but furthermore, the nature of Collisions' puzzles are perhaps best described by the very "zen" catchphrases which appear on screen, such as "Patience is the companion of wisdom". Indeed.\n\nNormally I'm not a great fan of such Buddhist-y musings, but in the context of this game they're perfectly appropriate, if not exactly groundbreakingly profound. So who would I recommend this game to? Well, anyone who can get behind a non-violent, mostly timing-based puzzle game, which isn't all that "long" (it took me a little over an hour to complete) or especially "hard" (I'm actually quite rubbish at these kinds of games)...yet has a nice visual and aural aesthetic which ushers one into a state of relative calm and so on and so forth and blah-blah-blah. In fact, it's a wonderful antidote to the frequently "troll"-ish nature of gaming and the internet in general, as it has a tendency to tell you when you're "doing great!" and what-not; as opposed to, say, a game of Left 4 Dead 2 Versus, in which you will be informed by teammates of how "♥♥♥♥" you are at least once every two to three minutes of gameplay (and that's if you're playing with the NICER folks who play Left 4 Dead 2...the TRUE ♥♥♥-holes would've simply "kicked" you two to three minutes INTO the game, period).\n\nSo if it's a relatively serene, laid-back, and only ever-so-slightly "frustrating" time you're looking for, and you have about an hour to spare, this could well be a game for you. I'm not too sure about the four dollar price-tag (I got it for two), and there's obviously a ♥♥♥♥-tonne of very angry people out there in Steamland who will complain even if they pay well under a buck for a mere hour's gameplay, so if you're one of those people...YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. It's short, you don't get to shoot anyone, and there aren't any virtual lap-dances. So if you fancy a game which makes you feel like a bad-♥♥♥, mo'-♥♥♥♥in' PIMP, this may not be for you.

It seems like they put a lot of effort into the engine. Good marks there.\n\nI will not be recommending it for the following ( 4 ) reasons.\n1. It took me longer to pay for and install the game than it did to complete. Needs many many many more levels.\n2. Oversimplicity.  To me, this is a mini-game that belongs in a bigger title. No real nuance, just physics fun.\n3. Any degree of difficulty is out of your control. If a level calls for timing, there are usually other elements that disrupt that timing.  When this happens it feels like you're at a pinball machine with the plunger, but no paddles. Frustrating for the wrong reasons.\n4. Please add a "point of no return" feature on levels where (if you miss) you have to spend agonizing seconds waiting for your ball to roll into the wrong hole before you can focus on trying again.  On the level that I'm thinking of, just move the failure threshold from the point the ball goes off screen, to the point where the ball hits the "floor". Then when you miss the correct hole, you're already thinking about your next shot.\n\n\n\nFix these things and the game will be worth $10-$20. As is, it's not quite worth the price. Even though the price is so low. Still, it's fun.","September 15, 2015","false","1.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

I liked the puzzles that reminded me of the board game, Downfall, with rotating cogs that you drop the ball into, but there were only a couple of those. The puzzles are a mix of skill, timing, and luck... mostly luck. A few of them are fun and well designed, some are okay, and the rest rely too much on luck and involve too much waiting between attempts.

Probably worth the price (you can eat 2 chease burgers in  less than 30  minutes, right? )\n\nThe reason i don't recommend is, is due to the high potential of using these various mechanicals, but they never get the chance to properly interact with each other in a complex way.\n\nIn quite too many levels, you either just have to time 1 part right or you are learning about using some new part. Then you get a few extra  levels where that part is used in some manner.\n\nThere are a few places, where they combine them and make it interesting. Ex, the wheel with a slider attached, used to convert angular velocity into a kinetic force upon the sphere you guide though. But you can count them on a single hand.\n\nSo all in all, while the price isn't something to rant about, it is neither a  game which will satisfy your hunger if you want a platform-physic-puzzle.

Color schemes and contrast were very pleasant. It was the very shortness of the game that I least enjoyed. Half the time I felt like I was being taught a new dynamic aspect to be utilized later on in the game. When, in fact, it was just that level being played out and not much was expanded from that. The difficult levels seemed to be overcome by either very precise timing or pure chance. When your timing was off, it wasn't as though you were frustrated in your lack of precision. It was more a feeling of "oh i'll just do this over and over again until the timing happens to coincide".

It's basically trial and error for many of the challenges where you don't know exactly when to click. Add on top of this the often long reset times for another attempt, and the game quickly feels frustrating and more based on luck, rather than actual puzzle solving.","December 10, 2015","false","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

When you look at it, it doesn't look bad at all - it looks like a fun timing-based puzzle game, and the levels compliment the physics quite nicely - but the problem is that the timing is more often trial-and-error than actually getting the right timing, the puzzles are very rarely hard at all, and the biggest problem is that there's a LOT of waiting around; either from waiting for the level elements to fit into place on their own, or from waiting for the ball to come back when you make a mistake. The whole thing just feels like it's made more to look impressive than to be actually fun to play.","December 12, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Nice music and art style. Some of the puzzles are intuitive and based on reactions, physics and problem solving. Some are unfortunately based on trial and error, or waiting 30 seconds for something to set up, and if you miss you have to wait another 30 seconds. Others are based solely on luck which is annoying. Game is also SUPER short, as being finished in around 45 min. Still worth picking up on sale.","October 25, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
