I played it all day long and it was a nice break from life XD. Though there are some things that might be a bit off, Starlight Vega is a very enjoyable visual novel. Now onto the review\n\nStory\nI find the story to have some very strong points but also some weak ones. The story overall is very interesting from the book, to how Lyria became trapped in stone, and the curse plaguing Vega. My problem though (and this depends on the route) is that thehe story can be weak at times. I think the story stayed pretty strong in Lyria's route. Not only do you find out who Aria's grandpa is, but you also get to know how Lyria came to be in the stone. Same goes for Melody's route to. Where it falls weak though is when we get to the curse and the book itself at times. I sometimes felt like the curse put on Vega wasn't shown enough and wished to feel more of that dread. I admit in Scherza's route that the curse is a bit better played out, but it kind of ends just like that. Still the story was written well and I will give major kudos to how the creator handle the intimate scenes.\n\nCharacters\n\nOne of the best parts of the game and they are what hold the story together. I'll give my thoughts on all of the main five.\n\nAria- Our main character. She is an average yet interesting girl who is put into a tough situation. I'll say Aria is pretty likable. She has a personality and tries her best to deal with all these new things thrown at her. I admit sometimes I kind of wish she had more of a spark, but for what we got I did enjoy her and she made the romance feel true with the girls.\n\nLyria- I think the best girl. From the moment I saw her I really did enjoy her personality and flirtatious, yet sometimes forceful attitude. Her route I believe was the strongest and I felt Aria and she were the best match. What I liked most about her route was the pacing with the romance. It felt very genuine and the pair had good chemistry. Also her story felt the most complete and I kind of wish the bad guy was in all of the routes since it made more sense. If I had to pick something I didn't like....well I can't think of it XD. Lyria was really a good and well thought out character. My fav to.\n\nMelody- Aria's best friend. From the moment I saw this girl's design I knew what she'd be like and I was right. Now don't get me wrong, Melody is a good character and the type of friend I'd want. I admit though she was the most boring of the three, but don't get me wrong, I still liked her character. Her love and care for Aria was really sweet and though I found her route to be the less interesting of the three, I did care for her. Only thing is I think she'd be better as a friend to Aria, but that's just me. Her route was cute though and she really has some beautiful CG's\n\nScherza-I'll admit, I was a bit surprised by this character. I knew she'd be the cold demon and some may find her not too likable. However Scherza, especially in her own route, shows a great deal of sadness and loneliness through the story due to the events in the past. What surprised me even more was she wasn't a Tsun type character despite being cold. In fact I really felt for the girl in all the routes. Her relationship with Aria was done pretty well to and that last CG in her route is pretty amazing. I did feel like Scherza was the second best matched for Aria to. Some points I didn't like about her route was how sometimes it felt rushed. Though the curse is touched upon more and you do feel sorry for Vega, I wished that it was a bit longer to show more of the problem Vega was facing But the creator did do a good job with pacing in her route, so it's not that big of a problem\n\nSid- At first I hated this little guy, but he does grow on you. I can't say much without spoiling anything, but I'll tell you that you will feel sorry for him as you read.\n\nArt\n\nArt is Starlight Vega is very good. I love how the sprites have  unique style. I admit I wish they had some more outfit variations. It was odd to go from sprites and then to CGs where the girls are wearing something entirely different. Still the sprites are very well done.\n\nCGs are exceptional. Every single one was done very well and I'll tell you I'll be looking back at them XD. If you can save them do, because Razz did an awesome job.\n\n\nBackgrounds are pretty good to. I admit some are better then others, but I never got put off by any. I think the demon castle had some of the best backgrounds. I do think that the castle bed rooms needed just small variations as well, but that's a minor thing.\n\nMusic\n\nMusic is good. Some songs may be a bit off putting, but overall the track was nice hearing. I never turned it off.\n\nClosing Notes\n\nStarlight Vega is a very good and  fun visual novel. It's the first one I've played straight through in a while. The characters, art and story are overall great and I thank the creator for doing a GxG visual novel that can be enjoyed by all people and not just a certain group. Another thing I appreciate is how she handled the intimate scenes. They are done very well and I feel like if she did a more adult game she'd handle them well.\n\nAnyway if you're looking for a fun, pure GxG, romance story this is it. The price is far and I think you'll have a good time reading it I know I did =).\n\nRating-8/10","April 14","true","6.8"," 47 of 50 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","47","50","2","0"

While exploring the upstairs study one night, she and her friend Melody accidentally unleash a flirtatious demon named Lyria, who spent the past fifty years in a stone. After freeing her from her prison, the two become attached by a ‘lifestone’, which means Lyria can’t go far from Aria without feeling repercussions, and vice versa. Now Aria, an ordinary highschool girl, must find a way to free herself from Lyria, who seems to crave the exact opposite. Add to that the increasingly realistic dreams plaguing Aria, the sexual tension between Aria and a select few girls around her, and the supernatural phenomena – it seems like Aria’s life will never be the same again.\n\nThe story overall is interesting but I was not captivated by it and it has failed to immerse me into the story because the individual routes each has their weak points in terms of there were some important points that were not explored on that individual route, for example 1 of the routes did not explain or even hinted of how Lyria got trapped in the stone. I am not sure which route is that. Apparently among all the character routes I liked the harem ending the most it felt more interesting than the other “good routes” as it touches on almost every topic and the characters in harem ending has more “backbone”they all group together and fought “Reid”.\n\nCharacter wise I like Scherza: Current Queen of the demon realm. She has a very icy personality and little like for humans. The pacing her route is alright it is not to fast or slow. The main reason I liked her from the start is provably because of her looks and character design she fits into the character personality perfectly, she looks so intimidating and “royal like”.\n\nAudio and Visual elementsVisual Elements –The visual elements is provably the most distinctive feature in the particular visual novel [well for me] I absolutely adore the artwork and art style being used in this visual novel and it is very consistent with character sprites,  not to mention the backgrounds are very beautiful as it compliments nicely with the overall art style.\n\nAudio Elements – The music sets the mood for every situation, but it is not memorable and did not leave an impact on me. I think they could have done better for the music because I felt that certain soundtracks was repeated too many times and some were just plain boring.\n\nTo Sum Up To sum up do I recommend this visual novel? Simple answer, yes. People who likes yuri will definitely enjoy Starlight Vega as it is very heavily yuri themed and the romance does not feel forced. Something else worth mentioning is that for the yuri scenes they are all very descriptive and detailed, overall an enjoyable read from the start to finish.\n\nI have been provided a review copy for Starlight Vega but it has no impact on this review in any way.\n\nClick here for a review with images etc[azusantiara.com]","April 22","true","10.8"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","32","34","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lady_Dawn/recommended/377690/","Lady_Dawn","Lady Dawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lady_Dawn/","1305 products in account","Starlight Vega is a yuri visual novel. It allows you to make some choices here and there that guide you towards a particular ending, but otherwise you'll be spending your time reading--which is fine, because the story is engaging and complex.\n.Story.\nIt's so difficult to comment on this without spoiling anything, so I'll just say that it's cute and fluffy at times, raunchy and suggestive at others. There's political intrigue, humour, fantasy/magical elements, supernatural elements like ghosts and other realms, combat, romance, non-explicit limes... The list goes on. I imagine there's something here for everyone, especially if you're a fan of reading.\n\nThere were only a few typos, which I greatly appreciated. Thank you for your level of polish, Starlight Vega, you beautiful beast. There are also a couple of plot holes (and one big enough to fall into), but I was so focused on the *adorable* romance that I didn't really mind all that much.\n\n.Game play.\nWhat are you, new here? This is a visual novel. Click your mouse and read the text that appears.\n\nYou can save and load at any point, barring when you're in the middle of making a decision, simply by pressing the right mouse button, which is handy. There's also a gallery for all of the CG you unlike by triggering events in the story or as part of the normal playthrough.\n\nYou can play in full screen or windowed, though I preferred the latter because full screen gives you black bars on the sides.\n\n.Soundtrack.\nThere was never a moment where I felt as though the music didn't suit what was going on in-game. Romantic scenes featured softer, slower tracks and fight scenes featured upbeat electronic scores. The background music kept me immersed in the story, never drawing away from what was happening, but also making what I read that much more memorable because it was so well-suited.\n\nHell, I went to the store while playing to see if the store had the option to purchase the soundtrack separately.\n\n-A minor gripe is that some of the sound effects used for things like gusts of wind and magical attacks sound a little hokey.\n\n.Art style.\nThe game looks great. Kudos to whoever handled the art.  It's all done in a brightly-coloured anime style, and the backgrounds share the same feel.\n\nThe main character's portrait, which is almost always presented in the bottom left corner of the screen, changes expression depending on what's being said. It's a nice touch and very well detailed. The other characters have a host of different positions and facial expressions that are cycled through, which is another nice touch to make them seem more than just some beautifully-rendered image.\n\n-The backgrounds were pretty limited and, though the game takes place in a variety of settings, you only ever see the same series of images; i.e, the bits where you're at school utilize the same image of the woods that you see when you're at home. Again, this is minor. The backgrounds were still nice to look at, it was just a matter of taking a moment to ground myself in what setting the action had moved to.\n\n.Characters.\n\nThere are eight main ones who get detailed portraits. Everone else is just a name on the screen. The cast is varied without fulfilling too many over-used tropes like the emo pretty boy or the girl who wants his attention. Not a single character was annoying, which I find tends to happen a lot with this kind of game. That's a major plus.\n\nCharacters include demons, humans, and a wyvern. His name is Sid. He's adorable.\n\nAgain, not much to be said here without spoiling anything.\n\n.Bottom line.\nIf you're in the market for a visual novel, this is definitely worth your money. The game looks good, it's well-written, and you'll get multiple playthroughs out of it. I adore this game. It's one of the better visual novels I've played on Steam; I'm only stopping here because it's very late at night. Needless to say, I'm hooked. I whole-heartedly give this game my recommendation and I'll be back in the morning to get the other endings.","April 16","true","3.9"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","31","34","2","0"

The choices are timed well and keeps the reader involved in the story and decision making process.\n\nFor a new indie developer Razz did an exceptional job that  should make the Japanese big budget VNs take notice.\n\nWith that said there were a couple of typo and grammar errors which does happen in all VNs but nothing that would detract from the story itself.\n\n","April 14","true","18.9"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paperrabbit/recommended/377690/","paperrabbit","Paper Rabbit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paperrabbit/","229 products in account","If you have any amount of interest in yuri, buy this. Yes, it's worth the full price of $15 USD. Just buy it.\n\n\nStarlight Vega is a fairly light hearted love comedy with LOTS of yuri in it. Just subtext? No! This is 100% bona fide yuri with love confessions, kissing, and PG-13 love scenes. (I would still not play this in front of your parents.) Art-wise, it's adequate enough. It's not bad, just adequate. Soundtrack is enough to set the mood. A single run through can easily be done under 7 hours depending on how fast you read. A complete run with old scene skipping took me 12 hours for all endings. Now for the nitpickings.\n\nThere MAY be some slight spoilers. Read the next paragraph at your own discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\nPLOT\n\nAlmost 4th ending exclusive:\n\nThere are definitely moments of "it's magic I ain't gotta explain ♥♥♥♥" going on. Sometimes there are story transitions where it may feel a tad forced. This becomes pretty apparent in the unlocked ending with the way the antagonist is disposed of. Wait a gosh darn minute, we had such a pain in the rear time dealing with this twerp in every other route and all of a sudden it's Persona style All Out Attack on the jerk. All of a sudden everyone but the MC just figured out the quickest way to get rid of curse was to beat the living undead ♥♥♥♥ out of a malevolent spirit. What da hell? You girls just reconcile out of the blue ridiculously quickly. For one thing, Scherza's abandonment issue was only really addressed in Lyria's route where she finally learned what really happened 50 years ago. Even in Scherza's route, she's one heck of an ice queen to woo. The only times Aria really ever interact with Scherza one on one was in a dream when they haven't been kidnapped to Vega. There have been instances where she does talk with Aria in a more private fashion, but nothing as deep as whatever happened in Scherza's own route enough for Scherza to get romantically interested in Aria...? To sum it up, the 4th ending just seems to parachute in from out of nowhere. There ARE attempts at trying to make this work, but the progress at how we arrived at this point just seems loosely held together by... harem anime logic. Yes, Kickstarter incentive and etc. I really enjoyed it but it could've done with more polishing.\n\nChoices\n\nYes, there are choices. Choices that easily dictate which route you are going to end up on and some do seemingly absolutely nothing. For all the choices, I wish at there are things I can do more of. Ok, the bracelet in the study. It was briefly brought up and never heard from again. Could've been funny if that was somehow used. The whole thing between Lyria and Scherza was unfortunately only properly addressed in Lyria's route. Aria has no say whatsoever regarding what actually transpired even though she may have come across the diary and whatever Lyria told her. She has 0 influence whatsoever as a main character and I find that very unfortunate as I do want the two of them to get along.\n\nCharacters\n\nI adore the characters: Aria, Melody, Lyria, Scherza, and Rhihannon. I'm tempted to say Aria has some issues as a MC, but I've seen much worse performance from otome games so I guess she got just enough done. I feel for Melody, a lot. She really got the shaft in not her endings. Such a good trooper and super friend. Lyria is just Lyria, fairly straight forward. Scherza is a slight mixed bag due to her behaviors in her own route and whatever happened in the 4th ending. The antagonist is... weeeeeaaaaak. Not enough build up. OOoooh, sinister silhouette. That should totally be enough to give it away. Not quite. I want to dig in into whatever happened back then. It's all just he says vs she says. Seriously, was it really as bad as it was thought or was there enough room for different interpretations? Scherza does paint the situation different than what was described by everyone else. More plot points please.\n\n\n\nThe story definitely had a few hiccup points, but overall it holds together well enough for me to gloss over the minor pitfalls it have. Would I recommend this to anyone interested in yuri game? Absolutely. I would try to sell this to anyone who's open to a light hearted visual novel. I got great milage out of it.\n\n\n\n\nMore nitpicks\nI need more save slots though. There just isn't enough for every choice in every route.\nPlease check your grammar and spelling again. There are definitely a few mistakes. I think there is also some coding issue in the special thanks section where someone' name shows up as 4 rectangles... I get there are a LOT of people who donated in the Kickstarter, but that's quite the speed at which you are scrolling...\nNot everyone plays visual novel on a daily basis. Nowhere was it mentioned that CONTROL key equals fast forwarding. Interface is already incredibly bare boned and could do with that option instead of relying on the keyboard.\nSome bugs with the CG not saving properly in the gallery.","April 16","true","18.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

CONS: - story is sort of basic, with heavy focus on the dangum romance - battle animations are boring as all git out - satanic themes and lots of lesbian stuff and racy outfits. as a Christian man i cannot reccomend to other born again christians.

The fundament is solid and enjoyable. Only problem I see is its shallowness due to fast and superficial pacing and writing. With its 10-14 hours playtime it's by far not one of the longest and most detailed VNs. It manages to convince you nonetheless, as long as you dont expect too much detail.\n\nSecondly: The characters.\n\nWhats brings the story to life are its inhabitants and Starlight got a small, but nice and loveable cast. The main heroine is easy to understand and follow, and takes you into her world quite easily. Furthermore, the three love interests are enjoyable and realistic. Once again, a little more depth wouldnt hurt, but you can still get into them.\n\nThirdly: The music.\n\nHere does SV shine the most. The music is on point and well made. Enhances the atmosphere perfectly and gives each scene alot more depth and feeling.\n\nLastly: The scenery/visual composition:\n\nNot out of this world, but also not too shabby. It fulfills it duty and gives you a visual impression of the story and its characters.

Those are pretty rare, so its nice to have one that wasnt contrived as male fantasy porn.\n\nThats not to say that it doesnt have its cliches, and the story is pretty straightforward (not too many surprises) but the characterization is done well enough to get you to like the characters and keep playing. (for Scherza and Melody that is)\n\nLyria's route, while i still enjoyed it, felt very two dimensional. You dont really get many chances to see what motivates her until after you've already successfully 'romanced' her.\n\nStill, good game, was an enjoyable 7 hours, would play again.","May 1","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Yuri felt kind of ehh. I personally disliked Lyria the most because she was a backstabbing ♥♥♥♥♥ who brought you and your friend into Starlight Vega knowing fully well that her crazy sister is going to sacrifice one of you to save her cursed world or whatever. However, if you played her storyline, it was her fault anyway. Like some already said, it would have been for interesting to know more about Starlight Vega and what the heck the actual curse was. LIKE its been 50 years, and they're still cursed.  WITH WHAT THO!? I think this game was too short, and could have been better if there was more time invested in it. DOn't get me wrong, i still enjoyed the game nevertheless. Just felt the game ended way too abruptly,  especially on the good parts.\n\nBUT honestly, I think this game is way over priced for it's content.","April 22","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
