Unfortunately gameplay is a bit slow, even for an ultima-like game. Doing almost anything in this game is fun but one thing: Walking. And there's a lot of walking. Walking through forests, walking through beaches, walking through deserts... and even more walking. The game has interesting dungeons and towns, filled with many secrets and details, unfortunately other locations are there just to be walked through. That is why I would rate this game as decent: It's a very enjoyable RPG, except for tedious walking through wilderness.","May 2, 2014","true","0.7"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","41","48","0","0"

Was that good time? Definitely yes, I spent a great time with that. But that doesn't mean that every player will like it as I do. First of all, you must be real RPG fan, and what is most important, you must be old-school gamer. Because this game is true old-school RPG with very poor animations and weak graphics (as for today). But if you're ok with that, you will like it. It has good story, turn based combat and high difficulty level.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you're old-school RPG fan, this is what you need.\nIf you're modern RPG fan but you want to try something classic, this is good choice.\nIf you're not a fan either of RPG and old-school, you shouldn't even read this, that might harm you.\n\nLike this review?

("western RPG" here means "opposite of JRPG")\n\nEschalon is solid. It's not exemplary, it's not bad. It's the kind of game that would metascore in the 70-75 bracket, filled with games that are worth your time if you're a fan of the genre.\n\nThe story is cliche; save the world by finding the macguffins and slaying the big bad. That doesn't necessarily make it bad. It's not memorable, but it works.\n\nFor the most part, combat in Eschalon is a game of numbers and dice. I played a magick user, and for the first half of the game, all I had was a basic single-target spell. The outcome of a battle essentially boiled down to how many times I could cast it with what mana I had, how many turns it took the enemy to close to attack range (which is melee for most enemies), and how many hits both of us could survive. Later on, I got a few area-effect spells, which added a small layer of strategy, though numbers and dice were still the dominant factor.\n\nThe first half of the game was extremely tedious as a magick user. Mana regen is very slow to start, though you can build for quick regen after a few level ups if you eschew everything else. There is a rest function that causes time to pass more quickly, but it can still take as long as a minute to fill back up. Health regen works the same way, and I have to imagine it's just as tedious for melee-centered characters.\n\nBasically, playing Eschalon Book 1 felt like playing a much, MUCH smaller Elder Scrolls game. That's just me though; your mileage may (and probably will) vary.\n\nTHE VERDICT: Eschalon is a solid RPG that will entertain an RPG fan for about 20 hours. It's not the best game out there, but it's not the worst either.","November 4, 2014","true","22.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","1"

This is an adequate description of the game, but unfortunately the game does not succeed in adequately copying all the good qualities of the classics that it is inspired by.\n\nThe game does have it's strengths for sure. Character creation is very detailed and let's you create the character you want to play by choosing such things as race, class, skills, the region where the character grew up and the character's religion (or lack thereof) and all of these choices make a difference.\n\nAnother strength is in how the turn-based system works. When you move or perform any action time flows. When you don't time stands still. This means that the game can have as high or low a pace as you want it to have at any given moment and that it moves seamlessly from a high to a low pace and vice versa. There is no waiting, e.g. for enemies to complete their turn, and you can also take as much time as you need to think before acting.\n\nThe game has a reasonable amount of optional side-quests, different items to find and different regions to explore. The graphics are nothing special, but entirely adequate. The music is quite good. So far, it all sounds pretty good.\n\nWhere does the game fail, then? Unfortunately it fails at the most important thing for this kind of game. Combat! What is wrong with it? It doesn't require any skill. You control a single character with a rather limited repertoire of combat actions, mainly slashing/bashing, shooting, or burning the enemies, The same is true for the enemies. This would be okay in a Diablo-like action RPG where the fun and the challenge comes from the high pace. But for a turn-based RPG this is not adequate, combats should require some strategic thinking and since here they don't fighting enemies becomes a dull routine matter. Since much of the game, like with most RPG's, consists of fighting this is clearly no good.\n\nAll in all, Eschalon is an old-school turn-based RPG with a couple of good qualities which is unfortunately dragged down by dull combat. I wouldn't really want to call it a bad game, but there are plenty of better games in the genre (although Eschalon beats many of these games in some respects, only not where it really matters) that I would recommend over this one.\n","November 29, 2013","false","30.3"," 48 of 79 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","48","79","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mangodrink/recommended/25600/","mangodrink","mangodrink","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mangodrink/","757 products in account","(Before I get going, I'll say that Book 2 is much improved and although I'm only a few hours in, I can probably recommend Book 2. Writing is more polished, graphics feel fresher, and controls feel more responsive. Book 1 isn't necessary to play or understand the story of Book 2.)\n\nSlow paced and feels more like a shallow copy of old school CRPGs (hey, that *looks old-fashioned*, or, nobody does *that* in RPGs anymore, let's put that into Eschalon) rather than capturing the deep magic that made old school CRPGs worth reviving (as in "why did they do that, and does it still make sense? If so, let's put it in and modernize it just a bit"). Don't get me wrong, I like turn-based (Western) CRPGs, love Spiderweb Games (Exile through Avadon even), and I even fire up one of the top roguelikes now and then (Nethack, ADOM, dwarf fortress, Cataclysm DDA, etc.), and Eschalon Book 1 falls flat by comparison. I've played Ultima 4-8, Wasteland, Fallout 1-2, Baldur's Gate, Arcanum, and I've probably played other awesome turn-based overhead CRPGs that I can't remember. I'm sure I've played some clunkers too, but I felt I had to put up this negative review if only b/c I cannot figure out why so many people seem to like this game enough to recommend others play it--the hype for this game, from "pro" reviews and players, makes me wonder how many of those even played a quarter of the games I listed up top.\n\nEschalon Book 1 is a passable timesink, but do yourself a favor and fire up an actual classic or one of the better old-school-style titles this side of 1999. Even if it's cheap, there's still your time to consider--a playthrough takes about 20-40 hours depending on how OCD you get on doing quests and leveling up, and much of that will be spent slowly walking your single toon around obstacles since there's no click-move.\n\nAs for the plot, it's pretty straightforward w/o any real interesting twists, the writing is passable, but there's no real drama, tension, or even humor. There's *some* sure, but most of it is rather flat and just something to check the box.\n\nNow, nobody ever came out and said this was a "love letter" to old-school CRPGs, but much of the marketing kept hyping up it's old-school-ness. To that I respond: 1) actual old CRPGs did it better, 2) some of those old CRPGs are still playable now, 3) newer CRPGs in old-school-style have also done it better.\n\nIf you read this and still played the game, no problem, even if you found you liked it enough to at least *want* to play it *a second time* (how many Yes-recommenders honestly think they'd *want* to play a second time? That's not even *actually* playing it twice, but just *thinking* about it?). I'm not saying I know all for everybody. If you played it and didn't like it, then at least know you've not gone crazy considering how many reviews recommend it. If you have yet to play it, seriously, track down and play the other names I've dropped first, then maybe you can at least be so busy putting in the hours into those that you won't even have to think about Eschalon.","June 21, 2014","false","90.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It is quite a bit difficult when you are first starting out and don't really know what to do or what is good, but after you warm up to the game, you learn it has a deep meta surrounding optimizing your character and that just building your character can be as fun as playing the game itself.\n\nThe game features turn based movement and combat, as seen in many roguelikes, although this game itself is not a roguelike.  It's got great randomly generated treasure always keeping you in suspense for what might be in the next loot bag.  There is also a wide diversity of enemies, even among the many melee-oriented enemies in the game, there are frequently variations such as enemies that inflict diseases or poison with their attacks.\n\nThe story is pretty good, and it's told to you through conversations with the various NPCs.  Learning about the world and its lore is pretty fascinating and there is enough of it to keep you wanting more all the way until the end of the game.\n\nThere are lots of things to do in the game, like crafting potions with alchemy, enchanting your equipment, tons of sidequests, secret rooms to find, locks to pick, traps to disarm, and crimes to commit.  It's very reminiscent of the great Ultima games, but updated with modern technology.

Very functional, if a bit hard in places. I'll admit I save-scummed treasure chests since loot is random. The game manual / help doesn't really educate you very well on how skills work.\n\nAlmost a little rouge-like in difficulty, esp. early game when you have no healing potions and dont know how to make them much less make actual money. Self-buff magic is really the best choice for spell casting as attack spells scale up in mana costs too much but are necessary for melee-penalizing foes.\n\nThe game graphics are pleasing enough, and the music is enjoyable and makes for especially good settings in a few places. Text dialogue and area descriptions are very rich as well, which definately helps.\n\n$15 is about right in price I suppose, but getting on sale is nice. This isn't a modern-day RPG and the difficulty and lack of transparency in the game system shows that pretty well. Not for the RPG dabbler.\n\nEDIT: I have changed my review from Yes to No on the premise that it obfuscates its mechanics too much and and is legitimately unpleasantly difficult in the beginning of the game because of it where mis-progression and lack of information can cause major problems.  For example, the shield use skill gives no benefit beyond the first point (which removes an unskilled use penalty), yet the skill can have many points dumped into it like every other skill which gives a scaling benefit.  This should absolutely NEVER happen in a game.","June 15, 2011","false","31.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are a lot of stats you can enhance and it does not seem to make a major difference even when you have leveled several times.\n\n2. The abilities that you can enhance your character with suffer from the same mentioned previously.\n\n3. Monsters are ALWAYS vastly over whelming for you to fight and will make you more aware of the previously mentioned complaints regarding character devlopment.\n\n4. THE DEVS DO NOT ALLOW CHEATING. THERE ARE NO CHEATS AVAILABLE AT ALL. NONE. You can't even edit a file to cheat. There are a few links to trainers that do not work. So if you have a desire to cheat, like some people do, you are out crap out of luck. This is guaranteed to pisss off many people and the DEV'S have stated they DO NOT CARE, so be forewarned. This, of course, applies to all three of the Eschalon games (1,2, and 3). I am one of those people who like to cheat occasionally and I don't need the whiney anti cheat community to tell me what I need, nor do I appreciate DEV'S who don't care about it either. Tired of this cry baby anti cheat coommunity. If you don't like to cheat, then don't cheat. Plain English, but don't make it impossible for people to do it in game or you are going to lose quite a few sales. This alone has caused me to refuse any purchases form these DEV'S until they change.\n\nIn summary, this was not a bad game at all. It was nothing revolutionary either, but still not bad. I did manage to beat it without cheats, but it pisssed me off that the DEV's pulled this crap.  If you don't like being forced to play without cheats, don't buy the follow up games, because you can not cheat in them either.\n\nGAME TIPS: Make monsters chase you to any border and then stand and fight. I usually run around the map and get 4-5 to follow me.If they beat you up badly simply walk through the border to enter a screen refresh and then camp until you are healed. Monsters will never follow you, but instead wait for you over the border. Walk back over the border and they will still be there with the same damage you gave them before. When camping, count to 4 seconds by watching the time of day clock and then stop the campng. Then redo it again by hitting the camp button. This will prevent the game from spawning monsters on you while you camp. If you over extend your welcome while camping, the game spawns powerful monsters to wear you down again so count 4 seconds on the time of day clock and then stop. Re camp until health is filled and then save the game. When you restart you will have all your health again. SAVE SAVE SAVE. That should help alot, of course the easiest way to help you is reccommend you ignore this game and buy something way better, and believe me there are WAY better games. It wouldn't surprise me if the game DEV's release a patch that disallows these exploits too, lol.","August 16, 2015","false","44.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

A dumbed-down grindfest in a vaguely Roguelike style that relies upon forcing players to min-max in order to be "hard".  Every monster is essentially the same melee brute AI, and every fight the same repeated ad infinitum.  The barrels in town are more likely to randomly have plate mail armor than the chest behind the traps in the last dungeon you completed, and low-level goblins drop better stuff than high-level minotaurs, because treasure is rubber-banded, but enemies, bizarrely, are not.  I cannot recommend this game for anyone - there are simply too many other good RPGs out there.\n\nGo play Avernum or Avadon or one of those actual old-school games getting updated and re-released over Steam, instead.  Those had clever and subtle systems.  This game mimics without understanding what made the classics classic.","November 25, 2013","false","62.3"," 25 of 57 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","25","57","0","0"

It received nationwide (possibly international) attention, being mentioned on a number of comedy-news sources and radio stations. He was even unofficially protrayed on the Drew Carey show by none other than Henry Rollins - an episode in which Oswauld hires someone from ebay to kick his ♥♥♥.\n\nPosted by Bonk on May 25, 2004\n\nI also did a few ♥♥♥♥♥♥ radio interviews. They were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because the smarmy morning show hosts and their sidekicks that laughed at everything they said were annoying and asked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ questions. And also because I had just woken up since they called me as early as they possibly could. If I remember right though, I got calls from New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, and Seattle. The LA guys were actually considering flying me out there to "kick someone's ♥♥♥ on the air", but I have no idea how that would've worked. I guess that's my 15 minutes of fame.\n\nPosted by Bonk on March 18, 2007\n\nUpdating for recent confirmation. Henry Rollins answers a good portion of fan mail through his website, so I recently sent him an e-mail to confirm this. He responded that his role of "Mr. Jericho" on the Drew Carey Show was in fact inspired by my auction, and that they showed it to him when he appeared on set.\n\nPosted by Bonk on June 5, 2012\n\nThis came full circle the other night, when I finally met Henry Rollins in person and got a picture of him kicking my ♥♥♥. He was a good sport about it.\n\nhttp://awfulyearbook.com/user/view/29720?pic=75411\n","June 21, 2014","true","0.1"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

It's one of those "actual" CRPGs where mechanics actually did require you to think and invest time in proper attributes and playstyles, not expecting any handholding like kids get in teen/console rpgs these days. Now, I just finished the main story and felt the same as when I put a good book down after reading its last word.\nLoved the music, the engine and exploration, above all. I still don't have Book II, but sure as hell it's on my wishlist now.\nThis game comes from before the current golden age of CRPGs and was one of the few that brought me back hope to the niche market of classic-styled, thought-out, pen-n-paper inspired role playing games, along with the Spiderweb Games and Knights of the Chalice.\n\nEstive jogando Eschalon por quase um ano.

This is one of the best ones I've played in quite some time.  If you like old-style, turn-based RPGs you will love this.  I look forward to playing Book II and the release of Book III.","August 29, 2011","true","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been finding it challenging not just to play, but to put down as well!\n\nVery, very enjoyable indeed and well worth seven quid of anyone's money :) If you found the lack of stats and crappy UI in Skyrim annoying and want something a bit more 'Authentic' for an RPG, then do give this a go. The demo's huge, btw, and will keep you busy for a good afternoon...","May 21, 2012","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're hurting for a old school style RPG, this might scratch that itch a bit.  Sorta feels like a cross between Ultima and some kind of Spiderware game (look them up if you've never heard of them; and then  go to bed cause your mommy is gonna get mad and it's a school night).","December 27, 2015","true","109.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While not as comprehensive and not without quirks and a few dubious design decisions, anyone who's enjoyed the old classics should welcome the non-linear and explorative gameplay style offered here.\n\nEschalon: Book I offers a good selection of stats and skills for customising your protagonist. It's a good idea to read up a bit on character builds before creating your character. If you focus on the wrong characteristics for your character, you could get in trouble.\n\nStory and dialogue takes a back seat to turn-based, die-rolling combat and exploration, with plenty of old-fashioned dungeon-crawling to boot!","May 25, 2011","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meyson/recommended/25600/","meyson","Randael","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meyson/","872 products in account","Oldschool RPG in the style of DnD , interisting story nice soundtracks and all in all great atmosphere. Its very hard to get into it and some mechanics dont really make much sense or can be frustrating to figure out ... but in the end its worth it to get around the tough start. I had a great 21 hours with this game . with knowledge of neverwinter nights, DnD or anything similar to that,  possessed knowledge of dice/dnd based RPG´s in general it shouldnt take long to get used to the game , without it its gonna be a tough ride .\nAll in all... Sometimes frustrating but all in all very enjoyable oldschool RPG, one of the rare gems that actually catched my attention and held it . After 19+ hours it got a bit of a chore but i just ignored the sidequests and finished the story bringing the game to a timely end at my comfortable pace. Give it a try .","February 8","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
