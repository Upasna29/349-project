I was pleasantly surprised by this game though, very pleasantly surprised. It is much more of a hunting simulator this time round.\n\nYou begin by playing through the tutorial mission that is very linear and a disappointing start, but then things really start to open up.\n\nYou unlock one of the four large areas of the USA and have three different types of hunts available. One of which is an OPEN hunt. That's right. Open world hunting on a very generously sized map (one of the available 4 to begin with). You complete all of the PRO hunts (one of the other types) to unlock the other areas of the USA.\n\nYou earn gear credits by hunting and there is a great selection of weapons and equipment.\n\nYou can view your best trophies in a trophy viewing area with shot information etc.\n\nBullet time with exact information about your shot and where you hit the animal (vital hits, deflection off ribs, shoulder blades etc. etc.)\n\nAt least 10 different big game animals to hunt as well as many other smaller animals e.g. rabbits, wolves, foxes etc.\n\nI've only played for about 30 minutes so far, but this is already proving to be a great game for the price.\n\nThank you Cabela for a great hunting experience this time round!\n\nVERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","March 25, 2014","true","7.2"," 279 of 323 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","279","323","0","10"

Well, it's surprizingly good. I've been having a lot of fun creepin around the woods, taking down these suckers. The graphics are the best I've seen in a hunting game, not including the cut scenes with the pro hunters.\n\nHere's one experience I had.\nI'm slowly creeping up on a bear, armed with a bow, as he's laid down in a clearing. (Keep in mind, I just bought the bow and this was the first bear I was going after.) From about 30 yards I take aim and draw back, carefully trying to judge where its heart is....I release. The shot goes into a slowmo x-ray cam like on Sniper Elite. The arrow pierces its skin, missing all of its vital organ and only breaks a rib.....uh oh. That sucker roars, gets up and charges! Back pedaling, I quicky and franticly aim at his chest and shoot another arrow. In the slowmo cam I watch it pass about 2 inches from his left side. Sh*t! This sucker's now about 20 yards from me at full charge. In a split second I think, "Ok. I'm goin' for his freakin brain." I draw back, aim and shoot as fast as I possibly could. The slowmo cam kicked in and I'm thinkin, "Ok. this is it. No more chances." The arrow pierces his skull and dead centers itself smack in the middle of his brain. In full charge, he crashes to the ground about 4 feet in front of me, dead. I proceed then to the bathroom.\n\nIf you like the genre, I absolutly recommend it. I'm havin' a hell of a lotta fun with it.","March 31, 2014","true","20.3"," 112 of 123 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","112","123","0","2"

I have hunted small and large game most of my life, so it pleases me to say that this entry in the Cabela's series is a more realistic hunting simulator than some of Cabela's other "hunting" games, which are often arcade shooting galleries with predator "horde" modes. (Ugh!) Fortunately, this game is different than those ridiculous arcade shooters.\n\nI've logged thirty hours of game play so far, unlocked all 4 regions of the game, and finished all of the Pro Hunts, which were pretty interesting, but were bookcased with predictably cheesy cut-scenes. I have collected 17 of the 31 available achievements so far (55%). I'm now just mopping up smaller hunts in each region and all remaining achievements. The achievements in the game are sometimes challenging but definitely obtainable, and I expect to get 100% unless one turns out to be glitched. (I haven't heard of any glitched achievements so far.)\n\nNevertheless, Caveat Emptor! (Buyer Beware!)\n\nBeware of a game-breaking bug. You will likely lose ALL of your progress at some point deep into the game's campaign. This bug has never been fixed by the developers, and they have since been bought out by another developer, so the game-breaking bug will likely NEVER be fixed. The only thing you can proactively do to mitigate this risk is to backup your save files on a regular basis. If you have your hard drive set to back up every night, you may experience the game-breaking bug but can easily just reload your last save files, and you will be back in the game with (hopefully) only minor progress lost.\n\nI experienced this bug myself just 2 nights ago, after reaching the 4th and final region in the game (Northwest), but recovered easily by restoring backed-up save files with relatively minimal progress lost.\n\nSo backup your save files regularly!\n\nOtherwise, sit back and enjoy one of the better hunting sims on the market.","June 11, 2015","true","55.5"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","43","50","4","8"

Wal-mart electronics department stuff. I am happy to say that Pro Hunts has shattered that image in blowout fashion. This is a great, great game.\n\nThis is a genuine open-world hunting game that you normally could only find with theHunter... a game with its share of issues. Cabela's has taken a page out of their book and introduced a more frequently rewarding and cohesive experience in Pro Hunts with more memorable kills and less doing nothing for an hour or two at a time. The four reserves are expansive, with plenty of tactical options ranging from large rocks and brush to well placed stands and blinds that give you enormous freedom of choice.\n\nStalking your prey is not easy, but the lifelike animal AI is believeable and genuine enough for people who don't hunt in real life. The paths your prey follow make sense and present a convincing challenge to get close enough for a stunning heart or spine shot, with each shot carried out in bullet-time and an accompanying chart of your bullet's trajectory. Once the bullet strikes home you get a complete in-situ diagram of your target's internal organs and you can follow the slug as it crashes through meat and bone. This allows you to see exactly how your shot placed on the animal and is an excellent feature, as well as a learning tool. I've learned everything I know now about "ethical kills" and game animal anatomy than I ever had before. It's eminently satisfying.\n\nIf you haven't liked hunting games before, or want to see what hunting games can be, this is a great place to start in my opinion.","April 30, 2014","true","39.4"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","37","42","0","1"

Seriously.\n\nTo get into that further, ive played several Cabela Steam Games as well as "The Hunter", before i started to appreciate this one here.\n\nMost Games in the Cabela Series look and play like complete Garbage and thats not a Secret.\n"The big Game Hunter pro hunts" on the other Hand, is really a well made Game, not perfect either, but its far from the other Trash in the Series.\n\nCompared to "The Hunter", the only disadvantage of this Game here is, that it has an older Graphics Engine and no Multiplayer Mode.\n\nThe Game starts weird with a Call of Duty-like Tutorial, and the first Ammunition type makes it hard to kill anything, but after that its a really entertaining and Time consuming Game.\nYou got a Campain mode, which is not really demanding and rather short, you can walk around freely, on large Maps in different Regions, shoot on everything you like, or complete some Challenges for extra Cash to buy better Equipment.\n\nYou can kill every Animal you see, with different types of Rifles and Shotguns, different kinds of Bows, Ammunition and Arrows, you can buy additional Equipment like Scrent Masks, Animal Calls, and a variety of Binoculars.\n\nYou can also track down Animals, follow blood traces of injured Animals.\n\nIt matters where you hit the Animal! A Shot into the Brain, Neck or into the Spine mean instant Death and its easy to collect the Trophy, after a double Lung Shot the Animal will only walk a few Meters further...\n\nA non lethal Shot into the leg, the Skin, the Skull or any other Bone wont kill at all or only after a long Time.\nSo you have to aim carefully or you will find yourself walking for hundreds of Meters, following the blood traces of your Prey.\n\nYou also have to watch for the Wind direction. First it will affect your aiming, second the Animals can smell you and run away.\n\nBe careful, some of the Animals, like the Wild Boar, the Moose, Black Bear or Grizzly can and will attack and kill you if you come to close!\n\n\nAnother neat Featue is the slow motion Bulletcam and the X-ray hit Cam, that some People might know from the "Sniper Elite" Franchise.\n\nLast but not least, there are some Statistics, like a Global and Friend Leaderboard and the Trophy Room.\n\nI just list the pros and contras here, for the lazy Readers:\n+ First Person view ( i mention this as plus, because most of the other Cabela Games have a sluggish Third Person view.)\n+ Large and well designed, really detailed Maps in different environmental Regions like Forest, Swamp, Desert and Coast.\n+ Open World exploring\n+ Easy Controls\n+ You can hunt and kill all the Animals in the Game like Black Bears, Grizzlies, Foxes, Coyotes, Rabbits, Moose, Roosevelt Elks, Whitetail Deer, Caribous, Blacktail Deer, Pronghorns, Mule deer and several types of Birds.\n+ Different Rifles and Bows to Unlock like 223 Bolt Action, 223 Semi Auto, 270 Bolt Action, 7mm Mag Bolt Action, 30-06 Semi Auto, 338 Mag Bolt Action, 12 Gauge Shotgun, Recurved Bow and Compound Bow. Also Different Types of Ammunition for each Rifle and Bow, different Gunsights.\n+ Realistic Animal and Gun Sounds, fantastic ambient sounds that really give you the feeling of being "In the Wild".\n+ Good Animations, nice looking Light effects and Waterreflections.\n+ Slow Motion Bullet and X-ray Camera\n+ Good Soundtrack\n+ You can Shoot from open Ground or use different kind of "Points of Interest", like Stands, Tree stands or Blinds.\n\n- Sometimes it happens that the Animals get stuck between Rocks, Trees or just "freeze."\n- No Multiplayer\n- The Graphics Engine itself looks old, textures from Leaves, Rocks or Bushes look ugly when you get too close.\n- Short and boring Campain Mode, its more fun to just walk around freely.\n- This is more casual while "The Hunter" is more a Simulation.\n\nAll together Cabelas Big Game Hunter Pro hunts has a lot to offer for People who like Hunting Games and for me, personally,  its currently the best Hunting Game on Steam.\nAs mentioned above, the only reasons to play "The Hunter" instead would be the better Graphics Engine and the Multiplayer option.\nFor everyone who can live without that, Big Game Hunter Pro Hunts must be the first Choice, even if some of the reviews cast a bad Light on it.\n\nI can only recommend this, even for the full price of 29,99.\nPS: If you need to see a few impressions, take a look at my Screenshots here!","December 3, 2014","true","42.0"," 55 of 75 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","55","75","5","4"

The devs have apparently ignored these reports to work on DayZ or something. How this happens is apparently still unknown and no fix, even uninstalling and reinstalling, is available.)\n\nIt's amazing how good this is compared to other hunting games out there, especially the almost Call of Duty like previous instalments of Cabela's games. In this one, you don't get to run in shooting everything. Animals are skittish and will run if they sense danger. You will need to be stealthy, sneak up on your prey while paying attention to the wind and cover, and avoid rustling leaves or making sound. Once in position, you will often only get one shot as the animals don't stick around.\n\nThis game made me feel more like a sniper than Sniper Elite, with bonus points for making good, clean shots at vital organs that don't hurt the animal as much and a penalty for shooting the gut(An incredibly painful place to get shot and it can taint the meat), and a decently large area to hunt in. The game feels both big enough to make it feel like you're going places, and small and populated enough that you won't have to walk for hours just to get to the action.\nOnce you take a shot, the bullet cam will show you exactly how it went and what you hit, allowing you to easily figure out what you did right and what you did wrong so you can learn from it.\n\nThings it could do better?\nAt this point, I'd actually be okay with an expansion or DLC for extra maps and animals, or just plain more guns to use. (Maybe gun rebalancing too, the bigger ones are almost all better)\nMaybe add the bullet cam for small critters.\nPerhaps allow climbing rocks for a vantage point(No climbing or jumping in the game)\n\nHonestly, aside from the problems with crashing and then not being able to start it up again that some people have, it's pretty good.

It's nice to see Cabela produce a reasonably realistic hunting sim. Too many Cabela games are hunting-themed action shooters. I like games like that, but it's good to see something different.\n\nPrice: Very reasonable. $29.95 is very fair for the content you recieve.\n\nStability: Excellent! I've played about 27 hours and have yet to experiance a single crash.\n\nGraphics: Very nice. Not cutting-edge, but certainly acceptable.\n\nRealism: Good compared to most Cabela games, but not super realistic. Strikes a good balance between realism and action without being too dumbed down. If you want an uber-realistic hunting game that requires lots of time and patience, try an online game called The Hunter.\n\nContent: Good selection of weapons and gear. Maps are well done and really provide a feel for the different regions of North America. A few more species would have been nice. Cougar, Javelina and Bison should have been included for example. Still, not bad. The bullet-cam is awesome.\n\nMinor flaws: Ammo loadout is much too limited. Birds and small game have poor AI and behave unrealisticly.\n\nMajor flaws: There are two. I will discuss each in turn.\n\nFirst. You MUST finish every storyline hunt in a particular region before you can unlock the next region. For example you start in the Southeast; you must finish all 10 storyline missions there to unlock the Northeast, and so on. This is not really all that hard mind you. There are 40 storyline missions in total and I was able to finish them all in 25 hours. But that's not the point. Point is, if you buy this game you should have the option of ignoring the storyline campaign alltogether and hunting anytime, anywere, in any region. Unfortunatly, you don't have that option until all the campaign is completed.\n\nSecond. The storyline missions are EXTREMELY linear. You must hunt a particular species. You must complete your mission in a certain time limit. You must use a particular weapon, or a very limited selection of weapons. You must meet certain special conditions. etc.etc. This can be very tedious.\n\nOverall, however, I am well pleased with Cabela's Big Game Hunter Pro Hunts. It's positive aspects definitely outweigh its flaws. This game should appeal to fans of hunting games and casual gamers alike. Keep up the good work Cabela! I give it 7 out of 10.","March 28, 2014","true","218.9"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","0"

It is a very relaxing experience, perfect for those moments when you want to fill some time in a beautiful environment without doing anything taxing.  It also strikes a good balance between simulation and arcade: great physics and a satisfying test of skill and patience without being boring.  Probably my favourite aspect is how the game makes you really want to end it cleanly - you feel like a proper d!ck when you rush it and get a less than perfect shot.  If you in any way lose yourself in a game like this when playing, you'll find yourself compelled to learn exactly where to place your shots and when, and when not, to take a shot.  The wonderful X-ray bullet-time helps enormously in this, as well as being probably the single coolest feature of the game.\n\nThere is a lot of talk on the forums about save corruption.  While I'm not sure whether the devs have fixed the issue, and although I think it's reprehensible if they haven't, the solution is a very simple one.  All that is required is a tiny script, available with 2 seconds of googling, and you can back up a copy of your save whenever you start the game.  Any problems and you've got the backup.  I've never needed to use the backups as I've never encountered a save corruption, but essentially I want to say "Please don't be put off just because there is a known problem - it's so easily avoidable that it should not overshadow an otherwise excellent game!"\n\nThe only thing I would change in a heartbeat if I could: the game's time compression, which is forced to a standard 10:1.  This is absolutely fine, and creates a nice challenge most of the time, but alongside the "mission" hunts (which are all along the lines of "hunt x of y from z") are free-hunts where you have no goals and can spend a full day of in-game time just doing whatever you want.  In that situation I would like to have the option to relax the time compression and spend essentially as long as I want mooching about in the woods.  It's hardly game-breaking!","March 1","true","35.8"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","15","15","4","0"

Re-installing won't help, deleting one of your safe-files, will make it work again, but you have to start from scratch. Work-around; you might let the game run the whole time until you are finished- this is how I finally completed it. I hope you will not be so unlucky like me to experience a power outage while doing this.\n\nFirst signals that you are in trouble: after a certain amount of restarts, you will loose some of your preciously collected purchases. Like; would you be interested in buying the riffle that you've currently selected in your back-pack for a second time?\n\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/28489456653430520/342A8B3484584D0BEFA059AE79F1111302758C23/\n\nAfter that, some of your hunts might be randomly erased.  This results in some funny surprises; for instance the game strongly recommending you to finish the tutorial if you want to hunt again in the first playable region, the South-East (while you actually completed 100% of the south-east, same like the tutorial, twice already).\n\nhttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/28489456653420462/DB19584A1CEF589720660ECCB8B4DE99E6997A22/\n\nPlay a bit more and the game fails to run what so ever. Like mentioned above; deleting one of the safe-files, called progress (look for it in your user directory ...\Saved Games\Big Game Hunter 2014) will make the game run again, but you have to start from scratch. Making a back up from the progress file and restoring it, might give you access to some earlier stages... But this is a cumbersome activity that leads to one frustrating conclusion: the progress-file is getting corrupted anyway.\n\nThe issue seems small and quickly solvable. Probably some stack overflow or alike, affecting the game saving. But why would they fix it, if instead they can take your money just like this as well and ignore your calls anyway? While the bug is known for more than a year, Steam keeps selling it - telling you to take your complaints to Activision. And do you think Activision will help you? Heck no; if you miraculously manage to issue a service request to them, they just refuse to react.","April 14, 2015","false","281.9"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","25","33","2","0"

I was on the fence because of some of these reviews, but honestly about 50 hours in, most achievements completed and the game is still working fine.  So here we go.\n\nGraphicsGood, not great.  I run a pretty high end video card and some of the textures are blocky, shadows as well.  The animal models and vegetation are quite good though.  The animals movements and animations are realistic and deserve some credit.\n\nRealismAgain good, not great.  About 10 hours in I was standing in the middle of a field, no cover, no scent mask and a Blacktail walked right up to me.  I shot it in the face at point blank range.  The calls are a nice addition however not realistic in the sense that they always work.  There seems to be a bug also that has animals freeze in the grazing posture and you can walk right up to them and shoot them.  Haven't seen it alot but it has happened.  Ballistics are realistic in terms of penetration, bullet drop, shot placement etc, however the game allows you to pinpoint where the bullet will hit by pressing a key.\n\nGearscoreThis is the only hunting game I own, so I can't compare with others.  But I thought this was a good addition that lets you work towards the gear you want/need.  I found this part of the game enjoyable.\n\nOverall8/10.  I like the game enough to recommend to other Steam users.  I have had no technical issues with this game.  However there is one thing that you should know.  If your speakers/bluetooth devices are not plugged in (indicated in windows by the speaker near the time having a red circle with a white X) then the game will crash.

The developing team actually crafted a pristine hunting game that is a wonderful option for those who don't want the acclaimed The Hunter (or those who simply haven't got the cash to spend on its nonsensical microtransactions). Big Game Hunter - PH is realistic, delivers a pleasant, peaceful and sporty experience for anyone willing to familiarise themselves with the universe of hunting without having to get their hands bloody in the process. A quasi-simulator, this title brings various landscapes (the four main regions of North America and their weather/vegetation/terrain discrepancies) and a vast list of weapons to choose from, from rifles to small carbines to shotguns to compound bows.\n\nThe variety of big game may not be as impressive as that found in The Hunter (which you have to spend money on to get thoroughly, by the way), but it's great already: Black Bears, Blacktail and Whitetail Deer, Moose, Caribou, Wild Boar, Pronghorn, Mule Deer, Grizzlies, and Roosevelt Elk - not to mention small game such as foxes, coyotes and rabbits - make up for an ever increasing level of excitement and difficulty.\n\nThis game can be unforgiving oftentimes, but that's the nature of hunting: picking up tracks, identifying eating and bedding spots, aiming for vital and not hurtful organs, quick deaths, sneaking up on them, watching the wind in order not to have your scent carried their way... all of these minutiae make Big Game Hunter - PH the best hunting game out there in terms of accessibility and challenge alike.

You start the game with a couple of tutorials where you learn the game and hunting basics and continue with some challenge hunts. Each region has two Pro Slam hunts where, with the help of the experts, you hunt down the biggest trophies.\nBeside the Pro and challenge hunts, you also can go by your own on the open hunts. Here, it’s up to you to track and bag the region animals you want.\n\nAs for content, the game has a great variety of animal species including ambient animals, which also can be hunted. You have at your disposal a reasonable amount of weapons, ammo and gear, but I would like to see more gear here. The animals models and dynamics kinda resemble others Cabela’s BGH games (some animals seem like that they have been imported from other games) and they do look better in the intros than in the game itself, nonetheless they’re good. The weapons ballistics is also good, and the new bullet flight / shot view really scores for this game.\n\nThe hunting regions are bigger, indeed, than any previous Cabela’s games and the scenarios look a lot more realistic, but comparing with other(s) hunting game(s) out there I think they could have done better. Some textures seem realistic but kinda low resolution.\n\nAs for gameplay and dynamics, Pro Hunts resembles Hunting Expeditions.\nYou have the Pro Hunts and Challenge hunts, where you have goals to meet, and then you can hunt on your own in the open hunts. Even when you finish the other hunts and/or the game you can still do the open hunts and try to bag monster trophies.\nIn the terrain, you can track the animals, use the calls to lure them in and use some fixed hunting spots like stands and blinds. The animals have a decent AI and in game they follow a fixed routine, making it easy to lay down a hunting plan.\n\nOverall, Cabela’s (Activision/Cauldron) really did a great job here and I hope that Cabela’s keeps going in this direction, kudos on them!\nFor me, unlike other Cabela’s games where once finished there wasn’t much to do, this game is really a keeper!\n\nHU Corner @ http://www.hucorner.com","April 7, 2014","true","66.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The gameplay and environment isn't quite as good as The Hunter, but at least you don't have to buy stuff with real dollarbux.\n\nAlso I recommend you get the different animal calls early on because they save a lot of time and make some of the more tedious missions a lot more tolerable.\n\nProblems include the scent system being pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at times, and animals spooking without you knowing what you even did wrong, but that's part of hunting.

They really should have just added more gun variety instead of so many scope choices. Or at least throw in a red dot instead of another useless reticle.\n\nWhy is there a 30-06 SKS?\n\nOh, and the game makes it really easy to find animals because you have spidey senses and a very fancy GPS.","May 2, 2014","true","24.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","2"

Although a patch or something would be great.\n\nIn order to get away from the more cartoonish aspects of it you'll want to play on the realistic setting.  Which is still more of what you'd expect in a videogame and is still very accessable.  If you aren't the patient type feel free to put it on casual.  The game will help you out with finding the animals and helping you get close enough.  It would be very cool if they would have made an even more realistic difficulty that turns off most of the UI and really lets you fend for yourself.\n\nThey tell you it has "The most authentic hunting ballistics ever in a Cabela's® game!" which is true but the way its utilized with the gear credits system definitely needs tweaking.  You won't ever find yourself in a position where you would really need to grind out credits to get a gun or bow that you need though.   If you find yourself wanting some extra credits you can just complete one of the small game accomplishments.\n\nOverall:  If you don't enjoy the on-rails arcade shooters they've made recently or the annoying dangerous game ones where you get endlessly massacred by everything for no reason.  You will probably enjoy this one just fine.","April 4, 2014","true","16.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has a nice sneaky sniper feel to it with out risk to get shoot yourself or getting a game over from triggering a alert and doing it over and over again which really annoys me on those games. i like the distance on which animals get spooked when you shoot or mess up, just far enough to have time to gloat on that perfect shot or eat your hunters hat when you stepped on that damn twig and the prey got away...again before you have to get back into sneak mode and hunt on. Not going into the realism aspect of this game or hunting sims in general, comparing gaming and point and clicking on pixles with rl activities is a bit silly, but i feel very hunterly while playing, which is probably not a word. The time on progression of weapon, maps and mission unlocks is fine. A game well worth checking out if you enjoy relaxed hunting and watching your bullet in slowmo  until you  get eaten by a bear.","June 12, 2014","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics haven't changed much, voice acting is terrible, but there are some pros that outweigh the cons. The gameplay is quite enjoyable, with a lot of unlockable gear such as weapons, scopes, ammo, and animal calls. The maps are quite big for a Cabela game, but still lack compared to other hunting games such as The Hunter. There is some replayability with the addition of challenges. All in all, you will get some enjoyment out of this game. It's worth picking up, or even renting if you are on the console.","June 15, 2014","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is by far the best hunting game I have played. Not a huge fan of Activision. Game is isn't SLI ready. Visually this game could have been much more. Considering the games demographic, it is visually appealing. For once it would have been nice to see DLC content. You have 4 regions to hunt. They regions are unlocked by finishing the "Pro Hunts". They are simple hunts. More or less a chance for the player to attain a quick lump sum of gear credits. I enjoyed this game far more than Call of Duty Ghosts. Which in itself is a sad state of affairs. Researcing the game I found complaints about "Hit Detection". Going prone  helps with shot placement. The game promotes ethical hunting, so dont expect to do a 360° no scope head shot. So far the best gear load out is: Rifle-.338, Bullet-.338 Mag Polymer Tip, Scope- 12x (the first one), Bino's- 10x (the first one). The 10x shot mulitplier is only available after you have completed all the "Pro Hunts". After that the gear credit value increases exponentially. I will purchase the next Cabela offering. This game is relaxing and as close to hunting as your going to get from a desk.","May 13, 2014","true","73.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I finished the final challenge in 23.1 hours. That wasn't my goal, until I realized it was within my grasp.\n\nI appreciate that the game rewards responsible hunting principles. For instance, you earn almost nothing for bagging a big buck if you are sloppy about it. In contrast, a clean kill provides considerable progress -- even if it was just a spike buck.\n\nI didn't like the canned special "boss" missions. I hit "enter" to make the "star" hunters shut up so I could get on with the challenge. Those special missions are completely canned -- the boss animal is scripted to take one of two paths in a tiny map and so those are pretty lame.\n\nThe "open world" ordinary maps are great and the animals behave as you would expect (if you know game animals).\n\nI wish there were fewer animals (more realistic) and then the benefit for bagging one could be more exciting and provide a larger prize. Also, the game gives you visual signals to let you know the animals are giving away their position. This is unrealistic. It would be better if the animals were just as sneaky and slippery as they are in real life.\n\nThere also some things they got right. For instance, bucks use does as scouts, following behind them. Deer alert and signal others too, as in real life. Not bad.\n\nNot much too it really, but when it's on sale, it's worth it.","April 18","true","38.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Why it would try to add overlays like your hunter is some kind of terminator, I have no clue.  My guess is if one is buying this game, they have a basic understanding of rifle marksmanship; whether from gaming or in real world aplication.  Asside from the confusing reticle graphics the game is entertaining and worth the $7.00 I paid.

Despite having a reputation for cranking out titles that range from the mediocre to the absolutely repellant, this Cabela's-branded game is a solid effort.\n\nDressed up with pleasant visuals, alluring ambient sounds, and a godawful, thankfully muteable hunting guide, Pro Hunts is a hunting game that straddles the line between simulation and arcade, and it does this better than any other title in the (admittedly niche) genre. The good news is that even non-hunters can appreciate the thrill of stalking quarry and lining up the perfect shot, thanks to relaxed tracking mechanics and an engaging ballistics simulation element that puts even realism-based shooters to shame.\n\nOh, that ballistics system. I kinda feel like there's a missed opportunity here for lack of a dedicated target range or ballistics-gel dummies that one could shoot at all day long, because the intricacies of it are really just that engaging. It's by no means completely realistic, as the bullet cam never seems to take windage and deflection into account, but the elements of parabolic drop and material penetration are present and accounted for, both of which affected convincingly enough by the type of ammunition fired. The differences between the various rifles in the game, and even the different types of ammo available to each, are immediately noticeable. Hunting with a bow is supremely enjoyable too, and its own special kind of fun.\n\nFor a game built around the whole bullet cam gimmick, Sniper Elite doesn't even come close to this level of detail. In even the latest entry, the bullet cam in Sniper Elite exists only to show off a bunch of quasi-gore effects, and is ultimately superficial - where you land the shots doesn't matter in the slighest. Not so here. No way. In Pro Hunts, shot placement is absolutely paramount. Bullets may pass right through a target without hitting a single vital body part, they may harmlessly deflect off of a rib, or just get lodged in the thick hide of your quarry. If you're unlucky, an otherwise perfect shot may bore straight on through into your victim's guts, which loses you points and earns you a verbal rubuke from your guide (because, y'know, it's just not *ethical*).\n\nYou're encouraged to go for sure shots ("broadsides," from the side of the prey into the lungs and hopefully the heart, which result in a quick, more humane takedown) rather than risky trick shots (you really shouldn't try shooting through the thick skull of a boar anyway). Pulling off an ethical takedown is a thrill unlike any other. Differing from most games that put a gun in your hand and ask you to shoot things, you really *feel* like you're earning your kills here, rather than mousing over the target of the day and having the game stroke your ego with every click.\n\nThe shooting is so much fun, in fact, that I found myself starting and ending hunts over and over again just so I could shoot at the first animal to come my way. Again, it's a shame there's no included target practice mode. That alone would practically be worth the price of admission. As it stands, however, the tracking and hunting that makes up the meat of the experience (super wicked pun) is substantial enough to keep one engaged. It's not as deep, detailed, and simulation-based as theHunter, but that might not necessarily be such a bad thing depending on your tastes.  Expect individual hunts to take a half an hour to an hour of real time, rather than hours and hours of it. Again, it's just simmy enough to be engaging, but not so arcadey that you feel as though the game is just handing you cheap thrills. And make no mistake, getting those perfect shots is a game within a game, and it's definitely a game worth the price of admission here.\n\nBought it, no regrets. It won't rock your world, but it will provide you with an itch you'll want to come back to time and time again to scratch.","March 14, 2015","true","31.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/warondar/recommended/247770/","warondar","Warondar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/warondar/","228 products in account","Frankly, this is by far one of Cabela's better hunting games, if you like an easy going hunt without too much work needed to bag a trophy or two, or even more during one outing.\nI picked up the game on sale for $8 and got just over 50hrs of playing time to complete everything the game has to offer.  The last thing I needed was the completion of a couple of achievements including: the 10 spine shot kills, the grizzly heart shot kill, and finally the bear kill with a recurve bow while it's charging you.  A few of the hunts really got my adrenaline flowing, even though I knew it wasn't for real.\nYou could also chase the Leaderboards to place yourself as the top hunter in various categories, which could easily extend your play time.  For me personally, I was happy breaking the top 1000 score for each species, so I'm not much of an overachiever. hehe\n\nHere's a quick rundown (well not that quick now that I'm done) of how the game is setup and how you progress through it.\n\nFor locations, you'll start in the Southeastern US and upon completing the required 'mission' hunts you'll unlock the Northeastern US, then more area specific 'mission' hunts to unlock the Southwestern US, and finally the Northwestern US where I personally loved hunting the most.\n\nYou'll be hunting various big game animals, but also smaller ones for achievements.\n\nBig Game Tophies:\n-Whitetail Deer\n-Blacktail Deer\n-Mule Deer\n-Pronghorn\n-Moose\n-Elk\n-Caribou\n-Wild Hog\n-Black Bear\n-Grizzly Bear\n\nOther non-trophy animals:\n-rabbit\n-fox\n-coyote\n-pheasant/grouse\n\nEach area also has 2 Pro Hunt missions that start with a cinematic movie hosted by Pro Guides Jim Shockey, Wade Middleton, Ralph and Vicki Cianciarulo, who will detail what to do on the hunt for 'named' mega trophy animals.  Mind you though, these so-called Pro Hunts turned out to be WAY too easy for my liking, and the target animals dispatched quickly and easily.\n\nOnce you complete a mission and a Pro Hunt, it's done for good.  You're unable to replay any of them, so make sure what you decide to shoot is the animal you really want for your score.  I would of personally liked to be able to replay these missions, although not the Pro Hunts per say,  it could add some replayability if it was an option to do so.\n\nMind you, there are also 'normal' hunts which are the open hunts where you can hunt what you want, where you want, and how many animals you want.  This is limited by ammo though, since you do have a very limited amount, and have the choice of 2 ammo types per weapon.\n\nThis brings up the weapons and gear for the game, which has a good choice for the types of animals you'll hunt.  You'll have some calibers in both bolt action and semi-automatic, which will come with 2 different ammo types as mentioned.  You'll have everything covered with guns ranging from the .223 up to the big bad boy the .338 MAGNUM.   One of the big features of the game is bullet cam and ballistic graphs while you take the shots.  It will also show the internal anatomy of the target once the bullet hits it.\n\nHere's a complete list for Rifles:\n-.223 Bolt Action Rifle\n-.223 Semi-Auto Rifle\n-.370 Bolt Action\n-7mm Mag Bolt Action\n-.30-06 Semi-Auto\n-.338 Mag Bolt Action\n\nThat's the bulk of the weapons, but you'll also get:\n-12-gauge Pump Action\n-Recurve Bow\n-Compound Bow\n\nAll the weapons and gear cost money, which you can obtain by completing the missions and collecting your trophies.  Clean and humane kills get you the most money, and you actually get docked money for unfavorable shots such a stomach shot.\nThere's a multiplier system which calculates how much money you get for a kill, and the biggest multiplier is the ProHunt one for when you complete ALL the ProHunts in the game.  Although, by that time I had almost bought everything in the game, other than a few of the most expensive scopes.  The scopes are the most plentiful item in the game and there's quite an extensive 'range' of them to buy (pun intended).\n\nAs for other equipment, you'll have the chance to buy a few different binoculars, and a number of animal calls like Moose, Elk, and Deer.  Using them is ultra easy with 0% chance of messing up a call.  Just need to press 'L' and hold for the length of the call you want.  That's it.  The scent cover is ALWAYS on and doesn't need to be applied or reapplied.  I'd like to see different scents, not just scent cover.\n\nThe map and built-in GPS is a very valuable tool, since not only does it show all the game locations, it also details which areas have got too much hunting pressure, and what time of day is best to scout a certain spot, as well as the critical wind direction and your scent dissipation.\nYou'll be constantly reminded of the fact that a sudden wind change could cause you to fail as a hunter.  I KNOW ALREADY!  STOP SAYING IT! hehe  Your radio will constantly come to life with the voice of your 'guide's' wisdom on this subject every few minutes, to the point of turning the gun on him as opposed the game animals.\n\nI need to shup up now, because I've written a book, not a review. hehe\n\nSo to compress all that, the game is fun, easy going, with no game 'bugs', and will get your heart pumping at times.  I suggest getting it on sale like I did, but $34 bucks is still worth it imho. (he said bucks hehe).\n\n8/10 GAME SCORE","May 7, 2015","true","55.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A very in-depth hunting system that has a bullet system similar to that of Sniper Elite. This system shows where exactly your bullet lands, and shows you if you hit a vital area. If you hit a vital area, you're pretty much guaranteed the kill. It can be a tricky though, and you lose points for missing. It has a stealth system, a scent system, wide variety of locations to visit and missions to complete. You can do free hunt, but there's also very specific missions that require you to hunt a particular animal.\n\nIt has a lot of problems though, for example the restrictions the game forces on you can be a bit ridiculous. You can't explore new areas until you've done certain tasks, and all guns and misc items are blocked behind an in-game money wall that you can only get through hunting animals, while the default gun is pretty meh. The stealth system can be a bit frustrating at times, when you can't run up a hill without scaring the animals on the opposite side of the hill. You have to be EXTREMELY patient to play the game most efficiently, which isn't necessarily bad but it can be quite annoying.\n\nOverall it's an extremely solid hunting game that surprised us all with how good it is. But it does have it's fair share of issues that hold it back from being one of the best hunting games ever.","April 12, 2014","true","9.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This game certainly has more action than "The Hunter", in which you sometimes have to walk for hours - just to see one animal. Good thing about Cabelas is that animals do not run across the map when they hear a shot, sound do not travel through rocks or hills.\n\nThe graphics are prettier than earlier Deer hunter / Big Game hunter, It is not as pretty as "The hunter" but pretty enough. You really feel like you are wandering around in a nice forest. I also like the "CSI" style bullet scenes that shows you clearly where you hit, making you learn the anatomy of the animals and become a better hunter in the process.\n\nInstead of money, you get gear credits. You get more if you go on hunts instead of just picking an open place and start randomly shooting things. There are stands and hides a little here and there on the maps, no need to bring your own. It is nice to be able to get up fast from prone, this usually get tedious when following game you just made a hole in and want to track - or run away from!\n\nSome things i find annoying, the weapon bobbing on screen for example. Also cutscenes should be skippable, not replaced by a text that says "Skipping cutscene" for 10 seconds.\n\nThat said, i think that CBGH is a very nice game, i'm glad i bought it.\n\n\nEDIT: After 28 hours of very enjoyable gameplay, the game became corrupted like mentioned by other users in the forums (i was hoping to not get this bug). Sure hope that the developers will issue a fix. Until then i cannot recommend this game any more.","May 2, 2015","false","29.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

You play the role of Jesus, who never gets tired of running and can pass through small trees without a peep.  You can also teleport without a sound into your treestand only ten yards away from your prey undetected.  You can use a recurve in your treestand with about 340 degrees worth of shot area.  Your recurve bow does more damage than your .270 rifle.  And at 50-80 yards your .270 shoots about 2 foot high and has the same grouping a dolphin would have during an epileptic seizure.  Shooting on the run is impossible.  The deer have short term memory lose and have turned around and started back towards me after maybe 10 minutes.\n\nThe only good thing about this in terms of a hunting game is the graphics.  In real life, a headshot is never a bad idea.  Just ask any poacher with a .22 rifle.  A rib will NEVER deflect a bullet the way it does on this game.  And there is never always one buck per every doe.\n\nI did get a chuckle at the really bad rabbit spawns.  Rabbits spawning in a wide open field...  Killed 12 coming out of the same hole in about 5 minutes.  Apparently rabbits have colonies...\n\nThat's not the only things wrong with this game, but it's a good start for a vent.  The game plays out more like a Sniper Elite or Ghost Recon than a hunting game.","June 26, 2015","false","8.6"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","13","27","4","3"

OK....\n\nMy likes:\n\n1) "Pro Hunts" where you hunt a singular animal with a reputation. These are harder to kill and take more skill than the typical animal.\n\n2) Shows trajectory of bullets/arrows and where it hits.\n\n3) You get to hunt big animals like moose and bears.\n\nMy dislikes:\n\n1) Not a realistic hunter. 90% of the time you're sneaking up to a deer stand 50 yards from the animal. Other times you call it in and it ALWAYS works. Assuming you don't spam the keyboard.\n\n2) No vechicles (at least, not in the first section of the game, haven't played the other 3 yet).\n\n3) Map is isn't that big. The only good thing about it is that it doesn't take long to run around and find more animals, but I rather have a bigger map and ATV's to ride.\n\n4) Hard to start out. It takes several hours to get any decent guns/ammo.\n\n5) No range/aim tutorial. You have to figure out where vitals organs are by pure trail and error. There is no shooting range you can practice your aim at either.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, this game isn't terrible, but I think I enjoyed my old Deer Hunter game more.

Etc.. However, though bullets will sometimes IRL deflect off of bones it seems they emphasize it in this game and reality is it should have been named "Bone Deflection Simulator".\n\nI usually play theHunter instead for a little more realism or old school Deer Hunter 2005. This is of course my opinion.. I still recommend the game due to the fact that they made a step forward in the right direction getting rid of that crappy arcadeish linear gameplay from previous installments of the series but again, when your trying to have a bit of relaxing fun and deal with the constant bullet deflection off a rib at 40 yards causing a minor flesh wound, well to say the least it can be pretty damn frustrating. Still it is a fun game and not a "bad buy".\n\nBefore some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ desides to post whining about "he only has 20 hours gameplay" as of this review post, lets not forget that the game is available on other platforms.

Definitely not the run-and-gun Call of Duty/Battlefield style game, you need to stalk your prey and take advantage of the environment in order to sneak up close enough to get a good shot. Shot placement and ammunition type matters in this game, you need to hit a vital organ (lungs, heart, spine, brain) in order to get a clean kill. If you miss your shot, you'll have to follow the animal's tracks (or a blood trail in some cases) to catch up with it elsewhere. It's not a very fast paced game, but I found it very relaxing!\n\nThe AI for the animals is rather simplistic, they tend to hang out at different "eat", "drink", and "sleep" waypoints at different times of the day. You can use calls to lure the animal to you, but it works on bucks/bulls 100% of the time if they're within ear shot. They dumbly walk towards you when you use it, never really acting suspicious at all. I think that to some degree they decided to dumb the animals down to make the game easier. If they were to skittish, it would be more of a hiking simulator than a hunting one.\n\nSome people have reported having issues with the game becoming unplayable after 30 hours or so. I have not encountered this issue and I'm running Windows 8 on an MSI laptop.","April 24, 2015","true","48.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The half dozen times I found something I would either hit it in the shoulder and it would run the ♥♥♥♥ away, or I‘d miss the lung and get nothing but gut shots. The game has a map system that shows what direction the wind is blowing and has areas marked where different animals tend to be throughout the day. Unfortunately no one told the animals they had somewhere to be. I have sat in one place for the while hunt and seen nothing. I have gone from one spot to another and seen even less. The random little animals like foxes run through the woods and don't count for points which is fine I just wish they would stop freezing in place so I can run up and push them.\n\nI was hunting a bear in a challenge hunt using the starter rifle and scope (because I couldn't afford anything better) I was given 3 in game hours to bag it and spent that time shooting it in the shoulder and it would run off, or one time I shot it in the head with the highest penetrating ammo I had and it bounced off. The x-ray shot showed I had broken the skull but apparently a bear is a bulletproof animal able to run away with a shattered skull, a broken rib (from my second attempt to kill it when its steel rib deflected my shot away from the lung) and a bullet in the shoulder.\n\nOh, and the pigs. They seem to like to charge from nowhere. Ya ♥♥♥♥ those guys.\n\nThis game could have been good, almost great. but I think Cablea's is trying the same thing other sports games and CoD are pulling, "put a game out every year that is incomplete, broken, the same as or worse than whatever we put out last year." I had high hopes for this. Oh well, that will teach me to not read reviews before I buy a cheap game.","May 4, 2015","false","3.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Arguably important in a hunting game.\n\nI was aware that RT is both the hold breath/fire button. I got that. However, at first I couldn't manage to get him to hold his breath. I would just fire immediately, which resulted in some less than satisfactory shots. Now I can't get him to fire at all. I spammed the living hell out of RT and nothing. Even experimenting with different amounts of pressure. So I'm watching my buck pace in front of me begging to die and I can't do anything about it.\n\nI am annoyed.

The game deliberately doesn't take into account that when you blow open the cranial cavity the animal should lose blood pressure and die.  The narrator is constantly scolding you for aiming for the head, and the brain "damage zone" is deliberately small and 100% limited to the actual brain and not the surrounding tissues. I am all for reducing animal suffering, but when you are hunting the goal is to kill the animal and harvest it's meat.. let's not pretend it's something else.\n\nI also have a bone to  pick with the ballistics in this game. There is no way in hell that a .270 round is going to only penetrate 6 inches in a deer's head, back, or side, from under 75 yards. It's unbelievable how little stopping power the rounds have in this game. I think it's to make the shamed headshot harder, since that is what has stopped me from hitting the brain well over 50% of the time.\n\nOn the topic of ballistics, bullet drop and leading the animal is totally unrealistic in this game. Where you point is exactly where the bullet will hit from the 15 hunts I tried. Even at 200+ yards. At an animal in full sprint. My brain is leading the animal into the shot, but I find myself missing repeatedly when doing so, seeing time stop as the bullet leaves the barrel. I also can't detect a realistic bullet drop, and the wind has no noticeable effect either.\n\nAnd again on the ethical concerns... I especially am hunting on my computer instead of in real life so that I can try crazy 700 meter headshots, without any concern for the animal. I am not playing to mollycoddle the comfort of a virtual animal or the idea of a real animal. They clearly want to reinforce going for the safer shot of behind the shoulder blade (lungs, heart) as a part of some politically correct, ethical hunting image. Cabela's is a hunting gear retailer and it is clearly inserting this notion into their game as an attempt to mainstream their brand and sell more physical product.\n\nWhen I play games, I want to not think about ethical concerns for my prey, not think about a company protecting it's brand, and I want to immerse myself in a believable and realistic simulation. This game has made it's 3 strikes for me.","April 18","false","2.1"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajmyers/recommended/247770/","ajmyers","Magnum Xpress","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajmyers/","145 products in account","First off. This game is better in many ways than the previous Cabelas Franchise hunting games have been in the past. Graphics are awesome. Animal behavior is decent. Now the problems; this game makes it nearly impossible to kill an animal without having to track it 49 miles thru the wilderness. Even the most perfectly aimed shots somehow by magic get deflected by a rib or completely miss vital organs all together. Last time I checked even if a bullet misses the lungs, heart, and everything else in there, its still doing damage. Oh no! says Cabelas. Also the sheer lack of weapon options is ridiculous. The fact that you have to match up ammunition precisely to the game you are hunting, is realistic, but once again flawed in this game. The damage they cause is indistinguishable except a small increase in penetration. The fact that some weapons wont even hurt or hit the game you're after is nonsense. We all know you shouldn;t shoot a moose with a .223 but if I would im sure the bullet wouldnt pass thru his body and leave him fully intact with no harm done. I know they are trying to make a point about "responsible shooting" , because thats all i keep hearing from the guide, but in reality bullets cause harm, even if you "shouldn't" be using them. Major mistake.  My last issue with the game is they give you the choice of about every scope known to man to put on the few rifles they even let you choose from.  Id rather pick from 30 rifles than 30 scopes to put on the 6 or so rifles in the game. And what about handguns? I think a .44 or .454 in this game would add many more challenges and many more missions. Another missed oppurtunity to come across as more appealing and realistic to the gamers/hunting community. Otherwise I enjoy the game play. Its much better than anything else Ive seen in years. Do i recommend it? sorta.","May 11, 2014","true","63.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bear in mind that it is NOT a survival game (unless you count angry boars or bears)---you don't need to eat, drink, sleep, repair stuff.. your time is simply devoted to stalking your prey and  making a fatal shot.  If your first shot doesn't kill your target, plan on tracking its prints and blood trail until you either find it dead, need to finish it off, or completely lose sight of it (which is heavily frowned upon by the ethics of proper hunting).

The graphics are very nice, the physics are pretty near spot on, the animal reactions and interactiosn are very realistic. The game play is handled in several ways that I really like, ie. the drifting scent display when you bring up the map that gives you a really great idea of how your scent is proliferating through the hunting area. This hunting game takes it all into account and you need to be aware of everything going on around you. You will make noise and listen for animal noises, you will need to stay low and as hidden as possible while trying to get a glimpse at your next potential trophy. Tracks will lead you to your prey and blood trails will lead you to your fallen trophy. I really enjoy the progression of your hunting gear, which is expamded as you win each hunt and mission and buy bigger and better equipment. You also unlock more and more territory as well. This hunting game is really going to impress long term hunting gamers aa well as bring in those who have not played hunting titles in the past.\n","June 10, 2014","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is really fun, especially for someone who is genuinely interest in hunting. It's not the type of game where you're going to be running around shooting animals, you have to strategize.\n\nThey really make you work for the kills. And in doing so, it makes it very rewarding to land a kill. I've been playing it on the "authentic" difficulty though, so for anyone who thinks it sounds a little too difficult, there is a casual setting.\n\nAs your progress doing different hunts you get points that you can unlock items in the store with (Ex. animal call, different bullets, different arrows, scent masks, new guns etc.).\n\nThe maps are absolutely huge and beautiful, it's honestly nice just walking around listening to nature. There's always birds or rabbits or the occasional fox (etc. etc. etc.) that really make the world feel alive.\n\nI would compare the graphics to Battlefield 3 or 4 easily. The map at first looks like you get access to all of North America, they break it up into 4 quadrants, although they only allow you to hunt in the United States.\n\nAs a Canadian it'd get me hyped to hunt in Canada but, unfortunately since they only let you hunt in the northern United States. Regardless when you're hunting in the northern quadrants of the map you feel like you're in Canada. It's nice having that contrast in environments to keep things fresh.\n\nAll in all, I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a solid hunting game that leans more towards the strategy side of things, opposed to the arcade style (Ex. Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013).","May 7, 2014","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like the Cabelas from 05-07 era this game is for you. The mechanics of this game is very well done. You basically track you target (Deer, Bear, Hogs, etc) through a fairly large open wooded area. There are a few guidelines that you need to follow to complete each hunt. For example, You need to hunt 2 Hogs from within 70 yards, or Hunt 3 8-point deer. These can be challenging because most of the time you will be right up to the time limit of the hunt.\n\nOne of the best features of these cabelas games is the bullet time effect. This gives you a great sensation of the hunt. You see the bullet fly through the air in slow motion. Then as the bullet enters the animal, you get a cool anatomy look of the skeleton and organs. As the bullet passes throught the target, bones break and organs puncture. This part never gets old for me.\n\nOverall, if you are on the fence about this. I would highly recommend it. There are a few graphical glitches but nothing that detracts from the game. The overall presentation and execution is very good.

This game is really fun, especially for someone who is genuinely interest in hunting. It's not the type of game where you're going to be running around shooting animals, you have to strategize.\n\nThey really make you work for the kills. And in doing so, it makes it very rewarding to land a kill. I've been playing it on the "authentic" difficulty though, so for anyone who thinks it sounds a little too difficult, there is a casual setting.\n\nAs your progress doing different hunts you get points that you can unlock items in the store with (Ex. animal call, different bullets, different arrows, scent masks, new guns etc.).\n\nThe maps are absolutely huge and beautiful, it's honestly nice just walking around listening to nature. There's always birds or rabbits or the occasional fox (etc. etc. etc.) that really make the world feel alive.\n\nI would compare the graphics to Battlefield 3 or 4 easily. The map at first looks like you get access to all of North America, they break it up into 4 quadrants, although they only allow you to hunt in the United States.\n\nAs a Canadian it'd get me hyped to hunt in Canada but, unfortunately since they only let you hunt in the northern United States. Regardless when you're hunting in the northern quadrants of the map you feel like you're in Canada. It's nice having that contrast in environments to keep things fresh.\n\nAll in all, I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a solid hunting game that leans more towards the strategy side of things, opposed to the arcade style (Ex. Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013).","May 7, 2014","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To put it simply, intentional emergence takes place when the game rules are simple and the player has a lot of different tools at their disposal to help them win the game.\n\nIn Cabela’s Big Game Hunter Pro Hunts, the player may arm themselves with a weapon and ammo of their choice in an open hunt of whatever prey they want. They may stalk their prey using calls or no calls. They may fire from a stand, a blind, or on foot. The player may even attempt to shoot their prey in any location of the body that suits their personal style.\n\nWhat really changed my outlook on hunting games in general was having an inside view of how I killed my prey.

If you like the Cabelas from 05-07 era this game is for you. The mechanics of this game is very well done. You basically track you target (Deer, Bear, Hogs, etc) through a fairly large open wooded area. There are a few guidelines that you need to follow to complete each hunt. For example, You need to hunt 2 Hogs from within 70 yards, or Hunt 3 8-point deer. These can be challenging because most of the time you will be right up to the time limit of the hunt.\n\nOne of the best features of these cabelas games is the bullet time effect. This gives you a great sensation of the hunt. You see the bullet fly through the air in slow motion. Then as the bullet enters the animal, you get a cool anatomy look of the skeleton and organs. As the bullet passes throught the target, bones break and organs puncture. This part never gets old for me.\n\nOverall, if you are on the fence about this. I would highly recommend it. There are a few graphical glitches but nothing that detracts from the game. The overall presentation and execution is very good.

Fun game, need patience mostly. Bought this game 80% off so it was like $7-$8 and was well worth it. Only bad thing is you cant jump(should be able to get on some rocks, but cant) and it seems like the animals are always in their designated locations and never on any trails or in between their locations. Other than that, It was a fun game.","September 9, 2015","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are very nice, the physics are pretty near spot on, the animal reactions and interactiosn are very realistic. The game play is handled in several ways that I really like, ie. the drifting scent display when you bring up the map that gives you a really great idea of how your scent is proliferating through the hunting area. This hunting game takes it all into account and you need to be aware of everything going on around you. You will make noise and listen for animal noises, you will need to stay low and as hidden as possible while trying to get a glimpse at your next potential trophy. Tracks will lead you to your prey and blood trails will lead you to your fallen trophy. I really enjoy the progression of your hunting gear, which is expamded as you win each hunt and mission and buy bigger and better equipment. You also unlock more and more territory as well. This hunting game is really going to impress long term hunting gamers aa well as bring in those who have not played hunting titles in the past.\n","June 10, 2014","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I've enjoyed it a lot, the issues with it are too great to ignore and have caused me some severe grief in the past.\n\nWhat the game does right.\n\nWhen it comes to Hunting Sims, we can't really afford to be too picky. The market isn't particularly wide or varied, and the only real alternative to this game that I've found is "TheHunter", which seems decent, possibly even a bit better than this for those looking for an even more lifelike experience, but it's also much more expensive.\n\nThis game does everything you would expect an affordable Hunting Sim to do though. It's not the prettiest game, but it looks alright and it runs okay. It should hopefully run fairly well on most modern system, even if you've not got some grand gaming PC.\n\nHunting is a decently realistic and satisfying experience with non-gory X-ray shots of your shots impact on your prey, and unless you shoot out the heart, brain or spine/neck your prey isn't going to just keel over right then and there, and you've got some tracking to do.\n\nStealth is an important aspect, and while it's really just all about crawling VS. jogging and lying still when your prey is looking, it's definitely passable. No, it's not Dishonored or Hitman, but if you were expecting that from a Hunting Sim then.. Yeah, I can't help you.\n\nThe atmosphere and environments are good too. you've got 4 very large and diverse maps with different kinds of wildlife for you to hunt and several "Missions" with different objectives that require all sorts of different skills.\n\nWhat the game does wrong.\n\nFirst and foremost, the most important (Potentially gamebreaking) issue is that your savefile might be corrupted at random, meaning you will have to manually delete it and start all over again. I'm not sure what causes this, and I believe it doesn't really come into play before you've played the game on a single savefile for more than 30 hours. There are some fixes you can attempt and to use, but none are guaranteed to work.\n\nThe tutorial level is seemingly unskippable, and it drags on for upwards of half an hour. This game isn't particularly complicated, so starting on a fresh save (Or being forced to because of the issue described above) can easily annoy someone as they have to go through all the steps, learning things they already know. Unskippable tutorials are never a good thing, it doesn't really matter whether it's a hunting sim or Pokémon.\n\nThere aren't any real options when it comes to customizing your experience or fiddling with graphical settings. As far as I've been able to figure out there's no way to rebind keys if playing on a keyboard.\n\nConclusion.\n\nThis is a fairly solid Hunting Sim for anyone looking, but because of the gamebreaking issues with corrupting savefiles I find myself unable to recommend it.\n\nIf you find this game on offer, or if you're prepared to fiddle around with the savefile-issue, then go right ahead! But buying this product at full price isn't going to be worth it purely on the basis that you're buying a fundamentally flawed product that will eventually break and require a fix or a fresh start.\n\nIt's very, very unlikely that this issue will ever be fixed, but if it ever is then I'll be ready to heartily recommend this for anyone looking for a good stealth game or solid Hunting Sim.","June 9, 2015","false","50.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
