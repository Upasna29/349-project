I know it reads up there on the genre description here on Steam, but this game is more of an Action RPG then anything else.\n\nSo, basically you enter this world where humans are fighting against demons and vice versa. In your first playthrough you start playing on the Light campaign, as one of the humans. The controls function like any other RPG, except here the combat is more fast paced. You don't go around and do quests and there is very little dialog. What you do is basically kill everything you see, and collect as much gold as you can. With the gold you collect, you can equip better weapons, armor, and bring more potions with you each time. There are quite a lot of races/classes that you gain as you play (some by completing levels, and some are special classes that you get after collecting all of the gold in the game).\n\nThe game itself is fun. It's obviously not a modern game. The graphics are dated, but they're not ugly or anything. The soundtrack is lacking, with only a few songs that you keep hearing over and over, but hey, at least they're good. The gameplay is simple and intuitive, but I have to warn you that the hitboxes are very small, and the game can be a bit difficult sometimes. I finished the game on medium but even then I had to replay most levels quite a few times. After you finish the game for the first time, you can play the game now on the Dark campaign and get a different perspective.\n\nEven though the game is from 2003 its It puts a lot of new games to shame. It's challenging, fun, and has a lot of content.\nI recommend.","January 12, 2014","true","15.9"," 147 of 164 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","147","164","0","3"

The rift that separated the Enclave of Magic from the Outlands is slowly closing, and heroes emerge from both sides, either to defend or conquer the Enclave.\n\nPros: The game offers two campaigns, first the light campaign where you defend the Enclave from the invaders, and then the dark campaign where you are a minion seeking the glory of conquest. As the story progresses, you find or unlock additional equipment and up to six characters (per campaign) to play as. At the start of each chapters, you get to pick your character and equipment, limited by how much gold you found in each mission. For the most part, you can backtrack as much as you want for each missions, and replay any of them at any time if you missed out on some gold and want to try to do better (allowing you to select more equipment).\n\nCons: I don't know why this was tagged as an RPG on Steam, 'cause it sure isn't: you have no stats, no upgrades, no character interaction or dialog choice. You don't even really purchase and manage an inventory, gold serves as "points" that determine how much equipment you can bring in a mission, being able to swap out at full value any item in between chapters. It is a Hack & Slash in the most basic fashion, battles consisting merely of slashing in the wind, only knowing whether you hit anything if damage numbers appear, while the AI is monstrously bad (enemies just jiggle about, only occasionally chasing assuming you don't break line of sight, like passing behind a chair). Voice acting is horrible, the story is rather poor, character progression is absent, and having up-to-date resolution doesn't save the graphics that have aged so badly that most 3D Fantasy early access indie titles are doing better than this blocky 2-Gen-Old world.\n\nVerdict: ★☆☆☆☆ - May it rot in your backlog\n\nIt's not horrible, but it is pretty bad by today's standards. I simply cannot get myself invested enough to ever play it again, leave alone complete a playthrough of even the first campaign. Maybe at one time this was considered a good game, but I can't see how I could recommend it to anyone, even for the low price.\n\nP.S.: There are dozens of Steam Recommendations that are fake, just to raise the score. They all say "gg" or "ggg", all have a username either starting by X or ending by XYZ, and all generally played under an hour. Seriously, dev/fans? You need to try to "cheat" the scores on Steam just to up the sales?\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","December 15, 2015","false","2.3"," 196 of 273 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","196","273","7","10"

When your mouse is set to a high DPI the camera will want to stutter and work against you sometimes even giving weird speedups even though the fps remains at a solid 60 throughout the whole game.\n\nIngame:\nWe have full voice acting by all NPC's though none by the randomly joining playable characters leaving a bit of a connection issue. Animations look good and give a good feel however hitboxes can sometimes be hard to hit. The game is set to go through story and survival stages which are selected in the map. When selecting a mission you also get to choose your character and the equipment he/she may or may not have which can then be purchased. Gear is very effective and will help you out alot. Purchases are done through gold which is found in missions. You find this gold in hidden area's or from enemies and sometimes requires platforming. The AI is ofcourse silly and will easily run into holes or groups of enemies (you don't actually need them).\n\nAchievements:\nNot available.\n\nDLC:\nNot available.\n\nConclusion:\nEnclave is a solid game for it's age and got a good PC port.

Its a game that doesn't take combat lightly, especially against certain enemies. You need to use your shield, as well as avoiding enemy attacks to maximize your combat efficiency and save on health.\n\nThe game is also kind of a collect-a-thon in where each level has treasure for you to find hidden throughout, you also get a mandatory sum of gold after each level. However, if you get more gold hidden in the levels, you can equip yourself with better gear and more potions at a time at the start of each level. The way you spend money is well, you don't exactly spend it like you normally would. Everything costs a certain amount and you will always have the amount of gold prior to "spending" it on your loadout. So the more gold you have, the better gear you can have, and more potions too.\n\nThe combat is a bit lackluster, in fact the hitboxes seem damn near god awful and random. Also the damage you deal seems vague at best, its random seeming sometimes as well. I guess I can't quite nail the pattern down. Ever.\n\nThe levels work on a checkpoint system and there is no quicksaving/quickloading. So if you die before a checkpoint, you're screwed, and have to start the level over again. Also I'm not sure if you can use the checkpoints more than once each or not, never died more than once per checkpoint. Well its the type of checkpoint where it teleports you to the point with full health, but your progress is not altered.\n\nStill, at that price its worth a play, even if it can only keep your attention long enough to play the Light Campaign. Oh yeah, theres two campaigns. Light Campaign, and the Dark Campaign, available after you beat the Light Campaign.","December 17, 2013","true","6.7"," 52 of 64 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","52","64","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Resoula/recommended/253980/","Resoula","Resoula","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Resoula/","262 products in account","Let me start by saying, I REALLY tried to like this game. And at first? I loved it. Enclave is an action-based RPG where you hack and slash your way through levels (depending on your class) all while collecting gold so you can afford better gear at a shop you visit in-between levels. Collecting gold is HUGELY important. In later levels archers are OP with their damage and warriors are brutally tanky. You NEED to collect gold otherwise you stand no chance. Let me also state one thing.\n\nTHERE IS NO ADWARE IN THIS GAME. THESE MANY REVIEWS THAT SAY SO ARE OLD, AND HAVE NOT CHANGED EVEN THOUGH THE ADWARE HAS BEEN REMOVED.\n\nSo what does this game have going for it?\n+From 2002 I never would have expected these kinds of graphics.\n+The soundtrack is amazing.\n+And the sound effects aren't too shabby either.\n+The level design and placement of enemies is genius.\n+The destruction in this game is fantastic. In buildings during sieges the roof can fall on your head, fatally damaging you. You can slash the beam of a wooden watch tower and bring it falling to the ground. Crates can be broken into flying pieces by explosives that are essentially flying wooden weapons.\n\nUNFORTUNATELY.\n-The story is really...bland. A 3 year old that watched lord of the rings could have thought this story up.\n-The enemies are very generic and repetitive. Again, a 3 year old that watched lord of the rings could have created these extremely generic characters.\n-The voice acting is mediocre.\n-The AI is nonsensical is how it acts. Enemies are jumping and breakdancing all over the place while you're supposed to be in a serious fight.\n-The combat. The core element of ARPGs, the COMBAT. Is the worst combat I have ever seen in an RPG in my entire life.  Ranged weapons work around a little dot you see in the center of your screen. Place it over an enemy and shoot, and you hit. Miss by an inch and you miss completely. It's pathetic. The melee combat is even worse. You just spam left mouse click to swing a sword aimlessly, missing tiny enemies completely unless you can get down to their level most of the time. Your shield is basically useless because there's a delay between raising it and lowering it that you could have used to get attacks in, that your enemies WILL use to attack you. The swordplay is also very unresponsive. I mouse click twice and suddenly my character is doing a 4-move sword swinging fiasco while I'm right clicking and trying to raise my shield. So an enemy pummels me while my character is having fun being some kind of sword dancer.\n\nEven if you get this for free like I did I would not recommend playing it. Maybe this kind of gameplay was good in an ARPG once, but at the same time, RUNESCAPE had better combat than this. So I could never condone a game that flops on its main element so badly.

Its a third or first person medieval fantasy hack and slash with engaging combat and exceptional environments. For the rogue in all us there is a dark campaign where you play as several evil classes like assassin, berserker, lich and sorceress to name a few. If there are any good hearts out there, you also have the light campaign with their human counterpart classes such as knight, huntress, druid, wizard and half-ling. Each campaign lasted me a fun and joyous seven hours. At the start of each level you select your class and assign their equipment from the money you have. Nothing is permanently bought, so if you want expensive armor and a weak weapon with a few potions, you can do it or if zero potions, expensive weapons and armor is more to your liking go for it. The money is never spent, just assigned. These classes, play styles and different equipment go a long way to making each play through different, even if its your twentieth time on a level.\n\nSo why is this game so good? Let's start with the controls and movement. While this was an X-Box game, there doesn't seem to be controller support. You're stuck with your keyboard and rebindable keys. Its more than that though, your character seems to have a good sense of movement. You'll climb ladders, duck to crawl through tunnels, jump up boxes and over collapsed bridges. Even jump from rooftop to rooftop. Each class has its own speed. For the most part the heroes of the light campaign feel slower than their dark counterparts. Knights and berserkers move slow, while half-lings and goblins are the fastest. There is no run button, heroic classes are so slow that it really feels like you need to fight.\n\nGetting there is half the fun, but along the way you'll of course find enemies and you've got the fantastic combat to take them out with. I can't call it deep combat so much as its fun. Each class can have a melee weapon that you really just mouse click bash to flail it around. Each weapon has its own strength, speed and range. Others have enchantments that will light enemies on fire. Most classes also have a shield too. Hold the right mouse button to have your shield up to block arrows and wow you will be blocking a lot of arrows. With some enemies that can fire a shotgun of bolts at you, it becomes mandatory if you're going to survive at close range.\n\nTo add some depth there, each time your shield gets bashed, that will knock it away for a split second leaving you open to attack. So if two archers time it just right they can break through your defenses. This goes for enemies with shields too. They're just like you, when their shield is up, you need to knock it down to hurt them.\n\nWizards, sorceresses, lich and druids have magic. Each magician has a magic meter that refills over time.  So if you run out from fire balling an enemy, you've got to wait, where the enemies see your weakness and will rush at you. You can equip two spell staffs, so you have a variety there in the level. A lot of the spells make the game easier. Plenty of them seek out enemies and turn in the air to hit them. Instead of a shield, the right mouse will raise a force field, but I never used it that much, since mages are such long range classes. Some staffs also have a summoning ability to raise an ally to help you. Oh and the spells can't get blocked. You still take damage.\n\nForm there, non magic classes can also have a long range bow or cross bow. Even the knight and grenaders can use them, but you need to equip them at the start of each level, you can't just find one. I've gotta say crossbows and bows are far too difficult to accurately hit anything. Sure melee enemies running to you will take arrows til they're dead. Its shooting the other archers that becomes incredibly difficult. They can dodge arrows just as good as any human player. Its difficult to accurately hit them, so to compensate, there are several different tricks. You can load several bolts into a bow at once by pressing the right mouse button. Then release so one of them will hit its target if not all to instantly kill a close enemy. There are also fire bolts that will ignite enemies or the ground on fire. The abilities add some interesting facets to the game when you're forced to play as an assassin for the dark campaign's original character.\n\nYou have a quick health potion button that really plays into combat, because you need to chug the potion. Its not just instant energy, so if you're getting beaten to death, you need to hide and chug the potion before you can attack or defend again. It adds a lot to the combat and gives the enemies a better chance.\n\nYou'll need to unlock the classes as you go through the game. This means you'll be rescuing your comrades in their levels. With them freed, they'll temporarily aide you, fight shoulder to shoulder with you and guide you to the next part. They can die too, but as long as you've saved them and complete the level, they're unlocked.\n\nEnclave puts you into incredible environments and assets are not used from level to level. So each level has a completely different look and feel. Crypts, tombs, caves, castles, lava caverns, shadowy towns, human towns. There is a ton of variety here. Between the light and dark campaigns only a few levels get reused among the two. Even if it is a shared level, you start from the opposite end of it, to make it feel fresher. The levels feel like they're just the right amount of time. Each level has plenty of exploration and a lot of levels feel open enough where you can look around without feeling like you're forced down a corridor. They never overstay their welcome. I never think of it as a chore, because there's always something new and beautiful to see around every corner.\n\nThe pre rendered cut scenes and menus are pretty dated with low resolution quality so they don't look as gorgeous as the game itself. Not that the game itself is high definition, but over a decade later it still looks amazing. The only thing lacking are the ground textures. Grassy fields could have used Oblivion style grass, but for a game that came out when Morrowind did it still looks better than its contemporaries.\n\nIts not all roses and sunshine in this dark enchanted world. The game goes from a fun treat and knuckles down on you in later levels to beat you down. I appreciated the challenge, even if some levels took me five minutes to make it across a bridge. If you die, you need to restart the level. To balance it out, if you can make it to a checkpoint, you will respawn there when you die. There's just one catch. You need enough gold collected in that level to respawn. I'm thankful for the checkpoints even at a cost. Having each revive cost gold gives you incentive to return to each level after you complete it. Oh by the way, you only keep the gold if you beat the level. So if you died ten times, you spent one hundred gold, so you can return to the level, not die and get an extra hundred gold to spend. Assuming you collected what you had before. That's the beauty with all the exploration, you can find things or miss them.\n\nYou won't get limited to combat, there are some puzzles and a few brief, yet fun turret sections that don't tie you to the turrets. The bosses are giant and feel engaging without being overwhelming or frustrating. A giant dragon, a huge lava monster and the mega evil boss has you shooting its hanging heart. If that wasn't enough for you, there are unlockable mini games that are actually fun. You'll find maps in levels that will unlock games like a survival mode and a cool turret gallery.\n\nThe music is also something to take note of. Its great and really fits the medieval epicness of the game. Its beautiful and touching, but with big and bold moments too.\n\nOnce again, this is just a gem of a game that I would have paid full price for when it was $50. Thanks to someone from Sweden for giving me the game!","February 10, 2015","true","14.6"," 72 of 103 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","72","103","5","0"

I hate to thumbs-down a game like this, but I'd be lying through my teeth (or, in this case, my keyboard) if I reccomended Enclave.","December 23, 2013","false","3.5"," 127 of 196 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","127","196","0","13"

When the game starts, greets us a little rather dynamic and impressive intro, but which fulfills its role as it should be - give the stories being pretext for threshing, which is to take place.  After this introduction, we have to choose side for which we'll be fighting for - good or evil. I chose the path of light (I'm such a thoroughly good man). Interestingly, this choice is important. Because each party has a completely different missions and different course of the game. It is worth to finish the game twice (that's what I did).\n\nAfter passing each stage we get access to new characters. Accessories, or rather equipment, does not impress anything in particular more fasting RPG fans. Besides, the Enclave is not rpg, although it may give such an impression, especially the world of game, full of mages, orcs and dragons. But returning to the equipment. We have swords, axes, hammers, but also bows or crossbows, ideally proven in the battles at distance. There is also something for the defense - shields and armor.  Everything we gain as you progress in the game. As far as we can afford it ... After each mission in "shop" there are new, better, items, and to buy them, we must have enough gold. Installment system in the world Enclave unfortunately does not exist, so the only solution is to keep your eyes wide open. Gold is scattered throughout the stages - often in various nooks and burrows.\n\nAs I said, the game was created a few years ago, but the graphic design looks passably well and still manages to attract the eyes to the screen without feeling disgust. Game menu looks impressive, being a foretaste of what awaits us in the game. Graphics look nothing less than more, as nicely. Textures are highly varied, and also flattering for a single pixel. Also, light effects and shadows have their charm. I must also mention about the interesting animation of monsters (large stock of movements). I have only caveat to NPC's faces. During expression in the cutscenes look like they had founded mask. The movable is only jaw, which gives quite unsightly visual effect. But the water ... the water looks beautiful. It is true that the whole persists to today's productions, but heck, this game is already on his neck showing its age! Soundtrack is another strong element of Enclave. The soundtrack is great, and the sound effects round out the rest.\n\nThe game is based roughly on the exploration of stages, which generously dotted with monsters, gold and various necessary to complete the map objects. We have a whole range of enemies. Some may complain about the level of difficulty, because the monsters were waving the weapon incredibly fast and agile. You need to skillfully put tactic, otherwise death will take us quickly. I played at the level of medium, namely the middle, and I have to admit that the level of irritation pierced several times the national average.\n\nThe combat system and the game itself falls moderately. The title is linear. Is it negative? I do not know, maybe, but for me not having any meaning. The combat system is extremely simple. Click the mouse and our soldier is attacking what he has in his hands. We will not experience any finesse. Attack, Defense, that's all.\n\nHowever, this game was able to catch me on a couple of good hours. Somehow I got this game for free. And I'm not sure if it's worth it for the moment these 6 euros. But do not hesitate to buy this game if it will be on promotion.","August 11, 2015","true","7.9"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","33","46","2","6"

For starters it has beautiful graphics for it's time, it look wonderful and you can tell the developers worked really hard on them. The same goes for the weapon and shields, they are very nice to look at, and you feel a sense of accomplishment when you can buy that sword, axe, staff, that completely obliterates your enemies in 2-3 hits.\n\nNow, gameplay, the controls are very solid and quite easy to control. At times it feels the mouse is a tad slow when it comes moving around and viewing everything, but it's easy to adjust in the menu. Also, there is no delay in the buttons so it is very nice.\n\nThe fighting is very unispired and makes combat feel more like a chore. After completing the main objective in the quest, towards the end of the game I just bolted out of there. No experience is gained whatsoever, so what's my incentive? Oh, that's right, gold!\n\nGold, you must collect gold througout the campaign. Some which is hidden VERY well and is extremely UNFAIR to get. When I say unfair, I mean that in this game, there are VERY FEW checkpoints. And if you aim to 100% this, you are going to pull out  your hair. Thing about checkpoints is, if you happen to reach one, but die..you lose gold. And that means you have to start over on the level completely in order to get all gold. Note, you need gold if you want to 100% the guy, buy more items and also  unlock all the characters. Again, it wouldn't be so bad if they weren't in such ridiculous spots. Earlier I said the controls are spot on, which they are, but the way these pots of gold and jewels are placed, it's beyond ridiculous.\n\nStoryline, it was very meh. You don't connect the chracters at all and the cutscenes and whatnot are very short and semi-informative. I didn't really play it for the storyline, mainly nostalgic reasons. I played it previously on Xbox and just had to relive this games graphical beauties one more time.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game. And give it a 6/10. The graphics are what really makes this game, but also the nice weapons you purchase as well. The combat is very so so and the story is..well it's a story. Fun game if you want to hack and slash, but that's all you're really getting out of it.","June 29, 2014","true","8.0"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","25","33","0","0"

You use what you need, when you need it, and it's bloody satisfying blasting a bunch of armored knights with a bomb.\n-No serious difficulty spikes; the game picks up the pace as you go along, not suddenly bombards you with something unreasonable you've never seen before.\n-Stealth works the way you'd expect.\n-Multiple weapon types that actually feel different and require different timings for their attacks to actually land. Each of the several staves also has a very different main and secondary attack.\n-Has a great cast of diverse characters for you to play as that actually have an impact on their playstyle; each of them has different equipment that they can use, different size hitboxes, different health and damage modifiers.\n-Locational damage is very accurate and makes aiming for the most vulnerable part of your enemy a good way of removing them. This mechanic works well with the fact different characters have different armor types for different sections of their body, depending on armor class.\n\nThe cons are also easy to list:\n-It's too short.\n-Sound design. On multiple occasions I found the voice lines got sped up, raised in pitch or what-have-you.\n-It's duration leaves something to be desired.\n-Soundtrack is not that great.\n-It's very, very brief.\n-It's pretty old, and hasn't aged too well in most areas.\n-It's gone too quickly.\n-The story is stupid. Not even funny stupid, just flat out stupid. It's not offensive or anything, though.\n-And yeah, it's length is insufficient.\n-By now I'm so proficient in this game I can complete any mission of either campaign with just the starting bow and arrows, armorless and without consuming health potions. Send help.\n-It's clock-time isn't all too great.\n\nYes, you could say I'm crazy, but I'd be far too busy hearing you over the dying grunts of an orc being shot in the neck by my magical arrows to notice.\n\nFar as I'm concernd, 10/10.

If you take this game and consider that, it really is amazing because for what little the devs had to work with it came out being a fairly challenging, fun, and interesting game.\n\nThe story was actually very unique, and I loved the cutscenes.

It's not an Action RPG, it's not even an Action game with RPG elements, unless "there are several characters who can use different weapons" counts as one. There are no dialogues, no character stats, no development, no quests, no (semi-) open world to discover, and most importantly of all, there's no role-playing.\n\nNaturally an Action game can be a nice experience as well, but sadly, "Enclave" isn't. For once, this is because there's hardly any gameplay. You can walk, jump, attack, and raise your shield in defense - that's it. It's really your basic ego-shooter range of actions. The combat feels incredibly clunky. Your attacks seldomly seem to connect, arrows go through the enemies without causing damage even if they're right in front of you; melee weapons flail wildly and hit everything but your foe. Combat doesn't feel rewarding in any way.\n\nThe missions are terribly simple as well. You'll always get several aims you need to complete, but it all comes down to "run through the tube-levels and kill everything". There's also a bunch of gold lying around in the levels, granting you access to other (read: stronger) weapons in the next one. The first couple of levels (which I played) feature only two basic types of enemies: small guys and big guys. It's boring, plain and simple.\n\nOn the pro side, the game environments look really nice. The story seemed alright, too, but I just couldn't be bothered to continue playing the game to find out how it unfolds.\nI can see why it would still spark nostalgia today for those who played "Enclave" when it was first released, but I just can't recommend buying it now, not even for 99 cents.","May 1, 2014","false","0.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Combat part of the game is pretty solid, it does not have that depth of Dark Messiah, but it comes with variety, because each character got different fighting style. Though knight is supposed to be "tanky", he does not feel "tanky" at all. Also like 90% of enemies are smaller than him, so he got a problem with hitting enemies.  In any case, game is alright for it's age and price, but there is nothing great or challenging about it, though collecting all gold is not that easy.","July 28, 2015","true","11.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

This allows you to upgrade your character using gold. Eventually, you unlock more classes and items. In this game, gold is not what I call a currency. It's more like points. This is because things can be "sold" for 100% of their value. Also, consumables, like arrows, are never permanently lost. If you "buy" 60 arrows, then you always start a level with 60 arrows. You can also upgrade your armor, but you have no control over the appearance.\n\nSome characters use staffs that shoot spells. Unfortunatly, there are very few differences between most of them, except the Astral and Psionic staves. One summons a Golem, and the other has oddly great tracking. Unfortunately, the Golem spell is finicky and can randomly fail.\n\nLevels give you more gold upon completion, but they also have some hidden gold. Most of the hidden gold is easy to find, but some are located in very secret or hard to reach places. If you miss any gold, then you can replay the level to find them. However, it will not count unless you also find the gold you already picked up. There are also hidden maps that unlock secret areas. They have small challenges that reward more gold. The levels themselves are fairly small and linear, but they are not boring either. Each one is different.\n\nWhen collecting gold you should try to not let enemies fall to thier deaths. This will cause any gold they drop to be unobtainable.\n\nThere are checkpoints in most of the levels. If you die, then you simply spawn at the checkpoint. Nothing is undone. However, if you didn't activate the checkpoint, or the level doesn't have one, then you must restart from the begining. Also, some levels could use more checkpoints.\n\nThe Hard difficulty is hard. I first tried it on hard, but I switched to easy during the second level after many restarts. On easy it was much more do-able, and a little too easy with the Druid. However, the begining of the 13th level was a little difficult with the Druid.\n\nUnfortunately, the 13th level could be seen as proof that the number 13 is unlucky. What should've been a cool level only showcases all of the small problems in this game; enemies that fell to their deaths drop gold off the map, too few checkpoints, too small combat areas, and the golem failing to cast for no reason (you need it on this map).\n\nFinally, there is one big flaw. It will crash once a day or two. I currently cannot find a fix. Some claim switching from DirectX to OpenGL fixes the problem. I tried it, and the only thing it did was make my game very dark. If it didn't have this flaw, then the game would be near perfect.\n\nDespite the flaws, I would recommend the game if it's on sale.","May 26","true","18.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The odd unexpected gem, occasional clever art design, or just experiencing the personal projects of earnest developers. Enclave is none of those. I've only played through maybe the first third of the Light campaign (there's an entire second one that you need to unlock), but my patience is officially dried up.\n\nThe game starts with a lengthy cutscene that could have just as easily been titled "How Not to Write a Fantasy Story 101," opening up a quasi-mystical looking tome while a bored-sounding woman rambles on about the setting's origin story, throwing in some made-up fantasy words like "Dreg'atar" every third word in a deseperate effort to alienate the audience before the game even starts. (Tip for writers: foreign-sounding words are the deep end of the pool. The bigger the plot point the less likely you want to have to pull out a glossary to understand it.)\n\nOnce the game starts it's a pretty bog-standard sloppy hack-and-slasher, paving through orcs and goblins because of course you are. Survival can get pretty finnicky as the clunky combat controls make tapdancing around your opponent the best means of defense, and occasionally an unpredictable exploding setpiece can kick you back to the start of the level. Still, not something I lost sleep over seeing as how it cost less than a dollar.\n\nThe quality just sort of slowly slides downhill from there. Ranged attacks are borderline useless as they require extreme precision, which in a game where no one ever sits still and your rate of fire is roughly the same as horse droppings, means that at mid-ranges you'll miss, at close ranges you'll miss and get stabbed, and at long ranges you might hit and give your target a small papercut.\n\nBasically every level introduces a new class to play as, most of which are slight variations on your standard sword/shield/crossbow Knight that you started with. The most distinct one (that I've unlocked, anyway) is the Druid, who takes any semblance of class balance and crushes it between her gratuitously exposed thighs (you can unlock armor with pauldrons, but not pants. How does that make sense?). Her most basic staff summons spectral ravens that home in on their target and has a secondary power to summon an elemental as a disposable meatshield, and her mana restores so fast it basically serves only to slightly limit your rate of fire.\n\nNow if this were a sensibly balanced game, the average class would be able to plow through levels with moderate difficutly and the hilariously overpowered Druid would just sort of wander through spamming magic like you snuck Starkiller into a game of Star Wars Battlefront. But this isn't a sensibly balanced game, and the clumsy controls will have your melee characters limping with no potions inside of five minutes, basically giving you the options of "play Druid or get really familiar with the first room of each level."\n\nMy patients burned up around level seven, which seemed easy enough like all the rest: wander around murdering ugly green people, grab loot, find exit. Unfortunately, the level is also littered with archer assassins, who use the same burst arrows as your Huntress class, but with unlimited ammo and impeccable aim. They can, and will, take you from full health to dead in one shot before you can even make out their silhouette through the game's heavy fog, and in a game where each level has MAYBE two checkpoints, there's only so many times I can try and play Russian Roulette with trying to snipe them through the fog before I give up and chuck the game in the trash.","February 15, 2015","false","4.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

There is a bunch of hidden treasures and even some maps that give you access to hidden levels. You collect gold in each level and in between you can buy better armor/weapons more motions etc. You unlock a bunch of different characters, that repeat themself not only in the form of being the same characters with different looks for both the dark and light campaign, but also by getting, lets say a sworsman in level 1 and in level 10 you can play the knight, that is the swordsman with more life and attack. so why bother with the swordsman? The classes therefor are basically: archer, mage, swordguy, something wird with bombs (never used that guy). The gold part is very interesting by the way. If you have, lets say 1000 gold and you get an armor for 500 and a sword for 200 then you still have 300 for potions or whatever. BUT: if you unequip the armor you get those full 500 back. This means you have a certain amount of gold, with which you can work and which equips whatever you want. Its seperate for each character as well. So you can use those 1000 gold to equip your archer and if you feel like playing mage instead you can use those 1000 gold no matter what your archer has equipped. The graphics are old but they dont hurt the eye or anything. The story is meh, but its about hacking and slashing not questing. you have small levels which you go through one after another and except for hidden treasures and levels there is not a whole lot else to do than to fight yourself through these levels.\n\nThere is two more things you need to know: 1 Its brutally hard. Even on easy mode you will die often. Why is this a problem? Because if you die you have to restart the entire mission, unless you found a checkpoint. if you got one of those you only lose 5 gold if you die and restart from there. the monsters you have slain even after reaching the checkpoint stay dead. what else makes it hard? terrible hit detection. I played through the entire game light and dark campaign and I have no clue whatsoever as to when something counts as hit and when it doesnt. I smash my enemy 15 times and they dont take a scratch, I hit somewhere completely else and they get damage? Same goes for me, believing that hiding behind my shild will block the enemy hit. What a foolish thought.\n\nFazit and TL:DR:\nIts mindless fun. See the enemy, kill the enemy, plunder the gold floating around everywhere and slay more enemys. And die a lot of times meanwhile.","June 24, 2014","true","23.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There has barely any loot accept gold and health pots and very rarely a particular level will reward you with an upgraded item for the various characters you'll unlock as you progress.  The combat is a mess with button bashing the par for the game, blocking serves limited purpose as you'll be wildly swinging your weapon around hoping for actual contact with enemies, sometimes it doesn't even register.\n\nThe defence Enclave has is its age, its quite old now - but even so, back in 2003 there was RPGS around that did a better job in the third person action rpg genre.   Levels are all extremely linear in nature, and some areas are quite confusing and its easy to get lost and frustrated.\n\nGraphics wise, its above par considering its age - this is probably why it got so many positive reviews.  But in terms of actual gameplay, its sub-par and the difficulty increases quite rapidly to a point you'll rage over cheap deaths from traps or other stupid game mechanics.","March 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Maybe because the game design is dated. Mainly due to feeling bare bones, and simple. I'm a few levels in 4, or 5. Each one has been the same so far (which I'm sure the whole game will be) fighting enemy's, running through linear levels, The game is dated. It's still very playable. If you're looking for something simple, and that doesn't require a lot of thought, or time I would recommend it. Especially on sale. I got it for 69 cents btw. The music is good, the graphics are pretty good.\n\nThe biggest thing wrong with this game is I think it can only run on one core. It seems if you have more than one core you have to go into the task manager while the game is running and choose "set affinity" and deselect all cores except one. Otherwise the game will be unplayable, and run really fast with a slight bit of lag. I play it on Vista.\n\nLike I said it's pretty much run through each level, kill enemy's, collect hidden gold, wash, and repeat until bored. The enemy's are the same. Finally got a lava type enemy to deviate away from the orc, hobgoblin thing, and magic witch......\n\nThe game is not bad, and it's definitely brings nothing to the table. Back in the day it may of been a cool hack and slash, but now it offers nothing.

Our original Xbox works great so I can play Enclave on it again, but I found this game on steam long before we got the console repaired. The checkpoint system makes the game a little easier to play for rookie players, and the removal of the lock-on circles equalizes the use of all ranged weapons and staves. And the difficulty settings are cool too for a classic game. Honestly I was ok with the original game with the lock-on circles, no checkpoints (except for Durzu and Mordessa in the Light Campaign), and no separate difficulty settings. However, I was so excited to see this game again and I just love to be able to experience part of the very beginning of my teen years once again. I just play on the Hard difficulty so I can avoid having the checkpoints, and the game is easy enough to beat anyways. I woud recommend this game because its very simple and straight forward, but it can be also challenging as well because I have still not been able to perfect all characters for all levels just yet. Graphics were excellent back when it was released and the gameplay was just fine back then too. So anyone complaing about the graphics and gameplay can just shut go back to their overdone next gen games because this is my favorite all time game.","September 13, 2014","true","54.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I really wouldnt consider this a RPG, as there is no real role play, its an action game, and a pretty decent one at that.\n\nThe story is simple;  bad guys coming to kill you.. kill them before they can kill you.  And the dark campaign is basically the same, except youre the baddy.\n\nIts pretty for its age, it has some nice environments and nicely done mechanics. A good example of these mechanics would be the halfling lady. Shes too short to be hit with certain  attacks, so shes good when facing certain enemies.  I know this may sound broken, but its pretty obvious its intentional.\n\nEnclave is a game that has a refreshing level of difficulty as well. If you die, and dont have a checkpoint, you restart from the beginning. If you do have a checkpoint activated, it costs 10 gold to bring you back. I never died enough to lose all of my money so I dont know what happens then.  Alot of the complaints about the difficulty are from people who did not get far enough in to get the checkpoints.\n\n\nReally the only issues I had with the game, is that its rather short, and linear, and the fact that its labeled an RPG when it barely has RPG elements to it. Its an action game 100%. That being said its worth it, especially if its on sale!","January 14, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Maybe because the game design is dated. Mainly due to feeling bare bones, and simple. I'm a few levels in 4, or 5. Each one has been the same so far (which I'm sure the whole game will be) fighting enemy's, running through linear levels, The game is dated. It's still very playable. If you're looking for something simple, and that doesn't require a lot of thought, or time I would recommend it. Especially on sale. I got it for 69 cents btw. The music is good, the graphics are pretty good.\n\nThe biggest thing wrong with this game is I think it can only run on one core. It seems if you have more than one core you have to go into the task manager while the game is running and choose "set affinity" and deselect all cores except one. Otherwise the game will be unplayable, and run really fast with a slight bit of lag. I play it on Vista.\n\nLike I said it's pretty much run through each level, kill enemy's, collect hidden gold, wash, and repeat until bored. The enemy's are the same. Finally got a lava type enemy to deviate away from the orc, hobgoblin thing, and magic witch......\n\nThe game is not bad, and it's definitely brings nothing to the table. Back in the day it may of been a cool hack and slash, but now it offers nothing. Only buy it on sale.","July 31, 2015","true","4.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The story is to the point so you can get on with the action, filled with hords of enemies, different unique playable characters that you can destory them with and amazing enviroments that will take ur breath away. There are aslo secrets in each level as well as a solid amount of content. Its price its great also but when its the holidays and its gets cheeper its well worth, its basically a steal!!!!\n\nI honestly cant praise this game enough, its really that amazing, i was shocked when i bought it and gave it a try.

You have to complete quests and every quest is a complete level. There's no open world, there is only one possible way to go on. In every level you can find hidden gold which you need to buy armor, weapons and healing potions before you start a level/quest and you unlock new characters. And that's it. No level ups, no experience and no inventory. Before a quest starts you just choose a character like a warrior, mage or archer and buy him equippment. There's no a big difference between the weapons and armor, it's just like: pay more gold and it do more damage. Once a quest started you run with your character through a scripted tube-level and kill everything you meet. Sounds like fun, but the fighting-system is bad. I just played as warrior and he could only attack. If you equip a shield you can block, but there aren't special abilities or something similar. The fighting system is comparabel with the fighting system from Oblivion, but without magic. This game will disappoint you if you want a rpg with focus on confrontations, because this game isn't really a rpg and the fighting-system is bad. But if you want to run through scripted levels and kill everthing by useing only two buttons, this game could be entertaining.","March 9, 2014","false","0.9"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","1"

There has barely any loot accept gold and health pots and very rarely a particular level will reward you with an upgraded item for the various characters you'll unlock as you progress. The combat is a mess with button bashing the par for the game, blocking serves limited purpose as you'll be wildly swinging your weapon around hoping for actual contact with enemies, sometimes it doesn't even register.\n\nThe defence Enclave has is its age, its quite old now - but even so, back in 2003 there was RPGS around that did a better job in the third person action rpg genre. Levels are all extremely linear in nature, and some areas are quite confusing and its easy to get lost and frustrated.\n\nGraphics wise, its above par considering its age - this is probably why it got so many positive reviews. But in terms of actual gameplay, its sub-par and the difficulty increases quite rapidly to a point you'll rage over cheap deaths from traps or other stupid game mechanics.","February 14","false","2.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","0"

The "action" portion of this game is a joke, completely mundane and extremely repetitive. If you are a melee character all you do is hold down the mouse to swing your weapon like a mad man (and your attacks will randomly hit or miss), and if you're a ranged character you can shoot enemies from range since the AI is not smart enough to detect you. While attacking you can just keep dancing around your enemies and they have nothing to answer your dance. Furthermore, there is no skill tree or any character customization besides equipping your character with different items at the start of each mission. That's right, there is no continuous character with quests, instead you get a mission selection screen where you can pick a specific character and choose your loadout. You can purchase different items by finding gold, which are all scattered throughout the levels making you run around looking for bags of gold instead of focusing on the action and the combat. Lastly, the story is nothing special and is your generic save our kingdom for the bad guys - easily forgettable. Luckily I was able to get this game for free, and I do not recommend anyone picking this one up when there are much better ARPGs out there!","December 12, 2015","false","2.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #56 - Enclave\n\nI'll start with the good, since it won't take me very long.  The graphics are really nice considering this game came out in 2003.  I also enjoyed the music.  A little less impressive is the level design.  I did like the way the game encourages exploration to find hidden gold.  But the levels are very linear.  There's definitely nothing open world about Enclave.\n\nI didn't play long enough to get a good sense of the story.  But the main character seems to be the "silent protagonist", which personally I am not a fan of, but sometimes it can work.  Other characters do talk however, and I found the voice acting to be somewhat uneven.  Some of it was good, and some of it sounded like they asked someone in QA to fill in for a day.\n\nAlso, you might notice the game is tagged as "RPG", but don't make the mistake of thinking it is one, because it's really not.  It's more of an action adventure game in a fantasy setting.  But it lacks many of the things you'd expect in a typical RPG, like an inventory screen, or character customization, or skills or stats, or a map of some kind.\n\nFor a game that focuses on action, I wished the actual action was a little better.  Combat just seemed to be your basic button mashing.  There is some variety in the sense that you can change weapons and use a ranged weapon instead of a melee weapon, and the weapons can have different speeds.   But that's about it for the variety, and mostly I found myself just mashing the attack button.\n\nSpeaking of the mouse button, I found myself wishing the game supported a controller, but it doesn't.  Another annoyance I found is, even though the game uses keyboard and mouse, from the main menu the mouse doesn't work, so you have to navigate solely with the keyboard, which made the initital setup and configuration annoying.\n\nIt's a shame that the developers didn't put a little more work into the gameplay, instead of just making the game pretty.  Perhaps if I had reviewed this in 2003 I would have been a little kinder.  But even so, there were far better RPGs to play even back then.  What little is good about this game is outweighed by the bland combat and gameplay, and other annoyances like having to skip credits when you quit, which for me it's been the last time.  Don't even need to finish my hour on this one.","April 7","false","0.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Its a third or first person medieval fantasy hack and slash with engaging combat and exceptional environments. For the rogue in all us there is a dark campaign where you play as several evil classes like assassin, berserker, lich and sorceress to name a few. If there are any good hearts out there, you also have the light campaign with their human counterpart classes such as knight, huntress, druid, wizard and half-ling. Each campaign lasted me a fun and joyous seven hours. At the start of each level you select your class and assign their equipment from the money you have. Nothing is permanently bought, so if you want expensive armor and a weak weapon with a few potions, you can do it or if zero potions, expensive weapons and armor is more to your liking go for it. The money is never spent, just assigned. These classes, play styles and different equipment go a long way to making each play through different, even if its your twentieth time on a level.","September 29, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I'm sure you have. This is the case with Enclave for me. After 6 h (around half of the game, I think) I just stop playing it. The game is not bad, but few things I don't like, contribute for my boredom.\n\nFor such an old game it have a lot of video options. Resolution, separated menus for graphics and textures, sliders for sound and music and even syncing with refresh rate. Last but not least, you can rebind keys, use a controller, on and of damage number indicator and so on. But make no mistake, the game is ugly, but not unbearably ugly. Graphics didn't age very well, textures are bad, enemies tends to jump really high, levels don't have enough details, but it's an old game, so it's expected.\n\nThe story is simple – you have to save the world and it is the worst part of the game. There somewhat interesstig backstory, but the developer didn't capitalized the fun premise. In the end, one can say it is absent. Even other reviews pointed this. It is cliché fantasy story, not develop enough.\n\nSo, next is gameplay. It is where I had some fun and there is a lot to talk about. Here you can find some interesting ideas – character classes and fighting system. Let's dive in.\n\nThe game have two campaigns – Light and Dark. As far as my knowledge, first you have to start with the Light and beat it to unlock the Dark. Enclave is hack 'n slash third-person action game with options for first-person, focusing on strategic combat for melee classes. If you enter thinking that this is similar to Devil May Cry or Dynasty Warriors, you will be killed really fast. The combat is slow and methodical. I think the best comparison is Dark Souls, but probably not that hard. Your shield is valuable as much as your weapons. The game is tough, but I can say with some patience every challenge can be overcome. The character you start is a Knight class. He is using melee weapons primarily. When you enter a battle, it's with your shield raised. You have to keep track of enemy hit patterns to find when is the best time to strike. You have to be patience. Interesting thing here is that size matters. What I mean is you may raise your shield, but your feet and head are not protected. You have to consider where to put it. In the beginning you will encounter short imp-like creatures and lowering the shield is crucial and vice versa. If your characters is short, taller enemies are easy. You can even use the terrain at your advantage, if you manage to get the enemy on higher ground. When using a melee weapon you can do a three hit combo and with every hit your damage increase, but it leaves open for attack. So, it's up to you to decide do more damage or hit once and bring up the shield. It's risk-reward situation. Depending on your movement, you make a different swing with the weapon and this add to the strategic gameplay.\n\nThrough the most of my play time, I used the Knight class. At some point I decide to see the other classes. What I found is range classes are boring. The combat with them is like any other third-person shooter and they weren't interesting as melee classes.\n\nEvery character have a melee and range weapon, but depending on the class, they are specialize in certain play style, so don't expect Knight class, for example, to get the best range weapons and vice versa. And speaking of classes, they are total of 12, but you don't get them right away, you will unlock them by playing the game. I don't like that. Why? What is the point of that? Unlock them from the beginning. But there is one interesting thing about that. You don't level up by getting XP. You just have to gatter gold for new gear. And since this is the case, the dev decide after each level, for all unlocked classes, you will get additional money, so you can swap character before entering a level and not playing the whole game again. New gear is unlocked by beating a level. This is all it required. They don't have statistic, so i assume, if it's cost more, it's better. Weapons include swords, crossbows, maces, bows, axes and so on. Some classes have can equip additional stuff like bombs, different types of arrows and so on.\n\nOne of the things I don't like is the AI. I feel enemies can walk only in a straight line and when get the chance I use this the get them to suicide or to stuck in the environment. The other thing is range enemies. Their projectiles can go through solid surfaces and it was annoying. The third things is the level design. Building after building after building. There are some places like vulcano and small harbor town. Although their design is somewhat diverse, in the end I find it boring and not very inspired.\n\nEnemies are not very creative.

Its a third or first person medieval fantasy hack and slash with engaging combat and exceptional environments. For the rogue in all us there is a dark campaign where you play as several evil classes like assassin, berserker, lich and sorceress to name a few. If there are any good hearts out there, you also have the light campaign with their human counterpart classes such as knight, huntress, druid, wizard and half-ling. Each campaign lasted me a fun and joyous seven hours. At the start of each level you select your class and assign their equipment from the money you have. Nothing is permanently bought, so if you want expensive armor and a weak weapon with a few potions, you can do it or if zero potions, expensive weapons and armor is more to your liking go for it. The money is never spent, just assigned. These classes, play styles and different equipment go a long way to making each play through different, even if its your twentieth time on a level.","September 29, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

I'm sure you have. This is the case with Enclave for me. After 6 h (around half of the game, I think) I just stop playing it. The game is not bad, but few things I don't like, contribute for my boredom.\n\nFor such an old game it have a lot of video options. Resolution, separated menus for graphics and textures, sliders for sound and music and even syncing with refresh rate. Last but not least, you can rebind keys, use a controller, on and of damage number indicator and so on. But make no mistake, the game is ugly, but not unbearably ugly. Graphics didn't age very well, textures are bad, enemies tends to jump really high, levels don't have enough details, but it's an old game, so it's expected.\n\nThe story is simple – you have to save the world and it is the worst part of the game. There somewhat interesstig backstory, but the developer didn't capitalized the fun premise. In the end, one can say it is absent. Even other reviews pointed this. It is cliché fantasy story, not develop enough.\n\nSo, next is gameplay. It is where I had some fun and there is a lot to talk about. Here you can find some interesting ideas – character classes and fighting system. Let's dive in.\n\nThe game have two campaigns – Light and Dark. As far as my knowledge, first you have to start with the Light and beat it to unlock the Dark. Enclave is hack 'n slash third-person action game with options for first-person, focusing on strategic combat for melee classes. If you enter thinking that this is similar to Devil May Cry or Dynasty Warriors, you will be killed really fast. The combat is slow and methodical. I think the best comparison is Dark Souls, but probably not that hard. Your shield is valuable as much as your weapons. The game is tough, but I can say with some patience every challenge can be overcome. The character you start is a Knight class. He is using melee weapons primarily.

I was wrong. Actually, i want to finish the game before even reviewing this game, but i can't really stand it anymore.\n\nThis game doesn't have any RPG or adventure feeling at all; you have to beat a stage in order to continue the other stage. Your map is limited to the stage and there is nothing to explore at all (except if looking for coin can be called as exploring).\n\nJust as the other reviews said, melee is really a bad choice in this game. Sometimes the hit isn't registering at all, forcing you to take some damage. The swings have a long animation which could render the shield useless because you hardly can use it (unless if you play it slow).\n\nI want to say that bow is a good choice in this game, but sadly, (again), the animation is very slow, not to mention that there are delays between shots. Your walking speed is slow, which means that you can't really use it for a very long time, which is a bad thing. I doubt that there is a head shot though, but i think there is an area where you can deal more damage on the enemy (maybe the head? who knows.)\n\nWell, despite all that, i must say that the environment and sound really create a good atmosphere to the game. You really can feel the environment to the bone. I can't really deny that i somewhat enjoy it up to some point, although it's crumbled with the very poor battle mechanic.\n\nPros:\n- Two campaigns, lots of stages.\n- You can choose the difficulty level.\n- Multiple characters available.\n- Secondary weapon available.\n- Great atmosphere.\n\nCons:\n- Long and slow attack animation speed.\n- Slow movement speed.\n- Bad graphics.\n- Auto death in some stage (yes, forced restart) if you fall in a pit or such.\n- Camera rotation suck.\n\nI might redo this review when i finished the game. But for the time being, this is how i think about it.\n\nThere are tons of better games out there rather than this game. This game might be good in 2003, but it's not in 2016.","February 20","false","4.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Just leaving it in background for steam cards.\nGuess this is one of those games that only old-gen guys who played it during childhood can enjoy it, in fact i never heard of it.\n\n[ITA] Seriamente, se non era per aver visto la data di pubblicazione del 2003 non avrei avuto nessuna pietà nel scrivere questa recensione, tuttavia sarò obiettivo.\nTrovo il gameplay molto banale e non curato, la grafica tutto sommato (considerando che è del 2003) è ok, ma le ombre sono un qualcosa di veramente fatto male che preferirei godermi il titolo senza esse. L'interfaccia del menu è veramente sgradevole, questo perchè è stato impostato un video scriptato come sfondo, risultando in un'interfaccia esteticamente rozza.\nForse la trama sarà interessante, ma non posso valutarla poichè non avrò intenzione di finire questo gioco.\nForse sono io, ma trovo questo gioco così vuoto, non mi dà proprio nessuna sensazione, nessuna voglia di continuarlo. Lo lascierò in background solo per le carte di Steam...\nImmagino che comunque questo sia uno di quei giochi che solamente i ragazzi della vecchia generazione che magari lo hanno giocato durante l'infanzia possano apprezzarlo.","November 27, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I was wrong. Actually, i want to finish the game before even reviewing this game, but i can't really stand it anymore.\n\nThis game doesn't have any RPG or adventure feeling at all; you have to beat a stage in order to continue the other stage. Your map is limited to the stage and there is nothing to explore at all (except if looking for coin can be called as exploring).\n\nJust as the other reviews said, melee is really a bad choice in this game. Sometimes the hit isn't registering at all, forcing you to take some damage. The swings have a long animation which could render the shield useless because you hardly can use it (unless if you play it slow).\n\nI want to say that bow is a good choice in this game, but sadly, (again), the animation is very slow, not to mention that there are delays between shots. Your walking speed is slow, which means that you can't really use it for a very long time, which is a bad thing. I doubt that there is a head shot though, but i think there is an area where you can deal more damage on the enemy (maybe the head? who knows.)\n\nWell, despite all that, i must say that the environment and sound really create a good atmosphere to the game. You really can feel the environment to the bone. I can't really deny that i somewhat enjoy it up to some point, although it's crumbled with the very poor battle mechanic.\n\nPros:\n- Two campaigns, lots of stages.\n- You can choose the difficulty level.\n- Multiple characters available.\n- Secondary weapon available.\n- Great atmosphere.\n\nCons:\n- Long and slow attack animation speed.\n- Slow movement speed.\n- Bad graphics.\n- Auto death in some stage (yes, forced restart) if you fall in a pit or such.\n- Camera rotation suck.\n\nI might redo this review when i finished the game. But for the time being, this is how i think about it.\n\nThere are tons of better games out there rather than this game. This game might be good in 2003, but it's not in 2016.","February 20","false","4.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That can be either good or bad, if you don't mind a simple history with not much depth in it.\n\nOverall, the game is not bad, and it is cheap, if you want you may buy it for an even cheapier price and prove this somewhat of a 'classic' game. It has some things to do in here, like some exploration, that probably will make you get into it for some time.","January 23","true","3.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But fighting is boring. Like really boring. It just doesnt work at all. And as for h-n-s it is major issue so nothing can save this game.\n\nOn the bright side game has two nice 'twists' that could interest somebody.\n\nFirst is multiple of characters to play as. During missions you can meet some NPCs in trouble and if you manage to save them they will join you and act as playable characters for the rest of the game. On the other hand this undefined main character causes story to be unrelated to characters. So dont expect any story from this game. Just almost random stages, enemies and your character of choice. It could be arena-type game and it wouldnt be any different.\n\nNext 'twist' is that you can outfit your hero before every mission. Equipping your character is based on limited budget mechanic. Every piece of gold you collected adds to the pool of gold which limits gear you can wear. Every piece of equipment substracts from this pool so you have to pick if you prefer balanced setup with average elements or maybe you will sacrifice armor in favor of better weapon. You cant pick your playstyle and enjoy the game your way without being forced to play some fixed archetype.\nMentioned gold you receive for completing every mission and even more you can find during the mission as extra hidden treasures that require from you taking extra risk. And risk here is high - death equals restart of the level. But thats fine, levels are short and fun part is mastering every level.\n\nTo sum it up: game is quite interesting and as such curiosity you could grab it to have a look, but i was unable to finish it - simplistic fighting mechanics are boring and no amount of customisation of character can change that.","April 2","false","6.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For the time it was made the graphics were amazing and still hold their weight  today. Textures are crisp and I can play this game at 1080p with no issue, the only downside is FoV is locked, though at 95 it isn't that bad.\n\nStory progression is ok. Light vs Dark and a rift that divides both. Unfortunately the rift is shrinking and both sides are now butting heads. I only wish the characters you meet in playing through the game had at least some back story or names, rather than just Warrior, Druid, Halfling, etc..\n\nCombat is fine. Melee combat offers 3 weapon classes, Sword, Axe and Hammer.  Melee weapons also have some form of a combo in where if you swing successively 3 times it produces an end effect. Bows offer a wide range of ammunition from sniper bolts which lets you zoom in at far away targets, standard bolts that allow you to stack them up for a burst shot, fire bolts for damage over time, and explosive bolts for aoe damage. Crossbows are your medium ranged weapon and can be used by both ranged and melee classes. Staffs used by your mages offer a standard attack, close ranged aoe attack, and a shield to block melee and ranged hits.\n\nCharacter customization goes as far as how much gold you've collected in your play through. Gold acts a point system and it's scattered throughout the game world, some in pots and others in the form of gems.  The more gold you've collected the better things you can equip. This can range from better armor, weapons, shields, staffs, more ammo for bows, etc... I would say your bow users as well as your engineers/bombardiers are more demanding in gold requirements due to how much stuff they can equip while other classes like warriors don't require much at all. Gold you've collected stays with you for your entire progression. Also collecting it all awards something special in the end.\n\nThe only sad part about this game is there's no multiplayer, which at the time would have been great as it looks like it could have supported at least 4 players (Just judging by the wave levels in the campaign). All in all it's a good game.\n\nI also still hope for an Enclave 2.","October 13, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

As for graphics they aren't bad, sound is ok, but gameplay is horrible. You basically get to gather gold coins while you kill some monsters in the "levels" which allow you to pick weapons and armor for your level playthroughs. Combat is as simple as face the monster and push the mouse button until dead. You have range combat which is ok for sniping at the start of encounters that you can snipe, a early headshot gives you extra damage, plus some foes like archers like to sit out of melee range requiring you to use a ranged weapon often.\n\nNow as to the bad parts, the game really is just "go through the level kill any foes that are there and collect gold coins". Thats it. Its like Mario with sword and crossbow. Your goal is to get all the gold coins in the level and finish it, which will unlock other characters to play, and lets you choose better items during each mission beiefing. The bad part about the game is that there isn't really any save points other than start mission-finish mission. If you die during the mission either 1 of 2 things happen. 1, if you didn't reach a "checkpoint" you have to redo the whole mission from start. If you did reach a checkpoint, you rez at the checkpoint, but lose gold, which means you can't collect all the gold coins in the mission which is why you are doing the mission in the first place, thus, making you restart from the beginning.\n\nThis is especially annoying in missions where the bad jump mechanics make you fall down a hole and die often, or hit a trap badly, or something else making you pull your hair out having to re-do missions over and over from the very beginning. Sadlly this bad game mechanic made me quit the game very early just gritting my teeth over "hey, we are going to make a badly designed jump mechanic in the game, which by the way will get you killed a lot making you restart that annoying mission where you have bad jump mechanics to die, over and over. Have fun.".\n\nSorry, not fun, and I didn't think twice after quitting and deleting the game and moving on to a much better game.","February 14","false","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is really fun to play and for the 2 hours of my own playtime, it doesn't seem to get boring.\nOne could say that it is an old version of Dark Souls, but both games have their pros and cons.\nThe only problem that I have discovered is while you are in the fight. When you are swinging your sword at the enemy it should be a perfect hit but it somehow misses the enemy, although it is not something that makes you wanna quit the game or anything.\nNow about the difficulty. If you are not familiar with those kind of games, go on easy mode and the game will still be fairly challenging. Don't think as a coward of yourself for playing easy mode, believe me :D\n\nFor the playtime of 2h I would give it a 7.5/10 :D","March 14, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game still has that unique feeling back from the glory days, but naturally any old game from today's perspective can't meet the standards of most modern games.\n\nSTORY\nIn a fantasy setting, you can experience both good and evil campaigns of the same story with different outcomes. I found it very exciting, that at some points, the storyline for the unique campaigns collide and you get to kill "your good side character" in the evil campaign plot. Overall the plot is a bit generic, but serves it's function as intended.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nDuring both campaigns, you can choose 1 character to complete missions. You have access to 3 warrior, 1 archer and 2  mage type characters. I really missed some stealth mechanics, because the archer could have been an even better class, it already has a very tactical setup with over 4 or 5 arrow types. The mage is a bit overpowered mid game and the warriors are near invincible at the very end.\n\nThe game features a "collectible - upgrade" system, there are many gems and gold hidden during the levels, which can be used to get better weapons and gear. Getting 100% on each level can be challenging, so you will be revisiting levels quite a lot.\n\nCOMBAT\nEasy to learn, it can be a bit strange the first time, I always thought the whole melee combat was a bit odd. The archer class might have a little learning curve, but the other classes are easy to play. There are little additions in the form of explosives and flame bombs that mix up the warrior classes.\n\nConsidering 10 years have past since it's initial release, I was still able to enjoy playing this game, so I would give it a 8/10, given what you can expect from an old game to deliver.","December 27, 2013","true","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The map design, the models, the graphics, the effects - it all has that 00s charm from games that made the best out of technical limitations.\n\n++PROS++\n\n+The maps are actually pretty small but with every design trick in the book (the one still used for Half-Life maps) you can run around quite long until you've been to every corner. Maps are very diverse from temples, dungeons and caves over castles and even whole villages but due to the small size there are no wilderness areas.\n\n+Combat is rather demanding with melee weapons, bows and spells. Everytime you thought you found a working routine a new kind of enemy or tactical situation makes you throw it over board again.\n\n+There is a lot of action apart from combat, your character can swim, dive, jump ledges, climb ladders, and pull levers. There are several TR-like puzzles and on occassion you can use physics to kill enemies.\n\n+The menu is simple and accessbile and the controls work properly most of the time.\n\n+You get additional characters along the way (who sometimes accompany you in the maps you find them) and you can choose for each new map which cahracter should tackle it\n\n--CONS--\n\n-The game is completely railroaded. Everytime you finish a map,a new one gets available.\n\n- Some of the characters you get to use are pretty useless\n\n- The range of equipment (different for most characters) is very underwhelming and there is actually not much choice how a character is equipped at every stage of the game\n\n- Sound effects are not good, Mostly a torch or waterfall is as loud in the next room as it was standing in front of it only to vanish completely once you're far away enough.\n\n- After a dozen maps or so it gets a little repetetive, I admit I haven't played it to the end.\n\nAll in all I had a lot of fun and I can recommend it as one of the games to can play if you just have an hour or two and want some fast&fun action in between.","December 20, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

As for graphics they aren't bad, sound is ok, but gameplay is horrible. You basically get to gather gold coins while you kill some monsters in the "levels" which allow you to pick weapons and armor for your level playthroughs. Combat is as simple as face the monster and push the mouse button until dead. You have range combat which is ok for sniping at the start of encounters that you can snipe, a early headshot gives you extra damage, plus some foes like archers like to sit out of melee range requiring you to use a ranged weapon often.\n\nNow as to the bad parts, the game really is just "go through the level kill any foes that are there and collect gold coins". Thats it. Its like Mario with sword and crossbow. Your goal is to get all the gold coins in the level and finish it, which will unlock other characters to play, and lets you choose better items during each mission beiefing. The bad part about the game is that there isn't really any save points other than start mission-finish mission. If you die during the mission either 1 of 2 things happen. 1, if you didn't reach a "checkpoint" you have to redo the whole mission from start. If you did reach a checkpoint, you rez at the checkpoint, but lose gold, which means you can't collect all the gold coins in the mission which is why you are doing the mission in the first place, thus, making you restart from the beginning.\n\nThis is especially annoying in missions where the bad jump mechanics make you fall down a hole and die often, or hit a trap badly, or something else making you pull your hair out having to re-do missions over and over from the very beginning. Sadlly this bad game mechanic made me quit the game very early just gritting my teeth over "hey, we are going to make a badly designed jump mechanic in the game, which by the way will get you killed a lot making you restart that annoying mission where you have bad jump mechanics to die, over and over. Have fun.".\n\nSorry, not fun, and I didn't think twice after quitting and deleting the game and moving on to a much better game.","February 14","false","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For the time it was made the graphics were amazing and still hold their weight  today. Textures are crisp and I can play this game at 1080p with no issue, the only downside is FoV is locked, though at 95 it isn't that bad.\n\nStory progression is ok. Light vs Dark and a rift that divides both. Unfortunately the rift is shrinking and both sides are now butting heads. I only wish the characters you meet in playing through the game had at least some back story or names, rather than just Warrior, Druid, Halfling, etc..\n\nCombat is fine. Melee combat offers 3 weapon classes, Sword, Axe and Hammer.  Melee weapons also have some form of a combo in where if you swing successively 3 times it produces an end effect. Bows offer a wide range of ammunition from sniper bolts which lets you zoom in at far away targets, standard bolts that allow you to stack them up for a burst shot, fire bolts for damage over time, and explosive bolts for aoe damage. Crossbows are your medium ranged weapon and can be used by both ranged and melee classes. Staffs used by your mages offer a standard attack, close ranged aoe attack, and a shield to block melee and ranged hits.\n\nCharacter customization goes as far as how much gold you've collected in your play through. Gold acts a point system and it's scattered throughout the game world, some in pots and others in the form of gems.  The more gold you've collected the better things you can equip. This can range from better armor, weapons, shields, staffs, more ammo for bows, etc... I would say your bow users as well as your engineers/bombardiers are more demanding in gold requirements due to how much stuff they can equip while other classes like warriors don't require much at all. Gold you've collected stays with you for your entire progression. Also collecting it all awards something special in the end.\n\nThe only sad part about this game is there's no multiplayer, which at the time would have been great as it looks like it could have supported at least 4 players (Just judging by the wave levels in the campaign). All in all it's a good game.\n\nI also still hope for an Enclave 2.","October 13, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

(or vice versa if you play with the evil side)\n\nGameplay\nThe cool thing is that you can choose between good and evil.\nThe good guys are not very balanced, you will end up playing the Paladin only since he is the strongest one of them ( Also the defeault character)\n\nThe evil guys on the other hand are more balanced and you have a reason choosing one over the other. ( They are also more interesting to play as, Assasin, Orc, Goblin, Berserker and a Sorceress. ( I probably missed a guy or two).\n\nNow the actual gameplay, not things that affect it.\n- It gets pretty repetitive, you mash the left mouse button to attack and the right one to defend.\nYou can switch between a shooting weapon and a melee weapon and upgrade them with gold after each stage.\n\nYou can buy arrows from the shop and health potions if you need them.\n\nPresentation\n- The presentation is good, the way the menu transitions in to the stage select is pretty well done for it's time. Altough the menu has a pretty bad quality since after you choose something the animation is CGI and it's old 2003 CGI.\nAltough this game brings nothing new to the table.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack isn't bad and it's kinda memorable ( Atleast I remember it since I was a kid, I thought it was scary and\nstuff).\n\n\nOverall Score               7,5 / 10","May 23","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's no character development but you find money on levels which you can buy better gear with. This creates a cool puzzle/platform element as it's no easy task to find it all as there are some very interesting places the money is stored.\n\nI played this a lot years ago and on the hardest difficulty it will give you a run for your money. It's of an older vein of games that will be frustrating at first as you need to place arrows carefully and time your swings exactly or you'll be flailing around hitting nothing.\n\n2 Campaigns with plenty of replayability due to around 6 different characters for both the light and dark faction. They basically mirror each other - so there's a warrior/archer/wizard/engineer/etc for both factions. Each character requires a different play style as you can imagine and get some unique equipment that you can buy.\n\nI was pretty excited that this was on discount on steam - 47p or thereabouts. However I've only been playing about 30 mins and the game crashed on the second level. Tried again and crashed right at the end again. Very frustrating -- and I imagine all support for the game will be gone now so no hope of a fix. The error message only flashed up for a brief second so apologise for not giving the exact error. Hopefully it's just me but worth bearing in mind if you're paying full price.\n\nFor what is a game you'll easily get 40 hours playtime out of, it's a shame that the steam version seems a little unstable.\n\nThe game itself is a solid 7/10","April 9","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is little depth to this game so only buy it if you looking for a simple button musher .Gameplay may seem shallow or even boring at first however once you get into managing different gear and characters it will be more fun .\n\nEach stage has a specific ammount of gold which is used to increase maximum number of items you can bring rather than currency . There is no casual inventory or loot drop . You have to preselect equipment before entering a stage and you can unlock new weapons through progression .\n\nThere are some interesting enviroment interactions and events that may change the pace like turning into giant demon and fighting another one . Stage design for the most part was good but toward the second half of the game .\n\nScore: 7/10 . It may seem like a crapy game at first because combat is extremely basic but it gets better once you unlock more characters and equipment.

The two years are distuinguished hugely. But like i said for it's time it's a really good game. It's... I'd like to say a learning curve because though it's a old game most of the people who play games nowadays don't realize how much more dependant as a player you need to be to finish a game. Games really really easy. But loses interest when the first bug hits you, which is pretty much the first "quest" or "Tutorial" seeming where it starts it ends up glitching. The scenario is great though. In the end overall i'd recommend buying it.\n\nI bought this game because it was cheap at the time, An the results of buying it is what i expected from a older game. I didn't feel any nostalgia from it. But the art is pretty good for when it was made as i said. An overall it's a good game. I'll update this review if i ever decide to re-play the game, an have a less hypacritical oppinion.

To be honest, this pc version has way better optimized graphics and controls than this last one. Kinda précious thing i could estimate while todays developers are not getting confortable with pc for mercantile and pessimistic reasons.\n\n\nGraphics are clearly outdated from nowadays, lots of clipping, little bit tearing when speeding up camera movement, global cubic rendering but it also works like a charm. Textures are clean even if obsolete and non-HD designed. The game offers quite a few graphical settings very pleasant for a console port.\nGenerally, the good quality  level design and architecture serves the medieval fantastic ambiance, environments are inspired and never get redundant. Levels stay linear but some of them are very wide-open ans submited to a labyrinthine path, so it's easy to walk round while you are looking tirelessly for a wood key that will bring you to the next room.\n\nGameplay is very interesting and fun. As you complete levels , the game gives ability to unlock and play characters with its own skills, and retribute you with coins you gather during the mission. Indeed, before each mission, a menu lets users spend budget in new weapons such as enchanted crossbows, tremendous magical swords, big boom bombs, powerful magical sticks, warrior armors,... Each of these new supplies has a certain cost and doing the cupid globetrotter roaming through the entire level will make you quickly one of the best bashing champions all over the enclave.\nIn game, controls are very reactive but aiming is a little bit buggy ; the shots given by your character don't reach ennemy each time you wanna touch its, in fact lots of shots with no damage are expected.The game has a very hard feeling mostly because of this part of the gameplay. It remains thought fairy difficult and at any moment, it become nonsense of frustration as demon's souls can be often.\n\nSoundtrack is a classical variety of dark medieval themes and participates in making the ambiance immersive. However, it is repetitive to hear all the same themes for differents levels so It doesn't offer necessarily an audio consistency to each level that make this boring and annoying after hours. Vocal dubbing is correct, voices actors are convinient despite conviction missing for some of them.\n\nTwo campaigns : light and darkness... Very cute and original. Player start first with the light campaign which has a storyline better exploited, longer and devoided with narrative ellipses instead of dark campaign less rich lingering on crucial moments that can be rapidly sent over.\n\nNow it's your turn to save people of the light and/or darkness... And kill them above all, that's the real purpose and leitmotiv of this outlet epic game !\n\n","November 30, 2014","true","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The two years are distuinguished hugely. But like i said for it's time it's a really good game. It's... I'd like to say a learning curve because though it's a old game most of the people who play games nowadays don't realize how much more dependant as a player you need to be to finish a game. Games really really easy. But loses interest when the first bug hits you, which is pretty much the first "quest" or "Tutorial" seeming where it starts it ends up glitching. The scenario is great though. In the end overall i'd recommend buying it.\n\nI bought this game because it was cheap at the time, An the results of buying it is what i expected from a older game. I didn't feel any nostalgia from it. But the art is pretty good for when it was made as i said. An overall it's a good game. I'll update this review if i ever decide to re-play the game, an have a less hypacritical oppinion. (Only played less then an hour an you get stuck due to a glitch on the first area not enough "help" or information on playing the game)","January 29, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To be honest, this pc version has way better optimized graphics and controls than this last one. Kinda précious thing i could estimate while todays developers are not getting confortable with pc for mercantile and pessimistic reasons.\n\n\nGraphics are clearly outdated from nowadays, lots of clipping, little bit tearing when speeding up camera movement, global cubic rendering but it also works like a charm. Textures are clean even if obsolete and non-HD designed. The game offers quite a few graphical settings very pleasant for a console port.\nGenerally, the good quality  level design and architecture serves the medieval fantastic ambiance, environments are inspired and never get redundant. Levels stay linear but some of them are very wide-open ans submited to a labyrinthine path, so it's easy to walk round while you are looking tirelessly for a wood key that will bring you to the next room.\n\nGameplay is very interesting and fun. As you complete levels , the game gives ability to unlock and play characters with its own skills, and retribute you with coins you gather during the mission. Indeed, before each mission, a menu lets users spend budget in new weapons such as enchanted crossbows, tremendous magical swords, big boom bombs, powerful magical sticks, warrior armors,... Each of these new supplies has a certain cost and doing the cupid globetrotter roaming through the entire level will make you quickly one of the best bashing champions all over the enclave.\nIn game, controls are very reactive but aiming is a little bit buggy ; the shots given by your character don't reach ennemy each time you wanna touch its, in fact lots of shots with no damage are expected.The game has a very hard feeling mostly because of this part of the gameplay. It remains thought fairy difficult and at any moment, it become nonsense of frustration as demon's souls can be often.\n\nSoundtrack is a classical variety of dark medieval themes and participates in making the ambiance immersive. However, it is repetitive to hear all the same themes for differents levels so It doesn't offer necessarily an audio consistency to each level that make this boring and annoying after hours. Vocal dubbing is correct, voices actors are convinient despite conviction missing for some of them.\n\nTwo campaigns : light and darkness... Very cute and original. Player start first with the light campaign which has a storyline better exploited, longer and devoided with narrative ellipses instead of dark campaign less rich lingering on crucial moments that can be rapidly sent over.\n\nNow it's your turn to save people of the light and/or darkness... And kill them above all, that's the real purpose and leitmotiv of this outlet epic game !\n\n","November 30, 2014","true","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, if you're looking for something to kill time...or looking for a game with a very loose story but mostly serves as an excuse to grind through kills...then go ahead and buy this game. I admit, I haven't played this game for long, so I could very well be proven wrong, but it's maybe worth about the $5 I paid for it. I can't say I love it, and I can't say I hate it. All I can say is...meh. It's OK. The good is the graphics are good for the age of the game and you can (once you have ground your way through campaigns to collect all the characters), play a character to fit your play style. The combat mechanics are simple, but solid. The bad news is it is a bit samey-same and it is, so far a bit of a grind. I can only hope it gets better...at which point I will happily admit I'm wrong, but at first blush it really isn't much to sing about.\n\nPIty I can only choose between two options here...thumbs up or thumbs down. We really do need a so-so option. I'll go ahead and give this a thumbs up, but with one caveat...if it's more than a few bucks you may be over spending. But if this is your thing, then go for it.

Simple enough to jump into and play, complex enough to keep things interesting throughout.  This game was originally designed to be a PVP game, however it was developed into a strictly PVE game.  But, you can still see remnants of it's PVP origins.  Enemies can do anything you can do, the engine feels very quake-like and old school.  In this sense, it's completely balanced, aside from the fact that the bad guys outnumber you and can have stronger gear.  You acquire new gear throughout the game by collecting a set amount of gold from each mission (which are replayable, in case you missed any of the set amount.  Ex: 290/300).  Most of the gold is found via secrets, which I find quite enjoyable.  Some of them are quite clever, too.  It's definitely old school, bringing back memories of Duke and Doom secrets.  Mappers have even left their mark on the maps, if you are clever enough to find them.\n\nNow let's talk about the bad.  This game has aged, really poorly.  I played this game back in the early 2000's, back when everything worked.  Some serious tuneups have to be done with the engine or something.  Perhaps the community can find some workarounds for a lot of these things.  Sometimes the game runs at hyper speed; the hitboxes are all wacked, meaning I will miss half the time for some odd reason, and I have to be very particular about which attack I use and when to time it, because most other attacks don't land; moving my mouse makes me move super fast, but none of the game speeds up with it; and there are just general crashes.\n\nThe game is still playable, but it does become really hard to enjoy what was once a pretty solid and good game, due to it no longer working on modern machines.  If some work was done with the game, it would be great.  I'll still recommend it, because of what it was, and what it could be, given some patches and fixes.  We'll see what happens in the future.","May 13","true","24.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

( They are also more interesting to play as, Assasin, Orc, Goblin, Berserker and a Sorceress. ( I probably missed a guy or two).\n\nNow the actual gameplay, not things that affect it.\n- It gets pretty repetitive, you mash the left mouse button to attack and the right one to defend.\nYou can switch between a shooting weapon and a melee weapon and upgrade them with gold after each stage.\n\nYou can buy arrows from the shop and health potions if you need them.\n\nPresentation\n- The presentation is good, the way the menu transitions in to the stage select is pretty well done for it's time. Altough the menu has a pretty bad quality since after you choose something the animation is CGI and it's old 2003 CGI.\nAltough this game brings nothing new to the table.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack isn't bad and it's kinda memorable ( Atleast I remember it since I was a kid, I thought it was scary and\nstuff).\n\n\nOverall Score               7,5 / 10","May 23","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It won't come up as a surprise for you, that this title has no DLC microtransactions or an insane amount of senseless grinding, instead being a true type of an adventure RPG with solid, fun gameplay. In the most accurate sense, Enclave is more of a hack-and-slash action rather than a RPG, although roleplaying elements are definetely present in this game. Despite being released way back in 2002, Enclave still manages to thrill and entertain even today, in large part thanks to its graphical quality and a relatively well created atmosphere.\n\nIn terms of the plotline, Enclave is your typical dark fantasy, where the ever encroaching darkness is about to swarm the last remains of hope... literally. Long ago, a great demon waged war against all that is good in order to destroy it, but in the process of doing so, he got slain. This event shattered the face of the planet, and the last hope of victorious men is now but a single stranded kingdom, known as the Enclave. After many years, those who were once loyal to the demon yet again are now ready to kill and destroy, and it seems that the demon himself is about to reincarnate back into the grim of world of Enclave. Without going too far into the details of the story, it can be noted, that even though the storyline  is kind of average, it still gets the job done and keeps the player hooked. Every single mission in the game has a very unique environment, ranging from trap filled tombs and lava sizzling valleys to strange places of mystical power. There are two campaings in Enclave, allowing you to try yourself out in both the roles of a hero in a not so shining armor, or an ugly looking baddie with an amusing, albeit not a quite threatening appearance. Old timers that played such games as Heretic II or Arx Fatalis will love Enclave, although the two mentioned titles are still ofcourse different in many ways.\n\nThroughout the game, your arsenal will include alot of melee and ranged weapons. Melee arms consist of various swords, clubs and axes, ranged weaponry consists of bows and magical staves. In terms of protection, your heroes will have three types of armor and alot of shields. Usually, as one would guess, the most expensive type of protection and weaponry is the most effective one, and as the game progressesess, you will be able to equip your heroes with the best type of gear, if ofcourse you collect gold and valuable gems that are scattered throughtout missions. Otherwise, you will have to play as a raggedy orc or a cloth-clad gnome. Battles are usually straightforward, especially when it comes to melee. Most of the time, you will try to deal a blow to the enemy while protecting yourself with a shield. Ranged duels with bows are more thrilling, and so are the fights between mages. In terms of combat and gameplay in general, Enclave is an entertaining game, just the kind of a game to relax with after work or study. The missions are challening, but at the same time are not annoying. From time to time, cinematics with explanation to the background lore will keep the players entertained and focused, and the music that is present in the game is pretty good and atmospheric.\n\nIn a summary, it can be written, that Enclave is a game worth to be recommended. Without a doubt, time has taken its toll on the game, and some younger, more demanding players might not like it, but if you are not too critical when it comes to older titles, and if you enjoy a good action game, Enclave is for you.\n\nP.S: Very often Enclave gets sold on Steam for a discount at a price of approximately 80 cents. If you have the patience and if you are really strapped for cash but nonetheless want to play this game, just wait for a discount, and you can purchase it for almost nothing :D","May 30","true","20.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not that they are bad or are comparable to a game like Nidhogg, however you are able to see it's age by all of the flat and repeating textures, lack of any anti alising and even a few very pixely items.\n\nIt also has to be mentioned that the menus do not have mouse support, meaning you have to use the arrow keys, Enter and Esc to navigate the menus.\n\nThat being said Enclave can be a fairly fun experience if you enjoy it's combat and exploration, the only problem being that the combat is very simple, somewhat cluncky and even unreliable as far as the hitboxes go when it comes to using ranged weapons close up to enemies. No matter who you choose to play as (will be explained upon better later in the review) it feels like an M1 spam fest as that is your only way of attacking with your sword/axe/hammer/dagger. Your other other ways of doing damage is (depending on the character) by pulling out your crossbow/bow/staff, and pressing M1. For it's time it was OK however in a day and age where we have a long list of games with numerous abilities and ways of doing damage, Enclave begins to show it's age. Though it has to be said that the combat is fairly satisfying. When you pull off a combo (depending on the weapon, M1 x Type Of Melee Weapon) the last hit will do double damage, and even give the attack splash damage so any nearby enemy will also take damage. This alone isn't much, but paired with a nice 'smashing' sound and a little bit of screen shake, it truely does feel good when you finish off multiple enemies with your final swing.\n\nExploration is a different story, whereas the age of Enclave has been hurting it, Enclave shows how older games did their exploration and it made you want to explore the land you were put in. When you start a mission you are put inside a medium/large sized area where there are a number of pickups that will become extremely important in your journey through each level, and ultimately the game itself. You will come across ammo pick ups for your crossbow/bow (may you have one on you or not), health potions, checkpoints and even gold. The health potions and ammo are given and taken away on a mission by mission basis, where you can find 3 potions in a mission, however they will be taken away after the mission is over.\n\nThe gold on the other hand is collected and kept for a equipment screen you will use before each mission. When you select your mission, you will be given the option of who you want to use for that mission. Each character has their own loadout (the Druid is the only one who can use staffs, etc.) that you can fill up, which is where the gold comes into play. You use the gold as more of a borrowing system then a buying system seeing as you choose your items from the equipment screen by just swapping through them, taking or returning gold depending on the quaility/quantity of the item. An easier way of thinking of it is by switching out gold with a weight system. Instead of gaining +5 gold, you picked up +5 max weight, allowing you to use better/more weapons/armour/ammo/health potions. The better equipment comes back to help you complete more difficult missions and get more gold.\n\nIf you enjoyed playing through the game once then you will be very happy to know that there are actually TWO campaigns to Enclave, the Light side where you face the forces of evil, and a more difficult Dark campaign where you face the forces of good. Besides that there are hoard mode missions on both sides of of the game where you face increasingly difficult groups of enemies to gain gold for the main missions and other hoard missions. These missions can be found by finding maps in the main missions which will open up a new spot on the mission select screen.\n\nAll in all, Enclave can be a fun game if you can get past the fact that it's over 10 years old and has nearly everything that comes with it being old. Personally I wouldn't buy it for $5.00 US dollars, but if you can get it while it's on sale (75%+), then I would recommend giving it at least an hour of your time just so you can at least experience what Enclave has to offer. It's not a bad game, it's just dated.","September 5, 2014","false","6.1"," 27 of 56 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","27","56","0","4"

Aiming is awful, and even if your reticle "guarantees" a hit by turning red, you may still miss.  There are some suddenly falling floors or traps in the game that lead to instant death, which is fairly sinful in a game that requires you start the entire stage over upon character death.  Melee attacking has its own problems too, in that every encounter is basically a slap fight with weapons.  Hit detection is iffy and any nuance like spacing or positioning is out the window.  Click, click, click.  Beyond that, the game is still fun and looks ok, player models aside.\n\nI can't recommend this to anyone but the morbidly interested.   It's not all bad, but it would have been a 6/10 in 2002.  If you just need something to play, then maybe go for it?

That's not true at all.\n\nIn fact, the graphics are really, really outdated.\n\nI could live with that, but unfortunately this game has a number of serious and infuriating issues.\n\nFirst, they use a script to shove ADs down your throat. EVERY TIME you click the "Play" button, it will open a browser tab and show the steam page for a different game from the same company.\n\nThat could create a stupid situation in which you have the game loading in the foreground and a video loading in the background at the same time - IF I could get the game to load right from start.\n\nFor some reason, though, I have to kill the game process and start it again, otherwise the game simply won't open. As a result, it will load the same steam page TWICE.\n\nCan we have a round of applause for that awful business decision? They managed to make me hate their company even before I could load up the game for the first time, and that is something not even Electronic Arts had done before. Impressive.\n\nWell, after actually loading the game, I found out it's quite generic and unimaginative. There's some loooong narration to set the scenario but it's not particularlly interesting or engaging.\n\nThe battles are boring and repetitive. Run up to an enemy, hit him, step back. Rinse, repeat. And you'll have to repeat that a lot, because the hit boxes are very small and it's very common to miss swings that should have connected.\n\nI couldn't feel a real sense of progression. There are no shopkeepers, but you can buy your equipment from a virtual shop before starting a mission. Didn't find any loot besides coin, potion and the starting sword/shield. There's a limited amount of money you can find in each level too.\n\nSo far the game looks ugly and boring, but those are subjective aspects and they might not prevent you from actually enjoying Enclave.\n\nHowever, there is a very objective issue that can and most likely will ruin your day.\n\nEnclave has a tendency to crash with a message that says "UNRECOVERABLE ERROR FOUND, press any key to close". It can happen anywhere, any time, for any reason or for no reason at all.\n\nWell, if you're thinking "I could live with the occasional crash", think again, because you cannot save the game. There are a few checkpoints scattered around the maps and you will respawn in one of them if you die, but if the game crashes, all your progress is lost - you will have to restart the mission from the beginning. All the puzzles, all the enemies, all the traps and doors - you will have to do everything again.\n\nUnfortunately, the game crashes frequently. It happened six times in the two hours I tried to play. I wanted to keep going but it felt like a chore and I wasn't having fun anymore.\n\nI didn't have great expectations (it was only a dollar after all), but  Enclave still managed to let me down.\n\nI can't in good faith recommend this game.","November 2, 2014","false","2.5"," 32 of 67 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","32","67","0","0"

What make matters worse - game doesn't react to keyboard keys bound to gamepad buttons, so I had to stick with mouse + KB. And yes, you cannot use mouse in main menu (makes sense since it's a console game in first place).\n2) The gameplay itself constantly suffers from random camera spins, random teleportation of your character and sometimes illogical reaction to commands - it can react slowly to button presses, it can execute your attacks way faster than usual. Hitboxes are quite off as well, in fact they are so off from visuals that it's obvious just a few minutes into the game.\n\nI see no point in describing the gameplay itself since I didn't see much, the only thing I can point out is that the combat is really too simple and narrows down to some kind of hit-n-run M1 spam, ranged weapons are almost unusable due to technical issues described earlier. Character development is also pretty much non-existent.

I absolutely don't mind older games, and still play games from several generations ago and still enjoy them, but this is beyond janky. The controls are atrocious, even for the time. Older games like Soul Reaver and Ocarina of Time still manage to have fluid and serviceable melee combat and character movement and they aren't even necessarily purely combat-driven; this  is a hack-and-slash with little else than combat, yet it moves horribly stiffly, the hack and slash combat is repetitive and boring, and the hitboxes are a total joke. Ranged combat is even worse, aiming is clunky and painful. I didn't even get far enough to try any kind of magic, though I unlocked a druidess (who honestly looked more like a stripper than any kind of priestess or adventurer) but I was too bored to bother continuing.\n\nI don't know why this is tagged as an RPG, this is a hack-and-slash action/adventure game (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I love those too, but don't go in expecting an RPG); there are no RPG elements such as stats, character progression, looting, story choices, etc. Missions are linear; you buy the best loadout you can afford, and go in (again I don't have a problem with that kind of structure, but don't expect tons of exploration or non-linear progression or anything like that), and levels are short, with okay level design I guess. The only gameplay element are killing boring monsters, sometimes jumping, and picking up gold and keys or flipping switches. Oh yeah, the second mission is an escort mission, and gods help you if the NPC AI decides to walk in straight into the monsters and get himself killed. Because yep, that can happen. Oh, you activated a checkpoint, and died? Cool, you lose a bit of gold, but respawn with everything else exactly as is, which in theory would be fine except... meanwhile monsters are attacking your NPC escort and you've failed the mission before getting back to where you were.  Oops?\n\nDon't waste your time on this mediocrity. Even if you're really really starving for an old-school hack-and-slash game, there are tons of better options out there. Like, say, any of the Ys games, or Dark Souls, hell even Bound By Flame is much better than this.","November 9, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Also thought it was a glitch so i restarted it many times aswell.\nPS- I finally found that there was a lever that was at the first room with out any hint that it was there, besides from spamming MC2 (the use button in this game)\nOn the second level, the main idea from the "compainion" was that you needed to defeat a few, easy monsters, simple right? Well yeah they were easy, but after you defeated them i could not go anyware, only advice from the so called "compainion" was "We need to protect the Outpost!" Well, ok, lets go! But there was nothing there, not even a letter or another monster to lead way, NOTHING! You could not go back where you came from or open or destroy any doors, so what then? Well i wasted another, rough 30 min (In my opinion) looking for something, and because i am pretty tolerant towards games i, restarted it many times to see if it was a glitch. NOPE . . .\nDisappointed in this game, had hopes for it.\nAlthough there are Pro's and Con's with every game here are a few i can say\n\nPro's\nConstant 60fps\nNote bad graphics for 2003\nUnique game style (names areas and ect.)\nFast load time\n*For you to decide*\n\nCon's\nNo help (beside from "what buttons do what")\nShort areas\nBad voice actors (sounds dull and not into the game style)\nEither buggy or hard (could just be me)\n*For you to decide*\n\nPS- These are just my opinions so do not take offence to this if you enjoy this game!","April 7, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You unlock new characters with different weapons and abilities as you play and depending on your saved budget and unlocked items, you can equip your selected character with a choice of weps, armor and potions, and thats pretty much all the "rpg" aspect.\nThe game has a story which is not bad but pretty basic and you can play it from the perspective of two opposing factions, you can chose the "light" or dark" campaign at the begining of the game and you will get to play different characters with different stories.\n\nThe game stands out by its very well made fantasy setting and an excellent soundtrack. Personally i found the graphics and the music to be outstanding back in the day.\nThe graphics aged of course but they aged quite well, for the most part they look good even by today standards. They might be technically dated but artistically they are still great.\n\nThe combat is solid and quite varied for a hack and slash game. The choice of character is vital because the game is pretty difficult and some characters will do a lot better than others in certain levels. Every level can be completed with any character but the difference in difficulty can be unforgiving.\nThe levels are not very big but most of them are intricated enough to allow some exploration in search for hidden stuff.\n\nIt was one of my fave PC action games back in 2003 but i still enjoy playing it today.","November 30, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

It's a very old game (2002), and I'm mindful of that. It doesn't even seem to register that my mouse is there. My mouse is a Logitech (#1 brand, mind you) track ball. I'm fairly sure I bought it circa 2004. I've heard about the game having issues with newer laser mice, but with an eleven-year-old (optical) trackball? This thing works fine with DOS games, Win16 games, DirectX, Flash games, you name it. If a game can't deal with my aging USB mouse, there's probably something fairly wrong with said game.\n\n* My trackball IS attached to my keyboard's inbuilt USB hub, that's the only rationale I can imagine. Thing is, with the game being published in 2002, it HAS TO be a Windows app and not the last of the DOS games, right? Anyways, I'm uninstalling and giving it a thumbs down.","July 28, 2015","false","13.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GRRRR/recommended/253980/","GRRRR","GRRRR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GRRRR/","255 products in account","Fun Hack and Slash action adventure with that certain Conan the Barbarian fantasy pulp feel.\n\nEvil is afoot or whatever so you kill stuff. Theres no leveling, you pick up gold in the levels which after completion gets added to a total you use to not really but kinda buy and sell - its more of a point limit you get to spend on equipment. For example with 100 gold you could equip a sword and armor for both 50 or a bow for 100. Theres usually one checkpoint each level (no quicksaves) and dieing means losing 10 gold - if you manage to find the checkpoint, else game over.\n\nTheres multiple character types to unlock altho some are just straight upgrades (in one case not strangely).\n\nLevels are well designed and varied, for such an old game it really looks amazing if you put all the sliders to the right. Gameplaywise it starts out abit slow but picks up pace along with higher difficulty.\n\nMelee fighting is rather simplistic tho, you can block and do a 3 strike combo. Something seems off with hitboxes, i had attacks whiff which really should have connected, this is especially noticeable using bows and such in very close range, shots pass right thru enemies if you dont aim at their feet or in first person. Annyoing but workable.\n\nOther minor cons:\n- very crashy if not in XP compatibility mode which breaks the steam overlay\n- rename or delete install.vdf in the reg folder in the games folder or have a steam store page for some ♥♥♥♥ open each time you start this\n\nIf you remember Severance: Blade of Darkness - this is kinda a lite version.

Well it feels that way, You do get used to it super fast and it's easy to look past.\nThe movement/Mouse movement is actually really decent and better than I expected.\n\nGraphics & Sounds\nThe graphics are amazing for a game port that's over 10 years old! I personally adore the art/graphic styles.\nThe shading is nice, the blood, and the enemies look nice as well! I'm actually very pleased with the "new" feel to it.\nThe only issue with the graphics I have is they seem to degrade during cutscenes.\nI also dislike how the main menu screen is in a 4:3 ratio though if you have a 1080p res.\nThe sounds are perfectly okay in my book for the type of game/way it was put together.\n\nGameplay\nThe story so far is nice and enjoyable, however it is very easy to get lost and no real indication that certain environment elements can harm you. (Which I love that, but I'd like a tiny heads up.)\nI spent my time feeling like I was playing a maze game running around trying to find the next area to enter. (I could just be blind.)\nI also find it funny that the goblins speak Swedish.\n\nOverall\nFor 5$ it's worth it, I'm enjoying it and I'll be returning to playing it shortly for the story.","June 15, 2015","true","1.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I never completed it on the Xbox but its looking hopeful for me now on the computer. I never particularly liked the melee characters because the melee fighting system is a bit flaily and wavy (for lack of better words), you will understand what I mean if you decide to play it. Now ranged is where it is at: it is rather satisfying pinging an enemy from a while back and scoring crit damage on them in the game as there is no auto aim function to speak of (apart from some of the staffs the wizards/druids/lichs wield). Due to the nature of an analogue stick, this is rather difficult but using a PC and mouse makes it actually really fun.\nOther stuff: storyline isnt engaging so don't buy it for that; graphics are good for their time but nothing amazing although they do offer a nice visual diversitah; music is great but I swear there is like 4 soundtracks (eg. wandering around music, cinematic music, battle music, and menu music); replayability is evident because of gold hunting/exploring or just thrashing a level with characters with bossing equipment (which is always fun); the game is actually challenging rather than just a case of grinding (which is the case with alot of games nowadays); the game's size is applaudible for how easy it is to run on modern computers.\nIn addition: its £4! Bargain for a game to pass the time when your internet is down; surprisingly addictive; great when your baked and when COD or DOTA is too much for you at that time.\nHighly recommend. Even if you dont trust this review, its four pounds. Whats to lose?","October 14, 2014","true","14.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I saw the graphics, and said "Wow, this looks really good for 2003!" Well, looks and plays are two different things, my friend.\n\nTo compliment this game, yes, it actually has very nice visuals. Nothing groundbreaking by todays standards, but for its time, they were pretty good. Aside from that? This is kinda terrible. But! it does fall under "So bad, it's good". The combat is just an M1 fest, with absolutely no strategy. Simplicity is one thing, but this is pretty braindead. Enemies either just stand there and take it or run. Actually, I gotta say, the combat reminds me of Kings Field on ps1...all the bad aspects of it. Run forward, slash once or twice, step backward, repeat. It's incredibily dull, to say the least. Oh, and hit collision is choppy.\n\nNot much to say about music or voice acting, nothing stood out. Nothing good, nothing horrible, it's all just kind of...there. The game is very linear. Now, I actually don't have a problem with a game being linear. However, this game is insultingly linear. Not Hallway Simulator 13 linear, mind you, but pretty damn close.\n\nOverall, Enclave feels kinda like the testing stages for a game. Like, they just finished the engine, impleminted the basic features, but shipped it out before it could be polished up. I guess I could compare it to a beat-em up, but without the satisfaction from said beating up. Can't say I recommened, Enclave, unless you feel like burning a dollar while it's on sale.","September 2, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Feel bad for getting it for 90% off. Wish I played this back in 2003.\n\nGame unexpectedly crashes uncommonly, possibly excessive input or graphic settings. It's to be expected I suppose in this day and age. Gotta be patient with it.\n\nUpdate Feb 20, 2015: Seems for whatever reason, upon starting the game your default browser (despite it said Windows Explorer for some reason) links to a steam page of Raven's Cry.\n\nHowever to prevent this, I get prompt by windows to let steam do sort of action, similiar to a "first-time play installation" you get with majority of games after purchase, which I get constantly for another steam game but for a different action. If I click on no, the game runs and my browser doesn't open... I'm unsure as to why this happens.\n\nHowever, since I get a prompt after launching the game for this action, I cannot classify this as adware per se. An annoyance sure, but nothing lethal or CPU draining than other adware I've had before.\n\nI found this out shortly after I noticed Enclave has steam cards, reinstalled, and started the game (along with a few negative reviews about this "adware" problem). Not a good marketing approach to be sure...\n\nHowever, with all this adware aside, it's still a good game to get and play. Depends whether or not you can deal with your default browser opening and going instantly to Raven's Cry is on you.\nUpdate Feb 24, 2015: "Adware" issue removed.","March 7, 2014","true","32.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/britannicus/recommended/253980/","britannicus","Britannicus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/britannicus/","1408 products in account","Enclave is clearly a ported console game from a different generation.  While it permits key mapping, it fails to allow the player to save where they want; instead, it comes in episodes that must be finished before one's place is saved.\n\nThe game fails to make much use of the mouse, relying largely on the mouse buttons to hit stuff and do things, while movement is keyboard based.  The game has "gold" scattered around each section, and keeps track of how much is available vs. how much the player has collected in some action game-esque scorekeeping.\n\nThe real annoyance remains the "on-the-rails" style of play that Enclave delivers.  It's pretty, it seems to have its heart in the right place, but it gives the player no freedom.  One quest at a time, with marks for how much gold you collect, and then on to the next.  You cannot even open a door until the necessary trigger event(s) have been completed.\n\nTo be honest, this is really not a game that I would call an RPG.  Action, yes.  Adventure, sure.  But it lacks most of what makes a good RPG - including multiple active quests and ability to stray from the path.  I didn't even see character building in the short time I spent in the Enclave world.\n\nI had such high hopes for this game, but it is time to resume the search for a good RPG.","March 1, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Melee seems to be the only choice and the ranged combat is really finicky; as if something was lost in translation from its original console port over to PC. What makes the ranged combat difficult leads into a positive I found in the melee combat. Though many enemies are melee based they don't simply run straight at you and play as if it's a multiplayer melee combat where they'll constantly zig zag to avoid ranged attacks and circle strafe/ dodge in melee combat. Unfortunately this leads to the Elder Scrolls style of combat where I'm diving in and back-peddling to avoid hits; this makes up the majority of the combat I've played.","December 21, 2013","false","4.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Maby too high expectations. I regret buying this game on so many levels. I have only played the first 15 minutes of this game. My first complaint is that the game is very glitchy. What I mean is that, I can't walk in a straight line because the game keeps teleporting me either in front of me or behind me. This is beyond annoying. My second major problem with the game is how clunky the gameplay is - it takes almost too long to swing a ♥♥♥♥ing sword and the AI is terrible. The voices of the characters is also very annoying and bad. This may be possibly the WORST game I have ever played on Steam. I am very dissapointed that I just wasted $5 on a game that I thought would be like Fable - an MMO, RPG (which what it was casted under) that I thought I could enjoy. The game starts off terrible too, you start off in a jail cell with an insane lady threatening to kill you. Then you get shot at with a giant catapult (the game is set in olden ages) and you have to escape through a hole. I won't spoil the rest. I get that this game was made awhile ago, but the game looks absolutely terrible. Even with all of the textures and normal video settings, the game looks terrible. I must also remind that the developers had absolutely no idea on what resolutions were. My moniter has a resolution of 1440x900 and when I switched to it, it gave me a resolution of 800x600 in a letterbox style. This was absolutely annoying to have to go through and find a decient resolution that didn't look half as bad. I could go on all day about how BAD this game was.

But the combat has some of the worst hit detection I have ever seen in a game in my life. It does not matter if you can see your sword blade hitting the enemy. You wont hit it unless an enemy is directly in front of you, and I mean DIRECTLY in a very thin line hit box, and you are so close to it you are touching it. The combat is laughably bad anyway. Just really generic and has no substance at all. The combat is so laughably generic I kept laughing at how it just feels like the very baasic 0's and 1's binary code for an atari game. The ONE THING this game has going for it is that amazingly for a game from 2003 it has vsync and supports 1920x1080. Blows my mind a game that old supports that res unless it was updated since 2003. It also installed and played fine with no technical issues at all, unless you count the fact that the game sucks balls as a technical issue, which I do. If the game sucks so bad you can't stand to play it, that is a stand out technical issue.\n\n3/10.","March 23, 2014","false","0.3"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","1"

I'm not very far in, but that is because the game isn't really engaging either! Also would the one factor to return be that it's some good brainless fun - but that would require the combat system to be  entertaining. It is, if you're cynical though. The "coins" (money bags) are hidden so cheaply within all in all very badly designed Levels that it doesn't feel like an achievement at the end of the Level and doesn't really add a lot of replay value because that would require one to play a Level again!

Controls are acceptable. atmosphere, which is glorified in the trailer and the description, is as atmospheric and interesting as a generic action/adventure game of the later 90's. The actual gameplay is fine, the graphics are quite dated and the overall quality of the game is subpar, but not bad. It's not a matter of graphics or controls with this game, so much as its fault being in its boring landscapes, strangely disjointed combat and utterly generic feel. Nothing interesting, new, innovative or even remotely eye-catching is done with this game. It rides its way comfortably into the safe zone of action/adventure gaming set in a bland and uninteresting medevial world devoid of anything that might make it stand out of the hundreds of its boring and generic cousins at the bottom of the value priced games you find in a cardboard bin at a department store, left to wallow in all they're boring blandness. for $0.82, it is ok, but for full price of $5.60, I think I would rather go have some tempura dynamite sushi..\n\nBetter that awful, but can't muster the strength to jump over that "Berlin Wall of Generic Gaming" fence - 5.5/10","January 26, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll give it a few days and if it's still gone I might recommend it, because it's a pretty OK rpg game basically.\n\n-\n\nNo matter how Enclave was as a game when it came out, all that is screwed up with this edition in a very rude and simple way.\n\nAs many here pointed out - when you run the game it first opens the browser automatically, by itself to Raven's Cry steam store page, another (new, latest) Topware game. It's basically a popup/spam/adware and the kind that hijacks your default browser to open an ad whether you like it or not. An ad that then runs trailer from that game in the background while this game runs on top.\n\nThis happens everytime game runs! If the game runs/loads before your browser, then you can't turn off Raven's Cry trailer and close that page because Alt+Tab or Win+D or Win+Tab is not working and the game crashes when those are used (Win7 Ultimate 64bit). Same thing when it's in windowed mode.\n\nVery not cool, Topware, not cool. Why would you do this?

Admittedly, I didn't get very far into the game before stopping, but having hit a game-breaking bug quite quickly I couldn't be bothered to reload the level I was playing.\n\nThe game is from 2003 according to the store page, and for a game of that time it actually looks fairly good. However, I found that whilst you could defend with a shield, most of your combat experience (at least as a "Knight") would involve furiously circle-strafing and mashing the LMB to hit the rather stupid AI opponents.\n\nThe allied AI isn't much better. In the second mission I managed to lose a friendly AI that should have been following me, and in the third mission, the AI and the scenery bugged out, causing the AI I was escorting to get fatally stuck on a door.\n\nFinally, the vast majority of the story (from what I could tell) was relayed through skippable cutscenes, making it all to easy to lose track of what was going on. There was no obvious way to receive cues on the story whilst in the game itself either, making it quite hard to follow.\n\nOverall, the experience was somewhat frustrating, and I'd give this game a miss.","December 20, 2013","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not all characters can carry all this, it depends on their class.\nYou first play as the good guys, and once you finish that campaign, you can turn the table and play as the bad guys which was very rewarding for me. The last few levels (end-game) were dissapointingly easy, but after the madness of missions 8 through 10, it was a welcome break.\n\nI totally recomend the game, you get a few days worth of fun (if you have a busy schedule like i do) for just 5$","August 21, 2014","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Colleeto5/recommended/253980/","Colleeto5","Ailuri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Colleeto5/","180 products in account","I was genuinely surprised when I picked this up for $0.94. First of all, after looking at the graphics in the screenshots, I was shocked to read this game is from 2003. The graphics are absolutely wonderful for its time, and even don't look half bad by today's standards; the fact that 1920x1080 is a supported resolution is just icing on the cake. (only the game textures support 1080p though, so the backgrounds look horrendus.) It reminded me a bit of the Champions series mixed with The Witcher.\n\nThe combat feels satisfying, aside from the stiffness and slight repetition; timing your blocks and blows is very immersive and can make you forget how clunky other aspects of the game can be.\n\nAll that being said, there is a slight problem with misdirection; this can be justified a bit because a lot of games from this time didn't exactly hold your hand, but there were times when I had no idea what to do, and only when I backtracked (or maybe just moved on to an identical area; I don't know), did the game move forward. Certain NPCs don't follow you when they should and seem to have the ability to teleport if you don't stay right on them.\n\nAll in all, I'd say it's worth the $0.94 I paid for it, though I don't know as if I would have bought it at full price. It's certainly worth a play, and it's enjoyable enough to justify the price, even if you only play it a few times.\n\ntl;dr: Can be misleading at times, but the combat and graphics are nice.","September 4, 2014","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
