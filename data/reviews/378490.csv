It would have been a neat bechanic if luggage fell out.\n- Mobile Port (I think this is a tablet game? I could be wrong)\n- Not enough content\n\nI'm mainly going to recommend this game to people who really enjoy Tiny Wings, and "want more", this game is fun for what it is, but it isn't much more.\n","February 3","true","0.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","0"

The game is vibrant and colorful. The environmental levels hit a soft spot with me, the creators were not lazy just to have one level. I also found this game extremely addictive and I spend countless hours a day on this game.\nThere are some downsides however, there are only two different languages to choose from (English and German) and if this game wants a chance at going international I would expect them to make this change immediatly. There also seems to be some problems with the landing, sometimes I would lose my luggage when I landed fine.\nThe sound is also was a small issue for me. It was too loud and I had to manually go to my sound mixer and turn it down. The music was very enjoyable and the only option was to turn it completlely off.\nIn conclusion there needs to be more options in the menu and more languages added and if so this could easily be one of the top games of the year.","March 1","true","2.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","3"

Its just a little casual game to pass the time, and the price is perfect. Needs a few twecks here and there but nothing major. Gotta get that controller support in the game(Which would be way bettter than the mouse) and add some more levels (DLC). Kinda has that retro 50's theme going.I like that. The music is cute and i love the sound effects. Especially the kids screaming while going up and down the hills and pulling off stunts. Haha Its a yes for me!! :)","February 2","true","1.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nomogumbo/recommended/378490/","Nomogumbo","Gumboman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nomogumbo/","625 products in account","TL;DR\nIt's okay - there's not much to do after the 20 minutes it takes to complete the campaign, and the game is mechanically less satisfying than Extreme Road Trip.\n\nI was hoping this would play somewhat like Extreme Road Trip, but it lacks the variety of playing as different cars, and the endless mode is completely pointless. The reasons being that it's impossible to die, it's still segmented into levels, your score is reset after each level, the leaderboard doesn't function, and coins aren't used for anything. I'm still wondering why the tutorial says to "collect coins to increase your budget."\n\nThe only goals in the game are to complete the 12 levels of the campaign, and to collect a souvenir from each. There's no rewards for this, only score bonuses. You can also go for the (in-game only) achievements to extend your playtime for maybe about an hour and a half, but then there's nothing left. This is a bit of a lazy port. It's not bad, but I can't recommend it either.","February 4","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
