Robot Aliens are here to destroy you." And then you grab the Master Chief action figure and he's all like "Not today, Robot Aliens!" and starts laying waste to a horde of aliens with a big laser machine gun, but then a grenade blows up next to him, and you pull off his legs and you're all like "Oh no, Master Chief!" and he's all like "Don't worry, I don't need legs to kick ♥♥♥!" and you're all like "You kinda do...", but by that point there's a bunch of space marine drop pods all coming down to back him up so it doesn't even matter, and then a bunch more robot aliens start coming in and the space marines and Master Chief are just pumping lead into the main doorway, but then the bullet casings start piling up in the doorway behind them and Master Chief is like "You guys need to get out of here, or you'll end up trapped by bullet casings!" and the space marines are like "That's a ♥♥♥♥ing stupid ♥♥♥ justification for a epic sacrifice scene..." and Master Chief's all like "I've definitely had worse." But by that point there's a bunch of AT-STs lumbering for the doorway, so the space marines are all like "later, brah", and Master Chief starts an epic hold out in the room, and a bunch of laser fire blows his left arm off, but he pulls out his pistol and he's all like "SUCK ON THIS, ROBOT ALIENS!" and starts shooting at the AT-STs, which is super useless but it looks really cool. Then, just when it looks like all hope is lost, an inbound robot alien dropship accidentally bumps into a wall as it tries to drop off more robot aliens and it spirals out of control, smashing into the AT-ST's and sending chunks of them everywhere. One of them hits Master Chief in the face and tears off his helmet, and with 5 HP left, as he quickly bleeds out, Master Chief gets one final moment of peace before ragdolling facefirst into a mine and getting blown to ♥♥♥♥ing pieces.\n\n10/10\n\n(Check the system requirements because the physics modeling is CPU intensive, $20 purchase might leave you a little salty, keep an eye out for summer and winter sales, as it routinely goes down to $5, anything $10 or below will leave you with no regrets purchasing.)","November 21, 2015","true","18.9"," 111 of 120 people (93%) found this review helpful 93 people found this review funny","93","111","120","93","5"

I never got into the metagame, but the individual battles -- where you're digging for loot so you can buy wobbly inverse-kinematics-y troops who arrive in unreliable crashy spaceships and stomp uncertainly across a mushy, shifting battlefield (partially composed of the corpses of previous troops) and then blast off in jetpacks, sometimes splattering against walls, so they can have a chance at maybe putting a bullet in the head of a flamethrower-wielding crash test dummy -- are CRAZY and WONDERFUL.\n\nNo description can do justice to the joy of crashing a tiny high-speed rocket full of bombs into an enemy stronghold, or sneaking a lone, powerful (but, again, VERY wobbly) robotic commando through a labyrinthine base equipped with nothing but a plasma pistol and a grenade launcher. This is one of those games where failure is every bit as exciting as success. And the mod community is very active, so if you want to play as a wobbly, two-dimensional Gordon Freeman or Emperor Palpatine, those options are available to you. Cortex Command is a game about physics and glorious stupidity. It's a game about ricocheting a sniper rifle shot off a set of doors and accidentally knocking the rifle out of your own hands. It's a game where, when you're sent to retrieve an object, you sweat the ENTIRE TIME because you're afraid you'll drop the object down a hole or accidentally jetpack yourself right out of the level while holding it.\n\nThis game is bliss.","August 10, 2014","true","166.6"," 111 of 134 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","111","134","11","0"

They probably expected some epic story mode or intense multiplayer battles, and end up disappointed because CC doesn't have these features. But it has something different: An incredible sandbox experience.\n\nDo you want to know how I play it? I load up a map of Skirmish Defense, enable unlimited gold and that my brain can be placed anywhere, then build an unbreachable subterranean bunker and start the game. Now the real fun begins. Wave after wave of enemies will try to tunnel a way to my brain, but this task is a bit complicated by the fact that I constantly drop crates filled with pineapple grenades and molotov cocktails on their heads and watch their bodies explode into gore.\nSoon, the whole battlefield is covered in body parts and debris. The never ending waves of enemies have to crawl trough a horrible mess of blood and flesh from their fallen brethren, only to be ripped apart by the next crate bomb. If this gets boring, I set up a Sniper with a high powered Anti-Vehicle rifle on a hilltop. It is just too damn entertaining to shoot out a drop ship's engines and then finish the remaining crew with a single, multiple-body-penetrating shot.\n\nThe completely desctructible environment is just so awesome to mess with. When you fire bullets at the ground, you can see them traveling through the dirt and coming to a halt. The game even takes into account what weapon was used - bullets of rifles will bury much deeper than the ones of pistols.\nThis also introduces some interesting mechanics in terms of bunker design. Depending on the angle from where the shot was fired, a bullet will either bounce off a wall or penetrate it.\nExploding grenades produce shrapnel that rips apart even the toughest enemy. There is even a Chainsaw Gun. Guess what it does. Yes, it fires Chainsaws.\n\nThe only problem with Cortex Command are the lazy developers. This game has been in development forever, and nothing significant has changed. The devlog is updated twice a year max, and it's been ages since the last release. This makes the 20$ pricetag feel like a rip-off, since you're buying an unfinished product that probably will never be finished.\n\nIf you can pick it up at sale, though... go for it!","January 8, 2015","true","10.3"," 71 of 79 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","71","79","7","0"

I rocketed into him with my jetpack, knocked the gun from his hands, and then picked it up. We stared at each other for a moment just before I emptied the whole clip into him. Then I hid on a tower top with a scavenged grenade launcher, and used it to take down a whole platoon and a dropship before I finally bled to death. It was a good day.\n\nMost of my hours playing this have been offline or with a standalone copy. As a physics sandbox, CC is unmatched. The campaign is fun, but just starting a skirmish and dropping bombs on things never gets old. Unlike so many titles nowadays, there is nothing to unlock, no experience to gain, no hook to keep you playing, and yet I keep coming back to it because it's just enjoyable. Like playing with toys when you were a kid. Not since the original Unreal Tournament have I spent so much time on a game simply because of the moment to moment fun factor.\n\nAlso, the workshop is populated with great mods.

It has other more important flaws, yet still I had fun playing it for the first few hours, but it got old very fast. While playing I thought that some small things could've been added to make the player care more. For a "war" game, there's actually no deaths, no characters. Everyone is a robot, nobody seems to care, so why should the player care for casualties, losses or individual unit? I enjoyed the idea of the gameplay, but I think that story and world immersion matters the most in games. I think a story mode should be added, because no matter how good or bad the gameplay is, as long as there are characters/people for who the player starts to care for, the game will be loved.

You can also put it in patroll mode to guard your base, sentry mode to guard a specific area and brain hunt where it will go towards the enemy's bunker and find its way to the brain. And if needed, call down a V2 rocket piloted by a drunk pilot who will probably crash, but still deliver your fully-outfitted troops roughly where you wanted them (or you just lob them from space in a box and let it crash a few metres deep in the sand, forcing them to crawl out of the gaping hole while hostiles throw molotov cocktail inside, fun times!)\n\nI must say, this game is very fun to play, Its simple, creative and action packed!\nHell, i had a soldier once who faced off agains three other robots, his legs got shot of and his rifle got destroyed, so he switched to his pistol and killed all three of them before bleeding out.\nIt's these awesome moments that make this game so great! Shooting down a dropship and witnessing the soldiers under it getting flattend by it or a squad heroicly fighting off hordes of crash-test dummies while trying to block their entrypoint with a concrete launcher, and all of this happened in those few hours i've played!\nWorshop makes it even better, adding in units from other games like Warhammer 40K or Halo makes it much more interessting, even adding in a few new maps is always fun!\n\nThe only downsides i've encountered is the clunky menu, the poor UI, lacking tutorial and the fact that there is no Free camera mode.\nThere barely is a UI besides the circular hold-the-right-mousebutton one which is a little confusing at first, the tutorial is very minimum, but you learn the basics of the game pretty fast anyways. And the camera, well, thats permanently focussed on the unit you are using, so no looking around the place, which is annoying if you hear a dropship nearby, but you can't see it.\n\nBut for my final verdict, this game is a must-buy for people who like customising their own troops individualy, who like games that tell stories about how badass the units were in that one battle against those 100 crabs and for those who just like building giant, trap-filled bunkers for the CPU to breach (which it will, he'll just dig into the brain's bunker right away)\n\nI give it a score of 8.5/10, take that Metacritic!","December 21, 2014","true","25.1"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","24","31","0","1"

As for gameplay, it's interesting to say the least. The game is definitely not a realistic combat simulation, but it definitely uses jetpacks in ways they've never been used before. Keep the throttle on for too long and you'll find yourself zooming across the map at the speed of sound. As for actual combat, it's thought out and entertaining. Things such as bullet weight and velocity play a good part in battle; a pistol's bullets will literally bounce off enemies if they're too far away, while a sniper rifle is heavy to carry but can penetrate armor from a good distance. You'll soon find that when you build your base you'll be putting down heavily armored juggernauts with rocket launchers and LMGs since you don't need them to move much (you'll also find weight is a real hinderance since jetpacks are the only real way to move) while your assault troops will probably just have that one remote-detonation-grenade launcher you think is really cool. While most battles have the simple objective "kill the enemy brain", there are alternative game modes available in the base game, like surviving with one troop for a set amount of time or holding down a base being attacked by dummies.\n\nCortex Command isn't for everyone, but if you don't mind a random decapitation becuase you hit the roof from time to time and you're not super serious about realism then this game will be worth the money.","March 12, 2015","true","98.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","17","20","2","0"

The biggest flaw with CC is that it really doesn't have much to do in it, it's more of a game that you'll pick up and play from time to time than a deep game you'll spend hours with. That said, it never really gets old unless you play really often, it has dedicated mod support to keep things interesting, and a great multiplayer mode.

I believed the latest vid from the developer, stating that a lot of previous issues have been fixed etc, and so picked it up for $6 in a steam sale, but to be honest it must have been pretty bad before if this is supposed to be significantly improved.\n\nIt definitely has potential: the combat could be fun if it wasn't so unbalanced, and the destruction/debris is nice.\n\nThe split-screen mode is one of the main reasons I picked it up.  A friend of mine who loves quirky indie games was coming over for the evening and this looked perfect.  We're used to playing a fair share of alpha/beta/unfinished Public Domain games where bugs are often part of the charm, but even this was too much for us and we gave up after about an hour.  I've since played it a little more on my own to see if we missed something, but as hard as I tried I couldn't feel anything but frsutration when playing this.\n\nIf you can figure out how to work around the weird bugs, the swampy controls, and the terrible GUI, then you might like it.  In the interest of fairness, I should say that I haven't tried any of the mods.  I read the other reviews on here and they all seem to agree that you need to try mods to get the most out of this, but my issues were with core things like controls and the single player campaign, which I doubt any mods would address,","May 31, 2014","false","2.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

I had watched videos and done a little bit of research, and the game simply looked amazing for what it was. A unique side scrolling take on RTS.\n\nWhen I actually got to hop in the game however, things went bad fast.\n\nFirst off, learning the controls, even with the assistance of the tutorial was a pain. They only explain the bare minimum in how you can switch out to other units under your influence, and how to control them on a basic level. They tell you nothing of how you're supposed to actually use the unit, or how to activate its various AI scripts and what they actually do. The UI is bare minimum, you have to dig and test everything out on your own just to figure out things that should be presented directly, or have better in game descriptions.\n\nWhile actually controlling your units, you'll find they are slow and terribly clunky. Even the faster/lighter units feel that way, and there's simply no way around. Heavy units are a literal nightmare to move around the map. With heavier units you'll find it almost impossible to reach certain areas, forcing you to use easily killed light units for everything, and only equipping them with the absolute bare minimum to assault the enemy. Attempting to use the AI scripts usually just forces them to saunter off to their deaths, they end up firing into the air blindly or never returning fire, while the enemy computer controlled units decimate your forces from half a mile away with a pistol.\n\nWhile all the equipment and units you can call down are interesting, you'll find yourself most times just calling down basic units due to the cost to protect yourself, while the opponent seems to have near infinite resources he can call on. Even when you have a ton of money it seems to run out in seconds, where there's seem to have no end, even on the easier settings. That and the fact you'll notice the enemy AI is quite crafty in going after your controller unit/brain. Assassinating him from impossible angles, or simply just scuicide bum rushing you, while your idiot AI forces stand there and watch slack jawed, even is they are on sentry/defense mode.\n\nThere are a number of mods out there that can expand the gameplay, adding modes, areas, new factions and weapons and other things. Some of them are quite excellent, and it's to bad there was such a great modding community for this game, but the developer half ♥♥♥♥♥ it for about 10 years. Yep, that's right. This game was 10 years in development before seeing a "full" version launch. Looking at the game now you'd probably be wondering where the full version is. It feels much more like a late alpha build, or very early beta.\n\nLike I said, it's such a shame there was such a passionate modding community, their talents and time went to waste on a devolper and his half ♥♥♥♥♥ game, when the modders could have put their attentions elsewhere and made something amazing in a game people actually care about.\n\nIf you can get the game for dirt cheap on sale for like 90% off go for it. Simply to check it out, and see "what could have been". The potential you can see in videos and in the game itself is amazing. But, the deveolper simply never capitilized on it, and now it sits as pretty much abandonware, festering here on Steam, where the deveolper is still asking money for a dead and rotting corpse of a product he will never patch, update, touch, or even look at again.\n\nIf the source code gets released, and others pick it up and do something with it, the results might just be amazing. So keep your eyes open if or when that happens.\n\nUntil then, stay away from this festering pile of abandonware garbage.","March 6, 2014","false","25.7"," 25 of 44 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","25","44","0","1"

I thought it was a great game. It only had two levels, no full screen (or generally 'settings' of any nature), and skeleton gameplay mechanics, but it was very fun and I played it for weeks. It is now five years later, the game is STILL in an early state (even though its official release date was a couple years ago), and aparently all it does now is jump around for a moment, freeze up and crash.\n\nI'm not recommending this game because it is clearly an abandoned project. It is a great design, really, but unfortunately also not happening, so you'll just be throwing your money away. I'm lucky I got it in the steam winter sale for only a couple bucks. We'd be luckier still if another company would take over and resume development.

I love it to death but if its not going to show you or teach you how to play it then its just kind of seems lazy and causes frustration for me but there was a warning at the start of the campaign that said the game was not polished and needs work.

I just came from playing a match where you have to evacuate a brain from a base. This would seem simple enough, exepet for the fact that with the reload action being the same as the pickup action youll be picking up worthless weapons that way you down. This gets extremely annoying because there is always loose guns from dead people everywhere. The ladders mixed with the jetpack are also terrible because the mechanic for the ladders is like glue and the jet pack pushes you forward into it so you always get stuck in a small corridor trying to just fly about a meter up to get to the next section. If you try to use the actual ladder, it seems your guy will just get tired and randomly fall off of it. I didnt know they uped the price to $20 (seeing how I got this in a humble bundle a while ago) but the fact is that this game isnt worth the $20... at all.","August 14, 2014","false","5.6"," 28 of 53 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","28","53","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UrbanFury/recommended/209670/","UrbanFury","UrbanFury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UrbanFury/","220 products in account","This is an extremely amped up 2D game that depends on the modding community. The metacritic score was likely formulated in an early build and without considering the mods. For example Gamespy said, "In a way, Cortex Command seems like it's asking for a lot of concessions because, for the most part, it still feels like an unfinished game."\n\nAnother example is what IGN said, "Not COD. 5/10." Just kidding. But seriously screw IGN. If you played only what IGN said was worth playing -- could you imagine?\n\nTo explain how ridiculous it is to review this game without taking the mods into account I will say this. If I recall back when I played on Build 23 the game itself was like 50-60 MB in size and the mods were nearly 3 GB. That's like playing Skyrim with 700 GB worth of mods. This is an Indie game that has it's own standards and priorities that diverge, tremendously, from that of AAA titles. There are so many games that seek to limit the player into a narrow and limited vision that a couple developers had. This game is not like that.\n\nI think if all you play is the currently popular games then this game will be an empowering experience for you. This is a game that is wide open for you to change. Play this game. Mod the hell out of it. Learn how to mod the mods. There is so many little things that are just so satisfying about this game, so jump in and find what satisfies you.","December 18, 2014","true","129.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","4"

The sad thing is the Meta score doesn't do this game justice. At the time of its review alot of the features were not polished thus resulting in a horrible score. This game is great for those who like games like Battlezone and Mount and Blade. A combination of strategy and action. Very similar Battlezone(limited resources and the ability to control any unit) for you old timers looking for a game of a similar flavour. Problem is without someone else around to play splitscreen, you are pretty much limited to just singleplayer which just gets repetitive(even with the mods).\n\nIn short I recommend this game only when on sale for less than $5, as you can buy much more in depth games for the same price.

I heard that this game is awesome when playing with a friend (thus avoiding some AI issues). I haven't yet, so I talk about single-player only here!\n\nSadly campaign mode with AI enemy seems broken. AI is kinda hard in an unpleasent way. You should build a bunker but realy the best bet is to raid the enemy as soon as possible taking lucky shots at his commander. Also the enemy can do multi-tasking (build base and attack you) while the player can only do one thing at a time.

It is still fun, especially the missions, but I can't keep looking at the issues and the fact that the game seems abandoned by its developer.\n\nLike said, I love this game but unless it is updated to address the issues I can not recommend it for the price of about 19$.\n\nIf anything, grab it on a sale and try to enjoy the better working missions - you'll either love or hate it.","April 1","false","13.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It cirlced in the air and flew down into the soldiers, killing them. The parts flew and killed my solder. I came back and that wreck didn't disappear; it was part of the landscape. This game has 100% (100% is not an exaggeration. It is one hundred percent deformable) deformable landscape which means if you're standing above the room where your enemy's main brain is hiding, you can have a squad of your soldiers armed with shotguns shoot a hole through 5 foot thick concrete and wires and rebar where your squad will fall onto the brain-droid and 2 soldiers, killing them all. Your gun can be knocked out of your hand and even broken by gunfire while you're using it. Your legs can be shot off as your arm can be. I spent 30 solid seconds flying around, limbless, with my jetpack when I flew into an enemy and killed him with the impact. Dead bodies also become part of the landscape. I've taken cover behind 3 of my comrades more often than behind actual cover. The command mechanics are *extremely* unique and interesting, and the plethora of mods in 2 days is staggering. I'm sure you've exaggerated the greatness of a game, maybe even said that you couldn't possibly tell someone why the game is so good and they just have to see for themselves but... You really have to see for yourself. I believe it's still 10 bucks but 20 is more than fair.

The game, itself, is very simple, containing mostly of factions, and modern to futuristic weapons. The downside was that it was not enough to satisfy the audience.\n\nWhen BUILD 30 came out last year, the game basically added the best feature (so far). Steam Workshop, which includes mods so strange and epic, has filled those "missing" gaps. The mods can range to a crab army to a super smart computer that can rupture brains, build structures, and more.\n\nAlso, the physics are another thing people don't look at. Some moments in the game are like movie moments and that they are NON SCRIPTED. Now that just blew me away when I first played it.\n\nNow, if I had to have one downside to this game, it would be that if you install TOO many mods, the game will take forever to load.\n\nYou should take my word instead of others and get this game, you will not be dissapointed and if you are...

It has been years, and the engine sill lags and twitches, too many models in-world cause all models to explode, the controls are still a clunky mess ("made for controllers," like that excuses awkwardness), the enemy AI's ability to perform multiple tasks (or even one task at speed) restricts you to either spamming skeletons or sticking to multiplayer, but the lack of online multiplayer or any sort of balance between factions and weapons makes the splitscreen multiplayer we're stuck with a bit of a crapshoot. And really, playing an already-cramped platformer RTS on a controller with half a screen is uncomfortable enough; I shudder to imagine it with four players.\n\nPeople will say you can just mod it into the game you want, but I shouldn't have to; if it's not the game I bought, and it's not the game promised to me, then why did I pay money for it? Why would you tell other people to pay money for it? People will say that I should lower my expectations because it isn't finished yet, but the developers have given the all clear on features that are nearly unsalvagable, like the campaign or your troops digging off the edge of the map.

It has been years, and the engine sill lags and twitches, too many models in-world cause all models to explode, the controls are still a clunky mess ("made for controllers," like that excuses awkwardness), the enemy AI's ability to perform multiple tasks (or even one task at speed) restricts you to either spamming skeletons or sticking to multiplayer, but the lack of online multiplayer or any sort of balance between factions and weapons makes the splitscreen multiplayer we're stuck with a bit of a crapshoot. And really, playing an already-cramped platformer RTS on a controller with half a screen is uncomfortable enough; I shudder to imagine it with four players.\n\nPeople will say you can just mod it into the game you want, but I shouldn't have to; if it's not the game I bought, and it's not the game promised to me, then why did I pay money for it? Why would you tell other people to pay money for it? People will say that I should lower my expectations because it isn't finished yet, but the developers have given the all clear on features that are nearly unsalvagable, like the campaign or your troops digging off the edge of the map. While they finally added squad mechanics, that doesn't fix a broken and unchangable control scheme or the fact that you can't leave your own troops alone without them killing themselves. And I think the worst part is, for all its flaws I can't think of any other game that tries to be what Cortex Command set out to be, what it promised to be, and as such can't suggest a better alternative.

Cortex Command is an incredibly depressing game. It's a beautiful brainchild of a passionate person or people who just did not want to polish their ideas. They game has been in development about eight years now, and it's still in a miserable state. It's horribly bug ridden, there are amazingly careless and obvious mistakes and errors, there's huge balance issues and very little depth, and it's stagnated for a ridiculous amount of time. This game is going nowhere. It's a perpetual prototype, seemingly never to be fixed or improved. A prototype with game-breaking bugs, including the overworld map not fitting on the screen, or fullscreen causing immense lag, or you just getting stuck in a wall all the time. Not to mention the game has prolonged lagging episodes constantly.\n\nBut what a fun prototype it can be. The game is at times incredibly tense as you try to find an opening to shoot while desperately trying to avoid having any bit of you out in the open, and the game is at times hilarious as drop pods go astray and crash into a squad of troops. It is perfectly viable to win by dropping a crate of crabs on the enemy brain's head. They game is incredibly silly, but also extremely engaging. It takes a lot of effort to take down some of the enemies, and it feels very rewarding when you manage to do so. The base game has incredibly potential.\n\nLet's talk about the actual game for a second. It's a 2D shooter with strategy elements. It's very hard to compare, there's really nothing like it. You have your typical base building aspects; you want a unit or two mining for gold, yet you also want a few armed units hanging around defending your brain/HQ. Most of the time you're be controlling a single offensive unit of some sort, kitted out to your liking. You have to make sure your brain lives, and the enemy's brain dies.\n\nIt's set in multiple scenarios. There are a few separate missions, including a horde/defense mode and a few assualt based modes. There's also a campaign mode, where you will capture points and build bases on them, then try to take over the opponent's bases. Although, that mode suffers from the previously mentioned glitch concerning the overworld map, making it so you cannot see and select some of the base building points, making it impossible to win. And that's it. You got about five missions and a frankly boring and repetitive campaign mode and that's it. There are a few nice mods that add some, but it's just a bit more icing atop an inch-tall cake. You ought experience everything the base game in about four hours, you can add probably add another four to six with mods. It depends how much you can stomach before getting bored.\n\nThe game has a very robust physics engine which allows you to contort into all sorts of hilarious positions, but it is also incredibly clunky. The menues are a mess, the characters are extremely slow, and you will accidentally kill yourself in hysterical yet infuriating ways. This is a good and bad thing. At first it's novel and interesting, then it's incredibly frustrating. Then it's a bit easier, then it grows fairly boring. There is a huge arsenal of weapons, but a lot of them feel the same, and a lot of them are somewhat disinteresting. Again, the base game is there, and it's great, but there is absolutely no filling, and there is bare minimum content. Your enjoyment of the game will depend entirely on how much you can put up with repitition and how far the bare basics of the gameplay can carry you.\n\nIn the end, I cannot recommend Cortex Command at the asking price of twenty dollars. That's simply too expensive for so little content and polish. It's also a game that I don't entirely feel comfortable supporting, as it's eight years in development yet still contains crippling bugs. It really feels like the developers just didn't want to bother polishing their initial ideas, they didn't want to do the boring parts. It's like an unedited paper, they just wanted to jolt down all their interesting thoughts and conclusions but they didn't want to spend time making it presentable to an audience. Such a shame.\n\nOn sale, you might want to consider it. It's got a few laughs and fun moments between the frustration of the brief experience, and it has a lot of toys for the more imaginative players. If you like weird 2D shooters with comically spasmic physics engines with some resource management, wait for a fifty percent sale bringing it down to ten dollars. If you're not interested in that or you can't stand major bugs or you need significant motivation besides gameplay, avoid it like the plague. Also, don't bet on this game ever being finished, or even improving significantly. Eight years of dead air does not bode well.","April 14, 2014","false","7.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

One of the best games to mod cause the mods are simple to create (compared to other games). The game has some weird moments like your commander randomly getting crushed by a droped gun or your soldiers getting eaten by a mob of crabs.

Although I can barely survive a few waves with my meager heavy marine and his compact assault rifle, I love to see the little soldiers fight and ragdoll all around when they get hit, or crush each other trying to get out of a pit. On top of that its actually in my opinion fun to lose here, so I'd buy this if I were you.","February 5, 2015","true","41.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Let me just tell you, the amount of ways in which you can kill your enemies? PLENTY, drop a soldier in a crate right on your enemies units, or rockets as they fly in, bombard your enemies with napalm, or other rockets dropped from the sky. Alternatively, just send your units in, and kill your enemies with brutal force. After you kill a brain in one of the areas, you take it over, and build a base, in which your brain will be stored, enemies will try to take over, and will use any means necessary to achieve victory. And that's just the tip, there is a lot more to it, and is best played with friends on a couch. THE BIGGEST FLAW is lack of online multiplayer, which is really sad, and I really see no reason to why that is.. :(\n\nAll in all I strongly recommend that you play it, and here is a video of couch play I did with my friends, a videos against AI are also available so check them out, they are real fun as well :)\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmY6ZrXNtsY","January 19, 2015","true","25.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Base building? Its like the Minecraft of Military installments (Terraria?). Shooting action? There are so many different guns. Main game too boring? More community mods than you have children to play with. The eleven years its been in development have been great, if boring.\n\nWhile the twenty dollars is pretty steep, I would recommend getting it if you can pony up the money or snag it somewhere.

Wanna build a base? Go right ahead. Wanna build some\ndirt cheap bunker and see how well you can hold off with bad equipment? Good luck.\n\nThe game it self is a marvel. I have seen a few 2D shooters like this one, and probably never will. The art is beautiful,\nthe characters (from what IS available) are hilarious to me (ever fought the Dummy Faction? Pure genius.), and the\ngameplay has huge amount of replayabilty.\n\nNow, everything has a bad point, and quite frankly, this one has a few. The first thing is that Campaign is seriously\nunderworked. Now, like I said, I don't play for story, but I know it when I see it. There is almost 0 to none story. A\nlittle bit of backstory, but nothing to play for. And I know alot of people play for story, and I know why.\n\nAnother problem is with how easy it is. In campagin, you and up to 3 other players (or bots) can fight to claim the whole\nplanet. It's fun. But it is way too easy. If you initiate a battle over claiming it for the first time, all you would have to do is\nfill a drop crate with bombs and drop it over the brain droid of your enemy. It's hilarious at first, but after awhile, it just gets\nredundent.\n\nDespite these problems, the game has a huge amount of potential; with a modding community to back it up.\n\nI've loved this game ever since B16, and I still love it.\n\nWow.\nMuch fun.\nVery explosive.\nWow.\n\n(Ever seen a crab bomb?

The game works but movement can be very wonky. Movement is also very slow which I feel should be updated in the future. With that being said, this game holds soooo much potential and it's worth keeping an eye on. It has one of the best intros I've seen in gaming. It's a sandbox/strategy/combat game. It's very unique in its appearance and gameplay. You basically have a disembodied brain and with that single brain you can jump between and control different mechanical bodies. You then use these bodies to protect your brain and mount an attack on the enemy. The game lacks refinement but it will be interesting to see where it goes from here.","June 13, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Imagine a sandbox strategy game with realtime Worms gameplay and base building: create a base & the layout ( rooms, corridors, doors, defenses), add soldiers (which also can be finely tuned with different armour, weapons, tools) & try to destroy the opponents brain whilst protecting yours, plus mining gold to supply more reinforcements with better weapons.\n\nThe terrain plays a very important role. It's fully destructable, being able to shoot through scenery & dig/explode a new path, or it can hinder you as when the bodies & debris pile up, they become part of the scenery & will hinder movement & bullets.\n\nThere's alot of physics involved in the game, so movement takes ALOT of getting used to, & the game is still buggy, but so far it's been extremely fun to play, hope the developers keep supporting it!\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a game that lets you fully customise your base, soldiers & gameplay, THIS is the game you are looking for!","October 6, 2012","true","31.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The modding community is great and it adds so much to this game.  I love the 2d style and destructable enviornments, however I could not honestly reccomend this game.\n\nThe issue here is performance, on multiple rigs I have had issues with not only crashing to desktop, but crippling lag as soon as a game runs too long or things start to get interesting.   It's almost to a point where it is unplayble.  Unfortunately, it does not matter what type of rig you have,  because this game only utlizes 1 cpu core and limited GPU as far as i know.  Either way the lag always creeps up and ruins the experience.    I don't know if there is a fix for this because the engine it was built on is old.\n\nI don't see how they can recommend playing this with 4 friends, when the lag crushes the experience with just two people.  There are some tweaks for this online, but nothing solid to get the game running at 60fps consistently even on modern pc's.\n\nAll in all it has so much potential but It cant be realized because of the dated engine and lack of optimization.","December 28, 2015","false","4.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I know my hour counter says i sometimes play it, but that is irrelevant as this review is to convince one not to buy it. You can play something you got for nearly free and still advise people to not buy it.\n\nWhere do i start? Well for starters "DONT BELIEVE THE BUILD 30 TRAILER". back when the game did reach steam it was in fact advertised to its community as DONE and ever since little to no news about it was ever shared and now after a very long time. NOW they show some returned interest in a game and defend it by saying "We should have communicated properly". they had a long time to explain that point and just now they do it. Thats just unexcusible.\n\nOnto the game itself...its a tech demo. nothing more, nothing less and it will NEVER be anything but that.\nThe tech is nice and everything, but there just isn't any depth. At most you may mess around in one of very few levels or the kinda chaotic "campaign" now and then with a few modpacks just for the sake of it. but it gets horribly repetetive nearly instantly... There just isn't anything of substance. there was the promise of a campaign with the game's setup (you are a brain on a quest to create a empire on a Free for all planet, neato). but that got shoved aside for the so called campaign currently and only a few scenarios hinting at the original plans remain.\n\nMultiplayer is a joke. there is in no way any networking capability and only if you have multiple controllers of any use...only then may you find some enjoyment IF you have the controllers and friends wanting to play...which is more often a big NO.\n\nAlso the dev shrugged off bugs and "unpolished" features on the pretense of early-access. Thing is that most of these bugs have been there for YEARS.\n\nIn overall this game is something that began with potential and ambition, but now is horribly dated and the dev doesn't seem to put in any effort anymore. I say that unless the game costs a few dollar and you are willing, to just let it pass into history and to let the dev know that he should probably just move on to something else, cause this is a lost cause.\n\nPS: Expect to crash to desktop a LOT when using modpacks.

It's great because it has a unique gameplay system, random terrain generation, and a decently fun campaign mode. The bad side is actually playing the game can be difficult and it's tricky to make wise decisions to stay ahead of the AI and be successful. I mostly view this as an extra challenge, but the heavy difficulty has lead to me not playing this game too much. Overall it's a good game and it's a fun to play. I do enjoy how open-ended it is and how you can be creative with equipment and various purchases you made.","November 26, 2013","true","3.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

At first glance this game seems to have a ton of potential. You have a lot of weapons to choose from, alot of equipment and a lot of gear to arm your robot avatars with, and the particle and physics effects are very neat to see. Unfortunately it only takes about an hour of play to exhaust all the fun you could have with this game. Every thing becomes to repetative. Small skirmeshes that range from to easy to almost impossible if you miss manage what little resources you have, and an overall unfocused set of game types thrown in almost as an afterthought. The multiple weapon types offer a bit of strategy to an otherwise mindless game, but once you become adept with some of the more exotic guns the game has to offer, you can abandon any strategy the game has in favor of brute strength.\n\nPlaying against a human oppenent makes things far more interesting, but having only local multiplayer in this type of game seems like a rather silly design choice by the developer. If this game really took a decade to make, perhaps another year on the design table would have done this game wonders.","February 15, 2014","false","11.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The big issue is that it is a buggy mess a lot of the time. Poorly optimized which is very apparent when you have large numbers of actors in the scene or when multiple/numerous explosions occur OR after playing for long enough (without crashing) and the remains of actors and weapons cover the field. All of these can cause massive frame drops and/or the game crashing. AI is rough and glitchs can randomly cause your brain to die causing instant failure of the mission. Without mods the game suffers from a lack of content with various missions being similar if not identical to others in how they should be played and campaigns suffer from excessive repetition. To get the most enjoyment you really need some imagination or community mods which are in ample supply. Enviorments and actors are nicely made. Decent selection of weapons in vanilla version alone. Gameplay is enjoyable even with the bugs, however frustration can easily ruin your experience. The developer's dedication to this game is also very questionable and even with the recent update I have still suffered these issues.

There is no real objective, most of the time you are trying out different weapons and mess around with the game's physics.\n\nIt's not a bad game at all.  For a while it's fun to fly around with your jetpacks, shoot stuff, and try things from the workshop, but at the end it's not much more than the rather unsatisfying slashing of the dumb enemy horde-AI.\n\nIf you are looking for a combat sandbox, try the Men of War series in singleplayer, where you can command EVERY unit with WASD (like in Cortex Command), but actually need a strategy (unlike in Cortex Command). If you are looking for a 2D combat sandbox, try King Arthur's Gold (Multiplayer). I occasionally come back to Cortex Command to blow up some bodies, but only when I am (mentally) too exhausted to play games with higher demands in reaction and concentration\n\nIt's not bad at all, and some will certainly have fun with the game, but there is just no reason to play it unless you are extremely bored  and have too much money.","June 28, 2015","false","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've always been fascinated in the intricate physics system, and how literally every single pixel has it's own properties outside of being purely visual.\n\nI feel like this isn't as appreciated as it should be, but really, the fact that Cortex Command has split screen local multiplayer is SO GREAT. Just as the intro screen says, just grab some buddies and controllers, and you've got yourself a mighty fine party game.\n\nWhile there are bits about it that are ridiculously unstable, there's always so much going on in any game that I can't help but to laugh whenever characters randomly explode into bits for absolutely no reason. With the modability of the game and the integration with Steam Workshop, there are some seriously fun gamemodes and  additions out there to work with to keep the game fresh, action packed, and at times... just... really weird.\n\n10 spontaneously combusting Coalition soldiers out of 10.","December 6, 2014","true","83.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some of the levels are broken, and sometimes your units will randomly die or explode. But is this a good fun game? Yes. This is basically a war sandbox, you can use a massive amount of various units, the battles range from epic to hilarious (When they work though), and using mods and the work shop makes this even waaaay more enjoyable. Even though it has alot of bugs, the developers are updating and patching this game still. Now is this game worth $20? In my opinion even though this game is alot of fun, It's not worth the full price. If you really are curious and have the extra cash, by all means check this out. But in my opinion, get this game when it's patched more or when it's on sale for $9.99 (like I did).","May 2, 2014","true","62.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Never before have I played a game where you can design a bunker, set up turrets inside, and call down troops from dropship, each soldier chosen and customely outfitted by YOU. The entire game is physics based. The walking, flying, climbing, and crawling, is done with your own characters 2 hands and 2 feet. Also, the plethora of mods, secenarios, and minigames make this game fun as hell even if you exhausted the vanilla game. Most of the major problems this game had before (Stupid AIs couldn't follow through with orders, Glitches, and movement errors) have been fixed. The new squad system has made the AI competent at organizing troops. You can create a squad to attack the enemy base, and turn around and focus protecting your own.  Just bringing down soldiers is awesome. Nothing is as beautiful as several dropships floating down from the sky, with AA missiles rising up to meet them. The game is just so versatile. Need to clear an enemy bunker? Send in masses of cheap robots, clones, or zombies, or send in a heavily armed squad of tough elite units, or fricking have crash test dummies go the long way around dig through the walls to eliminate their defenseless commander.\n\nThis game is special.

That one review that flashes by in his video is still relevant: "less than the sum of its parts", this means it is an AWESOME game... in theory... lol. So what the game should be is so unique and fun, but it needs more than polishing, still. The AI is still buggy, if thats what it is, specifically: when I was building my own base i noticed the AI getting stuck in a spot that was obviously a glitch, whatever mechanic that may be. The only other complaint I have is this game needs a better tutorial. The tutorial gave me an idea of how to play, but when I started a campain, I was completley lost. Still, with all that, this is an extremely unique game and I will still recomend it in the hope that it will be patched up.","April 28, 2014","true","18.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aceunknown/recommended/209670/","aceunknown","aceunknown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aceunknown/","128 products in account","Back in my young college days there was a downloaded version of this game going around amongst my friends (I really wanted to buy it but couldn't spare even the small amount of money required). At the time it was an unfinished sandbox where you basically downloaded mods and shoot crazy guns and stuff at terrible AI that practically just stood there.\n\nNow there's actually a game here. The campaign consists of taking and defending territories while competing with up to 3 othere AI players. You pick a place and if anyone challenges you for it you fight for it. Once you take it you can either design your own base within it, or pick a budget and let the game build one for you.\n\nI found designing things to be a little unfriendly because i wasn't sure what everything was, and it can take a lot of time depending on how crazy you want to get. Considering that at the moment the campaign doesn't usually last a long time depending on how good you are and the settings you choose I didn't feel compelled to do it. Additionally you'll be taking over several bases over the course of the game and it would be insane to manually build each one unless you were really quick. However, the autobuilding feature of the game tends to build some pretty decent looking bases. The problem is that each day you give the computer a budget for your base and then it decides how to spend the money and in what order. This means over time the base will get better but at the beginning you might have a pretty incomplete base. When you get attacked and you have an incomplete base, it can be nearly impossible to protect.\n\nThe actual battles are where the game shines. You start with a brainbot or if you have a base he might just be a brain in a jar. He's basically your commander and if his fragile brain jar gets destroyed then its game over. I usually send him down to dig for gold while i let my other units guard him.\n\nThis game is a physics based game where each pixel acually has its own properties. Units are actually made up of connected parts that move and interact based on their physics. This means that every part of a character can be blown off and every spec of dirt or other material has its own properties that can be deformed. Bullets go through softer objects and ricochet off harder ones. Rockets all have their own forces and when they explode they shred into pieces that can effect characters around the environment.\n\nThis game is run by gold and every unit is bought and dropped into your scene through the buy menu that will let you customize the unit and what it's carrying. generally they all have jetpacks, and weight matters so you dont want to bog a guy down too much otherwise he'll get stuck a lot and won't be able to jetpack too high.\n\nOnce a unit is called down you can take control of him and use his arsenal to take out other units and hopefully their brain. This is the part thats both amazingly fun, hilarious, and sometimes frustrating. The AI has gotten pretty smart at navigating around the levels and everyone is so fragile it can get pretty difficult, but in a good way. Especially when you're outnumbered and units are getting close to your brain. Having to fend off guys while simultaneously trying to buy and call down more units can be really tense. Especially because you're always working within a changing budget. Juggling shooting things, buying things, and budgetting can be pretty crazy at times.\n\nBut the real craziness comes from the Cortex Command moments you'll experience. Blowing up dropships and having them rollover and land on top of the guys they just dropped off, then exploding is always awesome. Jetpacking out of control and then smashing into 3 enemy NPCs and watching everyone explode is hilarious. Sniping a guy from long range and watching his parts just fly off is super satifying, and if you get your hands on a rocket launcher, you're in for some serious entertainment. These moments almost never get old, and will keep you playing this game for hours on end. Even when you totally fail the simplest task and all these things happen to you, its still hilarious.\n\nAnd when you get bored? There are a bunch of great secenarios and community made mods on the steam workshop that will keep the game fresh. weegee's unmapped lands 2 mod is a really great conversion of the campaign and probably more fun than the vanilla game itself. He even has his own interpretation of FTL in the CC world that's worth checking out.\n\nI'll be honest, this game has a bit of a learning curve. In the current state I'm reviewing this game it's unfinished. The developer has admitted that all the features are in the game, they just arent polished, and thats true. There is a tutorial that does an okay job of teaching you the basics of combat and mining gold, but as far as the campaign part of the game goes, there's basically no guidance at all. The community has made up for this though.\n\nIn it's current state it's a game you can sit down and play for 15mins or 5 hours. However, you can really see the potential of the game, and it can really only get better from here on out. It's a great game to add to your collection, play until your burnt out, forget about it for a year or two, and then play it until your burnt out again. It's that solid and that evergreen. You'll never get tired of blowing things up.\n\nLike the developer says in the video on the Store page. This game reviewed several years ago by alot of major sites in was was obviously an unfinished state. I'm not sure of the specific circumstances behind that, but this isnt the same game it was then. I'd argue it wasn't even a game then. Now it is, but still unfinished.\n\nThe message here is, don't believe the major reviews or metacritic score. Read the reviews on steam. Everyone is recommending it, just like myself.\n\n\n\n","April 24, 2014","true","17.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Figure it out guys.\n-Get some procedural generation code in there for the maps. Right now you tend to play on the same maps.

The 2D sprites with physics on each individual bit of pixel and sprite debris, the fully destructible environment, the jumping control between bodies, the building bunkers and fortifications to hold back the onslaught, or the calling in wave after wave of reinforcements to raid and destroy the AI's brain are all great fun by themselves.

If you like the idea of this game, I would highly advise it, no matter what the other reveiws say, as personally I've found the bugs that do pop up to be forgettable ,and the core gamepaly to be fantastic.\nPROS\n-First of my favourite part of this game- local coop- This gmae allows up to four human palyers, with xbox controllers, in nearly ever mission, and can also have a A.I team in there. The primary reason I got this game, and kept it, was for this features flawless implementation.\n-Huge selection of items- During the game, at any stage you can order a selected type of dropship to deploy units, tools or airstrikes. There are several factions, dozens of varied actors, and probably hundreds of bombs, guns and tools. Also, at the begining of some missions, you have acsess to the entire libary of content to build a customized bunker, that can stretch the entire map. The actors can be customized with every weapon of the game, but overloading them will slow them down, so you have to find the right balance. If the current selection of items is still to small for you, then there is the\n-Mods- You can fight space nazis with space marines. Enough said.\n-Gamplay- I'm not denying this game has some issues that need fixed, but this game palys flawlessly in most cases. some movment looks unnatural sure, but at the end of the day, this  gmae is a working mix of world map campaign, squad based , terraria like mining, base building,destuctible enviroment multiplayer shooter. AS much as I love it,, these features also make it a potential\nCON(S)\n-Complexity- AS some of my friends who are used to simple shooters like COD said, thsi game is a little complex. Although I think the dozens of diffrent gamepaly elements are as streamlinned as possible, the game still takes a bit of gettign used to. Which brigns me to the second con..\n-learning curve- Im going to be honest, the tutorial is a bit lacking in its current state, qit hzero info on how to use the campaign menu. However, after lookign up some internet guides, the games secrets reveal themselves quickly.\n-Clipping issues- As a game with fully destructible enviroments, actors trying to get out of the palyer build catacombs some times get indefinatly stuck on on peices of terrain, but this can be fixed with a quick zap of a digger.\nOverall, this game is deffeinatly worth getting, esscpecialy since the developer has stated that they have not left this game.","April 18, 2014","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Every single speck of land is simulated, and all the units are walking ragdolls. Which I would imagine make it very difficult for the AI to handle.

I've always been fascinated in the intricate physics system, and how literally every single pixel has it's own properties outside of being purely visual.\n\nI feel like this isn't as appreciated as it should be, but really, the fact that Cortex Command has split screen local multiplayer is SO GREAT. Just as the intro screen says, just grab some buddies and controllers, and you've got yourself a mighty fine party game.\n\nWhile there are bits about it that are ridiculously unstable, there's always so much going on in any game that I can't help but to laugh whenever characters randomly explode into bits for absolutely no reason. With the modability of the game and the integration with Steam Workshop, there are some seriously fun gamemodes and  additions out there to work with to keep the game fresh, action packed, and at times... just... really weird.\n\n10 spontaneously combusting Coalition soldiers out of 10.","December 6, 2014","true","83.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't really know what I mean by that... There's just a few things I'd like to do that I can't. Example, playing in a base between campaign battles. It would be nice to have a chance to dig out some debris and damage between battles, because you can only do that when under attack, and as a result of all the bodies I leave in my wake, doors end up getting broken. The base contruction could use more components as well. Some of the "odds and ends" have a left piece, but not a right piece, and vise versa. But that's just really knit-picky on my end.\n\nI love the concept, the plot, the art, the mechanics, the smoothness, the modding potential... There's so much that makes this game incredibly addictive. The Campaign is great. It has a board-game feel to it, like Risk. Triumphing against your enemies is really satisfying, especially when you come up with a clever stratagy (Tactical Skele-Brigade Strike FTW!).  The scenarios are great fun as well.\n\nI say this game is a great investment, and the devs should be proud of this work of art.","August 28, 2014","true","54.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Everything that was broken half a decade ago still seems to be broken now.\n\nThere are myriad new features though- completing the chip scavenge tutorial level causes the game to crash to the desktop. Mouse acceleration must be disabled everywhere to have even the remotest chance of controlling anything in-game. Much of the GUI seems lost off-screen.\n\nI was really, really hoping that this had come along some more, but I fear that we're being sold something that was functionally abandoned years ago. Fingers crossed, perhaps it'll be revived on Steam, and the true potential of this game might be seen. I suspect that Steam serves as a great carriage for flogging a dead horse, and for that price..?\n\n*IF* there is the slightest chance that this game could see completion one day, it's well worth supporting (though it could do with having its price halved).

I've watched the game evolve and take form and improve every feature. The first mod I've ever made for a video game, years ago, was for this game.\n\nYes it is a strange game and can feel sluggish or imprecise, but it is part of what makes the game so much fun to me. The environment can be as much of a threat as your enemies as each footstep digs slightly into the ground and every action terraforms the battlefield.\n\nThere is plenty of fun to be had in this game an I could not reccomend it enough. It has been one of my most favorite games since the day I bought it and still to this day, years later, It is one of those games I could never uninstall because I just never know the next time I want to boot it up for a quick mission, or to start a new full campaign.\nKilling is extremely satisfying. Dieing makes you really feel it, but is almost always hilarious.\n\nThere just isn't enough I can say about this game other than if you have any interest in it at all.

You can mold the enviroment using drills, bombs, bullets, or driving a rocket full of crabs into the enemy base.\n-The amount of mods that are availible for this game is kind of suprising, these can add many hours of content onto the base game. Steam workshop has been integrated with this game making mods much easier to access.\n-The game is easy to load up and play, and never really gets old.\n-The retro graphics are good, and are great when put with the engine.\n-Its all about player-defined choices, there is no pre-set strategies for you, you get to make your own. Personally this makes it very entertaining.\n-The game can run on older machines with a somewhat fast processor.\n+++++ Recently the Devs decided to pick up the game again! That means more updates :)!\n\nNegatives:\n-There is a problem with a lack of content, with mods this can be fixed, but the game itself is relatively small.\n-Paying 20$ for this game seems pretty spendy for game that is not fully "complete".\n-Some of the factions are quite OP, it would be nice if they were balanced a little better.\n-The game is not very user-friendly and does take a learning curve to understand it.\n-The AI can be stupid and clunky and points.\n\n\nThe Verdict:\nBuy this game, but wait, WAIT until it is on sale.

Don't think of this game as something to pass the time becase its so much more and im proud to see the game move forward and the mod update is super it just makes the game more fun if possible and as for if you want to buy this game i say its more than worth it and for all you strategy gamers its sure to take you for a spin because in cortex command you never know whats ganna happen.\n\nP.S. Hope this helps you look more into the game its worth it.\n\nP.P.S People who hate this game only played 2 hours worth and wont take the time to lern the option weel or the movement of the factions whats the point of playing game if you wont take the time to lern it first and yes it has bugs and not bad ones, one man made this, one man so stop hateing, minecraft was a one man game and it first came out lots of people hated it alot but he made updates at first took forever as it became more fun people joined in to help him make the game just like cortex command he is getting help now and has a work shop alredy! So i want you all to give him some time and im sure the game will bloom into a stuning game if you read all of this you are my hero :3.","July 6, 2014","true","403.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has always been a fun toy to play around with but has gotten a lot better recently. Gameplay is fast paced, entertaining and often leads to hilarious moments such as shooting a dropship down only for its engine to shoot off across the map and brain one of your actors.\n\nNow to be honest its a bit of tricky game to deal with sometimes. Controls are strange and not always very responsive. It can be very hard to get your actor to go exactly where you want to go. Shooting on the other hand feels good and has satisfying results.\n\nThe campaign is a bit of a mix bag. It is nice as a framework to play the individual matches but has some curious game design decisions. If a player doesn't get a base straight away they will usually get left behind permanently in the game. Building up the bases themselves can be tedious, impossible or completely hands off, depending. You can have the computer design the base for you at which point you will have to deal with a base layour you don't know. Or you can design the base yourself which can be fun the first few times but after the tenth base can get very tedious. And sometimes the last isn't possible because the fog of war wont have lifted on the map so you wouldn't be able to see where you are placing the base modules (Although this might have been fixed now).\n\nOne of the best things about this game though are the mods. This is a game that is very easy and fun to mod. It is quick and easy to come up with new guns and troops to make your own faction in the game. Not to mention the plathora of great factions and maps already out there.","June 23, 2014","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yeah, it is wonky at times but that's what makes this game so great. There's just so much stuff that can happen out of nowhere. For example when you order new equipment but all of a sudden an engine from the spaceship that's supposed to deliver your goods blows up, the whole thing starts spinning out of control and rolls over a bunch of attacking enemies. Love it.\n\nAlso there are dozens of game modes and also almost infinite playing styles. No matter how you want to reach your goal, you can do it, thanks to completely destructible terrain. And this is what makes the game so great, the destruction is just epic. Plus characters and vehicles are also fully destructible, piece by piece. Characters wear protective armor you can shoot off or try and aim for the fleshy head that explodes in a satisfying shower of blood. Vehicles also wear protective armor and if you aim well you can blow engines off of them so they spin out of control. That's the reason why I love this game. There's tons of details built into the satisfying destruction that this game offers.\n\nYeah, the performance is not the best when there's a lot going on on your screen. But even before the Steam version I have been playing Cortex Command for hours upon hours upon hours with friends and we had loads of fun with it.

Yeah, it is wonky at times but that's what makes this game so great. There's just so much stuff that can happen out of nowhere. For example when you order new equipment but all of a sudden an engine from the spaceship that's supposed to deliver your goods blows up, the whole thing starts spinning out of control and rolls over a bunch of attacking enemies. Love it.\n\nAlso there are dozens of game modes and also almost infinite playing styles. No matter how you want to reach your goal, you can do it, thanks to completely destructible terrain. And this is what makes the game so great, the destruction is just epic. Plus characters and vehicles are also fully destructible, piece by piece. Characters wear protective armor you can shoot off or try and aim for the fleshy head that explodes in a satisfying shower of blood. Vehicles also wear protective armor and if you aim well you can blow engines off of them so they spin out of control. That's the reason why I love this game. There's tons of details built into the satisfying destruction that this game offers.\n\nYeah, the performance is not the best when there's a lot going on on your screen. But even before the Steam version I have been playing Cortex Command for hours upon hours upon hours with friends and we had loads of fun with it. Definitely recommended!","July 28, 2015","true","25.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You then start the game and enemy ships start landing on the planet.\n\nThen ♥♥♥♥ gets crazy yo.\n\nYou are waiting for one of your dropships to bring in more troops since the last lot are currently blocking up the entrance to your base with their dead bodies when suddenly you hear an explosion, so you quickly zoom around the map looking for the source of the sound, and you see that one of your (barely functioning by this point) turrets has destroyed one of the engines of a dropship. You then watch as the dropship spirals out of control, smashes into the ground (and your turret) and explodes. What cargo was that dropship carrying? That's right. Mother♥♥♥♥ing mine bombs. Mines go everywhere. You then realize that your dropship has arrived. but it's too late, and everything explodes in an awesome tornado of dropship bits and body parts.\n\nThere's also local splitscreen multiplayer.\n\nWhy haven't you bought this game yet?","July 29, 2015","true","16.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But so what? I can literally spend hours on this game lag or no lag.\n\nI see people complaining about strategy?\nRamp the diffiulty up to nuts the enemy A.I. up to unfair and give about 10,000 funds and now you're gonna need some strategy. I've spent ages simply designing and redesigning bases to find the best way to stop myself getting destroyed by the enemy.\n\nThe only downside I can find in this game is the lack of multiplayer. If it was implemented my hours in this game would probably be much much higher. But unfortunately as far as I can gather due to the way the engine is multiplayer seems impossible. But if it is the last thing that the devs ever did for this game I would be so happy.\n\nSo,\nCortex Command. If you want to give your enemy a box filled with crabs as a gift well this is your game.\n\n\nAlso-\nThe mods are amazing for this game. 90% of them are to be found on the forums not on the workshop so make sure you go there too if you're looking for some.","July 11, 2015","true","42.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can blast enemies to beautiful bloody giblets with a multitude of weapons, drop bombs to destroy terrain (and soldiers) and when you're done bombing, accelerate your dropship to insane speeds and slam it into anything that's still moving, creating a deadly explosion of fire and shrapnel.\n\nIf I'm going to be perfectly honest, I have a few gripes with the game myself, but for how incredibly unique it is compared to every other shooter out there, and how fun it manages to be despite being so different, it deserves better than a 44 on metacritic.","July 12, 2015","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

That, and the very fun elements of the game that I have enjoyed have permitted me to enjoy what I got so far, and hope for more. The game is inventive and seems to be a great piece of work. The problems it has fall into three major categories.\n\n1) Streamlining.\nIts pretty self explanatory here, but when I'm trying to build bases or order soldiers / guns, it takes forever to navigate back and forth between the menus. You'll know how to get from place to place after one good attempt, but the actual act of manuevering is never easy.\n\n2) Polish.\nAI needs some work. The bots are at the same time both lethal to enemies and themselves. They're bad at following you,  but sometimes highly skilled at it. They can't hit anything for ♥♥♥♥, one half of the time, and they're Rambo the other half. Some refinement would be much appreciated.\n\n3) Glitches and Freezing.\nI played this game happily with both previous problems until I was no longer able to enjoy it because the game stopped working. It would freeze during loading for around 5 minutes, then load the menu, freeze for a few minutes loading a game, and then again during play. This is a problem for any game, especially ones that aren't finished, but it needs work.\n\nStill, after all of this, you should buy this game. Its hilarious and wonky, and sometimes a little unweildy, but its a great game and its worth your time and hard earned cash.","June 21, 2015","true","42.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Everything about it screams retro side scroller, however I was pleasantly suprized to see alot of interesting gameplay mechanics. It's part castle defense, part RTS, part contra style shootem up. If any of these things sound appealing to you this may just be your game: building the most inpenitrable base, sending waves of units to take out an enemy base, or Running around blowing limbs of scores of baddies, Resourse management and development, or sitting back and letting the computer do it for you.\n\nThe game is based in a very distant future where people's brains controll robotic legions to fight over resources. Everything about the game can be found in its opening cutscene (which might i add is freaken awsome) The core gameplay revolves around you Brain... both literally and virturally represented. The brain is either a moving robot or a static part of your defense that controlls all other actors and units. Its pretty simple kill the Brain, win the game. Initially when you occupy a planet at the same time as an opponet your brain will be air assaulted in with a few minor units ( In most cases a mobile sentry with anti arcraft rocket) From there you can call in additional units expending a gold resource that can be mined. Once a plannet is in your controll you can put your gold into building your dream base or have the computer do it for you. In the campain you set the number of factions and faction types along with the number of brains they have. Once all the brains are gone you win... or loose. Lets move on to the actors/units you can rain firery death with.\n\nThere are a few tarting factions in the game ( which can be expanded with player made mods) Each faction has a pool of troops (actors) weapons, tools, and aircraft to choose from. In the campaing by selecting a certain faction gives you a discount towards thier troops and gear, however you are not constrained to just that faction type. When your brain calls up troops you'll have a window that you may select the troops and thier eqipment. You start of with how they get thier, what troop type, and eqipment thier carrying. The initial equipment and weapons is expansive, with every weapon and tool verying greatly between eachother. A unit can hold many weapons and tools and freely switch between them on the fly, however if you load up on to much you cant fly... This brings me to another point. All your units are equiped with jet packs. This is both awesome and fustrationg as menuvering your flyboys and girls cand take some practice; and will most likely end up with your trooper splattered against a wall or something. Its almost like Tribes meets Contra.\n\nThe combat in this game can be pretty intertaining. All troops have body parts that can be blown off with well aimed shots; can make them beguin to bleed out or not. Another option is shooting the weapons out of enemies hands. The RTS aspect lets you select a groop of actors and set them on a patroll, Guard, Brain hunt mode, or designated points. You can also form a squad and have them move together and/or follow you. This is a pretty interesting aspect and gives the game some depth and versitility. If you feel like being rambo you can,  want to dropp in with an expensive hit team into the heart of the enemy defenses you can, or if You just want to send wave after wave of troops while you mine for gold Terraria style to fund it YOU CAN!\n\n\nThis is a very enjoyable game and has many interesting elements not utilized by other games. It is however not without its faults. The AI can be less desirable at times, as in getting stuck or just flat out non responsive. The game has a tendency to crash when overloaded with actors in the campain feature. The campain is very easy even on hard difficulty and there are many ways of rigging your planet to be niegh impenitrable. It would be a great improvement if you could choose to drop a couple bombs on key locations before your very vulnerable brain drops from the heavens just to get shot down my spammed rocket infantry.\n\nAll in all this is a great indi game and well worth a few bucks just to experience an outside the box game. It didnt have the backing of a AAA design team, yet still happens to pack some oomph.","April 24, 2015","true","84.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is because the developer has a great game on his hands here but he does not update frequently (its been in development for 11 years) and bugs and crashes run rampant.\n\nIt is unpolished and by far perfect but you will get some good laughs and carnage out of it.\nI recomend buy it on sale. For $20 is not bad (as long as he continues to update) but not knowing the future i would pay like $10 maybe $15\n\nAnd let me just remind you I DO KNOW THIS IS EARLY ACCESS, i know thta has been a complaint thta people tohught it was all finished but it was cleared up that it is not and this review is for its early access, build 31 state.\n\nPros:\n-Funny\n-Gorey\n-Mayhem\n-Nice 2d pixels and animations\n-4 player splitscreen\n-MODDING COMMUNITY!! (would only get maybe a couple hours out of it wihtout the mods)\n\nCons:\n-Performance\n-Crashes, Bugs, etc.\n-Few  updates. Last one came about a month ago, but a year after the one before it...\n-In general unpolished (Ex: walking sucks, terrain doesnt always get dug up properly, little stuff like that)\n\nThese cons can easily be fixed so if they do i will delete all of them and give a purely positive review on the game, because thats all there will be left to say.\n\nPLEASE FIX PERFORMANCE!

I've had this game since the latest update 31 came out, and haven't really had any of the problems I've noticed others have had, I'm not gonna name them cuz I am lazy. The gameplay is probably the most open and captivating that I have seen in a game to date, and offers a lot of possibilities and methods of victory. This is aided by the fact that the terrain is destructible, buildings and other fortifications feel "concrete" and wear away over the battle as does the battle field, covered in blood and machine and vehicle parts, and the gameplay mechanic of orbital delivery adds a sense of urgency/excitment to offensive attacks and defensive counter attacks. That said, the gameplay mechanics build up the game, and make it worth playing, now thats not to say that more couldn't hurt, like day and night cycles with the darkness of night adding stealth mechanics and sneak attacks, perhaps a custom weapon maker, firing crabs out of a gun, or maybe water, underwater bases, water traps, water water... these of course aren't necessary but they would add a bunch to the game, and the need for updates is also a concern for me, but hey, if they are on hiatus then so be it.\n\nAs for its gameplay mechanics such as controlling mass amounts of units and stuff like that it is probably the most innovative I've ever played before, I can be very fun with friends or solo, and once you get used to how the little guys play you'll be setting up sqauds, fortifying your base, hunting for brains, and blowing things up in no time. As for play and replayability, it truly depends on what kind of  system specs you have, if you have a lot of ram opened up, then it should run fairly smoothly, just dont get mods that'll crash the game, and for replayability, if you download some scenarios it can be very worth it, all in all, its a good game with a couple rough edges like not enough maps or slow moving guys but the positives out weigh the negatives from my experiance, so I'd reccomend it.\n\nThanks for reading this far :p","July 21, 2015","true","80.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You control individual soldiers one at a time as you move them around the battle field in hopes of protecting your "Brain" and destroying the enemy's. Mine for gold to purchase an air drop of more troops, or hijack the dropship and fly it into your enemies to cause lots of destruction.\n\nNot the most polished game, but lots of chaotic fun to be had.

If you don't have a gaming PC. You're computer will literally suffer and have terrible peformance at it. Its basicly only for people who have computers that are ment for gaming. Also, not only that problem. This is very common though, the AI is the worst in the game, they literally suck. They literally don't think at all. Like, what if your fort is guarded, instead of going to the entrance, they will attempt to make a tunnel leading to you're brain but there are lines supporting you're structures that are almost impossible to break, sometimes. The AI acts intelligent. But, they get stuck in holes commonly. They have poor accuracy. They literally don't think where to go and the best place to kill or ambush there enemies. They instead go to the worst place and get themselves killed easily, making the game have no challenge at all. Not only the enemy AI sucks, but the friendly AI sucks as well. They have poor accuracy, they do the same exact thing. When they have a rocket launcher. They try destroying dropships with it but miss, causing enemy drop ships to drop a fudge-load of enemys and out numbering you're soldier. I hope they fix this, the campaign feature sucks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowforks/recommended/209670/","shadowforks","ShadowForks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowforks/","291 products in account","A video of this review can be found here.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tpkUFlHpzo\n\nI’ve poured in almost 70 hours into Cortex Command with no end in sight.  This may perplex you as Cortex Command was released in 2012 with… mostly negative reception.  However, the developers did not give up this project and have justified the 20 dollar price tag.  I’m usually not one to become obsessed with complicated games, but this game that has consumed me and make hours pass by like minutes.\n\n\nThe story is a great backdrop for a sci-fi sandbox game, and set up the great motives for why you’re doing what you’re and that makes it good. When Earth ends, Cortex Command’s story begins.  Earth had become a viciously dark place, and the only choice the human race had was to leave.  From our evolution we cast aside our insignificant bodies as our brains alone, were capable to control multiple bodies in tandem.  This made it effortless to leave earth as we were literally just brains that could be transported easily.  When reaching the deep edges of space, we as a species learned that we were not alone as well as not important.  After some growing pains, we all adjusted to the alien life.  However, resources were depleting quickly and species started looking towards other systems which will hold the setpiece for a lawless, wild west type gold rush.\n\nThe artstyle of Cortex Command is similar to sidescrolling 2D indie games like Terraria, but it leans more on its physics engine to be pleasing on its technical side. The pixel art blossoms, and the physics are heavy and satisfying.  Robots have a similar weight to the B.U.D. in Grow Home, mechs look like controlling hulking metal, and mining in the completely destructable environments beholds an ambitious animation proposition that is executed perfectly.The music is a magically airy chiptune selection.  It sets the atmosphere perfectly, and is a great background to the hundreds of hours you will spend plowing through the wasteland.\n\nHave you ever played StarCraft?  In a sense, Cortex Command is the same idea.  Two bases build themselves up as they slowly try to frame their offensive attack to take out the other player. Instead of controlling multiple units at once, you simultaneously control and give commands to singular units one after another with the flick of a button. You land on a planet and build your base to defend your brain, the juggling and resource management is satisfying and immensely rewarding as you choose whether to attack or defend.  You can allot credits to have more possibilities as you mine for gold and build up your weapons.  Planetary scuffles can either swelter to a grand strike after multiple hours or a swift contest mere seconds into the match.  Jetpacks allow verticality and become weildly after a few hours with it’s amusing physics build. Keep a FAQ in hand however, as the games tutorials can be complicated and enigmatic.\n\nCortex Command is a Sandbox RTS game crafted by the folks at Data Realms, which is available for 19.99$ on Steam and Data Realms website. I purely suggest that you wait for a Steam sale and order multiple copies to gift to friends, as it’s very pleasant when playing with others.   Data Realm did not give up on their vision, and I applaud them for slowly improving Cortex Command into the game it is today.  Cortex Command is a game, that’s great for those who are looking for that new addicting game that stretches your dollar for hours upon each cent.\n\n","December 16, 2015","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you get this game, get the mods. (Some will crash or conflict with each other. Early 2000's am I right?) Just make sure they are for the right build. Too many mods will also make the start up time take several minutes.\n\nI have never had so much fun getting mods than with this game. Really cool stuff. Most of my time consisted of spawning tons of units, dropping bombs on them to gib. This was MY early 2D Garry's Mod. The combat was fun. I never really got too into the "Team Tactics" of the game as it was pretty broken, but I've heard since then they fixed it, and by fixed it, I mean they don't dig a hole by walking back and fourth over your brain before finally tunneling straight to it.\n\nEVERYTHING but the base pieces gib. Ships, units, guns, it all gibs. Huge selection of units, guns, anything really. Workshop makes the whole mod installation a lot easier. Digging is an option too, if you wanted to get to a base from below, you can get there. Low on gold? Just go mining.\n\nIt also lets you build your own base at the start of each round. You can choose from: modules, bits and pieces, doors, and your brain room. It was pretty good.\n\nThe graphics were a lovable detailed pixel style that had me at hello, The sprites, the ground, and the units were incredibly charming to me.\n\nIf you like destroying things, or are a big sandbox guy, I'd say this game is totally worth your buy.\n\nIt's got it's bugs but I can safely say it was worth my buy.\n\nMy total non-biased rating would finalize at an 8/10","June 2","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Basically the idea is that you conrol multiple units in real time to protect your base and destroy your enemy. There is a good variety of units and the terrain is fully destructible but many of the basic mechanics like movement can be buggy and frustrating. Though I'll admit the music is quite good.\nIf I had any confidence that this game would be updated in the future to fix some of these problems I might change my rating, but as it is the updates are few and far between. If this games sounds like something you might like, pick it up on sale, it's certainly not worth $20.","November 29, 2014","false","0.7"," 31 of 64 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","31","64","0","0"

The game is NOT worth 20$. The game has many options to build your base, one can potentially create a large labryninth of corridors and rooms with intricate turrets and defendable positions. This isn't a positive though, as the annoying mobility of the game renders complex bases too clumsy to traverse through. The controls are bad and the game does not take it into account. THere are about seven scenarios to play on, as the multiplayer function does not function. The economics of the game do not balance well with the game. One ALWAYS has enough money to just create the essential unit to win. You don't feel any difference between units or weapons (of course there are the obvious assualt rifles and shotguns, etc.). The game is really repetitive. In a few reviews of the game on Steam and on Youtube, there were mods in the workshop to fix all the above problems, however the only mods are extra factions, maps, or items. You can download all the mods you'd like, however, the vanilla game's loading times are already terrible, and are made significantly worse with mods.","September 1, 2015","false","1.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

Squad takes a bit of time to aim to an enemy, so they are pretty much a cannon fodder.\n-It gets laggy with a lot of units on one location.\n-There is no internet co-op (Though, it should be. This would save this game). Only local co-op.\n\nIf you are not okay with that, this game is probably not for you. But if it's fine by you, then don't waste your time and buy it. Sandbox world, build whatever you want, steam workshop for mods, tons of guns and everything is destroyble. What are you waiting for? BUT IT!

It is, without a doubt, not quite finished, and unfortunately it's likely it never will be.  The single player campaign is functional, but sparse, and a quick look at the scenario menu makes it obvious a dozen ideas and features never saw the light of day.\n\nNonetheless, the game shows its worth in the multiplayer.  It has fully functional splitscreen--a rare treat for a PC game--and it's in the gleeful chaos of a multiplayer scenario with a friend or two that the game becomes truly fun.  I've spent countless hours with friends building ridiculous, convoluted bases, defending them against hordes of enemies and whooping and gasping at every particularly visceral headshot or burning dropship obliterating everything in its path.  The physics are modeled exquisitely, every pixel destructable and every thrust of an engine or recoil of a rifle having a visible impact on the characters and surroundings.  In the thick of a survival scenario with troops and bombs raining down all over your bunker, drones dragging themselves around on broken legs, craters being blasted in the turf by overloaded rockets crash landing, and missiles and bullets whizzing in every direction while you scream at player 2 "Oh god there's like thirty guys on the left", it is wonderful, insane anarchy.\n\nThere are also a truly impressive number of mods available, so if you want to be Master Chief taking on an army of orcs with a tuba that shoots miniature suns, well, you can.  My recommendation is mod Cortex Command to the gills, invite your buddies over, get really drunk and scream incoherently as your base explodes around you.  You'll have a blast.","February 16, 2014","true","31.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Your bullets cut grass, make the dirt softer/break and makes concrete break with sustained fire.\n\nIt's also an epic-moment generator, where your rifle's been shot and broken, all you have left is a pistol and a frag grenade, and you combat roll off a cliff, throwing the grenade, landing on another guy's gun, making him drop it, pick up the dropped gun, shoot down the first guy and then the grenade explodes killing the last one, making the victory screen appear.\n\nYes, that situation was just another day in CC.

If you are successful in combat, holding the breach from waves of enemies, do not be surprised when the climb the mountain of corpses and attack from above, or mine below the surface, digging the ground from underneath you.\n\nWhat makes this game even better are the loads of mods found on the DATAREALMS.COM forums, adding factions and hilarious weapons to the gameplay.\n\nCatch it on sale and do not miss this.

Somehow Nod had been able to kill off the Imperium of Man relatively early, although a contributing factor to their defeat was their strange compulsion to defend the tactically useless desert where their heavy units simply fell into the sand and were unable to retaliate.\n\nPlaying as the United Aerospace Corporation I had the unique ability to deploy all troops and supplies to the field instantly through teleportation. This had worked in my favor until I found myself caught in between a firefight between Black Hand confessors and Combine Elites backed by several Hunters. The instant my forces were on the ground they were incinerated. My stubborness to admit defeat and simply wait for another opportunity to take the site got the best of me and my defenses were spread ridiculously thin. I had ended up taking the cliffsides but it was not even remotely worth the effort. I had an ample supply of brains to reclaim any territory that would be lost to the enemy, but no funds to supply them with backup and the ability to purchase new recruits. At the same time it was plain to see that with the Brotherhood of Nod sweeping across Combine territory and emerging victorious, they had no plans to halt their advance and give me time to save up the cash to produce an army powerful enough to turn the coming red tide. I had no choice but to perform an extremely stupid and desperate attack utilizing all the resources I had at that point against a single stronghold that Nod had dumped most of its cash in. If I could capture this territory I would kill off almost 50% of their units occupying the planet and also maybe gain the use of some Nod units as well.\n\nIt was not going well at first, but then I massed a large group of minigunners and rifleman together on a high ground overlooking their main fortress. It was crawling with infantry and surrounded by turrets, but due to the sheer number of rounds I was throwing at them everything above the surface was slowly obliterated by an advancing swarm of lead death.\n\nFinally I was able to send in a modest amount of men armed with shotguns, chainguns and plasma rifles. I was slowly pushing their troops deeper and deeper into a retreat, forcing them to fall further back to the depths of their fortress, bottlenecking them. I had them. My initial strike force was getting weak, so I ordered them to continue onward without my direct interference. I produced another marine, this time armed with a BFG9000 and sent him in to finish the job. My men had managed to corner their brain at the very bottom of the base, but they were missing most of their legs and arms and couldn't land a shot. Their death would not be in vain. I fired the BFG directly at their brain and one second before it reached its target the game crashed.\n\nWar is hell.","April 9","true","63.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auramancer1247/recommended/209670/","auramancer1247","Auramancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auramancer1247/","590 products in account","In the far future, humanity sets out into space.  No longer held back by their fleshy bodies, they transfer their brains into jars, and send out robot clones to fight for territory on newly discovered worlds.  You are one of those brains, and you arrive on a planet in order to harvest it for its plentiful gold.  But you are not the only one searching for riches here.  Welcome to Cortex Command, a side-scrolling real-time strategy game from Data Realms.  This was one of the first games to try the “Early Access” style of development, where the developers sell an unfinished game to the public and allow them to download any updates for free.  Notch has commented that Cortex Command’s strategy was an inspiration for Minecraft’s development, and everyone knows how well that turned out.  Now, Early Access is a major feature of Steam sales and started a huge shift in games development, where the users directly interact with the devs as they create the game.  Cortex Command started all that, so let’s see what came of it.\n\nIn each scenario of Cortex Command, you will build an underground bunker to house your delicate brain while simultaneously attacking your enemy to destroy his brain.  You will do this by ordering bodies, weapons, and tools from the store, which are then delivered by dropship from an orbiting space station.  Take control of the bodies to command them directly, or issue them orders to stand lookout, charge forward, or dig for gold to power your economy.  All this takes place in procedurally-generated 2D levels, which look quite gorgeous.  The environment is fully destructible, and the physics are quite complex for an indie project.  Limbs will go flying after a rocket explodes, leaving body parts on the ground intermixed with all the guns and equipment, for the rest of the game.  Flying shrapnel pieces can actually injure or kill your clones and robots.  Jetpacks are difficult to control but can fly your guys across the map in no time.  The controls are comfortable once you get used to them, and you will quickly become adept at managing your little army of expendable bodies.\n\nThat is the simple explanation of this game.  It goes so much deeper.  You can take control of the dropship and use its thrusters to kill enemies in a fiery blaze.  You can pick up enemies’ guns off the ground and use them yourself.  You can tunnel beneath the enemy base to get around their carefully constructed defenses.  The situations and strategies you can employ are almost endless.  The store is chock-full of different options, and it can be overwhelming when you try to figure out what combination of stuff to use.  And that’s part of the problem here.  There is a short tutorial that explains basic mechanics, but there is no real learning curve.  The game doesn’t give you a real chance to explore its options slowly.  You are given everything upfront, with no real direction on where to go.  And what’s more, if you do choose a loadout at random and receive a delivery of useless equipment, now you have no money.  You’ll have to restart the mission and try again.  Not the best learning experience.  There are a number of specialized scenarios, which challenge you to survive with just a single unit while a horde of enemies bears down on you, or to defend a large base against waves of well-armed enemies.  These are good fun, and serve as decent ways to test out different equipment, even if none of what is going on is explained to you.\n\nThe cartoony visuals are quite entertaining, as bodies will explode violently and parts go flying.  Each faction’s dudes and weapons behave quite differently, but are relatively easy to tell apart once you learn who they are.  Exploring enemy bases and fighting your way through the unknown is a treat.  Every weapon has unique physics and sound effects, making it a neat experience experimenting with a newly discovered weapon to see how it behaves.  The bright colors and loud explosions just make the battles a fun time.\n\nThere is a lot of depth in this game, which works both for and against it.  Either you will fall in love with the systems and want to devote dozens of hours to exploring how they work, or you will get frustrated at the lack of direction and quit.  The game has an interesting campaign mode that plays out as a sort of planetary Risk, with you and each enemy brain committing funds to different sites on the planet to explore, attack, or defend, and battles occur when you both go after the same site.  Whoever has the most money at the end of the game wins.  I would have really liked a story mode that slowly introduces the complexity to you, instead of pushing you off the deep end without any guidance.\n\nThere is a good game underneath all the complexity!  I just do not have the time it requires to really get the most out of it.  Lively cartoonish graphics combined with fun gameplay give you a decent diversion, but there are better games for short-term enjoyment.  If you are looking for a long-term single-game RTS to play for the next decade, then give Cortex Command a shot.  Encouraging news is that the game is still being updated today, and Data Realms are constantly tweaking balance issues and adding new features.  There is also a strong community dedicated to modding the game.  This is a game you can invest a lot of time into and not run out of things to do!","April 5","false","2.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's one of the earliest examples of why early access shouldn't be a thing. The game was hyped up like crazy the first few years it was available. It was hard to be on the internet in the late 00's without hearing about it. People were hyped for a strategy game that implemented complex 2D physics. However, as time went on, the creator slacked in developing the game and lashed out at people who had complaints like "hey, it's been a few years now..." or "why am I paying $30 for $10 at best worth of content?".\n\nOverall, it lead to the Cortex Command we have today. It doesn't quite work as a sandbox, and it doesn't quite work as a game, either. It's fun to screw around with for a bit, but honestly I wouldn't buy it for more than $5.","June 26, 2015","false","3.8"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","1"

On paper it has all sorts of coolness.  Base building, battling robots, a little platforming and a little mining.   RTS elements.  Lots of coolness.\n\nAlas... I can not reccomend this to anyone.  The robot controls are clumsy at best.  The campaign is some sort of unexplained turn based thing.  The AI players have no problem with their controls so they win a LOT of otherwise even battles.  But they also get confused by the terrain a lot.  And don't even get me started about how you need a magnifying glass to read any of the text that pops up.\n\nThere's a lot going on.  And a tutorial that tells you "use WASD keys to move, there's a radial menu, you can form squads, go get em'" essentially.  Getting to that point in a campaign is... confusing at best.  More tutorial info would hep a lot... if I could read any of it.\n\nLike I said, I REALLY want to like this.  But it feels like it aught to be an early access game.\n\nMy appologis to the devs but, I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this.\n\nThanks for listening.","February 23, 2015","false","1.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

And it NEVER explained the planet conquest thingy.\nI do enjoy playing a little but it bugs me how slow you walk and I personnally think that instead of specail delivery robots  you should be able to make a assembly unit.  if its going to be a resouce and time management things need to walk a hair faster and the buy/ deliver option is kinda goofy because you can just deliver them right out side the enemy base.\nIt makes more sence to have a assembly room or something.

Within seconds my excitement starts to falter, then fade.  I immediately realize that this game is only playable on a console or with a controller even though I selected mouse and keyboard controls.\nA few minutes later I find out that the controls are even worse then I imagined.  The same commands given over and over give different results. Pushing up and right to fire the jetpack will sometimes move you up and right, other times it will hover you in place, other times it will move you straight up.  The list goes on.  After playing for 10 minutes and accidently turning on the ai of the unit I was controlling so that it would just start doing whatever it wanted and override my commands I gave up.  With a heavy heart I still wasn't ready to give up.  So I pulled out my xbox 360 controller and set it up on my computer. After a few minutes I was good to go.  I started up the game switched the controls to joystick and tried again.  After loading up the tutorial I was met with being told to do things with [][]  with no buttons inside to let me know what to do.  So Knowing I was trying to select a bot I hit every button on the controller including pushing down the movement sticks, yet none of the buttons slected the bots.  So with all my dreams crushed and the inability to deal with the horrendous controls, I step back and write this review to warn others.\nI plan on coming back to the game next update and giving it another try, if things change I will update this review.\n","December 18, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

If some of the major issues get addressed, I'd be really excited to play, but at the moment I'm spending most of my time wanting to rip my hair out.  The idea of the game is REALLY cool, and yes, I had fun playing, but mostly it was an exercise in frustration.\n\nThese are the major issues that I encountered:\n\n1. Broken 360 controller support. Buttons work, but not the sticks.\n\n2. Godawful frame rate at any resolution.\n\n3. Screen resolution options are terrible with anything other than native screen res. Smaller resolution in a window is very tiny, and going full-screen doesn't actually fill the screen, it just makes the same size "window" in a full-screen. That means lots of black with a still-tiny game in the middle.\n\n4. Fonts - anything smaller than native resolution (1680x1050 in my case) is unreadable.\n\n5. The aiming system is very difficult. Sometimes I get an aiming "reticle" so I can see where I'm aiming across the screen, but other times (even with the same gun) it's not there, which means you can't tell where you're aiming except to carefully watch the bullets.\n\n6. The jet-packs - after 2 hours of play-time, I still can't get my soldiers around using the jet-packs. Most of the time, they seem to barely budge my soldier off the ground. If a soldier gets stuck down a mine-shaft (or whatever), it takes so much time to get them back out that the rest of my squad is usually wiped out. Consequently, I end up leaving many squad members in useless positions and buying more.","November 21, 2015","false","2.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Also, it has a steep difficulty curve, and while challenge is nice, the game has no sense of pacing, so right away you're screwed over.\n\nA little clarity: it's basically a mix between tower defense and platforming combat. I don't know how to describe it, but the only word I can't use is -good-. See, there's very little room for error, and the game unfortunately makes you mess up tons of times. When controlling basic characters you'l often find yourself flapping around because of poor controls, and your guy will be sent flying to a part of the map you don't want. Other times the jetpack will just die on you, leaving your character to die.  As far as engagements go, you fight guys on the ground with ranged weaponry, but you and them are made of paper, so you die almost instantly when one sees the other. Even the tutorial is unforgiving like this, and you'll die if you don't shoot him the second he comes on screen. So above all, I would avoid this game, even on sale, unless you're intothe type of game I described. I wish I didn't have to be so harsh, but there is one last thing that really bugs me: no single player that I'm aware of. You get to play multiplayer versus bots, and online if I recall, but Im not too much into those, and for 15 bucks I was kinda hoping for it.

Quite admirable in that respect. I'm not sure how many sandboxy options are actually afforded to you anymore, that was from much earlier in development, and I'm sorry to say that the actual game portion of the game, in spite of continued revamps, just isn't even remotely engaging on an actually-playing-the-game level. It's remarkable fun to watch ♥♥♥♥ get destroyed, particularly dropships, but actually attempting to control stuff and do battle is an impossibly obtuse and clunky process.

I love the concept that combines real time strategy, shooting, and finance management. However, everything feels poorly executed.\n\nYou move your units in the game using walking, which is painfully slow and a jetpack which has very little thrust and makes your character flop around like a piece of paper and get stuck on everything he touches, making it feel very awkward to move. Several times I've been powerless to defend my base because I couldn't move my units over a hill or wall to confront the enemy.\n\nThe shooting is pretty well done, and I really like how your units' parts can be destroyed, leaving him disarmed, without legs, or blown apart across a large distance.\n\nThe place where the game makes me feel most handicapped is when I am trying to order units. The menu UI works well enough, but selecting your units, their weapons, and the craft their delivered in takes too much time in the heat of battle, and there's no way to pause while doing it. Even when selecting preset units I feel much to slow, and usually you don't even get a chance to enforce your base with units before it gets attacked. So many times I've failed battles because I couldn't order units fast enough and was wiped off the planet by the AI without a fighting chance. Sometimes the unit delivery doesn't even work. For example, I ordered three preset units in a drop pod, the drop pod fell, broke through the ground and got stuck, and when it opened all my units' parts exploded out of it with their guns, the soldiers having been crushed to death.\n\nOverall the game feels very awkward and unfinished, but it can still be enjoyable. However, it is definitely not worth $20.","January 10, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Who cares if it's still buggy?  Can't you people enjoy a game?  The basics are totally there, and with mods and a bit of tweaking to find which mods work with certain other mods, you get countless hours of fun.  The campaign mode breaks easily, but the scenarios are crazy.  I once went up against a bunch of guys with diggers (they dig and are an extremely powerful melee weapon) and I hid in a vent, shooting at the hordes of the "undead" while they frantically dug away at the vent attempting to reach me.  Luckily I survived long enough, and the mission was over, but I had to make sure to not destroy the bodies of the enemies as that was what saved me, the fact that the bodies were blocking the way.\n\nHonestly, I'd rate this game 9/10 IGN, it's like a 7.5 real review.  In my opinion, Metacritic is just plain stupid and gave this game a 44/100, because "the game isn't ready so therefore it can't be fun".

The game itself isnt that bad, and if your looking for something to hold your attention for a little while you might be interested in it, especially with all the workshop mods. but even then it won't be too long before you get bored. Also no online multiplayer yet,just saying.","October 25, 2014","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With much more physics than most other games you'll see out there, and the highest level of modability I've ever seen.\n\nIt's difficult to say who will like this game or not. Honestly, it is. I know that I like it a lot. What I do know is that you might like this if you like: shooters, particle physics simulations, RTS, and blowing stuff up. The best way to figure out whether you should buy it is by watching gameplay videos so you know what it's all about beforehand.\n\nThere is a catch, though: the game is single-threaded, meaning you need to have a decent processor to play this game at a reasonable speed, so don't get this if your only computer is an old laptop.","July 5, 2014","true","299.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the concept that combines real time strategy, shooting, and finance management. However, everything feels poorly executed.\n\nYou move your units in the game using walking, which is painfully slow and a jetpack which has very little thrust and makes your character flop around like a piece of paper and get stuck on everything he touches, making it feel very awkward to move. Several times I've been powerless to defend my base because I couldn't move my units over a hill or wall to confront the enemy.\n\nThe shooting is pretty well done, and I really like how your units' parts can be destroyed, leaving him disarmed, without legs, or blown apart across a large distance.\n\nThe place where the game makes me feel most handicapped is when I am trying to order units. The menu UI works well enough, but selecting your units, their weapons, and the craft their delivered in takes too much time in the heat of battle, and there's no way to pause while doing it. Even when selecting preset units I feel much to slow, and usually you don't even get a chance to enforce your base with units before it gets attacked. So many times I've failed battles because I couldn't order units fast enough and was wiped off the planet by the AI without a fighting chance. Sometimes the unit delivery doesn't even work. For example, I ordered three preset units in a drop pod, the drop pod fell, broke through the ground and got stuck, and when it opened all my units' parts exploded out of it with their guns, the soldiers having been crushed to death.\n\nOverall the game feels very awkward and unfinished, but it can still be enjoyable. However, it is definitely not worth $20.","January 10, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this a few years ago and this still sits as one of my favorite games.\n\nThere is a fairly large learning curb, as I can't even compare the gameplay to any other games. The closet I can compare it to is that this is like Wurms turned real-time with an overdose of action, a massive hit of strategy, and under all of that is a tab of freedom.\n\nThere is a health bar, but most of the time it means nothing besides a bleedout timer as you can be instantly killed by a headshot or be crushed to death by your own dropship or rocket. You can shoot off legs and arms and sometimes it can even works towards your favor, but most of the time it doesnt as you hands to even hold a gun.\n\nDid your space rambo get both of his legs blown off and is rapidly bleeding to death? No worries, without those legs weighing you down you can jetpack much faster towards the enemies and then headbutt people to death as you fire your machinegun. But wait, as you move forward a stray piece of dropship debris hits you at 666km/h, killing you instantly. You are quickly overwhelmed by crash-test dummies with spacey nailguns and kills your disembodied brain because you spent all of that money on rambo and didnt bother investing in gold mining. All that is left is a fail message cycling through your screen.\n\ntl;dr Buy it.","October 8, 2015","true","72.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is amazing but it doesn't feel like a real game that has been released.  Even with that though, it is so much fun it is ridiculous.  It's physics based, a jetpack is physically on you and directs you from it's point, if you tilt your torso you fly sideways, not up. If your guy's leg gets blown off you hop, both legs you crawl. Arms and legs you sit there doing nothing. You drop a crate full of 2000 crabs(crabs are free to deploy but crates are not) from orbit onto a spaceship and it explodes like a shrapnel grenade and destroys half of the map and leaves crab limbs everywhere.

If you are the kind of person that gathers friends home to enjoy game match. This is made for you in most ways. You can have fun for quite a long time. If you are the sandbox play with your self kind of player - you can really toy with it a lot.\n\nWhy to pass:\nSingle-player barely exists. All single-player options boil down to skirmishes that you can do for a while, but do not have a goal, do not build up and are not presented gradually. Think of it as a worms armageddon without the campaign and with everything unlocked at start. All you can do is hotseat with friends or play quick matches vs the AI.\n\nValue for money? I like to own games that have a certain effort put into them, and this certainly has plenty of that. The good news is - it has huge potential to grow. Maybe one day its maker would finally learn to work with its strenghts, instead of adding more guns etc.\n\nAt the time of review I had 24 hours spent on it. 2 Hours spent being familliar with everything. 22 hours being my own entertainer until I moved on to something else.

I bought this a few years ago and this still sits as one of my favorite games.\n\nThere is a fairly large learning curb, as I can't even compare the gameplay to any other games. The closet I can compare it to is that this is like Wurms turned real-time with an overdose of action, a massive hit of strategy, and under all of that is a tab of freedom.\n\nThere is a health bar, but most of the time it means nothing besides a bleedout timer as you can be instantly killed by a headshot or be crushed to death by your own dropship or rocket. You can shoot off legs and arms and sometimes it can even works towards your favor, but most of the time it doesnt as you hands to even hold a gun.\n\nDid your space rambo get both of his legs blown off and is rapidly bleeding to death? No worries, without those legs weighing you down you can jetpack much faster towards the enemies and then headbutt people to death as you fire your machinegun. But wait, as you move forward a stray piece of dropship debris hits you at 666km/h, killing you instantly. You are quickly overwhelmed by crash-test dummies with spacey nailguns and kills your disembodied brain because you spent all of that money on rambo and didnt bother investing in gold mining. All that is left is a fail message cycling through your screen.\n\ntl;dr Buy it.","October 8, 2015","true","72.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those that make you want it? No? Well then.\nCortex Command, a pixel art game about doing the campaign or some one time missions, what makes it unique for me?\nDestruction and the ways you can deal them. The game offers many factions by default, but you can expand with the Steam Workshop. Star Wars? Why not. Some plain weird stuff? You name it. The game uses weight of guns and your soldier to determine "Will you fly or get stuck in the ground?" The combat is quite challenging and fun. The guns can get detroyed, ships get blow by rockets, and soldiers made into blood with A pulse digger. Bullets need time to hit the target, and rockets are slower and able to shoot off the sky. The maps itself aren't that big in wiidth, but is big in height, so much space for some space or mining action. Many modes to play, most likeable is probably Skirmish Defence aka. "Make yourself a base and protect your brain with all you have", just remember to get max money for the destruction :)\n\n\nWell, this review isn't much of an review, but the game is fun as hell.

And the only game I've ever played with a rocket-propelled chainsaw.\n\nUPDATE: It's been a long time since I posted this review and I'd like to say I'm quite disappointed that the developer still has not uploaded a Linux binary, even though there is a Linux build of this game and my Steam client claims one is available. Attempting to install this game on Linux results in the client downloading nothing and failing to launch the missing executable.\n\nTo be fair the store page doesn't claim this game supports Linux but once again there is a Linux build available through other sources.","October 11, 2012","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are the kind of person that gathers friends home to enjoy game match. This is made for you in most ways. You can have fun for quite a long time. If you are the sandbox play with your self kind of player - you can really toy with it a lot.\n\nWhy to pass:\nSingle-player barely exists. All single-player options boil down to skirmishes that you can do for a while, but do not have a goal, do not build up and are not presented gradually. Think of it as a worms armageddon without the campaign and with everything unlocked at start. All you can do is hotseat with friends or play quick matches vs the AI.\n\nValue for money? I like to own games that have a certain effort put into them, and this certainly has plenty of that. The good news is - it has huge potential to grow. Maybe one day its maker would finally learn to work with its strenghts, instead of adding more guns etc.\n\nAt the time of review I had 24 hours spent on it. 2 Hours spent being familliar with everything. 22 hours being my own entertainer until I moved on to something else.
