Heres my personal breakdown of the game.\n\nPROS:\n- The game does a fairly good job of creating a simple story with no real dialogue\n- The 2D sprites are rather nice, and everything looks pretty good\n- There is no filler to this game, no real padding. Everything that happens is there for a reason\n- Your actions can actually influence (albeit slightly) the outcome of the game\n- The fact that you grow as you gather powerups is a nice touch\n\nPRO/CON:\n- The flight mechinism takes a bit to get used to. If you try to 'flap' before you start the downward part of your arc in the air, you won't really get any height. I personally like this, because it makes you feel a bit more like you're actually controlling something thats flying rather then just a double-jump like most platformers. Still, some won't care for it, so I can't just list it as a 'pro'.\n- I will admit... the main reason I bought this is because I LOVE games where you can play as a dragon. Not only play as one, but play as one thats not EVIL.\n- While I admire the 2D sprites the hand drawn pictures are... meh. Certainly better then I can draw off hand but I feel that they could have been a bit more polished looking. They aren't poorly drawn or distracting but they're not fantastic either.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Although there are no fillers, the game is very short. It took me about an hour to beat from start to finish. This is honestly the only thing that I found disapointing.\n- It's not immeidatly obvious that you can effect the outcome of some situations. If it weren't for the fact there are achievments for it, I wouldn't have thought I could change anything.\n\n\nIts not a perfect game but I'm very satisfied with it. Its fun, charming, and I hope the developer makes more dragonic games in the future.","December 11, 2015","true","3.6"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","40","42","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lowen/recommended/399070/","Lowen","Lowen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lowen/","857 products in account","This is a fun, cute little platformer that I really enjoyed.\n\nWhat makes the game unique is you play a newly hatched dragon and can flap your wings to jump, glide and kind of fly. Getting around the levels using your limited flight is really tricky, but has a satisfying feeling once you get used to it. You also start with a bite attack and you gain the ability to breathe fire before long. The level design and scripting is very tight and tells a good story with strong characters you'll care about, without using any dialog.\n\nThat's not to say that the game is entirely prescripted. In fact there are a number of different ways the story can play out, and it's a logical consequence of how you acted while events were unfolding in in the game, rather than some dialog choice.\n\nThe story is also recapped by still pictures that display when loading the next level. The quality of the pictures are somewhat mixed. A lot of people say the 2D art is amateurish, which I kind of agree with, even though I don't immediately know what's wrong with them on a technical level. But I also thought the pictures had a charm to them, so I think the artists did something right that might have been lost with better art.\n\nThe game is very short. Maybe 2 hours for one play-through at most. I liked the game enough to play through it a second time to get the bad ending.\n(I got the good ending first because I'm awesome :-P )\nI also played a little bit more to get the 10 seconds of flight time achievement, which was the only one left for 100%. It was a very good 2-5 hours, so I'm not upset about the length.\n\nThe thing I think could be most improved is the difficulty of the final boss. It's a huge spike in overall difficulty. Simply providing one or two more save points for the final boss battle could make the battle easier and the overall game better.","February 2","true","6.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KoboldCoterie/recommended/399070/","KoboldCoterie","Kobold Foreign Relations Bureau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KoboldCoterie/","1187 products in account","Dragon's Wake is a game about a dragon and his reptillian buddies - ostensibly kobolds - trying to survive. As someone who likes both dragons and kobolds, perhaps more than could be considered healthy, it was a snap buy at the price point, and it was well worth the money.\n\nLet me get this out of the way: The game is very short - I'd estimate somewhere between 2 and 2.5 hours for a first playthrough and subsequent ones could likely cut that in half. The game has a little replayability (finish it, then go look at the achievements you missed, realize there might be a better ending, and go play it again), but overall I wouldn't expect to get more than 5ish hours of playtime out of this title. That said, it's $3.59, at full price. You can't go wrong.\n\nThe story is delivered through images on loading screens, which works well - there's no speech or text, and none is needed. There were a few weird inconsistencies between these images - the kobolds, for instance, seem to go back and forth between having tails and not a few times, which was a little off-putting, but it's a minor complaint.\n\nAs a platformer, it does a pretty decent job. The controls feel tight, though it could have stood to be a bit longer, and it could use a bit more enemy variety. There are only a couple bosses, and the difficulty ramps up considerably for the final encounter. To give some perspective, I didn't even come close to dying until the final fight, then died ~10 times before winning. Difficulty isn't a bad thing by any means, but it didn't feel like a ramp so much as running into a wall.\n\nI encountered no bugs, which is always nice.\n\nAll of that said, it's a game worth playing, especially if you like riding emotional roller coasters. If it was a $10+ game, I would have a difficult time recommending it, but at $3.59, I absolutely do.","December 11, 2015","true","2.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SageParadoX/recommended/399070/","SageParadoX","Emdoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SageParadoX/","420 products in account","I followed the development of this Dragons Wake up until its release and it lived up to my expectations.\n\nThe gameplay could be improved, the controls are clunky and hard to use, the visual feedback leaves much to be desired and the music, though decent in production quality, doesn't seem to fit the game.\n\nProgression through the game is based on you eating various animals that give you more health, flaps or fire-charge. Though cool to get, they are just animals in the world with not explanation around them. On top of that, rather than balancing the health, you just put them in at random places, giving a huge ramp to my health, without giving me a reason why.\n\nHell, I made it through most of the game without losing more than 1 health, despite having a tonne.\n\nOn the aspect of art, the game would have been a load better if you hired better artists. The loading screens were fan art quality and the quality of the pixel art was incredibly low in certain areas, though the quality of the occasional bush and shrub was through the roof in comparison.\n\n*SPOILERS AHEAD*\n\nThe game has two main bosses, a Goblin dude, who, to be completely honest, I didn't even realise was a boss.\n\nThe second boss, was the Knight. Disregarding that the game only took an hour or so to complete, the game ended incredibly suddenly, with possibly the most sudden change in difficulty curve I have seen in a game in awhile.\n\nPhase 1  is simple, easy enough to get past if you somehow miraculously pull off the button combo for slam 3 times in a row, otherwise, you lose a lot of your health in this phase straight away. I think the worst time I did it, I was left with 1 heart out of 10+.\n\nPhase 2  has you fall into a pit, followed by the crazy reveal that knight is actually an undead necromancer-like dude.\n\nIn this pit, you are greeted with a landscape that is completely different to the rest of the game, its quite literally, a giant hole in the ground. Your ability to fly and land on ledges to get to safety is completely taken away, removing the main aspect of the game.\n\nAs someone who has played my fair share of MMOs, I am no stranger to multiphase fights, hard mechanics and heavy hitting bosses, but the fight itself is incredibly unfair with next to no telegraphing of attacks. Sometimes he shoots 2 arrows, sometimes he shoots 7 or even 8 in quick succession. He summons ghosts in random numbers too, which appear in random places and charge at you (recycling the most annoying enemy in the game). He also uses another attack, which looks like it should be a pushback, (which I feel would have made more sense and made him more fun to fight) but its just another damaging move. Hes also really quick, which doesnt help as your attacks are all ranged, meaning that if he gets in close, you lose a lot of health\n\nNot only does the boss have a health bar you have to deplete, but after you deplete his health bar, he changes into Phase 3 without a warning or refilling of the health bar, but instead, you have to deplete the frame for the health bar instead.\n\nThe first time I got to this point, I thought that I beat him due to no obvious feedback that anything of note was happening, then was killed, making me start the fight completely from scratch.\n\nI found this boss, as the final boss of the game, more of an annoyance than anything.\n\nBut here is a tip, if you make a game like this again? If you want to make bosses this difficult, scatter them through the game! If all bosses in your game were this hard, I would've expected a hard fight and would have been super keen, because having difficult bosses and KNOWING that you will be fighting difficult bosses, creates a huge sense of accomplishment every time you beat one.\n\nI feel that randomness has no place to the extent that you used in boss fights, boss fights are supposed to be about learning mechanics and being able to avoid them.","January 5","false","0.2"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

In the meantime, it created a series of relatively new control scheme for the indie platforming genre.\n\nThe controls are admittedly terrible on the keyboard, but all of that gets fixed pretty quickly if you plug in a controller. With a controller, the rather unusual controls are actually quite fun and satisfying.\n\nWhile the graphics could use some tightening up, the music and sound effects worked well to give you that sense of adventure.\n\nDragon's Wake aslo does a really good job of telling a heartfelt story without the use of a real verbal or written narrative. Everything in the story is shown to you through action and choice, which makes you feel more invested in it.\n\nProbably the biggest drawback is that this game is extremely short. There is a good ending and a bad ending which helps  expand Dragon Wake's lifespan, but it still takes no more that a few hours to finish twice. If you're looking for a game to experience for an evening, then this game is fine, but if you're looking for something to fill out your weekend, then this may not be the right choice.\n\nOverall, I did end up enjoying this game.

The game is also able to convey emotions without walls of text telling you how to feel which is always a plus in my opinion. The only complaint I have is that the final boss feels a little too difficult, but that isn't a huge deal in the grand scheme as the rest of the game was so good. Many would say that the artwork is "amatureish", but personally? I actually liked it, since it gave the game charm and some personallity, so if you enjoy 2D platformers, dragons and going on a small but enjoyable adventre, I recommend picking this game up. <3","February 10","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This does not effect my review.Dragon's Wake is a 2D Adventure Platformer where a fledgling dragon hatches into a world in which the extermination of dragons at the hands of a mysterious black knight is already underway.\n\nCommentsThe most unique thing about this game is the ability to eat almost anything in your path. As you eat certain “special” creatures, you gain power-ups (fire breathing, and ability to fly more) and grow larger (which gives you the ability to stomp and destroy rocks). Also, as you eat enemies, you regain health.\n\nStory is a very interesting one: it is told by illustrations, gameplay, and music rather than voice narration. Took me around 2 hours to complete (and I got 17 of the 24 achievements on my first play through). Would definitely recommend.\n\nPlatforming can be very frustrating. You use wing “charges” that you can collect from certain monsters to fly between platforms. You start out with only 1 or 2, and can get to 6 or more jumps.\n\nLinear story, however, your actions can somewhat effect the final outcome of the game. Very short, but makes up for it with charm.\n\nDifficulty: relatively simple. Fans of platformers will not find this overly challenging, but will notice how frustrating it can be.\n\nArt style: 2D- sprites are very cute. Lighting is well done, environment is oozing with charisma. The cut scenes are hand drawn.\n\nControls: default arrow keys for movement, space to fly, c to eat things, and x to shoot fire. Controls are definitely tight, but not too difficult to learn.\n\nLast boss is extremely rage inducing; you will die over, and over, and over, and… well you get the picture. Once you figure out his movement patterns, it becomes easier to defeat him. Also, make sure to look for hints how to defeat him.\n\nContent: For a single walkthrough, only around 2 hours. Short, but the cost makes up for it. Little replayability.\nFinal overviewFor a platformer game, this one certainly has an emotional story and attractive visuals. Short, but sweet. For $4, I really recommend picking up this game and trying it out. Try and get all the achievements while you’re at it, they are fun and easy to collect.\n\nVerdict: 7/10\nReview done for Vantom Giveaways.\nRead the review on our {LINK REMOVED}website.\n\nSteam Key provided by the developer","December 16, 2015","true","5.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's one that by the screenshots I would just pass over, but reading the reviews with people saying how indepth it is and how all your choices affect the rest of the game.\nGoing through it you quickly find the jumping/flying is very hard to learn to control. I often found double jumping wouldn't work as expected and lift you higher. If you try to go to edges you get pushed back, and trying to jump vertically through small gaps is extremely difficult. When you don't have fire as a weapon you'll often find certain enemies will hurt you at the same time as hurting them (with the bite attack).\nThe most annoying moment being the end (at least I assume it was the end). The boss is practically impossible - he can stun lock you with sword hits during the first part and often the dive attack wouldn't work when pressing for it so you just keep getting hit while trying to get the dive to work. Once you get to the second part you have a 2 health pickups but you can't get close to the boss to bite, you get hurt too much to stand still and "flamethrower" the boss, leaving pretty much only the fireball shooting attack but even with that you often get hurt at least once while trying to fire them off. I always found on the rare occassion I past that part I'd only have about 2 hits left only to find there's a third part where the boss can pretty fly with you at the same speed. It was just impossible.\nGenerally the controls haven't been tightened up and it's completely imbalanced. Unless a lot of changes are made, I would not recommend this game.","December 16, 2015","false","2.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

It doesn't help that the trailer sells it as a more open game than the linear "you get like few choices that barely affect the end screen of the game" type of game that it is. It's not bad, but it's not very good either. I experienced a fair number of glitches playing through this, which given the level of complexity of the game is... not great. Game has a mild difficulty spike half way through, then a massive one at the end boss. I was probably only able to beat it inside an hour on the good end run because of one of those glitches making the end boss not able to hit me. Several enemies have designs that on paper are pretty cool, but in the level design present are annoying as ****. Flying is admittedly cool in that it's not just a double jump thing, but its also a bit wonky to try and master, and the game expects you to pretty quickly with some of the platforming.\n\nI don't have a problem with short games if they are fun, but this game is a fairly lukewarm title at best, just above the quality of a flash game, and it costs $4 for an hour of that. Even if you replay for different endings it shouldn't take more than 2 hours, maybe a total of an hour and a half if you're good and not trying to get all the acheivements. To be blunt, for that price I could have rented a movie that I would have enjoyed more than this, and it could have even lasted longer with some. Even more bluntly, I could have played flash games from 2005-2010 era that would last as long and be much more entertaining for free. I don't have a problem paying for quality entertainment, nor short games, and I think that asking for this to be free would be cruel and unfair, but honestly after playing it, it felt like it was worth 2 dollars to me. So if it's on sale for that price and you want something dragony, you could do worse, but otherwise I'd probably avoid it.","February 5","false","3.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The story as far as I know is there is a black knight who wipes our the dragons and it's your job to hatch, grow up and fight the black knight. Well, an hour into the game I was given what I assume it the boss fight. This is the second boss fight, I've only had one dragon friend in my brood(though the screenshots show having more) and he gets killed RIGHT before this fight happens. The fight itself is EXCRUCIATINGLY difficult. I'm talking a HUGE jump in difficulty compared to the rest of the game.\nThe first part of the fight is so small and cramped that more often then not you'll get locked into a corner and get killed, and since the flight mechanics aren't great you often miss the rocks you have to smash or don't trigger the smash at all. The second part of the fight only offers you two goblins (worth two hearts each) for food, but you're going to lose easily two hearts if the enemy gets close and will often find stopping to eat these guys puts you in more danger. You can't melee fight this guy because his sword attacks hit ridiculously fast, he jumps around just as fast as you do, summons random ghosts (literally random spawning, I had one spawn IN me during the fight) that have a very far flight path that you have to dodge, he has an AOE that has a very large range and fires arrows at you. The only tactic I had to fight this guy was run at him and chomp away while he summoned ghosts.\nTHEN, after taking him down to NO health, he turns to a ghost and flies around JUST AS FAST as you and non-stop melee's. I assume it's a 'survive long enough to espace' kind of deal, but it's a small arena with barely any room to stop and recharge your flight long enough to keep away from him.\nThis could have been a really cute adorable game if it were longer, had at least one or two more companions and boss fights that let you bring those companions in to the fight. I mean, the trailer even said I'd need to protect my dragons but I didn't even get the chance to. Directly after he ran off to get his fire breathe, we went into the boss fight.","December 17, 2015","false","1.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's a really simple platformer and while the concept is cute, the execution leaves a lot to bedesired.\n\nConsider this: There is an achievement (mommy) that is literally achieved simply for getting to somewhere near the end of the first level (less than 5 minutes of gameplay).\n\nAccording to world wide stats, less than half the people who own the game have actually achieved this simple goal (of playing for a few minutes). The other achievements are completed by even less people (less than a third have begun the second level, which is about 1 minute past the first achievement, just for showing up there)\n\nWhat does that tell you? Most of the people who own the game don't bother getting past the first few minutes of gameplay without realizing how bad the controls are and giving up.\n\nWhere does the 88% positive reviews come from? I don't know.\n\nIf you like old school graphics, routine platformers and don't mind bad controls. This might be the game for you.\n\nOn the positive side, you can get this on sale pretty frequently. I think it cost me about 25 cents with a coupon so I almost feel guilty for complaining. But what this game really reminds me of is some of the bad arcade games of the 1980's. The kind you put a quarter in once and never play again. (don't get me wrong, there's plenty of old school arcade games worth dumping lots of quarters into, this just isn't one of them)\n\nI paid 25 cents, I feel bad complaining about it. But I litterally just spent 5 mintues being frustrated by the bad controls and felt like complaining at someone over it, because there is little else to do in the game but jump and walk, and the game is bad at both.\n\nHad the controls been nice and tight, this would have been a cute game about jumping around as a baby dragon.\n\n","April 13","false","0.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

THANK YOU FOR ACTUALLY MAKING A GAME LIKE THIS! There is not enough of them out there. I am getting tired of games like that or a game where you can be a dragon to some extent for a part of the game and its locked behind an energy bar that is limited or only can be one in certain areas (Divinity II and Shyvana in League of Legends are examples).\n\n\nThe struggle throughout Dragon's Wake could be felt, and going through the "bad/dark" ending sequence had my heart strings rather torn and I was sad to see many of the tragedies that did happen throughout. It made fighting the final boss rather epic as the only way to stop such destruction of innocent lives was to end that dark knight. Even after he was defeated, you could feel the emptiness each of the characters felt for losing their loved ones (each artwork depicted all that emotion rather well. Kudos to the artist!)\n\n\n\nThe only two criticisms I can offer is the jumping in the game is rather "clunky". Not so much what it looks like or how it handles, but rather you have little to no control while mid air which makes precision rather difficult and frustrating. I spent a lot of this game trying to jump properly. If there was more control for mid-air gliding that would be fantastic.\nThe other is please allow a manual save and allow disabling of auto-saving features. There are times where I am trying to achieve certain results for an achievement but can't go back unless I redo the ENTIRE content beforehand.\n\nI would totally love to see/make addons to this game for extra content (or another game in general!).

As others have stated, the controls are somewhat difficult, but I found upon a second playthrough that it was a lot easier after some practice. Playtime was just under 2 hours for me on the first run, but with the multiple routes, I was looking forward to trying out more. Short and sweet. I kind of wish there was something to do at the ending, or maybe a tiny bit more of an epilogue to make it feel more rewarding, but it's based on a set and linear storyline, so eh.\n\nMy two complaints are similar to that of another review: food placement and the final boss. Potential spoilers from here on.\n\nIt's mainly the skeleton dungeons that have food troubles. It's a quick rise in difficulty from the rest of the game, as everywhere else you're given loads of food to keep your health up, and the enemies here (mostly the ghost skeletons for me) are harder to evade. Even in the mass goblin/kobold/orange people battle, their bodies made it easy to survive the whole thing. Whereas, in the dungeons... yeah, let's just say I got stuck in a portion near the end that I had to do over a few times before I could proceed. Kind of frustrating. I'd suggest having food sources taper out towards the end, to train the player to get used to having less healing, though I don't know how difficult it would be to change.\n\nSpeaking of healing... yeah, the final boss. It was hard. Disproportionately hard from the rest of the game. Maybe five times harder than the skeleton dungeons. Impossible, to many if not most players. I tried to get the game refunded because it was that hard, and I was convinced I would never see the ending, or any ending. Frustrating, and not in the good way. There has to be some way to ease the difficulty on this boss. Maybe more invincibility frames. Maybe less knockback from the sword. If nothing else, adding in some sort of... catchable, non-damaging source of healing would help. Please fix this.\n\nOverall, a nice game. I enjoyed it, and I'll try to get the other routes. But, the boss battle really embittered my experience.","December 25, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though some of the choices in the story are not obvious the first time so it is very much worth trying again if you feel you missed something.\n\nThe art style is rather cute looking but do not assume from that that the game is unchallenging. Getting the best ending is actually pretty difficult and will likely require several playthroughs to figure out all the puzzles and choices.\n\nAgain, the game is short but I would throughly reccomend it, for the modest price tag it is great fun for the cost and will have you playing it through at least two or three times if you are anything like me.","February 21","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A full review to come once I get the other endings and achievements (as, after reading the reviews, I've come to believe that this game is relatively short - 100%'able in 2-3 hours).\n\nDragon's Wake is an adventure platformer, a genre I don't normally play. And it showed - I couldn't completely control the flying mechanic, even towards the end of the game. The dragon you play as likes to clip onto the edges of certain platforms (and will automatically walk towards the anchor point). Not sure what the point of that was. The final boss was particularly frustrating for me since the boss had 2 stages, and its second stage is relentless.\n\nI think the most redeeming quality of this game is the way it presents its story. You start as a newborn dragon (fresh out of the egg), and must learn about the world you've hatched in. Dragon's Wake's story is mainly a tale of a dragon's path to adulthood, with a rite of passage involving the slaying of the final boss - a threat to dragons and friends of dragons in this world.\n\nThere's a certain charm to the pixel graphic sprites, the gestures and cues that the kobolds use (according to the top review on the page, the green guys that help you are kobolds), and the limited amount of text on the screen (in fact, I don't recall seeing ANY text throughout the game, barring loading screens - just button prompts and infographics).\n\nThe music is pretty decent and helps to convey certain feelings, especially since there's no text to do so in this game. The art during the loading screens is, I would hazard to guess, drawn by a hobbyist instead of a professional. I have no real qualms about this, but I just thought I'd point that out.\n\nOverall, what would I give this? Meh...right now I'd say a 7/10. Recommended, but not an entirely GREAT game. I got it for 10% off ($3.59), but 10% off $3.99 isn't much of a difference. Value-wise, this game isn't much of a deal.\n\nRating Breakdown:\nGraphics/Art Style: 9/10\nMusic: 9/10\nStory: 10/10\nMechanics: 5/10\nValue: 5/10","February 11","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only complaint is the controls. Their exremely slipery and it's worse consitering it's a platformer. Other than that, it's a good game.

It's short, and sweet, and simple, and utterly charming. Throwing players into a world of a baby dragon, it sets you on a journey of discovery, growth, and loss.\n\nA platformer, players gain various abilities throughout the game, developing the ability to glide, breath fire, and even spit fireballs. Gliding takes a little bit to get used to, as the game doesn't really describe it very well, but once understood, it provides a very mobile and very frantic mode of travel.\n\nAs a dragon, you have a variety of attacks. You can bite, stomp, and breath fire, and all three allow the player to take down enemies in a variety of ways. Combat's light, but as it's not the main focus of the game, it doesn't need to be heavier.\n\nArtistically, Dragon's Wake is, again, simple. It's pixel art, but details everything very well. Each character has, well, character, and provides just enough to be able to make distinctions in a characters emotion.\n\nDragon's Wake has heart, and while short, it delivers a powerful story from start to finish. In the hour that it takes to finish the game, you'll encounter loss and heartbreak, but also victory. I didn't realise it while playing through, but every loss seems to be avoidable, providing replayability.\n\nI really enjoyed my short time with Dragon's Wake, and for a game that one person made over two years, I think it's very much worth checking out.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DDXpoZoD6zw","December 14, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

THANK YOU FOR ACTUALLY MAKING A GAME LIKE THIS! There is not enough of them out there. I am getting tired of games like that or a game where you can be a dragon to some extent for a part of the game and its locked behind an energy bar that is limited or only can be one in certain areas (Divinity II and Shyvana in League of Legends are examples).\n\n\nThe struggle throughout Dragon's Wake could be felt, and going through the "bad/dark" ending sequence had my heart strings rather torn and I was sad to see many of the tragedies that did happen throughout. It made fighting the final boss rather epic as the only way to stop such destruction of innocent lives was to end that dark knight. Even after he was defeated, you could feel the emptiness each of the characters felt for losing their loved ones (each artwork depicted all that emotion rather well. Kudos to the artist!)\n\n\n\nThe only two criticisms I can offer is the jumping in the game is rather "clunky". Not so much what it looks like or how it handles, but rather you have little to no control while mid air which makes precision rather difficult and frustrating. I spent a lot of this game trying to jump properly. If there was more control for mid-air gliding that would be fantastic.\nThe other is please allow a manual save and allow disabling of auto-saving features. There are times where I am trying to achieve certain results for an achievement but can't go back unless I redo the ENTIRE content beforehand.\n\nI would totally love to see/make addons to this game for extra content (or another game in general!).

However its length does not detract from the experience but rather keeps the game focussed, constantly furthering the plot and adding new gameplay mechanics.

Though some of the choices in the story are not obvious the first time so it is very much worth trying again if you feel you missed something.\n\nThe art style is rather cute looking but do not assume from that that the game is unchallenging.

I like that the story is shown, not told, as that makes it surprisingly effective. Unfortunately, because I had no indication that anything important was happening, I moved forward like normal, and so I failed every "choice". I put that in quotes because it's not really a choice. It's more of "Pay attention here and intuitively do the right thing the first time or you're losing a party member." Because I was given no indication of how to save people until it was too late, those moments lost their effectiveness. I didn't feel like I made the wrong choice, I felt like the game made me feel bad for not instinctively knowing what it wanted me to do.\n\nHowever, I did feel bad, and I was going to leave a positive review. That is, until I hit the final boss and remembered my major gripe with the game. This is a platforming game with shoddy controls. It's quite forgiving about that fact in every place except boss fights. To fight a boss, you need control and finesse. You need to be able to quickly maneuver your character. In this game, you cannot. I caught on pretty quickly to what I needed to do (unlike those "choices", you can redo boss fights if you die), but I couldn't do it because the dragon doesn't do well if you're doing anything other than flying in open spaces. It's a good thing you're given a lot of health over the course of the game, because boss fights burn through them ridiculously fast.\n\nI'm sure this review comes across as me complaining because I'm bad at the game, but I had little difficulty outside of the aforementioned problems. Just try and play this game and tell me the controls are intuitive and effective.\n\nI wouldn't exactly say that people shouldn't buy this game, but I'm not convinced that it's worth even $3.99. I would recommend getting it on sale if you can. I think I bought it for 25% off, which is probably about what I'd value it at. It's a shame. I wanted to wholeheartedly recommend it, but controls are crucial to a good platformer, and that is this game's greatest failing.","March 9","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are a little less responsive than some other games we are used to but I enjoyed the fact that they were challenging as it meant you as a player developed an attunement to the controls as the dragon got older and thus there was a parallel between the growth of player and character.\n\nAlso my goodness I have never cared so much about a tiny green sprite before, The Cheif (Lizardman with the red cloak) as I will call him was my favourite and I was totally in the mindset to defend him from anything and that was really interesting for me. Normally I'm faily distant with NPC's as games will have story points or dialogue basically explaining "How you like this character" which really doesn't work with me, but the Chief doesn't say much, it is never stated that you character likes him or that you have some in game reason to care for him. He's just there, doing his own thing, being self sufficient and just being there to help you along. It's really quite stright forward but it worked amazingly well for me caring for him.\n\nNow I'm not sure if the Dev's read/can read this but if they can, I reaaaaaaly like the fact that the NPC's are self sufficient, or at least that they aren't relying on you as a player to survive. Their lives and deaths appear like they will go on without the players interaction and that is really powerful because it makes them feel real. There isn't this fake sense of "The world revoles around the player" it's just things happen and characters deal with it and it's up to you as the player to decide if you want to help or not.\n\nI think that it is just really darn good because in real life people don't just instantly rely on someone who turns up out of the blue and neither do the NPC's in this game.\n","December 23, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of the few game I've found where you take the role of a dragon. The graphics are good for this type of game, and the loading screen art fits the style. The story is a little short, but the gameplay fully makes up for it. The controls can be weird sometimes, mainly flying, but is overall easy to use (Just the Arrow Keys and three others). The difficulty curve turns exponential near the end of the game, going from challenging but not hard to nigh impossible until you figure out the 'puzzle'  (If you don't ragequit by that point). The overall best aspect of this game in my opinion (Besides Dragons) is the music. The music for every area fit so well with what was going on, especially the joyful, happy music of the grassy caves. Every game has it's flaws, but I still rate this a 10/10 (I've always been a sucker for dragons :P).","May 17","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is absolutely fantastic in it's unique playstyle. It brings back the era of great old school platformers, with it's own unique twist on it. There is a story that is told without words, and the art, while I wouldn't say is the best, fits the game perfectly.

Some frustrations too, but that came with the learning curve of how to be a dragon. :P Even without the use of dialogue the game tells a rich story with a few surprising twists! I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good story and, of course, dragons. I'll be keeping my eye out for a sequel, I'd love to play another game in the same world.\n\n10/10","May 10","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The lack of narrative doesn't take away from the experience at all and the slight changes to the story based on your actions leave an emotional impact that makes replaying the game just as impactful as the first time.
