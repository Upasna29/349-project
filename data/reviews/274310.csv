As a life simulator it is consistently challenging and nerve wracking, your journey is not a ‘zero to hero’ one where you build stats and gain money.  This is a tale of the daily ups and downs poverty. At times it is like a modern Steinbeck novel and at other times a hilarious meta comedy that plays with your expectations.\n\nThe gameplay is engaging and surprisingly varied and non-linear with plenty of choices, paths to choose and lovely mini-games that never break the immersion. Most importantly, playing this game is FUN. The pixel style is lovely and its animation limitations are made up for with great dialogue and environments.\n\nThis game will cause arty arguments about ludonarrative-dissonance and decision making in games.

Thought-provoking, clever, humorous, and dark in all the right places. The interactive story of people at their best and worst. But I have some serious gripes. For one, there never seemed to be any consequence for starving your character. Early on I made sure my blocky textured game self was properly fed at least one brick of bacon a day. By the end of the game, however, it didn't matter. I went the last few days without so much as entering a store. No complaints of hunger, no risk of starvation... I just kept trucking.\n\nAnother complaint: pacing. Man was this game hindered by poor pacing. The game runs out of interesting tasks early on, and getting on to the next "level" require monotonous grinding under the guise of "man does real life suck or what?" And I get it. You want to buy expensive things, you've got to work for it... or be greasy enough to rob people blind. But as a game mechanic it turned the experience into a chore. But I kept on trucking, like my malnutritioned game character. I had to get to the end. Surely that would make it worth it? All of these choices - so many variables! How will my story turn out? Well, SPOILERS...\n\nIt ends the same way every time. Me in an alleyway with a gun pointed at me. Did I betray my friend? Yep. Marry my girl? Yep. Did everything end up falling apart? Yep. Okay, seems logical. If you're a ♥♥♥♥, you're going to get a ♥♥♥♥ ending. I'll do it differently! I'll help my friend. Let my girl marry him. Maybe now I won't end up all distraught in an alley? Didn't I make friends in my travels? Friends who swore they'd help me and be there for me? Wasn't I a good person? Rescuing dogs and helping old ladies? Nope. I'm in an alley, begging for the sweet release of death. Well, that isn't very fun. Again, this feels like lazy design disguised as some seriously angsty philosophy... life sucks. It doesn't matter what you do, who you are, or who your friends are, it all ends the same way: you, in an alley, hoping some guy will execute you to make the pain go away. Really unfortunate. You can be a horrible monster or a paragon and it ends the same way. What, bad guys don't win sometimes? Good guys lose, sure, but they don't EVER prevail?\n\nI may have to play this through a few more times, but what I'm seeing from other players is the same preachy, bummer ending. I'll rescind this review if need be; assuming there's a way to end it with me not sucking the proverbial barrel of a gun.\n\n\nEdit: As of 5/24/2014 I'm seeing that there were some finale bugs that resulted in the player character  ending up in his/her homeless predicament regardless of doggy rescuing and old lady assisting. It seems the devs have corrected this. It also seems that there are a few happy endings that require a bit of finagling... choosing arbitrary reasons for the initial break-up, choosing how to make a quick buck, either planting seeds or harvesting medicinal marijuana... I don't know why. I still can't recommend it. Some people will enjoy this. It's an interesting story with some flashes of brilliance; just not enough. If you like bummerfests (as that is likely how your story will end JUST LIKE REAL LIFE MAYBE SOMETIMES ALWAYS),  and you don't mind monotonous grinding, THIS might be the game for you.","May 23, 2014","false","11.3"," 554 of 708 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","554","708","2","13"

Its main failing is that the story is about a lot of things, but the ending is 100% reliant on whether or not you "win back" your love interest. Personally, I thought it would be most satisfying to play a character initially very deeply set on reconnecting with his ex, but gradually coming to terms with the breakup and, in the end, letting the ceremony go uninterrupted. In this playthough, I had been successful in almost every aspect of my life: religiously keeping a journal, participating only in activities I believed in, and treating everyone with kindness. My character's future was promising. So, what ending did I get?\n\nThe one where I'm suicidal, nihilistic and alone because I couldn't bear the pain of losing my ex-girlfriend, who I'd had every intention of getting over on the way to her wedding. This is the only ending possible if you fail to "win her back", regardless of your other achievements or the way you've roleplayed your character. The game as a whole could be massively improved by the removal of the framing device at the beginning and end, as, for many endings, it fundamentally doesn't make sense and stands contrary to the story's themes. There's a fine post-credits scene, but it didn't negate my confusion at my character's hysterical response to making a perfectly fair, mature decision that, in my mind, caused him no great pain. It was a very "Huh?" moment for me.\n\nAs for the rest of the story, it's pretty good. Extremely tonally uneven (I found myself going "Really?" probably a dozen times) but not at all bad when you look past that, and I genuinely enjoyed most of the campaign. The trip was gruelling but satisfying, with more than its share of close calls and poignant moments, and it felt like I was coming to the end of a long journey when I finally arrived at the ex's wedding location. It's not realistic, but there's a realness to it -- something humbling about the situations you're faced with, an earnestness in the way the game presents love, friendship, and hope. I guess that's why I felt degraded by the ending... I mean, how can my character be so nihilistic when the past month has probably been the most interesting in his life? He's learned so much, experienced so much, yet the game gives me a pitch-black failstate because I didn't adhere to the arbitrary goal. It's not only unsatisfying, but also troubling philosophically. I guess I would recommend this game with the cliche that you should focus on the journey, not the desitation... or play with the LI in mind. Either way.","November 14, 2014","true","13.8"," 154 of 175 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","154","175","3","1"

I did. I got it, I was super interested in it. It helped my attention so well. . . Until the ending. I know others have stated it but I absolutely loath the ending. Hands down, I really enjoyed this game until you got near the end. I enjoyed going through the turmoil with my character, watching them grow as a person, seeing the effects of the choices I made. . . But the ending is such a slap in the face.\n\nSpoiler alert for anyone wishing to play the game. Do not read beyond this point:\n\nSo I pick my character, I have my love interest, I lose my love interest and my life spirals out of my hands. Not a bad start to a game. It was definitely unique so I did enjoy that aspect of the game. Then I played on and I found myself getting immersed. My character gets a job  at an advertising place, while there though I save a young man from commiting suicide simply by being honest and not judging someone I don't even know. Kudos to you game developers. I liked this.\n\nI get to the next time. I continue helping people from a transgender man to a hungry young boy to even my "friend's" marriage all while being reminded of my choices and what to do when I meet up with my ex.\n\nI think hands down my favorite level is with my 'uncle' whose now a pastor. How finding out that his love for me as his own child turned his life around and how he wanted to be a better man. I dunno. I really liked this part. I also liked the part where he asked me what I wanted to do. Was it to reconsile with my ex. Was I going to finally let go? What was I doing. . . Now at this point in the story my motiviation had gone from 'get back with your ex' to possibly letting them go (In my eyes the relationship wasn't that good if it ended in the direction it did) and to make a better start.\n\nand then Vegas/Ending. . . The game PUNISHES you for not going with your ex. It really does. I don't care what anyone says. I played through it and even though I had a high compatibility with my ex I decided to let them go on with their life and Bam. SHot in the head as a hobo. WTF?! Seriously. I was finally making amends with an old friend, seeing them marry my ex and I get shot in the head as a hobo cause I couldn't get over it?! FLIPPITY DO DAH AH! I hated that. I absolutely hated that. So I reload and interupt the wedding and profess my love. Get accepted, undo everything I had done (Making amends, learning to stand on my own two feet) and even that ending wasn't really rewarding. I just.  . . I hated the ending so much. I still do. It's been months since I last played it but that ending has stayed so vividly in my mind because of how much I had enjoyed the first 2/3's of the game until the end.\n\nThat's basically the end of my rant. If they've updated the endings I may give the game another shot but as of right now, no. I regret owning this game and that's really sad for me to say as again I did enjoy a good chunk of it.","January 25","false","17.1"," 113 of 130 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","113","130","3","3"

I had high hopes for this game, but it really fails to deliver on its promise of an open story of moral ambiguity in favor of a tedious romp through a poorly explained plot that looks like it was written by a 15-year-old going through their "edgy" stage. There is a lot to do, but none of it feels especially worth doing, and a lot of it affects nothing so far as I can tell. Maybe there's a point to buying crab rather than chicken apart from wasting money. Also, ideas like "Sandwich Furtures" traded at a terminal in a sandwich shop, banks that require a security question to make a deposit, and day care providers willing to overlook an allegation of terrorism on a criminal background check are all sufficiently stupid (and not actually funny) that they do nothing but detract from the story.\n\nThe characters are too close to being parodies of archetypes to feel truly endearing, and some of them are introduced to disappear completely from the game moments later. I stayed at a girl's house for nine days and saw her exactly once, despite the fact that the she seemed like she could be an interesting and dramatic character. Meanwhile, I have to deal with the Kurt Cobain / Courtney Love analogues far more than I want. Too often, the choices I wanted to make I could not, and the questions I wanted answered were not.\n\nProduction-wise, the graphics are bland and inconsistent Some characters look completely different in their close-up versions and their walking versions. The imagery is often too cartoony for how dark the subject matter is trying to be (although a lot of that "darkness" comes off as a ham-fisted attempt at shock value), but not cartoony enough to feel like more than a bland vaguely anime look. The sound effects are ear-bleedingly jarring at times, with obnoxious beeps and sudden bursts of animal noise contrasted by the near complete silence of the game world apart from the music (of which I have generally few complaints). Even when the sound effects are appropriate, the lack of other appropriate sound effects make them feel out of place. If that was a design decision, it was a terrible one, but judging by the overall production value, I suspect they just couldn't be bothered to put any serious work into them.\n\nI'm glad I got this as part of bundle, because I'd feel cheated if I paid for this by itself.","November 14, 2014","false","4.8"," 214 of 275 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","214","275","3","0"

No, but the game apparently thinks people do that.\n\nAs a cop-out, you even get to make some choices about the actual plot. As in you decide who dumped who, and why. But this one 'choice' hidden away in a conversation, a couple of hours before the end, is what impacts the ending most of all, without even alluding to it. Madness.\n\nIn one person's story, you dumped a girl because you wanted to bang some more chicks, then changed your mind and crashed the wedding and she came crawling back. In another player's story, you got dumped and now you're acting like a crazed stalker to see her again and ruin everything. In another, you may not give a crap about her. The game, however, is adamant that in each scenario you're going to the wedding to crash it or be a wuss and do the whole "I just want her to be happy but I still love her" shtick, and likely end up depressed anyway. Because the plot isn't as flexible with choice as it wants to say it is.\n\nOther little things about the game can make it frustrating. Press space to speed up the text, and you might end up accidentally making a choice that pops up without the usual pause, and you'll have to reload your most recent save. Play Blackjack and if you and the dealer have the same hand (a 'push'), you still LOSE.\n\nIn hindsight, my hours would've been better spent playing something else.","December 21, 2014","false","16.0"," 128 of 158 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","128","158","4","0"

I personally enjoyed what I have played thus far which at this point is 4 hours,but have not completed it. It allows the player to make choices with no morality scale,but rather allows a sense of introspection for why we make the decisions that we do and to see how it affects the story. Although I am left feeling like many of the decisions I have made would not lead to drastically different outcomes,but rather just affects my own view of myself. Again the title "Always Sometimes Monsters" is pretty apparent. The game starts off showing what I have the great assumption is the ending,but it is the journey of discovering how my character got to that point that is intriguing. While also discovering what I am willing to do or not do in a video game whether it is virtual or not based upon how the characters are written. I enjoy it thus far and it has been for me worth the 9$ and supporting indie developers who created the game that is inspired on their adventure around the country.

While I personally did not enjoy it to the level most of Steam seems to, I definitely see this game had alot of potential, as well as being an honestly original experience.\n\n"Always Sometimes Monsters" is a strange yet human experience where (after the foreboding intro) your character, an unsuccessful story writer, is invited to their ex's wedding and you go on a quest to make your way there over the course of a month to either try and win her back or be supportive. Along the journey the player can make a multitude of choices all throughout the game which have very distinct impressions on the story, often with an obvious placement of morality as to whether they're considered good choices or bad, which is what half the gameplay is comprised of. The other half of the game being dedicated doing events & oddjobs throughout the game for expenses in order to progress to the next town AND to feed yourself, as you have an actual stamina meter... that is almost redundant because all it really decides is if you die in your sleep or not. I'm serious. I understand why this is the way progression is made, it really gets across the feeling of barely being able to scrape by as economy and almost life itself seems to be against you, and cleverly makes you feel that sometimes you feel to do questionable things such as theft to get by, but I personally feel this negatively impacts the momentum of the story, as there are portions where you might have to grind just to move the story along. There ARE minigames to mix things up should you play them, but there's one that kind of... comes out of nowhere? I lost where the story was going for a second there.\n\nThe dialogue itself is fairly well written, characters DO feel human and even minor characters display personality, but alot of the characters just feel like jerks for the sake of being jerks. Or influencing players to do bad things in a few cases. Unfortunately, alot of these characters are major characters, making empathetic or relatable connections very hard to have. Since I have problems caring for the characters, I have a hard time caring for the story. Combined with how dragged out the story feels due to having to spend time managing expenses, and eventually I'm not even playing for the journey, I'm playing for the conclusion. Problem is the game seems to put more emphasis on the journey because, despite there technically being multiple endings, they're all dependant on a copout collection of choices you can make during the end of the game, making the ending also feel slapped on. Another review goes into better detail on this.\n\nAs for presentation, there isn't much to say. the 16-bit graphics are detailed. It has no voice acting but I'm alright with that. The main issue I have is with the music. Not that the music is BAD or anything, but the looping for the tracks is HORRIBLE. I really don't think it should start from the very beginning every time, it sounds sloppy.\n\nAgain, I didn't like the game too much. Despite the thumbs down however, I WON'T suggest people ACTIVELY avoid it. It is definitely an interesting experience. Just do yourself a favor and get it on a discount or something.","June 18, 2015","false","9.1"," 100 of 127 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","100","127","0","0"

The idea of a game that lets you choose your own path starting from the bottom in this way is somewhat unique, and it is fun for a while. The issue with this game is that I feel that I merely have the illusion of choice (which I realize could be the point, but it still annoys me). It seems as though I can make some little decisions that mean nothing, but I am essentially forced to follow a fairly linear story for the most part. In one instance, wihtout major spoilers, I had a job moving boxes. My character repeatedly complained about the job and recommended I quit. However I decided to truck on. eventually, 96 boxes and 30 minutes later, nothing had changed. Sadly, I tried to take a screenshot using f12, and it kicked me to the start screen, losing all of my work.\n\nThis leads me to my second complaint, controls. I appreciate the simplicity, but it is too much. I haven't found a way to remap keys which results in the keyboard using the arrow keys for movement, enter for actions, and escape for back and menu. Considering the constant use of the enter key, I am forced to either cram my hands together, or endlessly shift my hand. Using a gamepad does not fair much better. The analog stick is finnicky at best and for some reason the x button is action rather than a. considering the constant travel around the world that is necessary to proceed, this is a major hassle.\n\nFinally, the game doesn't run at 1080p. I didn't look too hard, but I couldn't find anything that warned me about this, and frankly, I kind of expected it to at least scale. I'm not sure what it is about this game's particular visuals, but they seriously hurt my eyes as well. I constantly feel like they are being strained despite no problems with other games or computer activities.\n\nUltimately, I can't recommend this gam in its current state. The idea is there, and honestly, it lured me in, but it just isn't done well enough. If given another chance, I would wait to see improvement and further reviews before buying.","May 22, 2014","false","7.1"," 135 of 189 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","135","189","0","4"

There were some points where the game was very enjoyable and others where it taught be something about my own morals (pretty straight, but willing to hose the people who try to cheat me). And I enjoyed how the creators were meta, and stuck themselves in the game. And some points were pretty hilarious, like when I broke into a doctor's mansion to recover evidence of his teddybear fetish for blackmail.\n\nUnfortunately, there were many points in the game where I was unsure of what to do. I would spend a good half hour or more wandering around town trying to find something, ANYTHING to do to pass the evening so they game would FINALLY let me start a new day. Othertimes it was very redundant. Don't get me wrong, it was hilarious to get a job butchering pigs ALL DAY LONG... but when I've got to do that for three days in a row, it got pretty dull. I guess work is work, and that's reflective of real life. But in the end I felt it sort of forced my hand. As recommended, I named the main character after me, and the ex after my ex. But I really had no desire to travel across country to go to her wedding. I mean, inviting me to her wedding? That was a "dickish" thing to do. I'd rather work hard and get my life back on track... But butchering pigs was pretty dull, so in the end I bought a bus ticket, just so I could pull out a little more entertainment out of this game. Because there was literally NOTHING else I could do at that point.\n\nI also wasn't a huge fan of a lot of the dialogue. There was a lot of swearing, trash talking, etc that detracted (I felt) from the game. Maybe that's just me, but it felt overused. Also some of the dialogue and cut scenes were... long and without much substance. Maybe that's another way this game tried to mirror real life. But sometimes I felt myself skipping through scenes, thinking "I really need a break, but I HAVE TO SAVE MY GAME!" 15 minutes later, I finally get a chance to save.\n\nI really hate to say I don't recommend this game. You can tell a lot of thought and effort went into it. It's only $10, and a lot of people really enjoy it. You might really enjoy it too. Who knows? Maybe it's worth taking the chance.

The only relevant reason is that your conscious decided to pay you a visit and you just got a hit on home.\n\nOn a rainy night, a furious young man with a 2000 dollar suit and an Italian accent slams the door behind him as he proceeds towards the dark alley. In mere seconds, a shaky middle aged gentleman with spiteful features does follow him, and orders the Italian to come back that instant. The Italian refuses, and declares that he is done. They start to argue, as the Italian keeps walking away and the other man keeps throwing threats around like Halloween candy. Suddenly, their argument is cut short with the appearance of a faceless hobo who asks them to listen to a story, with a .45 at hand. As his ex-boss keeps yelling for the Italian to shoot the hobo, he keeps the hobo on gunpoint and makes a choice... This is the defining moment of Always Sometimes Monsters, and as you make your very first choice, the camera rolls to tell you the hobo's story.\n\nAlways Sometimes Monsters is a story of someone as real and as ordinary as you or me, who'd hit rock bottom and take a journey to redefine their place and worth in this world. The narrative is excellent and compels you to take every little aspect of the game personal. I've emphasized with my character so deeply and invested in her achievements, her choices and her personality so thoroughly... I found out that I've been playing the game as myself all along. Considering the whole display of the game consists of 16 bit graphics, a repetitive techno soundtrack and a text narration, such atmosphere is a great feat by itself.\n\nThe world you play is as uncanny and as simple as the real world, and nothing is sugarcoated. The game is a contemplation on human nature and the element of choice. By definition, the storyline forces you to make choices and live with their consequences at every given turn. There will be moments that would make you, and moments that would break you. You will be forced to face the ugly, cruel and downtrodden part of reality; nuances and topics that we'd better left ungazed in our daily life. Sex, drugs, language, immoral and unethical, even violent actions are only the beginning of the content you'll be forced to deal with. By the first hour of your gameplay, you'll become familiar with the term "lesser evil".\n\nAs you may have guessed so far, the game has multiple endings and huge replay value. You are given an open world with limited time for one conquest. The journey in between is what would define you in the end. One thing that I've appreciated the most is that there are achievements only relevant to plot progress. As you'd complete one casual playthrough, you'd have every achievement. This encourages the player to experience the game with honest choices and make his/her own decisions: play the game as it is intended to be played.\n\nBold in tone, bare in nature, ordinary in content and extraordinary in achievement, Always Sometimes Monsters is an experience. Take out a can of beer, pick your headphones and start the game. By the end, you'll discover more about your own self than you'd be comfortable with.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 25, 2015","true","17.1"," 88 of 119 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","88","119","4","6"

The attention to detail is really nice. Some parts of the game are monotonous, but I find that it completely jives with the overall theme of the game. I didn't have a problem being bored, because the boredom of mundane work is kind of the point of the game. I did enjoy the many ethic decision making the game forces upon you. I did find out something about myself that I didn't know before playing, and that experience is very rare for someone as self-reflective as me.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe end is terrible. I expected my past decisions in the game to affect how I would choose the ending, but they didn't. The ending you get depends complete on the last 3 days that are completely scripted and on rails. I was enjoying my freedom for most of the game and then suddenly everything went into this singular tunnel. A lot of the choices are binary, but it's never more apparent than at the end of the game. Another problem is I kept thinking that the time limit would be more constrictive, but I got to the goal with double digit days left over and I got no reward for showing up early. In essence, the game punished me for being efficient. This also makes it possible for you to play the game with no real reason to ever deviate from society’s moral standards. You don't have to choose between love and ethics, you're choosing between working hard and being lazy since you have a ton of time to make it to your destination. This game has the same problems as Tale Tale Game's games; choices are fun, endings that are not meaningfully impacted by your previous decisions ruins the fun.\n\nWhat would have made it better:\nMore moral choices, giving how many days until certain jobs or areas open up, telling you how many towns are between you and the goal, and finally make a decent ending(s).\n\nRecommendation:\nSkip this game. It's pretentious and the ending will spoil any fun you'll have during the game. I am excited for the next game from this studio, but this experimental game is far from optimized. It suffers from being part of the first wave and I hope the devs will learn a lot from it and from the community response to it.\n","February 8, 2015","false","15.9"," 48 of 60 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","48","60","0","2"

I'm a sucker for story-rich games and love ethical ambiguity (for example, my favorite game, The Witcher).\n\nBut once I got into this, the play was just awful. I found myself doing stupidly simple tasks, like one job where I literally have my character just go left and right across the screen carrying boxes from a conveyor belt to a truck (over 25 times!). It seems like the creators just had very little creativity when it came to gameplay. Not to mention the self-referential jokes that started to sound haughty and overdone.\n\nMany times during the game I found myself bored and confused: why are all these shops here? What is the point of this stamina bar that LITERALLY DOES NOTHING? Why create all these items if they serve no purpose?? And the worst question for an RPG game - WHERE are all the people/dialogue??\n\nI would normally excuse these kinds of detail problems if there was a great story to hold onto...but again, this element lacks in ASM. We get a very short introduction to several characters, are told to apply moral depth and meaning to the relationship our character has with them, only to then be expected to ignore said storylines for half the game and be satisfied with a terribly shallow development/ending.\n\nTo me, this game was a contrived attempt by hipsters to create something "meaningful;" akin to making a really great sauce while burning the meat.","June 24, 2014","false","9.3"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","28","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/274310/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Our lives are full of choices; ups and downs that dictate our destiny and forge our path through the world. They're the moments that define us, and for better or worse steer our life one way or another. Always Sometimes Monsters builds itself on this intrinsic aspect we all experience, but does so to intentionally take us down roads we would hopefully never travel down in our own lives. Unrestrained and unafraid of presenting dark and controversial moments, it's a shockingly human experience that's alarmingly introspective, making me continually question myself as I lead my character into increasingly dire circumstances, but at the same time is untraditionally relatable. I connected with my character to a degree I've rarely experienced while playing a game, and this ability to bring the player into a second life with nothing but text and pixels is what makes ASM such an unprecedented achievement.\n\nThere's little I can say about story specifics as so much of it is derived from your own decisions and how you interact with the world, but in essence this is the story of one person on a journey to find where they fit into the world and what's left for them in life after hitting rock bottom. Times are tough and the situations you're placed in are the sort of moments we'd prefer to ignore and forget. The content warning in the description isn't a ploy; sex, drugs, illegal activities, foul language, and death abound and the developers make no attempt to gloss over or sugarcoat them into something palatable. Whether you get offended is not the end objective; the question of if you will is, and is what drives an story that at each moment seems to sink you deeper into insurmountable circumstances, the outcome of which is almost entirely in your own hands.\n\nThe moments when I was forced to make a choice between equally unpleasant scenarios are the moments when ASM shines and accomplishes something few games have attempted, dealing with subject matter entirely unlike what we are used to seeing in games. It's not fantastical or larger than life, it's simply the story of a person and the people around them, moving emotionally from joy to suffocating depressing, to mundane daily tasks and the moments in between. It's strange to play something that so closely resembles real life, but it's even more unusual for it to be as engaging and intriguing as it is in ASM.\n\nWhere the developers falter is in merging their idea of a human experience told through a game, with the limitations and exceptions of a traditional game. Sandwiched between the narrative decisions and character development are the usual, uninspired RPG standbys, from fetch quests to currency farming, or simply poor pacing and direction. I appreciate the freedom you are given to continue your story or completely ignore it and laze around doing nothing of importance, but the problem is you are rarely given enough freedom to actually warrant being left to roam around on your own. Where there a choice between being shuffled from one story moment to the next, or stumbling around trying to find it for myself with options to engage in unnecessary fluff that ultimately matters not (such as feeding your character), I'd have gladly opted for the former as at times the pacing is so slow I found it hard to continue playing for long stretches of time.\n\nFor as basic as the sprites themselves may be, developer Vagabond Dog has manage to inject an exceptional amount of character and distinction to its environments and the people in it. Character portraits are drawn memorable and add a lot to the otherwise entirely text based story, and the environments you traverse sparely populated but with just enough detail to keep each area feeling unique. The soundtrack is a little less consistent, as for every excellent track there's one that's just as annoyingly repetitive and dull.\n\nAlways Sometimes Monsters isn't without problems, but like the characters in it they are simply part of a whole that you can still love despite their obvious flaws. Nothing and no one is perfect, as the decisions you're forced to make in the game and your own life can hold testament, but if you're willing to look past them there's something very special laying underneath. ASM is not what it looks like, or in many ways even what it proclaims itself to be, but what it is is something that connected with me like few experiences in any medium have managed. I became invested in my character's fate and longed to see them get the happy ending they so desired, and when the moment finally came to seize it I came to the startlingly realization that maybe I had been blinded by what I really wanted. Maybe my selfish desires weren't meant to be and I was attempting to create something that could never be.\n\nBut perhaps in the end that's the point of it all. To show that we're all human, that we all long to be happy, and occasionally we must become a monster to achieve it.\n\nDisclosure: Always Sometimes Monsters was reviewed using a final review copy.

The plot involves slowly meandering through less than a handful of sparsely populated, small towns to dissuade a former lover from marrying someone else. Along the way, decisions must be made about whether to be nice or mean to uninspired, cardboard cut-out NPCs.\n\nYou are never really provided a reason to care about the former lover. You are simply expected to care about her/him. This expectation applies to all the other flimsily developed NPCs as well. Sometimes they have problems involving drug-use, sex, violence, suicide, etc., but these subjects are never thoughtfully explored.  "Mature content" is inserted as if merely including it is enough to elicit emotional investment in the characters and story--but the trivialization of sophisticated issues only comes off as a failed attempt to be "edgy."\n\nClumsy, unpolished writing also plagues the entire game. Dialogue between the protagonist and NPCs is uncreative, insipid, and dull-witted. Characters often spew unnecessary profanity like children who say “bad words” to sound “cool.” And when ASM isn’t transparently trying to be provocative, it bludgeons you with trite declarations about life, choices, and consequences. The ponderous tone of these statements gives an impression of self-importance, rather than intelligence. While playing, I couldn't help imagining the folks at Vagabond Dog spouting this stuff to each other and saying "that's deep, man."\n\nActually, I didn't have to imagine much because ASM's creators apparently think shoving themselves into the game at every available opportunity is clever.\n\nPixelated versions of the creators stand atop the Delvolver logo. They make an appearance during character selection. They show up in every coffee shop of every town. They even squeeze themselves into the epilogue. And their dialogue often consists of praise of ASM's content and comments such as “whoa, meta.” Maybe the cameos would be less irritating if there were more NPCs (and more stimulating NPCs) to interact with, but the NPC population dwindles as the game progresses.\n\nInstead of repeatedly congratulating themselves, the team at Vagabond Dog should have focused on making ASM a better game.\n\nDefinitely, not recommended.","June 2, 2014","false","10.1"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","27","35","0","0"

I'm talking about things like cold-bloodedly allowing the death of someone so you can keep 100$.\nI'm on my third playthrough now, and I don't get the feeling that you get any agency in deciding how your character develops as a person.\nI also couldn't actively spend more time with the npcs I found genuinely interesting. Instead I was pushed ever towards the main storyline. Overall, I had a better "life simulator / tough choices / Am I a monster?" experience in a lot of free games out there, let alone professional titles like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, which despite being set in a fantastic scenario and featuring archetypical people still managed to feel more believable than what this game asked me to take at face value.\n\nYou're playing a totally shitbat crazy person.

Because I played the GoG version of this game already, and I just felt like increasing my game count on Steam when I got this off the latest Humble Bundle. Also because Steam requires me to play the game for 5 minutes before I can post a review. Don't let the lack of hours here influence your opinion, please. I'm sure my review below will show that I know the game. This review was also orignally going to be MUCH longer, but it turns out that Steam doesn't like it when I write too many words.\n\nASM is a game made in RPGmaker, which already earns it negative points because RPGmaker is an awful engine, that is all about your choices, expect not really. You're allowed to pick your character from a handful of characters in a room, and then you can pick your LI from a handful of characters in another room. Yes, you can choose to be a gay man, or a lesbian, because this game wants you to think its ~progressive~ when the entire game is written to be pretenious. The game has you going from town to town and sometimes experiencing flashbacks, trying to earn money and fix the "main problem" in each town so you can get to your LI and try to stop her wedding. Of course, you also get dialogue choices that allow you to say "Nah, I'm over her", but they don't matter and I'll tell you why soon. The game has four "towns" for you to deal with, with the first town having the most content. It's an awful place that lets you see first hand how choices don't matter at all. You did Option A? Ending A happens. Did Option B? Ending A still happens, but with a teensy-tiny variation. The only time where the game isn't sniffing its own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is in the second town when it decides to correctly say Republicans and Democrats are both terrible people who are in corporate pockets.\n\nThere are also flashbacks, as mentioned, about your college life and the life you had with your LI. These flashbacks, for me, only confirmed that my old college friend and my LI were both huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who I would refuse to deal with if I had the choice, which I don't, because this game provides as much "freedom of choice" as a Fable game, but at least Fable can provide variations in the endings for each choice. Anyway, when you meet your LI, it turns out they didn't want you at the wedding, but your friend, who is marrying LI, invited you. The same friend that your LI told you to screw over and the same friend that your LI called a creepy little stalker. Turns out your friend managed to get a publishing deal even after you screwed him (guess your LI only wants to go with whomever is gonna get the deal), and the LI's father decides to confront you on your choices in the game, even through it doesn't matter, because all you can say is "I regret it" and "I don't regret it". You are also asked for the reason you're around, and I reconfirmed that I was around only to say goodbye to my LI. You're forced to go to Vegas and gamble because you probably only got $1000 to your name and you need $15000 if you want to buy a tuxedo and get the best "ending" for you and your friend (otherwise he dies or you lose your book deal).\n\nWedding happens, I let the girl go so she can get married, and yet despite me saying repeatedly that I did not want to get back with my LI, I turn out to become a bum because she was my TRUE LUV and without her, despite the fact that I could easily get a job and find someone else, I'm just a useless sack of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSo I replayed it, this time going for the girl, slightly changing my choices, mostly taking the bad ones, dealing with that AWFUL boxing minigame in the third town, telling the parent I regret all my choices and I want the girl back, and then I win her back. Woo. Now my friend is the bum because she was his TRUE LUV even though he had his own book deal he could finish, and he was doing pretty god damn fine before he got with the girl.\n\nThis game doesn't respect your choices. It doesn't even care about them. It's a game about you being in true love with a huge ♥♥♥♥♥ (or huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if its a guy), your friend being a prick, and everyone you know being useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, except for the cowboy guy in Town 3, who was the only person in the game worthy of any respect. I was tempted to play a 3rd time and make all the worst choices, because I suspect so long as you say "I regret", you want the LI back, you make sure your book deal is safe and that your "friend" lives, you can get the "best end", which is you getting back with an awful person.\n\nI regret the money I paid for for this game on GoG and regret the dollar I gave to Humble Bundle, since it included this piece of crap. 3/10, and that's only because I'm feeling generous. I wish Steam would increase the character count for reviews so I can really get into how awful this game is.

Awful waste of time! RPG Maker game. Lots of bugs. Waste of time.\n\nORIGINAL POST - Sorry, can't do it! Can't recommend it! I've put hours and hours into this game, andI just don't get it. It's not hard... it's just slow. It's a game all about choices, and yet I can't seem to make the choices I want to make in real life.\n\nSPOILERS\n\n• I get locked out of my appartment. I have a crowbar in my inventory, but I can't use it on the door.\n• There is a faulty lever. I have a screwdriver on me, but I can't use it on the lever.\n\nAt the moment I have over $1000, but I can't pay off someone's depts on their car I need. Instead I have to race around a track... but first, I need to upgrade the car, so I need transmission, chemicals, and tires.\n\nIn order to get the transmission, all I need to do is help an old man with some scratch cards. Easy enough.\n\nIn order to get the chemicals... my choices are "Do drugs" or "Deal Drugs". The guy is afraid I'm a cop... but he's already admitted he's in possession of drugs, as he wants me to deal. I have lots of money, so I can't just buy the chemicals... I have to deal drugs. Ok, so I do it, and that boring chore is done.\n\nNext, the tires. For some reason I'm replacing old worn out tires with old worn out tires used in a gym. First, that makes no sense at all! Secondly, again, remember all that money I have? I can't just buy the tires, no! Instead, I have to fight and win all of the boxers that are in here all day every day. With no training.\n\nI do have another option, however, I can cut the brakelines of the other driver, which will probably kill him. Not an option I'm willing to consider. However, each time I box, and each time I lose, I lose a day, and wake up to find my friends wife asking me if I want to cut the brake lines. EVERY DAY!!! THE SAME CONVERSATION!!!\n\n"I only have 16 days to get to the next city."\n"That's no time at all! You should kill someone"\n"Hmm... you're right, that's not a lot of time... No, I won't do it. Ask me again tomorrow morning please!"\n\nEvery damn day.\n\nThe game opens up with you having many many choices, and not enough time in the day to do all of them. It ends with you having no choices besides grind this game, and hope that you win by luck or by killing a man. You can tell that the people that made this used RPG Maker, and moved from pen to paper to just using RPG maker to write their story. Like I said, the beginning is brillaint... but it just gets boring fast.\n\nIf they can patch out the boxing, and give people more options, this game would be quite easy to recommend, but at the moment it's buggy, broken, and boring.\n\nI've invested so many hours into it, I need to go back to the god awful boxing ring and win this final fight just so I can see what my ending is. Such a waste of time... but I'm invested now, and I hate cutting my losses.","May 26, 2014","false","23.5"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

He started reading out crimes and sins that I hadn't even commited.\n"You gave a kid an allergic reaction and didn't help him!" ... "No I didn't".\n"You did this!" ...

However, the game falls short.\n\nFirst of all the graphics, surprisingly not a problem. I'm not a huge RPGMaker fan, but the game does what it can to make the graphics good within RPGMaker's limitations. While this may be a problem for some, it really doesn't interfere with the game.\n\nThe music for the game is very well made, but when it loops the audio can sometimes cut out for a few seconds which is a bit annoying. After listening to the same few loops it can get a bit annoying, but generally it's very good.\n\nNow for the main part of the game, the gameplay (really the writing). A game like this isn't bought for gameplay, which just consists of running between buildings and people and talking, choosing dialogue options, finding items, etc. The writing is where this game falls short. It's promise to deal with serious topics falls short because of the game's absolutely horrible approach to dealing with serious topics. At certain times, I can't tell if it's poking fun at the topic or seriously trying to be dark. The amount of obvious tongue-in-cheek references to other video games and video game review sites also go overboard after they start to interfere with actual writing, such as the scene in the theatre, which seems to be an obvious cash-in.\n\nFrom the short while I played, I really wanted to like the game, but the writing was not very good. It was goofy in too many ways, and this ruined what otherwise would have been a very good game. Maybe it'll be better if I play more, but from what I've seen I wouldn't recommend it to anyone interested in this genre of game.","May 24, 2014","false","1.3"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

That seems like what it's trying to be. But it just isn't doing it for me. Maybe I'll finish the game and decide it was all entirely worth it, but for now, this is how I feel.

They do nothing to advance the game or plot and it just feels pretensious, premature self-praise.\nThe game is about choices but to be honest it is overly limited and locks you out fast if you go the wrong way. Prime example is the Jack story, you can not get information about him if you take the newspaper job despite being able to walk into his ad agency office but are unable to ask more information about him despite being able to ask other people questions before this crises, instead you must work for the ad agency to get this information. This sort of binary limiting of choices is in too many games and detracts from the game experience a lot and is a good example of terrible writing.\nNice try but no cigar. Not the worst game ever but definetly flawed in major ways that detract from what could have been great. Only buy in the sale, totally not worth full price.

Which is unusual for me since I'm a gamer with a lot of patience and wouldn't have bought this if I thought otherwise.\n\nSadly from the very start I felt the game suffered from bad writing and plot pacing. The writing is simplistic in nature and will probably satisfy less picky gamers, but the game sells itself as a somewhat serious take on life followed up by mature content. However it's as if the game is trying to take itself serious at times but the writing seems to take on a different form altogether.\n\nThe moral choices in the story are on the edge of black and white, and we know it's never that simple. There are also various character connections that just don't make any sense or is sufficiently explained. I can't go into detail without this turning into a spoiler review, but it feels like cheap tie-ins are made to your character in order to make you feel like your previous decisions carried weight.\n\nThere is also no real connection to the characters. At times it's as if the game wants you to feel 'connected' to a certain character in the story, a character that should mean something to you. Someone important. However, due to hardly any depth given to any character background, you're left with the mindset of just not caring. Why should I care for character A, B or C if the game doesn't bother to build up a relationship? Snippets of dialogue between characters isn't enough for a game like this and it's something that the devs/writers really missed out on.\n\nThe game makes the mistake of jumping you into the shoes of a random person and building their 'life' without actually filling in all the gaps. This leaves a gaping void that just hurts the overall game.\n\nIf the writing and general plot pacing along with improvements to the gameplay such as the rather annoying repetitive money earnings had been much better, I'd probably be playing this a lot more and pumping more time into it.\n\nSadly the game is a bust and I can't recommend this.","May 28, 2014","false","2.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

I finally turned it off and am returning it after reading the line "More babes will show up so I can share my secret sauce with them!" from a bouncer. Maybe it's because I just came from the excellently written biopic Straight Outta Compton, but this is weak.\nThe writing in this game would be fine if there were interesting gameplay or world, but it's about the writing, and the visuals and music seem like "default RPGMaker."

It offers the player several moral choices which influence the story. It gives the player a few opportunities to reflect on these choices or discuss them with characters in the game, and it avoids labelling any particular choice as the "right" or "good" one.\n\nThere are a few things, however, which make this game difficult to recommend:\n\n* Most situations are extremely contrived, being even further removed from real-life decisions than most soap operas. Do I let my friend die or commit a major criminal offence to save his life? Do I confront a murderer or run away and never tell anyone?\n\n* The mini-games are terrible. They're more difficult and less fun to play than the 30-year-old games they imitate\n\n* The characters are a bit one-dimensional, including (frustratingly) the player character, whose emotional baggage pretty much dictates the plot of the game","December 13, 2014","false","9.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It looked like it was going to be a thought-provoking, deep experience where people would be able to compare the different choices that they had made and the outcomes that resulted from them.  I was wrong.\n\nThough on a first playthrough it is easy to believe that the choices that you are making change the story, a second playthrough (or even a bit of research) quickly prove otherwise.  At best your choices make a minor difference that lasts about as long as the next scene.  At worst, there is literally no difference at all.  Once you discover that the choices in the game don't matter all that much, your second realization is that the story is rather bland as well.  I'll avoid discussing the ending for the sake of those who are reading this review but still wish to give the game a chance but I definitely suggest not getting your hopes up.\n\nAs far as the story goes, there were several parts that entertained me and (while still having the belief that choices affected the narrative in a major way) seemed promising.  On the opposite side of that, there was plenty in the game that drained the fun out of it.  The vast majority of the jobs in the game were an absolutely terrible grind.  This makes it so that earning money is less of side quest and more of 'you know, I think I'm going to skip eating today' moment.  Call that realism if you'd like, though I prefer to enjoy myself the entire time that I'm playing a game.\n\nOverall, the game was okay up until the discovery of an extremely linear storyline and downright bad after it.  It had potential to be a great game if the developers had put a little more heart into it.","December 21, 2014","false","8.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It even allows you to choose what race, gender, and sexual preference you want to be, adding little hints of flavor text that color the world around your character. I didn't notice this because I played a short-haired white male and therefore WHITE MALE PRIVILEGE MAKES THE BITTER MEDICINE EASIER TO SWALLOW, TRA LA LA LA LA\n\nIt does that thing where it turns the little mini-games that should be easter eggs and makes them a part of the game. Some of these are justified (and can even be fun), some really should have been flushed down the toilet. So you have to play Frogger in order to not ♥♥♥♥ up at a mission. Then you have to learn this confusing boxing mini-game in order to finish an objective on the straight and narrow. I hated these parts.

The game is centered around emotional bonds and relationships and how easily you can make or break them. My playthrough took me down a horrid little path where I used a character's secret plushie porn as blackmail, ended up fixing a boxing match in the most horrid way possible, and journeyed my way to San Verano, burning bridges and narrowly avoiding one emotional, traumatic bullet only to get hit with another. On top of that, there's loads and loads of opportunities for the writing to shine here, and they are not wasted.

There are a few dreadful mini-games tossed in here and there but at its core this is a narrative game, a digital choose your own adventure that sells itself on the quality of the story and it's ability to be shaped the choices you make.\n\nUnfortunately the writing is awful. The dialog is flat, the characters are a collection of unmemorable types with no depth or originality to be found. The choices offered are contrived almost always breaking down into do a bad thing for money or give up money to be a good person. The effect on the story is negligible until its time to decide which ending you get. Do to many bad things and you are judged to be selfish don't do enough and you'll be forced to play bad mini-games for money. The final act is particularly disappointing as it is largely driven by the bad choices of others forcing you into yet another contrived choice.\n\nTonally this game is a mess. It purports to deal with heavy social issues but the writing is too outlandish to be taken serious and the characters are too flat to make an impact. This is a deeply silly game in which you will occasionally be called a terrible slur because the creators think that this is important social commentary. It's a game that has no idea how stupid it is. The whole story is framed with a ridiculously overwrought frame narrative where the protagonist retells the games events to armed criminals in between monologues about choice that waver between ludicrous and pretentious.\n\nThis is a game that forgoes gameplay in favour of a story that is awful, choices which are contrived and shallow, and thinks it is making important statements when really it’s just using some naughty words and being stupid. It’s a complete waste of time.","May 29, 2014","false","10.0"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

So i played this game knowing most of what would happen because i had watched the playthrough (i stopped watching it after a while to play the actual game). Granted with games like this that allow you to take different paths depending on the choices you make, you can never watch the same Let's Play twice and whatever the Let's Player does shouldn't be the exclusive path you take. In general i LOVE games that allow you to take different paths with the story. I also love writing and want to be a writer and turn most of my works into webcomics. So because this game was about a writer trying to mend their relationship with a former flame, my interest was almost instant and Cry's let's play let me get a preview of what i could expect from the game.\n\nOk, now onto the reivew:\n\nAs stated above, the game is about a writer down on their luck in life and living near-poverty in a run down town called Dubstown. They're down on their luck and taking whatever jobs they can get to earn enough money to pay their rent or risk eviction. On top of that, they also find out that their ex (who they still have feelings for) is getting married in 30 days. So that puts your character on a quest to make enough money as possible and get to the wedding to mend their relationship with their ex. This concept is very good. It's rare we see games and media in general dealing with a character trying to fix a past relationship with this much effort (going on a road trip to see an ex one last time is usually something saved only for the romantic comedies, which the majority of are just chickflicks made with no effort at all). On top of that this is one of the rare oppertunities in media that we see and PLAY as a character in or near poverty, another nice change from the norm.\n\nBut while the concept is well and good, it's all about the delivery that makes or breaks a story... And honestly i feel rather dissapointed...\n\nPros of the game include:\n- A new perspective to the world of writing\n- a new perspective to the world of mending relationships and what love and romance mean\n- a new perspective by playing as a character in or near poverty\n- self aware and meta humor\n- good set design for an RPG Maker game\n- The game can get pretty philisophical when it comes to the theme of choice, which is very much appreciated.\n- The NPC dialouge is unique for the most part, even random ones walking around on the street and not the major ones\n- The choices you make in this game are pretty impressive seeing that you're playing as a writer in poverty. You're essntially homeless for a lot of the game because you're on the road, forcing you to sleep in the street and do whatever you can to find a bed at night should no one want to give you a home. Making money is also realistically hard as it would be for someone in that situation. You can help your friends or completely break people and possibly yourself in the process.\n\nAND NOW THE CONS:\n- a few plotholes, though likely unintentional (like if You let the drug dealer's nephew get shot and run away from the crazy drug dealer, he'll run Belinger over with his car. if you make it to the wedding however, you can see Belinger in the casino... Odd...  And in the second town  when you fall through the vents after hacking the election, the guard says 'KILL HIM/HER!' But the next day, you're not being hunted by the cops or anything. Weird... And why would you immediately kill the person rather than apprehending them and putting them in jail? Was it a failed attempt at a commentary on police brutality?\n- The odd jobs were likely intentionally made to be boring to make the scenerio realistic but boredum and repetion is still boredum and repetion. In addition, they don't give much reward, probably still intentional.\n- The illusion of choice for most of the game just sort of makes you wonder what the point in going on is after a while, which can result in more boredum.\n-The characters are really forgetable save for the old lady and Markansas. Everyone else is pretty much a jerk to you save for a tiny handful you are required to do quests for (like Jack, Viper, ect). Other than that, everyone else is forgettable and  Sam is the biggest jerk of all. Period.  Granted, some of the characters can be nice, but for me at least, i always ended up hating them.\n- There is a character in the game you'll encounter in the second town who is revealed to be transgender but that character could've been written out fo the game entirely. Their 'subplot' consists of 3 meetings and you can't even make them a love interest or invite them to the wedding, which makes you wonder why this character was put into the story if they'd have no impact on it later on. This could've given the player more choices, but instead your interactions with this character don't seem to matter. The game seems to want you to pursue this character by making the 2 meetings you have mandatory cutscenes, but after the election subplot is over, this character can be easily missed and never seen again. What was the point of introducing us to this character if you weren't going anywhere with them?\n- Toward the end of the game in order to get your happy ending, YOU PRETTY MUCH HAVE TO SAY YOU'VE BEEN AN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THE ENTIRE TIME. This pretty much kills the illusion of choice and feels like the creators want to force you to change. Did anything matter up to that point if this is how i get my desired ending regardless of what i did?   I'm honestly offended. If you didn't play the game like a pruitan, the game GUILTS YOU FOR EVERYTHING!  That's no way to talk to your audience in any form of media...\n- The game feels like it's trying TOO HARD to be edgy and controvercial at times. Like the spoiler example above regarding the election and if you make it to the wedding in the final portion of the game, the game feels like it's trying too hard to bed edgy and new, like it's trying to start a controversy but ends up being just 'meh' once you confront said 'controversy'. Sure the game does cover some issues like poverty but when it tries to dip into other typically controvercial things, the delivery just feels off, doesn't leave much of an impact or is just full of lost potential! This is most notable toward the end of the game when you make it to the casino/hotel for the wedding  it would've been a perfect oppertunity to introduce the issues of human trafficing in order to pay back huge debts, but the plot avoids it, opting for plain out killing those who don't pay the debt . Another example in the middle of the game:  If you screw up the job your publisher friend gave you at the second town, he won't let you stay at his place and the only other bed in town is under a bridge where you're forced to either cough up 100 dollars, blow the guy or look elsewhere. This could've delved into how poverty creates gang violence and gang activity and possibly go into human trafficking again, but this was also avoided. hell if you REALLY wanna talk about lost potential, this could've changed the gameplay and given you an oppertunity to join a gang!\n\nHonestly I'm not really sure what else to say about the game. I wanna reccomend it because at least it tries, but the more i think about it and write about it, i still feel bored with the product overall and feel this game has a lot of lost potential (which saddens me as a writer). So despite the fact i feel this game has a lot of potential, i feel it's trying to hard to be something it's not. So if you wanna try it, go right ahead, but wait until it's on sale. Overall, it's a nice concept but the final delivery just feels bland.\n\nI give this game 3 diaries out of 5.","August 15, 2015","false","33.1"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

I wasn't expecting much going in, but Always Sometimes Monsters is one of the better games I've played in a long time.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Interesting concept. You play as a male or female who gets invited to their ex-boyfriend or girlfriend's wedding, and you have 30 days to travel across the country before he/she gets married. While it sounds rather generic, there are a few twists and turns that keep things fresh and interesting.\n- Decision-making that really does impact the storyline. What you say or do impacts how others look at you, how you can progress forward in the story, and even affects where you end up at the end.\n- A unique story and great character-customization system. You can play as any race, gender, or sexual orientation you wish. The dialogue and story is affected by who you choose to play as and how you identify.\n- Great replay value.\n- Multiple endings. ASM is not a story where you are guaranteed to get a Happily Ever After. The tone of the game is dark and depressing throughout, and some of the endings adhere to that. Only get this game if you don't mind mature content (drugs, sex, swearing, death, etc.) that occasionally deals with things in a dark way.\n- Many metaphors and life lessons scattered throughout the dialogue. While sometimes sounding overdramatic, most of the one-liners are very thought-provoking.\n- An extremely memorable experience that made me look at myself and the relationships I have in my life differently.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- Occasional typos.\n- No ability to take screenshots in-game unless you find an annoying workaround.\n- Some of the minigames drone on and/or are almost too difficult to beat -- a luck-based boxing minigame in particular.\n- Repetitive sidequests at times.\n- Can feel aimless.\n\nOverall Rating: 9.0/10\n\nI definitely recommend this game.","May 10","true","10.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Every area is amazing and have interesting quests from getting money for your apartment to a union to religion. But the biggest fault in my mind is the romance of the game.\n\n\nHEAVY SPOILERS\n\n\nTo me, i love romance but this one felt extremely forced like no tomorrow. Mainly with the person you are dating and Sam, to me it felt like it went "hey...screw Sam" and if you didn't they would force you to, mainly with the first flashback with the signing the contract, i tried to not sign it but the game to me in the end forced me to. Then when you find out it is sam that your love interest is marrying it went from a good game to just confusing. It felt forced the your love interest would be with Sam, a person they showed no interest when you first met her and with the contract, sam who she said "meh, just sign it, screw sam" then somehow decided to date sam and marry sam in under a year. To me this is heavily flawed. Then with sam itself, it just felt forced that Sam is the bad guy, the evil person and to me had nothing that showed they were a good person.\n\nNow my biggest fault is how the choices mattered. In the end you find out that all your choices till you pretty much get to the wedding means nothing in the end. Sure you can save one guy from suicide to get a free ride but it felt like i could steal from an old lady and nothing in the end changes. My biggest fault is how you get the good ending. The only way you can and still be a good person is to literally cheat. You save scrim to 10,000 just to keep your book and then some random choices decide if you get your love interest back. In the end for me it feels like you could literally be hitler but if you chose 3 choices you win her back but being the nicest guy ever and messing up 1, boom you are forever alone.\n\nThe endings also are kind of crappy. Either you are with your love!...but Sam is dead and you feel like ♥♥♥♥ or sam is famous from what you did. Or you keep your book! but now you never get to be with your love ever again. And in the end you just screw Sam is the best ending, take everything from him and maybe kill him whe you could easily make the character move on. It feels like all the cool characters are useless when you find out they mean nothing, it goes from seeing a homeless dog and going "i must help the dog!" to "oh if i sell him i get more money, meh". In the end it just feels like nothing matters till 4 choises, 3 to your Love interest parent and the debt, anything else doesnt matter.\n\nEND OF SPOILERS\n\n\nI wanted to love this but the story problems just held it back so much that i just don't want to play again when i know nothing changes, unless you get 2 things in the game, you will get a bad ending no matter what. You can say that is life but life isn't that way. Plus i found it weird you couldn't pick people outside to be your main character when nothing really changes if you consider all the characters you have.\n\nI say if you want to see the good, just play the first 3 area's (and get use to useless events in Benton), after that everything just becomes "i have to do this" over what you want to do","December 27, 2014","false","9.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Otherwise, consider the following.\n\nI do not recommend this game. It was part of a Humble Bundle I bought, but it wasn't worth the time. It's pretty short at around 8 hours, but I was never really engaged by it. Personally, I found the whole experience pretty tedious. I wanted to quit around hour 4, but I felt like I'd invested too much time to stop when it was more than half done.\n\nThis game is sold with the idea that you'll be making important, conseqential choices, but they're ultimately little more than deciding which way you're going to grind your way to enough money so that you can advance to the next rigid setpiece. The pit stops along the way do little to actually show us anything about your progagonist or the other characters outside of some moral choices you can make, though they're largely inconsequential at the end.\n\nThe tone of the narrative and the behavior of the characters are wildly inconsistant. When the game tries to be serious, it's unbelievable. When it tries to be irreverent, it's hit-or-miss. I often found myself mashing the spacebar to advance through about 30% of the dialogue, but it never seemed to go fast enough.\n\nAlways Sometimes Monsters is a solid effort by a small studio, but it's not worth your time. In the first 90 seconds of the game, you're given the option to shoot a person who approaches you. Unless you're a big fan of boring exposition and tedious gameplay, I recommend using your weapon.","December 13, 2014","false","8.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

When things go so wrong so fast, it's human nature to obsess over what you could have done differently. Story-heavy RPG Always Sometimes Monsters asks what we can do instead, and specifically what choices we will make when we try to set things right.\n\nYour character's goal arrives in the post on the second day of the main story: an invitation to the wedding of their now ex-partner, in one month's time. To make it there, you'll walk from place to place, visiting and talking to dozens of different characters via some basic top-down RPG interaction and managing a simple inventory of things like the food you'll need to keep up your stamina.\n\nYou'll have to balance the need for enough money or favours to get across the country with the time it takes to earn them, and face the consequences of that balancing act along the way. The day before the invitation arrives acts as a neat demonstration of that process: your landlord threatens to make you homeless unless you can bring him $500 in overdue rent by the end of the day, which you'll discover is only manageable if you do things like steal from your trusting elderly neighbour or pick people's pockets during a shift as a cloakroom attendant.\n\nLater on, you'll be able to opt for low-pay but legal manual labour, which Vagabond Dogs has made deliberately slow and tedious for the player to ensure it's about as tempting as it is in real life. But most choices in the game are less obvious. Consequences are unpredictable in this world and aim to reflect real life situations to some degree, where chatting to colleagues at your temp job about the guy you've replaced might be enough to stop him from shooting himself.\n\nSometimes these options lack the choice that tally with your instincts or sense of logic, however. Always Sometimes Monsters cannot help but fall prey to this – you can't just phone a friend for help on that first day – but also uses it to its advantage in flashbacks that prevent progress until you make the choice your character has technically already made. You can't change the past, is the obvious point being made here, but it is dramatically effective. The flashbacks also play a crucial role in making the protagonist relatable.\n\nThe chance that you'll relate to your character is also increased by the additional choice of their gender, race, and sexuality. In a clever prologue scene set at a party, you choose from a range of potential protagonists via a publisher choosing which writer to sign, and while their backstories are the same the reactions of other characters will differ. Play as a black lesbian, and you might experience a doctor accusing you of playing the race card, a 'friend' ascribing your apparent lack of fashion sense to your sexuality, and plenty of everyday sexism. “I still expect a hard day's work from you,” says the warehouse foreman, “Even if you are a woman!”\n\nThe low-res RPG Maker aesthetic might seem at odds with the often stark subject matter, but the limitations of the tool help rather than hinder the game. Limited by little more than the amount of words the writer could produce and the player's imagination, Always Sometimes Monsters is able to tackle everything from homophobia to drug abuse to suicide with credibility. The focus is on the writing, sometimes overly dramatic but always engaging, and on the many branching paths down which your decisions can take you.\n\nIt's refreshing to see this kind of real-life subject matter explored in a choice-based game, and presented in a way that's competitive with the best written of those types of stories. Always Sometimes Monsters' vision of the real world can be painful to experience at times, but only in a way that demonstrates the level of craft in developing this strong tale about modern life.\nThe Verdict\n80100\n\nAlways Sometimes Monsters\n\nA convincing examination of player choice set in an all-too-realistic modern world.\n","May 8","true","1.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The game is LOOOONG and for bad gameplay reasons, since the story is relatively short, issues like movement and dialogue speed make the game feel sluggish, there are some nice story beats every now and then but ultimately they fail to deliver.\n\nThe game promises a choice driven experience which is completely false, your decisions are inconsequential until the final moments of the game in which it boils down to the traditional choice structure that you've seen in a million other games.\n\nI have to give credit where its due, the game starts with promise when choosing the main character and the love interest, but it falls short just a couple of hours into the game when it becomes a snorefest of doing chores and getting X amount of money to get Y or doing X thing for Y to get something in return (which usually translates to money or quest items).\n\nThe humor wasn't to my liking, some people may be into it but it felt pretty immature and cheessy. I would also have liked an option to get over your love interest, the whole story hinges on the presumption that the player wants to get back the ex, since there is no way to make your character get over him/her, this makes him/her (i.e. your character) feel unidimensional, stupid, and boring.\n\nAlso the game developers appear on the game, their inclusion felt like it didn't fit at all and they wanted to give themeselves a semi-important part on the game, appearing on every single city and even on the epilogue, they felt out of place in the game and the wall-breaking wasn't to my taste.\n\nI can see what they (i.e. the developers) were trying to achieve with this but I felt ike they didn't succeed , nevertheless there are some good ideas which could be rescued and I'd like to see them expanded like documenting a journey or dynamic character interaction based on your main character, so I'll be looking forward to the next game they make, but if possible I'd skip their first stab at accomplishing their vision.\n\nI seriously can't recommend this game there are many other things I didn't like but most of the reviews I've read also cover those issues I had with the game (e.g. save scumming, bad endings all around, incoherent story, dumb stamina system, etc.), if you're planning to play a similar game with a great story and even developed on the same engine I'd recommend playing To the Moon, both your time and money would be invested better in that game.","June 10, 2015","false","11.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

In the very beginning you can get a bad end really fast by selecting a certain choice. Which I did choose even though I knew it was not the right one. Pretty much the basic set up is you chose a character by talking to someone during a particular party scene. It was pretty confusing at first who I was going to be playing as until I got the gist of what was happening. From what I understand the game simulates the struggle of being out of work and trying to make rent. It places a big emphasis the choices you make on how you're going to earn cash to pay rent. I don't believe there's a morality checker, so there are no right/wrong choices to make. I'm sure the player is supposed to meet some parts in the game where your moral stance on things is going to be questioned.\n\nThe biggest gripe I have with this game is the lack of an options menu allowing you to change the movement to WASD. Other than that it seems like a real slog to go through which is going to run my patience quite quickly. Perhaps once I get further into the game is when it will really click for me. Overall I would recommend this game if you like role playing a person going through a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time in their life.","July 6, 2014","true","2.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It questions the player's morality, it was easy to make the wrong decision, thereby encouraging a higher replay value. However, that brings me to the pacing of the game. For one thing, I spent SEVERAL HOURS working in a tofu factory making tofu products for extra cash and then gambling for another hour just to make a little more; makes me hesitate on picking up the game again...unless of course I can find an easier way to make money. The story makes up for it for the most part and while grinding is technically realistic, it felt a little too strenuous.\nSecondly, there are quite a few points in the game where you, as a player, feel very isolated and the game seems to be going nowhere - but I'd say that's pretty typical for an RPG-maker style game. This would happen if you miss a certain point in the game such as miss a job opportunity or skip the bus to get to the next town. It seems as though you can almost just stay in your home town and let the wedding go and while that says 'CHOICE', it also says boring.\nOne weird side quest in the second town over (or the third; I can't remember) that I'd like to mention, has a fishing kid who asks you to fetch some lake crab. This felt incredibly 'RPG' and far-fetched from reality and to top it off, his sprite turns into a black kid after you finish it. I didn't know if this was just a joke but I laughed with a questioning look on my face. You gained almost no benefit from it besides gaining more fishing spots to get free food.\nSomething I really adored about the game is the choosing your character and partner mechanic. I didn't get it at first but when I did, I was very pleased. It was unexpected and surprising but very clever.\nIn regards to the story, it was interesting, dark, romantic, intense, sad, silly. It makes you think, it rewards you, it beats you up and kills your insides. No matter what, in the end, you'll feel like a bad person, regardless of the 'good decisions' you make. You're selfish and subtly (or not so subtly) mean and rude but in my opinion, that's realistic. The cameo of the developers, Jake and Justin, was a bit of a weird meta stretch but their conversations were pretty entertaining so it wasn't all that bad. However, it did seem a bit over confident.\n\nI'd recommend this definitely, especially if you're into a choose your own adventure visual novel-like game. If you're into the Louis CK 'local man's life gets progressively worse' theme, this is the game for you. And despite the little small weird details to the game, I can't wait until the sequel, Sometimes Always Monsters, which I got to play the demo at PAX'15 and got super excited with Justin over it.","September 7, 2015","true","32.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It did not take long for me to realize this game is certainly out of the ordinary, perhaps purposely deviant from the typical RPG, and it is very mature, story-rich, and at times, a brilliantly written work. I certainly think a lot of thought was put into the story itself and the consequences your character's decisions have on others.\n\nBasically, the plot involves a struggling writer who lost the love of his/her life and has a month to make it to their wedding.\n\nAs such, after you get thrown out of your apartment in the very beginning, you are given a city to explore, with the goal of rounding up enough money  to get your key back and eventually buy a bus ticket to the next city. Making the money is a day-by-day process which can sometimes seem like a chore depending on how you go about doing it. I found myself going to the employment center in town to spend the day working at a tofu factory making countless soy burgers for a mediocre salary. I later found a job as a reporter, where I was faced with the decision to accept a bribe to write a fake story. It wasn't too uninteresting, if you keep in mind your final goal, but it might not appeal to someone who is looking for the story to move at a faster pace.\n\nThe biggest letdown for me was the fact that despite the numerous decisions you'll end up making during the course of the game, it seems that in the end, the options for endings are rather limited. The ending I got was not at all fulfilling for my character. The moments leading up to the ending sequences left me guessing, but I suppose I was left wanting something different.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the dialog options I was given did not really fit with what I would have personally said. I tried to be the nice guy throughout the game, yet at times this was impossible as there was a lack of "good" options for certain situations, making you feel like the bad guy no matter what.\n\nI appreciate Vagabond Dog's efforts here in many respects. They have produced a realistic choice-based game where one can easily relate to the character they chose to portray, and tells a lot life and people's struggles.

Dialog and scenes tend to overstay their welcome, some minigames (like the boxing one) are unfun or could use a more straigforeward explination, and the humor doesn't really do it for me. Otherwise, it's a fun adventure game with an emphesis on choice and I did feel like I had an impact on the narrative.\n\nMy biggest complaint of all is that the game seemed to encourage me to want to get back with my ex, even though I didn't like him. I understand that part of role playing is playing a role but there seemed to be no rewarding option for moving on.

I guess I'll start with the normal things to review:\nGraphically this game isn't a masterpiece, it's your normal bitstyle game.\nThe music in this game also isn't stellar, if you aren't a fan of looping music it might even be bad. I thought it was fine but nothing I'd tell a friend about for sure.\nThe gameplay is exactly what you'd expect for a story driven game so really I guess this is mixed with story. And the story is what made me get this game to begin with. While It's not very common for me to be emotionally invested in a game besides just wanting to see how it turns out, I was 100% invested in this game from start to finish. I'm not even really sure what it was. My character didn't look like me at all, I didn't know much about my love interest besides the fact that I wanted to get to her, but I was always invested in the game. If I had to attribute it to something I'd say that with how dialogue works and the with the choices you're given, you end up creating your own story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WitteCS/recommended/274310/","WitteCS","'Witte - Ice Cream Time","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WitteCS/","1286 products in account","Much like the film industry it often imitates, in the videogame world the definition of an “independent” creation operates on a sliding scale. Outside of the sheer volume of a games production budget, there are also the questions of the development team’s size, their planned distribution, and sometimes even the concept. After all, even Bungie now qualifies as an independent company while piloting multi-million dollar projects.\n\nWhatever your requirements for triple-A autonomy may be though, it’d probably be a safe wager that Vagabond Dog and their project Always Sometimes Monsters qualifies in nearly every way, and in this gamer’s opinion, almost all of them are good.\n\nThe premise of Always Sometimes Monsters, on the very surface, is actually very direct. You are playing a down-and-out artist who just finished losing everything after trying to make it big. With no job, no cash, and very little hope, your character receives a letter in the mail detailing that the last thing he or she cares about is slipping their grasp forever. With nothing to lose, you set off on journey to seize whatever happiness may still await you… or very possibly die in the process. The twist that makes this title extra-special however, come from the challenges that await your hero: everyday life…\n\nNow admittedly, there isn’t much a person could think of that would seem like more of a mundane time-sink than a game about trying to make ends meet, performing great sacrifices for little reward, and the in-and-out stresses of paying your bills or doing the right thing. But Always Sometimes Monsters manages to keeps this tale engaging because your hero only has so much time to get any one thing done and achieve their ultimate goal. This creates a lot of pressure both morally and otherwise as you pilot your way past the various difficulties your hero is confronted with and what outcomes await you. Also, while many titles claim to feature it, Always Sometimes Monsters is a narrative adventure truly about choices and how through either action or inaction the course of your characters life will be changed. Choices like how not helping your kind elderly neighbor in order to keep a promise to your friend also means never seeing her again, or how protecting your integrity as a journalist means not making enough money to pay your rent. This isn’t a title simply attempting to mimic life, its mimicking a seedy variant of life that only certain individuals can empathize with but many should be able to imagine, a world where your life’s gone wrong and in the process your vision of “wrong” has become something other than what it used to be. While at times it’s more than a bit dismal, primarily it’s captivating.\n\nAs far as presentation goes, from the moment the opening logos have faded and the title screen music has begun, everything about Always Sometimes Monsters feels like an 1980’s throwback. The dialog is delivered through a series of slides beside an image of the speaker in question, your 8-bit characters move along gridded trajectories against largely un-interactive objects, and unless you scribble it down yourself there is no journal function or maps to speak of. This is bare-bones gaming by any modern standard and for the very newest generation, maybe even archaic. But in no small measure does this minimalist approach encapsulate Always Sometimes Monsters’ intriguing appeal. This game was purposefully made to be a simple creation with complex guts; dynamic enough that, if you so choose, the entire journey can fully and functionally be over within the first ten minutes with the real-world press of a button and a virtual pull of a trigger. This dynamic element however, is also where Always Sometimes Monsters can sometimes lose it grasp on your imagination.\n\nThe more options any game or story offers a person, especially tales which are supposed to mimic “real life”, more options and choices a person is going to want. Always Sometimes Monsters, in its simple virtuoso of substance over style, at times paints itself into a corner with that very question of; “ I could do this, why can’t I do that?" Also, the interactions with objects and NPC’s can feel a bit haphazard at times, proving cumbersome beyond titles implied dogma of “even the simplest tasks can prove a challenge”. As a matter of fact, if you happen to locate them in-game, there are a pair of avatars modeled after the developers who will tell you as much themselves.\n\nHowever, all of this only matters as much as player actually likes the story itself. Sure, Always Sometimes Monsters has to roll the dice on whether or not a player will like it’s narrative as much as any other title that bothers to have one. However, in games which are only about the narrative, lacking any actual “gameplay” to speak of, this becomes a much larger concern. If you can’t get beyond playing a lonely vagabond, who at times needs to sleep on the street to stay alive… sell some drugs to win someone’s trust, or even believe in true love, there won’t be much here to hold you. However, if you love a good story and want a really creative way to take part in telling it, there is little reason not to toss this title in your shopping cart and bring it home. At the very least to give its hero a place to sleep tonight.","January 7, 2015","true","15.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

With Always Sometimes Monsters I was hoping to jump into a surreal world full of death danger and decay. But it delivered an experience much like life, and rather than give it a surreal outlook it showed me how surreal it really is.\n\nAlways Sometimes Monsters sends you on the road trip from hell. Broke, depressed and just about to give up hope you must travel from place to place to reach the other end of the country to stop the love of your life from tying the knot with someone else. Whilst this sounds like a pretty easy task, it isn't. And sadly, it wasn't one I enjoyed as much as I had hoped to.\n\nI know that this game is centred around choice, and on my first play though I came across a lot of hard decisions and I gather than everyone's experience will be different. But to be honest, I never found any of them to affect me or the characters in the game on an emotional level, up until the final hour so of the game. Everything I did just seemed to brush off, until you get a summary of everything you have done near the finale. Choice is something I long for in a game, but I feel as if Always Sometimes Monsters made these choices abrupt and I never really had much time to work up to them.\n\nWhilst I do gather that I have gotten a different version of the story from everyone else, I never really found anything all  that  controversial for video game standards. I was hoping with something with a little more depth, rather than just giving me a harsh re-telling of reality. I was forced to work, make friends, loose friends just like everyday life. I found the first half of the game very tedious. Moving from place to place, scrounging for scraps, living off others and just being an all round disaster of a person is not something I long for in a video game. Choices really didn't start to get serious until the latter half of the game. My version of the ending really disappointed me. It completely destroyed the atmosphere of the game, so I will be hunting around to try and change it somehow.\n\nAlways Sometimes Monsters does have its good side, mind you. I don't know what living a broken life is like, but I really feel Vagabond Dog pulled it off. The atmosphere was amazing, I did really feel I was living a life rather than just watching someone’s life. I did really feel like if I didn't pay that rent, I would ruin my life even more, and I really did get motivated to stop the wedding. As well as feeling great, it also looked and sounded great. Lovely artwork, and a great sound track to supplement it. Great work.\n\nAll in all, whilst it had its downs, Always Sometimes Monsters is something that I think can be enjoyed by anyone, and the multiple scenarios make it something I shall visit often. I followed this game for months, watching every video, reading every story. My hopes were very high. And whilst it was something I did have a good time with it, I wanted to love it.\n\n+ Multiple choices that will effect the outcome of certain events, highly replayable.\n+ Great art direction and soundtrack.\n+ Created an immersive life simulation, and the struggles that comes with it.\n\n- Some of the game felt like a chore\n- Slow paced first half. Took me a while to get into\n- Some choices in my play through were brushed off too easily, i.e.  I killed a man with four children and seemed to show no remorse\n\n7.5/10","May 22, 2014","true","8.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

I have started up this game expecting a decent story that normally comes with this genre, but I have not hoped to get what I did. Developing a decent game is hard as there are many aspects to consider and implement them in a good way but is totally different to create a masterpiece.\nI would go as far to pin a tag "Educational" on this game as it will lead you through an endless really hard and realistic decisions a person may have to make during their lives. The game uses very interesting and perhaps cheeky ways of turning the character you control into yourself, a really hard achievment that makes me both love and in a weird way - hate this game. Before I realized what is going on, it was telling a story about myself.\n\nPeople speak of how good or bad games are and it is really rare when you just wish to say: "Thank you" like i do now. Thank you.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPixel art: 8.5 / 10\n\nMostly very pleasant, detailed looking game. Every room is made beautifully and aside one counter you can walk over, everything works perfect.\n\nStory: 10 / 10\n\nWhile it may seem the story is slow progressing at the start, soon you come to realize it just perfect and that any word you say or any action you do or do not do may lead you into another totally different way. The game branches quite nicely and in reality speaks about you. It will throw at you the hardest possible choices and just perhaps help you find your place in the world, both in game and in real life. There are no crazy things in this game, no dragons or unicorns. Consider it a life simulator. A great one in my opinion.\n\nSoundtrack: 7.5 / 10\n\nNot memorable, not annoying. However, it sets the mood perfectly and follows you through the game quietly, allowing you to focus on everything else. I think it fits the game well.\n\nControls: 8 / 10\n\nLike any RPG pixel game, controls are not too difficult or confusing. I have found it interesting though as you have to pause the game to access your inventory. Walking speed of the character seemed too slow at parts, but nothing of this ruins the game, especially if you have some patience and like exploring.\n\nFun factor: 8 / 10\n\n\nFull recommendation!","January 6, 2015","true","13.5"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The story just isn't enough fun to go through.  The devs' conversation in the coffee shop reads to me like nothing so much as the gaming equivalent of a line in a bad detective novel like "Jake shook his head, it was like something out of a bad detective novel".  "Are you sure we made the right decision not to put in a tutorial?"  Yeah, that's a huge sign that you should have had one.\n\nMaybe if I cared more about the main character's predicament.  But the game seems determined to present them as someone who's entirely screwed themselves over with no extenuating circumstances to make me feel sympathy for them and to stick with them through the dull "gameplay" segments.  I can't care about them, I can't care about their friends, and I can't imagine replaying this game to see all the alternate paths.

How people act towards you will depend on your character’s characteristics, for example choosing a gay person will have some people call you a “♥♥♥♥♥♥”, choosing a black character may have some people call you a “Deadbeat” and so on. After you choose your character you then choose your partner; your love interest. After this you write your name and give a toast to the success of a book your character is writing. Then a year passes and you are single and living in an apartment which is a mess while your rent is overdue, not only that your book is put on hold due to lack of time. You then receive an invitation to the wedding of your partner who is marrying someone else, which is due in 30 days; because of this your character gets angry and makes it his/her goal to get to the wedding and attempt to get his/her love back for your character.\n\nBecause of this plot setup, your character and you are put in a state of desperation, and because of this, the game gives you countless choices in many situations such as acquiring money so you can successfully reach the location of your love one’s wedding, while at the same time testing your morals. For example, in the starting town you get a job as a guy who hangs up the coats for people entering a night club, when no one is watching you can look inside the pockets of the coats and steal anything you can find.\n\nAt the beginning of each day you have a limited amount of time to perform tasks, such as acquire money or help a friend out with an issue. If you choose to help out friends or ignore them, this can dramatically change the storyline of the game, the wedding is always a top priority, however the means to getting there can be changed. Here is an example which is a minor spoiler but please ignore if you want an entirely enjoyable experience, or you plan on picking the game up.\n\nLater in the game during in the first town, you meet a man who is suicidal, if you cheer him up he promises you to take you to the next city to get closer to the wedding in his friend’s car. After this your friend wants you to black mail a doctor who is providing many medical expenses to a woman who may die as a result. One of the blackmailing ways is smashing up the doctor’s car, do this and you save the woman’s life, however the car you smashed was the one the suicidal man was going to use to take you to the next city, because of this you need to find another way to get to the next city\n\nThere are many more situations like these present in the game, and the countless choices and consequences really stands this game out as unique.\n\nIf I had an issue with the story, it would be the pacing, because you need money, you need to work jobs and most of these jobs are extremely dull and go on for too long, this could've been intensional, however it isn't fun when you have to do it again especially on repeat playthroughs. If I were to recommend something, it would be playing this game in short bursts instead of long sessions.\n\nNothing much to say in the visual department, the 16 bit style is charming and the character drawing present when you talk with somebody is a nice touch.\n\nThe music is great however, the beginning menu theme is excellent, most of the music suits the location and situation, and deserves attention because of it, the music is by far one of the best assets of the entire game.\n\nIf you get bored talking to people and feel like taking a break from the story, there are a few arcade games you can play, which are a neat distraction but nothing I would play a lot.\n\nAlways Sometimes Monsters is by far one of the most unique narrative games of the year; it manages to make the player feel desperate in his/her situation, and makes you question your moral code. It’s a look at how you will deal with situations under desperation and pressure, and because of this combined with the story, Vagabond Dog deserves praise.\n\nAlways Sometimes Monsters is an emotional trip that is defiantly worth playing through, and should not be missed.\n\n9.0/10","July 7, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Thanks to my trusty friend Standby422216 (my other gamer buddy) for joining me for this ride by my side <3. Here's my thoughts and review of the game, along with my expirience. No spoilers, promise.\n\nSo I played it through once, choosing answers and choices that I would normally choose, and then played it again following a guide to get the best of both worlds. I definitely recommend you doing the same. It's how I got a full experience. :)\n\nNot having any strategy guide (or any guide in particular) was difficult at first, especially with how oblivious I am as a person, so you could only imganine how many wrong turns I took going at it. LOL. Anyway, given how it's supposed to be a realistic "pick and choose/your choice determine the outcome" type of game, not having a guide would actually make sense, seeing as how life itself doesn't come with a guide.\n\nBack to the game, however, I give it a 9/10. The storyline is absolutely amazing and delivers a better show of how reality can be tough while still adding a little flavor of that romantic fantasy like feel. I've always been a sucker for "choose the outcome" type of games, so I was really happy when I found this gem. (Many thanks to Cryaotic on YouTube for introducing me!) Also another reason is how the game made me feel very touched to each of the characters. Each character (that mattered) was very well rounded and I appreciated every one of them. Another reason was how the game had me at the edge of my seat with every choice I made. It reminds the player that once you make a choice, you can't go back. (Of course, you can here, because hey, save files, but that doesn't really work irl does it?) The game kept me involved and coming back for more each time. I played it twice to get the full feel, and I seldom play games twice this quickly.\n\nNow as for the downside or the 9, I have to say that some parts of the game were extremely tedious and unnecessarily long, such as working to farm money. I mean, sure, working irl can be tedious and boring, but it feels a bit draggy in a videogame. Also, I wouldn't have minded perhaps a more juicy/romantic scene as a reward for getting the best ending (because it's a tad difficult to accomplish) but hey, again, I'm a weird gal and that's just my opinion.\n\nOnce again, 9/10. Great game overall. Thanks for the memories, Vagabond Dog!","January 8, 2015","true","22.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/luciusang/recommended/274310/","luciusang","Lucius Angicoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/luciusang/","62 products in account","I'm going to start this by saying that I got the Humble Bundle as an early Christmas present and while trying to decide which one of its awesome games to play first, I set my hands on Always Sometimes Monsters just because it was an RPGMaker-made game (and I have a huge soft spot for their minimalistic supremacy). Also, this review is going to be an unusually long one for me because I haven't spazzed over a game of this category in so long, even if it looks pointless.\n\nA crudely beautiful game, Always Sometimes Monsters is what they call "a life simulator", setting you up in one of the worst life scenarios possible: broke, jobless, homeless, loveless. Trying to fight back all the obstacles and win back the love of your life, you decide on your own destiny with every single option you make, which is the essential point of this game. All the elements of storyline, pixel graphics, and soundtrack construct step by step an immersive feeling into the plot, which is unfolded, again, with every step you take and every option you make.\n\nThe story starts off with an interesting allusion, which then brings you into the game experience itself. It's hard, it's stomach-churning, even far-fetched sometimes when striving over the edge to be real, but it never fails to serve its primary goal: life isn't meant to be easy. Gamers up for a good story will know this one isn't disappointing... until you reach the end of the game. With so many choices in-game it's nearly impossible to know you're doing what's right according to the game without a walkthrough (I am guilty of that, but solely because I wanted my love back), though this was an element that really hurt my feelings as I was suffering along with nearly everyone in the story, and even after replaying the game with different characters, I was still left quite confused and unsatisfied with the elements of the "eternal ending". The fact that the interpretations are left open for the player to make is a nice thought, but I still am not sure I enjoy this in games. Moreover, the small easter egg popular arcades are a nice touch, although most likely not replayable and serving their purpose for the image and only. (Swedish Pac-Man with meatballs anyone? Damn yes!)\n\nNevertheless, all the choices possible raise up this game's replayability for me, so I will definitely spend more time into it. I also have to congratulate the developers on their initiative to create a "character selection" box regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation, as well as on the implementation of the selection as a node into the allusion that starts it all. I also enjoy the fact that they actually put themselves in the game, since, in my opinion, their dialogues construct extra food for thought concerning the game. I know I'd love to do that if I was a game developer.\n\nThe average decent RPGMaker pixelly graphics are able to set up a real-like atmosphere in the city, combined with the morose darkness of the backstreets, but there's nothing else to say about them. As for the dialogues, they're captivating yet full of orthograph mistakes (and I really am someone who doesn't like being a grammar nazi) which should be fixed.\n\nThe soundtrack... What could I possibly say about the soundtrack?! Fresh, stylish, retro feeling while still modern enough, rinvigorating and immersive! Laser Destroyer Team outworked themselves on it and it's undoubtedly a fine piece of work. Every little piece or loop helps set the mood and captivate the player, it's really catchy. It's a nice thing the LP is available through Steam as a preview of their work, although it's really worth it to support them on their Bandcamp and get the EP and XP too (in all honesty, I'll always wish for a physical copy... Christmas wish found!). It's a complete and on the spot soundtrack.\n\nLong story short, this game had a huge impact on me as I'm quite sure it has on many others. Intriguing storyline and graphics, smooth gameplay, disappointing ending, stunning soundtrack.\nThis game has made me question the severity a lot of things in life. There was one day I was at the supermarket and I saw a vagabond roaming around the aisles, so I stopped and thought just for a moment, what if that was me? It was actually another confidence boost to show myself that there is tougher stuff out there that can be overcome, and for that I couldn't be happier. I'll definitely replay this game more than once, because I really want to find all the secrets, and totally suggesting it to anyone who likes themselves a good story, so long as they can forgive the mistakes in its existence. This game has changed me and I'm grateful for that, and I'm really interested in clearing out anything hidden in the game. And who knows, "maybe I could translate the game for free"! Haha. Or probably make a comic about it. With a personally envisioned happy ending to satisfy those who didn't like the one in the game, haha.\nThank you sincerely for this little experience of a game.","December 25, 2014","true","43.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And what a treat it is that the moral choices in Always Sometimes Monsters are so complex, because this gem which can be seen as inaccessible at times and obtuse at others, tells a story that is a standout title in video games as a whole, one that confronts the player with mature subject manner that is almost never discussed in games, the exact stuff that anyone who loves video games has been begging to see for years.\n\nAlways Sometimes Monsters is complex, potentially one of the most layered and intricate games I've ever played. It was even explained in an interview with the devs I was privy to that the average player will see less than 50% of the game. Rarely is a game so ambitious to try to explore such a complex story in a complex way that is actually meaningful, and you would be a fool to not see how uniquely Always Sometimes Monsters accomplishes this goal.","July 26, 2014","true","15.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's well worth playing, but isn't without its frustrating aspects.\n\nIt has some great writing - interesting characters, hilarious moments, and others which are quite touching and thought-provoking. However, the tone is quite odd. It jumps from dark and meaningful to silly and self-indulgent so frequently that it can be quite jarring.\n\nDespite the adult themes, it's hard to ever take it too seriously. Homelessness and poverty are worthy topics to address, but it's undermined when fishing in the local pond and sleeping on a mattress in the street are actually better options than buying food or paying rent. Still, perhaps that's a decent way to handle it; it would be an ordeal to play the game if it was too dark.\n\nThe steps required to get a decent ending are quite unintuitive. My lazy female author avatar not only can but pretty much needs to be a champion boxer (and/or save-scumming gambler) to end up well! Other options for gathering the required money would have helped.\n\nIt's also a little odd that my host and potential mother-in-law isn't bothered that I nearly killed a toddler and then ransacked his backpack for toys as long as I admit that it was wrong!\n\nStill, there's something compelling about it. There's some aspects of a really good story there, and though it tails off a bit towards the end, there's enough good elements to keep playing through to the end. The devs deserve particular credit for giving you a range of character options, and adapting a fair amount of dialogue to reflect that.\n\nIt's a very solid effort. Hopefully the devs will learn from it and come back with an even better second game.","November 28, 2014","true","9.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Truth is the only choices that actually do matter are the ones you make at the casino and wedding at the end of the game. The game seemed to force the idea that good choices aren’t always easy by making the good choices set you back, making you doing hours about hours of grinding to get any farther, while most of the bad choices help you complete the game faster. Those bad choices don’t even really matter at the end as the choices that actually do matter are the ones you make at the casino and wedding. Along with some poor dialogue the “great story” was heavily weighed down. Sometimes I wanted to make choices that were totally reasonable and logical but I was forced into situations I wouldn’t choose.\n\nPotential Spoilers\nPoor writing caused this game to suffer, like how Sam and Rose got together even though she was totally weirded out by him, to the point where she wanted me to tell him to stop because it was bothering her but somehow they end up together, I don't understand. I don't think any ending is really the good ending, someone always ends up in that alley. I don't think really any of these characters would ever be happy in this story, Rose was so broken with losing Sam that I can’t help but think she was always broken and would be still in every ending no matter if they showed it or not.\n\nOverall\nThis game had great promise but ruined it by focusing on quantity and trying to enforce an unrealistic moral code.","January 12, 2015","false","13.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The main plot is also really make or break because your ex is essentially a plot device and you're expected to care with little to go on. So if you don't care and just want to move on with your character's life  the game just lassoes you into doing it anyway (I didn't do this, but I'm sure a good amount of people did.) The writing is prone to serious navel-gazing that rather borders on pretension. There is good writing but it gets drowned in the grind and wallowing a bit too much in pessimism and self-pity.\n\nI give them credit for trying for something different, even if they ended up kind of failing. It is priced pretty well, so maybe if you really interested you can give a shot, but I don't think most people will like it.","August 20, 2014","false","6.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

That’s a question Always Sometimes Monsters distills back to its core, with a 16-bit era roleplaying game (RPG) seen through text boxes, no voice acting and a pace dictated by hundreds of conversations. It’s thanks to consistently interesting characters entering the stage and down to earth yet surreal moments that this adventure manages to captivate all the way to its end.

A weird title that got my attention quite some time ago. A dude i know told me about it a couple of months ago. I checked it out but i wasn't ready to pay for it. Now it was part of the Humble Bundle so i grabbed it. And boy...i'm glad about that. I'd rate the game a 7/10\n\nThe Pixelart workes great on that Game. It might turn some people down but not me. Like i said. it works great with that game. The Story is the core of this game. It makes you think about stuff. Thats something i like about games like these. They are not only there to empty your pockets and make you feel like a badass hero. 'Always Sometimes Monsters', tries to make you think about something. It has a goal. An that goal is not for you to reach the end of the story as fast as you can. the goal is to give you something to think about when you're done with it. It will stick in your head. I can't say too much without spoiling anything lets say...love is a big part of it. Gameplaywise you won't find anything special here. there is nothing that will blow your mind. The game has a story and a goal. And thats what it focuses on. And it does a good job. Give it a try if you like good storys with twists and WTF moments.

I did my best choosing the right decisions and making money when I had too and chasing after my love interest / romantic other but in the end it was all in vein and even though in my ending we both had a happy-ish ending after that the happiness quickly faded away.

From the very start, the morality system enforces the idea that good actions are often only rewarded by inner peace, and evil actions are often never punished. If you're careful, most people will never find out that you're a bad person at all. "Always Sometimes Monsters" will make you question your choices. Not just the choices of your character, who is enduring one of the most insane road-trips across the fictional United States anyone has ever had, but the choices of you, the player, in your REAL life. It isn't a game, it's an experience, and one I reccomend everyone has at some point.\n\nIf there is any worry you should have, it would be that the price-point is a little bit higher for the amount of gameplay. I finished the game, taking my time, in 6 hours, which is alright for the 10USD price, but I wasn't too thrilled with the replayability of the story, so that might be a turn off for some people. I think it well worth it, you can't see a movie for 10USD anyways, and this is the length of three (or two, if Peter Jackson's involved).\n\n","August 6, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I read this title on the internet, I don't need to tell you that it catched my attention, I didn't know what was the game but the title was almost enough to convince me. I read the description, I said "Oh ♥♥♥♥, (I'm not the polite type of person) that's what I was searching for" : a story, not an another indie game that looks exactly like the others. I thought of To The Moon right away, the graphics, the story over the gameplay, over everything. And it made me buy it.\n\nSo, if you don't want to read more, yes, I recommend this game. I highly recommend it. If you liked To The Moon, you'll love it because it's longer, it's a "real" game, you're free to do whatever you want.\n\n\n\n+ First of all, you chose the hero, you chose who you are. That is the first important choice you have to make, and, I think that in a game like that, you have to be able to chose you character, for the immersion. You can identify yourself tohim/her, even if you've got nothing in common.\n\n+ Let's talk about the choices because, well, you obviously play for that. You'll have a lot of choices to make, sometimes they seem useless (and they sometimes are), sometimes, they are lifechangers. You really feel the importance of the importan choices you've made.\n\n+ About the freedom of choice and action, I think that, even if you'd like to be able to interact with some things that you can't interact with, you'll never feel like a prisoner of the game, you have an objective that you can reach or not, and you can reach it by any means necessary. You want to be a good person ? So, be a good person. But, the "bad" way seems easier ? Nobody will stop you. You write your fate. You choose how to find what you're looking for. Or to give up. Or to look for something else.\n\n+ The music is not invasive at all and is pretty cool too. I guess that's an asset.\n\n+ The writing is great too, it really seems to be real situations.\n\n+ The fact that you can think about your choice, examine the different options before you talk. It allows you to imagine the consequences and to do what you think is the best thing to do.\n\n- The fact that you can think about your choice, examine the different options before you talk. Since you're not in a hurry to answer, you don't feel overwhelmed by the situation (well, yes, you do, but not as much as you'd do in real life). But, since that's not real life, is it really a problem ?\n\n- Every good thing as an end, right ?\n\n\nSo, as I said, yes, I recommend Always Sometimes Monsters. It might be a little difficult to get into it if you're new to games like that, but it really worth the effort.\n\nMoreover, the devs are really nice people and they answer to their fans (probably to the ones who are not fans too) on social medias, and that's a good point. And I think, it's only their first game, if it is indeed the case, well, great ♥♥♥♥ing jobs guys. And they added themselves in the game, so they're probably cool guys.

It can be a bit of a drag at times, as there's no real "action" involved. You're basically faced with a series of moral decisions as you play a character whose life is looking a little worse for wear. The character selection section is a little odd, as you're not even aware you're making a decision as to who you will play as  for quite some time. Depending on who you choose, you may find that certain other characters you encounter as you play through are more prejudiced, and are less likely to offer you opportunities. You will probably make a bad decision at some point, and you could be left feeling like crap for quite a while after, depending on how badly you screwed up someone else's life.\n\nThe game devs also put themselves in the game in a coffee shop, which I guess is good if you like both game devs and coffee.

I've only done one complete playthrough and may play through again to see another ending and outcome determined by the choices I make.  Especially knowing the impact of certain decisions\n\nI was able to ascertain where exactly the story was headed early on, but it did not disuade me from continuing to play it out in hopes from some surprises along the way.  Not to say that the writing was contrite or anything but given the medium and the probable limitations on time and the software as well as budget to fleshout the story any further and making it any more intricate just doesn't seem feasable although I would like to see something similar with some of the same mechanics but on a much broader and potentially open ended scale someday.  Given that it is still a lot better than the usual fair that we find in games these days and the narritive does give you a bit of pause as to what really you your self would evne do when placed in a similar position as the protaganist.\n\nAlways Sometimes monsters is a peculiar break from the typical fair and it's presentation is decent despite some of the tedium that I would like to see altered, primarily the balance involving food/stamina (do I really need to eat 100 sandwiches  at $6 each to gain full stamina? - slight exaggeration ) and I'm sure many others have gone over some of the other tedium in the game that makes it less fun like the well mentioned warehouse scene with the boxes, and other things that just seem like a grind or busy work to artificially extend the length of the game.  It adds no value to the story or otherwise.\n\nRegardless it is worth at least one play through I would say, and is a nice take on things with decent potential if you are looking for a decent story game and the journey to go along with it.","January 11, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a ton of choices of characters of different sexes and races, and you candecide what sexuality your character is. I played as a lesbian and there were some rude comments directed at me from other characters, which sort of made the experience feel a little more personal and real.\n\nOverall, this game is just a joy...well, I suppose "depressing" is a better word to use...but it's a good experience and is now among my favorite games.","December 21, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once you start the game, you will find yourself pulled back to it untill you finish your first play through. And once you finish that go around you will more likely than not be compelled to play through it one more time to really get the ending that you want to see. The choices that this game puts on you are often very shocking, and will likley leave you deeply pondering what you think is the best decision. And i gaurantee that by the end there will be more than one decision that you find your self regretting. But to keep this review short for times sake, I whole heartedly recomend this game to anyone who cares at all about a game with an amazing story. As well as a character that you will probably consider a part of yourself more than just a character in a game. Its an amazing experience, but dont take my word for it. The only way to understand this very unique game is to just dive into it yourself. I promise you wont be dissapointed.\n","November 30, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"Haha!" I told the game, "I am beating your system and successfully keeping my character from ever doing anything monsterous or ending up in too bad a position!"\n\nThen I realized that it was me all along. The person always sometimes being a monster was me as the player gaming the system to give my character a good pool of money she wasn't supposed to have to dip into. So I went "Well then, let me be evil!" and outright used Cheat Engine to give myself thousands of dollars, because if I was going to feel like the game was judging me for my actions I might as well go all out!\n\nI'm recommending the game because it has a well-written story that kept me interested until the end, but let you warn you going in that it can be a slog. The game is full of unpleasant characters and situations that always try to go worse for your character. Even if you try to keep your hands as clean as you possibly be can a good hunk of the game characters will still treat you like dirt (although, to be fair, that is realistic for folks who are trying to turn their lives around after hitting rock bottom). And if you try to keep your funds up the honest way you'll quickly find that the minigames you do for work are dull as ditchwater, in a deliberate commentary on how mindnumbing minimum-wage jobs can be by the developer. Don't play this unless you don't mind a story that treats you like that! But for me personally I found it a fun challenge to try to hunt down (in most cases just having money isn't the answer, my cheatiness mostly just kept me from having to do unpleasant things for food) the "good" choices through any given scenario when they weren't spelled out for you, and I imagine that other people would have an equally fun time seeing just how monstrous they could become!","May 25, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are so many ways to play. Even after several playthroughs there are unexplored paths left; just when I think I've seen every option, something new happens. You can play plenty of times without getting bored and the player's adventure always gets me thinking- the main character has a pretty common backstory: they're a struggling artist. That could've just been it, and in real life that's pretty much as far as it goes, but instead they end up on an adventure. It feels realistic in the sense that anybody playing COULD do something like that, but they won't, but as they play they can't help but wonder "What if I did, though?"\n\nThe gameplay itself is great; equal parts lighthearted and serious, compelling, many ways to play, and overall good enough to overlook what I'm about to say, but I'm still saying it: The story doesn't make sense. The devs put so much time into character development early on and then just throw it away for the sake of moving things along towards the end. The characters do things that go totally against their development for the sake of setting up a twist ending. The thing about twist endings is that it's supposed to be shocking at first, but then the player thinks about it and has a eureka moment where they realize all of the subtle little hints and nagging things throughout the game that now make sense. It's supposed to ultimately make sense once it sinks in, and this one doesn't.\n\nDespite that, it's an enjoyable game and I'm happy to own it.","September 20, 2014","true","44.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a ton of choices of characters of different sexes and races, and you candecide what sexuality your character is. I played as a lesbian and there were some rude comments directed at me from other characters, which sort of made the experience feel a little more personal and real.\n\nOverall, this game is just a joy...well, I suppose "depressing" is a better word to use...but it's a good experience and is now among my favorite games.","December 21, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Leaning on retro graphics from the SNES era, ASM relies primarily on its story to get you hooked, opening with a choice that'll either end the game as soon as it began, or drop you into a tutorial-free experience (as, the creators tell you in game, Life has no tutorials) to choose your protagonist from an array of partygoers and then pick their significant other, suffer an off-camera (for the moment) break-up, and set you on a quest to break up a wedding and try to win them back.\nASM touts the power of choice in the game, with some conversations literally meaning life or death, while others are borderline-transparent attempts at character development. The freedom to be LGBT is definitely one of its selling points, normalizing LGBT relationships by showing they're just as fraught with difficulty, though racism plays an element as well, as picking a Latino or African-American character will definitely get you a different gaming experience than a white male. All of the phobic comments are casually made, with the player given no option to refute or call people out on them, likely to simulate the day-to-day casual comments that are made that minorites are forced to suffer through to make their way in society.\nBut for myself, the career scenes hit pretty close to home. While I'm not qualified to speak on the experience anything other than a white male playing this game, I can definitely attest that the concerns and insecurities of being a writer, and how they affect relationships will cause some players to feel as if they're watching a scene from their lives play out on the small screen.   Reading the text of my in-game boyfriend dumping me because he was tired of seeing our relationship written on the page, well, a LOT of writers, particularly creative non-fiction writers, know all too well the inspiration and danger of mining their relationships for material.\nIt was these scenes that carried me through the tougher sections, and by tougher, I mean artificially tougher. Some missions will be enormously aggravating and send players running to the forums to shatter immersion because they can't figure out the most convoluted vent system in North America, or because they find themselves losing precious days to a wedged in fighting game that will find some players shouting at their screens, "CAN'T I JUST *BUY* THE STUPID TIRES!?!" Sections in the 4th act will require save-scumming to make any reasonable progress, and the angstier scenes that bookend the story will sometimes find your cursor lingering over "Shoot" longer than it probably should.\nSo, it's not a masterpiece, not quite a diamond in the rough, more a cubic zirconia in the gravel, but there are still scenes that will drive you to the next, questions to the story that will make you want to find the answers, and conflict jarring just enough to make you ignore the cheesiness. Going back through to try different choices is always an option for replayability, but personally, I found it a one-and-done.\nStill, as Marla Singer said, "It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee."","August 18, 2014","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters you create and the game offers not only a man and woman relationship, but also a man and man relationship and a woman and woman relationship which includes a huge number of diversity in relationships and the choices you mkae can greatly affect the story, what I chose could be completely different than to what I saw on a YouTube video online\n\nThe game as a whole is like an interactive story, there isn't really much to do, The game is dialogue heavy and a few actions can change the course of the game completely. I liked this a lot, however, the game can get boring just seeing the same stuff with the heavy amounts of dialogue\n\nAlways Sometimes Monsters is a very mature themed game and includes a lot of mature content which some people may find disturbing or offensive, but for people like me who are not easily offended or disturbed, this game is a good mature themed game\n\nThis game is not for everyone, the heavy amounts of dialogue and samey missions and stuff as well as the long length for a RPGMaker game can be boring for some people, however, Always Sometimes Monsters is not like any other dialogue heavy game I've played and deals with mature content fairly and maturely, as well as offers huge options and consequences for players to decide\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","May 8","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think in this, it succeeds somewhat. But the execution leaves something to be desired. I think there are a few times in the game where it tries to go 'philosophical' on you, but it feels forced and therefore not particularly intelligent. And, although I've only played through once, it seems like a lot of the stuff you do doesn't really matter in the end. Though to some degree, one could say that the fact that it makes you think about the choices you made is worthy of praise. It's not bad for a first attempt. There are mistakes littered throughout the world, but for me that was part of its charm. There's a certain feeling of sincerity that can only be achieved by a small team writing about life.\n\nIt's certainly a game that deserves attention. The concept is great and the story compelling. It's pretty cheap and I would say worth the asking price for the amount of enjoyment it brings. However the execution is wanting. Therefore. not everyone will like it. Some typical gamers will flat out hate it.

The pixel art oddly supports the story well, providing a different view on a world that is oddly familiar. In fact, I found the whole world and story shockingly relatable, and the decisions I had to make throughout the game challenged my emotions and mentality. The story is one of the best I've come across. I was glued to this game for a solid week, and the many hours I have on record are due to me falling asleep playing the game...I couldn't stop! And the game has multiple story arcs, offering much replay value. I can't express enough how incredible this game's style and story are...honestly I would simply recommend buying the game and seeing for yourself. If you appreciate a story-rich, semi-open world game in which literally the entire story and the characters within alter based on your decisions, ten bucks is a small fee for such an experience.

It gives an experience where, based on race, gender and sexuality, your experiences change. However, this isn't all it provides. The story itself is gripping and amazing, with lots of different paths and lots of different consequences for your actions. I will admit that the story is somewhat stream-lined in that it's city to city to city, with fixed cities, however there is still plenty of room for diverging paths. On top of this, it provides an experience where you're often wondering whether or not you will be able to get through it; not because the game's that hard, but because the story twists in so many ways. On top of this, it also has some interesting moments when characters delve into philosophy.\n\nThere are some cons however, the first being the potential for grinding. I'll give you an example. I was in a factory, loading boxes, told I could keep going until I was finished. The counter is 2 digited, so I assumed it wouldn't be too many. I loaded 101 boxes before giving up, with no indication that there was an end or not. As well as that, the jobs can be a bit boring/monotonous, but I suppose that's part of the game so I can't judge it for that. Also, I whilst I found Easter Eggs winking at the fourth wall clever, the heavy-handedness of this at the end was not to my taste.\n\nAll in all, a fantastic game, indicated by the fact I'm going in for my second run now.","May 25, 2014","true","28.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

First of all, I'm a big fan of those RPG-Maker like games and this is just one hell of a good game. It makes me want to play the game over and over again to gain new paths, new endings, new reactions and the 'What if?' is always a luring voice in your head that makes you keep playing and once you finished it, you just want to do it again to see what will happen if you do it the other way. Always Sometimes Monsters is funny, real and yet surreal on the same time. Either you can be the hero or the anti-hero. Decide for your friends, your benefits or do whatever you want and send all of them to doom with choosing a way that would break friendships, relationships and futures. Nowadays most people always take the save way, this game shows what could go wrong or what you could gain if you choose the extreme or you do it the way our society does and keep things low. I really recomment this game. It's a fun, intense experience and for people who like to choose for themself it's a big hit. The mini-games are awesome, you have many things to do for a living, explore and meet interesting characters you just have to love, to hate or...well...sometimes you can't even judge a book at the cover. You have to think or let your heart decide before you choose and that is something most games can't: Make you think about the choices you did. The 'What if', regrets, fun in choosing..\n10/10 from me for sure. Great game. I hope the developers will bring games like this to us more often. I would buy them for sure.

There are dozens of permutations based on character choices that will affect not only the ending but also the plotline, which gives repeat playthroughs a purpose.  It also has a diverse cast that includes a variety of genders and sexualities.\n\nThere are a few factors that detract from the experience, however.  The game's RPGMaker appearance may bother some, though it features original sprites throughout.  The mechanics of the minigames are tedious at best and frustrating at worst.  As opposed to Cart Life, which has rote tasks that are easily and quickly done but performed ad naseum, ASM's work simulations eat up a lot of time for little payoff.  (That might be the point, but it is difficult to wade through, regardless.)  Perhaps my biggest complaint is that the content per city is uneven.  The first city has a plethora of storylines and activities, but the following cities are minimal in comparison, usually featuring the main plot and a couple of side quests.\n\nUltimately, the value of the game will depend on the player's ability to invest in the protagonist and the central conceit.  If you can get past the grinding for cash and the clunky minigames, there's a worthwhile story being told here...with a generous dash of fourth-wall-breaking meta-awareness, which might either be another selling point or cloying element to ignore.","June 1, 2014","true","17.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is honestly all about human interaction. It so perfectly captures what it is like to be a human all in one short, what took me, 13 hour video game. The various choices with which the player is faced are identical to the choices a person will be faced with throughout their life. Towards the end the player is made to think about the various decisions they've made and this forces the player to think, "if that were really me, how would I feel about my choice." This is also a great game for someone with identity issues because certain questions/choices in the game make you think about your own life and your own beliefs. Overall, this game is great for anyone; and everyone should play it! Major props to the people at Vagabond Dog for almost making me cry at that ending!\nP.S I should add that for anyone looking for major exciting gimicks this might be a tough game for you to enjoy.

The graphics and gameplay, both neither good nor bad, are not the focus of the game. If ASM has your attention it's because you're looking for a story to be told, a story you can shape with the decisions you make (and the ones you don't), a story where the world is built upon the path you select. And ASM gives you precisely that. And much more.\n\nPut in simple terms, ASM is a love story gone to hell. Your story starts at the pit of broken dreams, and everything is piling up to get much worse. As you start a journey to seek what could possibly be the last bit of hope left in your life, you'll be faced to make choices that will define who you are, who you were and more importantly, who will you become. It gives you the building pieces of your past and asks you "How did it all go wrong?", and then it makes a wonderful job at creating a story out of what you've done.\n\nI'm not going to say ASM is something I'd recommend to anyone. Story-driven game with an unremarkable gameplay paired with the laundry list of trigger warnings the story has, it's likely most people will simply ignore this and move to something else. But for those that are still willing to try ASM, I can recommend this game for you.

Now I finish Always Sometimes Monsters roughly over 3 weeks ago and once I finished it I imeaditly wanted more, but what's done is done, and there is no adding to it. Let me give a quick synopsis of the game without spoiling too much of the plot.\n\nThe stories revolves around a starving artist, an author who has had a bad mental block and can't seem to get their life together. During this block their publisher has been pushing them and in the process has lost their boyfriend/girlfriend who they were madly in love with. Months after the events transpired the protagonist recieves a letter in the mail inviting them to their exes wedding that is comming up (Rough am I right?) and spend the rest of the game trying to get there to stop it. Now as the story continues you find out more the protagonists backstory and how it shaped the person they are today, along the way you learn their troubles, triumphs, and that we all may be always sometimes monsters.\n\nNow that it's been 3 weeks since I finished the game I came to realise just how much this game has made an impact on my life. I've been battling my own dealings along with drifting apart from everyone I care about. This game taught me that you need to love those around you while they are still there because one day you may wake up to find that friends turn to foes and you may be left with nothing but the clothes on your back. This game taught me to love and care and I thank it for that. The devs made a masterpiece with this one and I hope you all will see that. It's definitely worth the $10 and don't let the fact that it was made in RPG maker fool you, because it's definitely one of my favorite indie gems.","January 28, 2015","true","11.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For people who say a game can't be art because it can't emotionally effect you' I submit Always Sometimes Monsters as a game that qualifies as art. There are few games that cause you to question the decisions you make when playing and to even question your own humanity like Always Sometimes Monsters. Be warned every decision will have a consequence and sometimes it feels like you just can't make the right call. This is the beauty of Always Sometimes Monsters. In a market flooded by games where you heroically save the day and are always the good guy this game stands out.\n\nMost of the limitations of this game aren't necessarily its own faults; but more the limitations of RPG Maker. Ignore the reviews saying the ending seemed forced and the plot silly or forced. I suspect that they truly wanted a completely good ending that made all the characters happy.

About... life, really. It's pretty intriguing title, that I've stumbled across by complete accident. This game is definitely different. Special. At the begging, we're choosing are character and his/her love interest - happy times, but the true story begins, when our protagonist are alone in shi*ty apartment, have problems with money and... finds out that his/her ex is going to marry someone. Yeah, that's not good. Since protagonist still love his/her ex, he/she decide to be there on they're wedding day and this decision is a beginning to many different choices.\n\nIs this game boring? Yeah, to be honest, it can be. Works are boring (well, true life I guess). Some parts of the story are too. And for a story with a lot of choices... There aren't that many of those. What's even worse is that the choices seems to be lacking in the moments and situations where they would fit very well and actually be pretty important.\n\nPros:\n+ length (especially if you would like to explore everything, do additional quests, find all collectibles etc.)\n+ graphic - most of characters have their own portraits and they're look good\n+ individual treatment - if you choose someone of the same gender as your lover, you will receive few comments about this here and there. Same goes for your race and gender\n+ plot can be surprising\n+ this game is unique, really one of it's kind.\n\nCons:\n- you don't have option to truly shape your character's personality, which would be so much more interesting\n- ... this may cause issues with relating to your character - honestly, I couldn't relate to mine at all\n- parts of main story and some other quests can get pretty boring\n- there's something missing... maybe stats? More impactful choices? I'm not really sure, but when I was playing, I couldn't get rid of feeling, that this game could be so much more interesting and challenging at the same time\n- not enough choices.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevicwu/recommended/274310/","thevicwu","Industria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevicwu/","189 products in account","Would I recommend this game? Only if you enjoy emotional massochism and completely absurd awful life choices and consequences. More the consequences than the choicecs cuz even though you have choices, the consequences often are unprecidently awful. Or if you always wanted to commit crimes and simply needed a reason. Use this as catharsis and avoid jailtime!\n\nMy overall impression of this game? Great premise, iffy execution. There were a lot of awful choices you could make and often you had to choose between a really ridiculous awful choice and something phenomenally ridiculous and awful choice. You're often forced to commit crimes when you otherwise probably wouldn't which is annoying when you're trying to get the player character's life back together. I'm not sure if the creators did this to illustrate how awful life can get or if they just thought of the most ridiculous situations to put the player in. The things people do for love, amirite?\n\nParts of the game were really frustrating. For example, having to pay $10 for one sandwich and needing to eat 10 to fill up your stamina bar and the frequency you need to do that. I ate 5 sandwiches in the afternoon and when I went to bed in the evening it said going to sleep would be risky since I was starving. I figured, "Eh, people can live for several days without eating and I gorged myself like 3 hours ago, no big whoop." I died. I DIED CUZ I HADN'T EATEN BEFORE BED AND I HAD EATEN 5 SANDWICHES NOT THAT LONG AGO WUT?! T_T Save early and save often all the time. If you play this game, save like you've never saved before.\n\nAnother frustrating part was the repetition when attempting to earn money so buy bus tickets that rival airfare from North America to Europe and to buy the equivalent of Thanksgiving feasts for a midnight snack to prevent dying on someone's lousy couch. Getting shafted repeatedly by various characters in game and being blamed was also frustrating. For a vague example, Friend A makes bad choices because you didn't do something that wasn't really your responsibility but you get blamed for the tragic outcome even though it was really someone else's fault in the first place. Again, not sure if this is to illustrate life is really crappy or give you a headache. I think it accomplished both. Another annoying thing is boxing. Fisticuffs. Pugilism. Cuz some people just won't take money for auto parts and prefer punches to smackeroos? Alright, gonna do what I gotta do and hate it. I really got tired of playing about halfway through and just wanted to finish as fast as possible, survive all the BS, and after all that headache, win back the love of my life. It wasn't looking good for me and that made me mad.\n\nThe dialog is at times really awful. I can't say I enjoyed having my character called a "panty waste f*gg*t"or a "♥♥♥♥" by an employer. I also didn't enjoy some turf warriors saying they needed to protect their turf from a "pack of n*gg*rs" despite one of said turf warriors having a dark complexion. Can't say I thought it was particularly necessary for some old guy telling the pawn broker he wouldn't let him "jew him". Seriously, you're not edgy or gritty. You're just awful at creating dialog. Yes, maybe they were trying to show how awful the world is again but I think the $10 sandwiches and having the metabolism of a hummingbird while being broker than broke and getting screwed by life repeatedly illustrated that just fine without the bigotted language for no actual story-defining purpose. Stop trying to be "edgy", edgelords.\n\nThat said, there were some pros. You could choose your character model and name as well as that of your partner. You could have a same-sex partner if you wanted and other than being called names becuase of it, that's pretty progressive. I'm partially curious if you get called that crap as a straight character. I'm skeptical the dialog varies that greatly between chosen character models given the overall execution of the  game. The premise of the game is really appealing, win back the love of your life cuz your life is an epic soap opera of the absurd. I'm so into that. Ending up in some of the dumbest situations ever imagined? I'm not as into that as I used to be after playing this game. There's a pretty thick line between dumb luck and living the Jerry Springer dream. The game shuffles across that line into Jerry Springer territory pretty quick. But let's be real, crazy BS makes for an interesting story. Use it to your advantage.\n\nI'm really glad I got the ending I wanted and felt all the stupidity and random BS was at least mildly worth it. Closer to the end, I found a helpful community guide (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=290538894) to make sure I didn't flip my desk over at the end of the game cuz that's how frustrated I was with how things were turning out. I probably would have gotten mad if I hadn't found it. Thanks, pal!\n\nApparently, Vagabond Dog are creating a sequel to this game wherein you can import your save file for continuity. I really love that sorta thing and it looks like it may be a bit better by the preliminary info I could find. I'm still hesitant to buy the game outright. I think I'm going to let my feels on this game simmer before I seriously consider it. Maybe I'll buy it during onen of Steam's epic, mega sales for 80% of in like 3 years.

It turns out it's substance as in 'substance abuse' not 'substantial character', because everyone in the room is a copy pasted background prop who's dialog only differs in the drink that they offer for a toast. After I make my arbitrary choice and accidentally become gay due to reckless plot advancement I'm confronted again by the inner monologue, or as I suspect simply a narrator stuck in a flimsy framing mechanism, and asked if these were to be the heroes of the story: I say no. Thought that was pretty clever since this game makes it immediately clear that it's a hella-indie pretentious mess with an emphasis on decisions™, but it just reset me to the time when I began my fruitless search for a character of substance. The sort of thing that happens when you exit the first dungeon of any other game in case you want to redo something; speaking of any other game, that's exactly what I'd rather be playing. That was my introduction to the game from the developers, and I think it's a great introduction from me as a reviewer to a potential player as well.\n\nI'd better write a bit about the more mechanical side of the game. The level design allows no visible indication for the occasional stage left, right and bottom doorways so you just have to walk into the one-dimensional wall and see what happens. The art is a bad mix of stylings. The audio is comprised of free sound effects that I've heard before in other indie games accompanied by four note synth music, probably from a free trial of Fruity Loops.","November 15, 2014","false","2.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I say this as someone who likes story-focused games like Gone Home and Bioware titles. Your choices don't feel significant and the retro/limited graphics don't convey much (character portraits are completely static in conversations. Even a simple 5-emotion repertoire for each character would have been appreciated).

They whine about the fact that your choices don't have any effect on the game, but they fail to realize that while the ending will end up the same, the actuall gameplay experience changes every time. One person was whining about the area where you have to load boxes into a truck, and that nothing had changed after him doing the same boring task for half an hour. Well, I guess I'm the only one here who didn't act like an idiot, and I quit after about five minutes. Once the dialouge started becoming really sparse and far between eachoter, I realized that by this point the developers were trying to tell me something, and I promtply left. And guess what, I did it long enough to move on to the section where my boss liked what I did and took me out to this clubhouse. It didn't take much intuition on my part to realize when it was ok to leave. It was kinda like that situation in Mafia II where you were loading crates into a truck, and you eventually realize that it was pointless to keep doing it. So you leave and go on with the game. Somebody else said that the game was far too grindy for it's own good. I honestly don't know what this guy is talking about, because I only had to do any work about three or so times outside of the main story line, and I was completely fine throughout the entire game. Maybe I just got lucky with the path I took, and didn't have to spend much money on anything, but I never felt like I was grinding for anything. So, if you want an experience with a little more gameplay than something like To The Moon, but still less than most games, or a life sim without the bullshat anime. Then this game is for you, and even if this really doesn't sound like something you would like, at a price of $10 it would be stupid for you to not at the very least try it out. I know this was kinda ranty, and I didn't talk too much about the actual game, but there really isn't much that I can add that hasn't already been said.","July 8, 2014","true","6.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Whitout giving away to much of it's stoyline, which frankly it is nearly imposible to spoil anything, this was one of the few games I've played lately that made made me actually care for my character and their outcome in the story. Maybe it's because you can be whomever you want and pick any choices you feel like, or maybe because this is a regular story about a regular person. Your character is not a hero, it's not a villian, they are just trying to get on with their lifes trying not too make any wrong choices, which is also kind of difficult because life is like that, at the end, you always have one or two wrong choices.\n\nSo, as a tl;dr, this game is one lil' neat indie game that explores so many issues, many of them feel wrong, some of them feel right.

There's a stamina/hunger mechanic that isn't talked about at all so I have no idea what the importance of that is. Finally, I just found the story to be uninteresting and dull. I didn't play for longer than an hour though, so maybe it gets better, but there's lots of really fun games out there that don't feel like I'm wasting my time waiting for some payoff, and I just don't have the time to devote to this game. I can tell a lot of thought was put into the story in this game, and maybe I would be willing to give it a chance when I feel like I have more free time, but it's just not enough fun/minute to justify playing right now for me.\n\nGive it a try if you like thoughtful, interesting story-driven games and don't mind if the visuals aren't super high-quality, and don't mind slow paced or relatively low-thrill games.","November 12, 2014","false","1.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

In the beginning, the script is really funny and somewhat refreshing but after reading what seems to be the words of a 15-year-old boy discovering himself throughout the whole game... It gets very repetitive and annoying.\n\nHonestly, this game could be so good if not for the script.

I just looked at it's name and dismissed it as some Rogue-lite style game, without even bothering to check up what it actually was. I'm happy that I did decide to check it out a second time.\n\nIf you enjoy a dark and depressive game with an incredible storyline then this is the game for you! It doesn't matter that it's graphics may not be impressive in any way because if you let yourself get immersed in the game then you're in for one hell of a ride. But beware, if you do give this game a chance and happen to like it then you'll have a hard time shutting it down until the story has reached it's end. I thought I had figured it out from the start, but I was thrown off by some unexpected twists in the plot, results of the choices I had made earlier in the game.\n\nWhen we're on the topic of choices, this game has plenty of them! And even if it may not be something that you consider to be a huge decision then it will have an impact on the story, subtle or less so. Some of the choices are hilarious, some are disturbing and some of them will make you feel like a miserable wreck. What's not to love about that?\n\nThe game also contains some quite funny humour and interesting pop culture references.\n\nIf I had to sum up this game in a single sentence then it'd be along the lines of: The darkest and most immersive RPG that I have played up to date. I sincerely hope that this game gets the fame that it deserves because it is truly a masterpiece in my eyes.\n\nAnd with that I'll end my review right here and jump straight into my second playthrough, thanks for taking the time to read it!\n\nEDIT: Corrected some of the many typos.","May 22, 2014","true","12.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Always Sometimes Monsters is a compelling and enthralling game brought to us by the aptly named Vagabond Dog. To surmise Always Sometimes Monsters as eloquently (and with as little spoilers) as possible, it would begin with a small anecdote, much as life and this game does.\n\nEmotions are a fickle thing indeed. Our lives are so dictated by facts, set on rails since the time we begin to the time it ends, and that railcar called life never stops moving no matter how bad the road gets, picking up and losing speed wherever it feels it wants to. We can choose to leave that railcar and act as we see fit, essentially moving with our emotions, but we must keep in mind that we're shackled to it, and if we let it get too far ahead of us it will drag us into the ground. That doesn't mean that life hates us or has any preference, just that it always keeps moving and we neeed to keep that in mind. Always Sometimes Monsters is an amazing portrayal of such a concept.\n\nStorytelling as a medium is relatively new to anything outside of literature, especially in most western culture. Things are very action oriented, and it's easy to do so in a field such as video games, because all that is required is to present a moving story and hope your audience accepts it. It's when we are given control of situations that storytelling becomes complicated. You can say that you ultimately want to write a sad story or a happy story, but is it really simple to portray a story as just that? As something that has ups and downs depending on your own choices, forcing you to keep in mind that things move on and everything has its own time and pace? Always Sometimes Monsters would make it seem as simple as breathing.\n\nThroughout the course of this game I was given situations and choices that had me constantly reflecting on myself and my own life as much as my character's, and those choices did eventually catch up to me in some way or another. I felt happy, I felt sad, and by the end of it I felt empty. I stood at the edge of the game and could only look back, regretting what I had done and thinking that perhaps I could have done better. There was, however, a small spart within me that kept me looking forward. I had realized that this game had never pushed me ahead, in fact it had given me the option to give up and turn back many times, and I as an individual chose to press on.\n\nThere was no fate that kept me moving constantly forward, there was just life. Very few times did the game make me question myself, it instead provided me with the opportunity to reflect in a manner that touched my heart in pleasant and disturbing ways. Ultimately this game made me feel something that I had grown accustom to, but it instead let me see it from the outside looking in: depression and desperation. I didn't feel happy just because the story said I was happy, nor did I feel broken just because the story said it was so. I felt human living within the world presented to me, and that is a truly beautiful and complicated thing to be able to create.\n\nVagabond Dog has successfully created what I would say is one of the most beautiful and realistic portrayal of a single fragment of life that I've ever seen, regardless of the medium used. I would recommend this game to anyone at all who has any interest in storytelling via the video game medium. This wonderful game stands as a reminder that video games can be so much more than just pointing and shooting, and I hope that Vagabond Dog continues making such wonderful games in the future.\n\nGO BUY THIS GAME NOW.","November 22, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am an older game who started gaming in the late 80s with an Atari 2600 and spent most of my gaming years in the 90s. I played on the NES, Sega Genesis, and SNES, all the way up until my parents bought me a Nintendo 64. I also played PC games. Then, I quit my gaming for a while and went to college, focusing my attention entirely on my studies. When I returned to see what the world of gaming had to offer, I was largely disappointed. The entire world seemed mostly composed of boring graphic novels and first-person shooters....That is.... until I met this game. It was like fate.\n\nI can now credit Devolver Digital with returning me back to the world of gaming. At first, I thought it was hopeless out there, but now I see that there are different niche genres out there that will even appeal to people like me. With "Always Sometimes Monsters", they hit the nail on the head.\n\nIf you grew up with RPG games like Shining Force, Final Fantasy, Phantasy Star and FAFA's Shadowrun for the console, this will most definitely be a treat. You will feel both at home with your past and yet still very much up-to-date in today's modern world. The feeling is surreal and one of utter bliss.\n\nI just hope they either make a sequel or another  similar type of game.

At the beginning of the game you can choose which character to play as and who is your love interest. Every combination you make leads to a different outcome in some parts of the game: there is racism against interracial or homosexual couples,people interact differently, etc. The bad aspect is that these changes from playthrough to playthrough aren't as big as one might expect. Nonetheless, there are many choices throught the game that can lead to different paths.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to real life: you can do some small jobs to gain money, you have to eat regularly, you can pawn objects, go to the movies, play at the arcade and so on. It is a risky move and I understand why some people don't like it. However, I found it very fresh and interesting.\n\nThe original score by Laser Destroyer Team is really good and worth buying.\n\nOverall, Always Sometimes Monsters is a solid RPG.

The idea is great, presenting a gritty view of the ups and downs of life, but the lack of direction and attempts to read a deeper meaning into everything started to feel a bit long winded after a while. Every choice is yours, and you don't even need to make choices if you don't want to. You can just watch the timer tick down and stare at your character say they're hungry (but forgets about it after day 7).\nThere are no real consquences to anything you do, bad choices are there just to make you feel bad, but you easily rationalize your choices to any NPC in the game, and they just sort of shrug it off. At times I felt completely alienated from my character, simply due to their dialogue. You moved 20 boxes, got $150 and feel like you're being punished? Just a little entitled and spoiled, my pixelated friend.\nThat said, I liked it. It's too interesting not to like, but it felt like some aspects could have been polished off a little better, especially near the end where it feels rushed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Melferas/recommended/274310/","Melferas","Melferas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Melferas/","302 products in account","Always Sometimes Monsters is a RPGmaker "life sim" where you play one character whose objective is to attend his/her ex-bf/gf wedding in a distant city.\n\nSo as you may think, this game first lets you pick from a small range of characters (because they couldn't make hundreds of sprites) to get the protagonist and then you choose who will be your partner (and later, your ex). Both can be guys, girls or an heterosexual couple, the game let's you decide how you'll get more involved with the story there. For example my first gameplay I chose a lesbian couple.\n\nSo the game centers around making you think about what path is best to accomplish your goal, and then make you reflect on your decisions. You need money in order to get to San Verdano (the city hosting the wedding), so you'll have to work, steal, lie... or not. The game leaves all that up to you. You can get the money by legal means, or walk over people to get what you want. You also need to eat and sleep, so you'll need money for that as well.\n\nThe game involves drugs, sex, killing people, stealing and a bunch of references and jokes. So if you enjoy this kind of things you may like the game.\n\nBut so far I've described to you the overall feel of the game. now I'm gonna get a little bit harsh on it, so I warn you:\n\nFROM HERE THE REVIEW HAS "SPOILERISH" OPINIONS, IF YOU PREFER TO GET INTO THE UNKNOWN, DONT READ THIS.\n\nOk so the game has mainly three wrong things.\n\n- The first one is the poor writing of the story. At first the plot is real good until you get to a point where you ask "why?". And this repeats from then on. Poor character development if you ask me, and this will make you mad if you can't stand weak plots. Also, you "decide" why your character wants to go to the wedding, so you expect it not to be a "romantic rescue" if you don't want it that way. You just wait.\n\n- There is "almost" no consequences from acting douchy or well apart from the rewards. I've done a lot of ♥♥♥♥: Help people who needed it, sell drugs, try to do an honest job... . And the only bad things that will happen to you if you go commiting crimes or just walking over people is... the moral remorse? Which may not matter to you at all because well, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing game.\n\n- At the end of the game you'll get a fusion of the last two points. The only way you'll face your "mistakes" is by talking with some character, and well, that's it. You'll have to defend yourself from accussations of doing bad things, if you did any. But you'll have an excuse for all of them so it doesn't matter at all. But the worst part is that, not only it actually turns out that you are ON A ROMANTIC RESCUE, but you figure it out too late. In a game where you can act maturely, you are expected to fight for your exs love (even if you chose your character to decide to forget her), other way you'll find yourself in one of, what I guess, many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ endings. Again, thanks for the poor writing.\n\nEND OF "SPOILERS" HERE\n\nSo this is a game that makes you decide in every minute, with poor writing but a fun story and minigames. Only one of the many endings this game has is "good", and if you play the same way I did, you'll find yourself in any of the bad ones.\n\nAlso it fails to deliver the message in the game's title, as you build your character from zero and make all the decisions for him/her, so you won't feel bad about doing bad things if you just wanted to play that way.\n\nAnyway, buy it if it's cheap, but don't expect a great game. It's still fun and a nice experience, but I warn you, if you try to behave maturely and nice, you'll get butthurt as hell. 6/10 too much meh.","November 25, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skinnymister/recommended/274310/","skinnymister","☆MTT☆","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skinnymister/","49 products in account",""Can we be salvaged, or are we always sometimes monsters?" 7/10\nAlways Sometimes Monsters is not for the faint of heart. Don't expect any remorse on the game's part: it has the potential to be far more bitter and unforgiving than it appears. In it, you play a struggling young author on a journey to pick yourself up from the gutter, but there's a catch: you only have 30 days to turn your life around. As I feel that the game is best enjoyed with little to no prior knowledge of its plot, I'll try to keep this review as nonspecific as possible.\n\nThe concept is standard decision-based RPG fare: the choices you make will determine your future. I've always been a big fan of decision-based games, especially those that test your morals - and Monsters is brutal in this respect. A Paragon through-and-through, I'm always trying my hardest to take the moral high road in video games: tell the truth, abide by the law, and be the hero. Similarly to Lucas Pope's Papers Please, the decisions you make in Monsters are far too morally ambiguous for this to ever be an option. Due to the complex and difficult nature of these decisions, it's not so much a fun game as it is a captivating one - there's no good or evil, and you'll find yourself making a lot of difficult choices that reflect those we make in reality. In its complete rejection of black-and-white morality, events chain together and intersect in a myriad of different and surprising ways. You'll often have to choose between your own welfare and that of others: the game forces you, an individual struggling to stay alive, to choose between money and morals, but there's more often than not a third option that might help you unintentionally...or hinder you just the same.\n\nUltimately, I found the events of the game to be dissatisfying and irritating - but that's not necessarily a bad thing, as these feelings were born more from a desire for in-universe justice than anything else (how dare they treat my Marcus like that)! I've got a lot of respect for any work that can evoke this sort of reaction. I was not angry with the game itself, rather, the cruel nature of the world within it, and the way it had treated me.\n\nAs the player, you're forced to take what is handed to you, and often feel as if your hard work has no purpose. I felt myself constantly frustrated, unable to have my character's life turn out how I felt it should, regardless of the effort I put in. I was equally upset when characters berated me for choices I made that I had originally judged to be morally sound. You're always presented with easy ways to make cash or advance further in the game, but they're never without their lasting consequences. I found the range of emotions this game stirred up in me to be surprising, as they were very much unexpected during my first hour or so of playtime. I did, however, find the required menial tasks quite frustrating - whilst I understand this is likely the intention of the developers, much like the aforementioned Papers Please, this kind of gameplay was severely limited by the RPGMaker engine, whereas the former tackled it in a very unique way.\n\nDespite the serious themes the game explores, there's still a good helping of well-written humour. One thing I found particularly amusing was the fact that there are self-inserts of the developers in the game, and interacting with them produces a host of self-referential (and occasionally self-deprecating) jokes. I found this to be very clever, and it was a great way to break up the tension in the game, along with the occasional mini-game (Rasmus Man, though clearly a Vagabond Dog inside joke, was quite amusing).\n\nUnfortunately, the game lacks the defined visual style found in conceptually similar games such as Hotline Miami and Gods Will Be Watching. The character designs were not very memorable, although I did find the overworld sprites to be more aesthetically appealing than the character portraits (which, sadly, most characters only had one of, making intense scenes with smiling characters somewhat offputting, though I can understand this given the sheer number of designs). I honestly felt this to be to be my only major complaint with it, as the substandard quality of the artwork was made up for by an excellent plot and soundtrack. The music ranges from melancholy and atmospheric to gritty and unsettling, comprised of thumping 80's synths that wouldn't sound out of place on the Drive soundtrack. Sadly, however, I did find myself picking up a host of grammatical errors in the dialogue that could have been fixed very easily.\n\nFinally, I think it's important to note two things about this game, though I'll try to be as ambiguous as possible so as not to spoil anything: the all-important LGBTQ+ representation, racial diversity, and the replay value this ultimately results in. The character selection process can yield a huge range of different combinations for the player and their partner - much like life itself - and I'm yet to replay the game in order to explore the possible combinations of genders, races, and their influences on the game, let alone those of my choices. Characters will suffer racism, sexism, and/or homophobia, an unfortunate reflection of reality.\n\nI certainly recommend this game to anybody who's looking for something that deals with human nature at its very core. Though it does lack polish in some areas, it's an outstanding game, and it's definitely worth a play. If you're anything like me, just try to have tissues handy. And maybe a stress ball.","August 24, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are, however, some things I did not quite like, but I overall really recommend this game.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics aren't amazing (they could really use some tweaks!), but the story really gets to you. I think one of the greatest things the developers did was to include a lot of diversity. Sexuality, gender, race, morality, religion, etc are all integrated into the game in a way that each player can have an unique experience while playing the game,  and that's something I really appreciate. I was gladly surprised when the NPCs comment on some of these things, tailoring their answers depending on who you choose to be. Not all options matter in the end though, and sometimes the options you can take as the main character are limited. This may not be the same for everyone, but I found the game a bit depressing, but it could also be argued that it's just like life itself: There are choices to make, and you can't always please everybody. It takes about 8 hours to complete, but it is possible that at the end you'll also be wondering "what would've happened if I hadn't done this and did that instead..." so you may wish to play it again afterwards. (At least I do, specially since I kind of messed up and got one of the saddest endings!) Oh, and the music is awesome! I love the main theme!\n\nSomeone should really fix the menu and the UI though. Why cannot we simply exit the mini games pressing ESC? How can we change the resolution? Why do I sometimes choose an answer I didn't want to say just because I pressed 'space' to get the full text? And maybe the mouse could also be integrated in some way, as for example, being able to move using the mouse or something.\n\nAnd also I wish you could at least change the clothes of your character. Yeah, it's kind of funny you always wear the same and it's kind of a nice joke, but who goes for a swim with clothes on? I got a damned scalp massage with my hoodie on! Erm... Just don't choose the guy with the hoodie at the start or you'll later on be infuriated you cannot "unhood" your guy even while assisting a wedding (yeah, not everyone can afford the 5000$ the suit costs.)\n\nAnd food and stamina plays no role in the game. You can basically starve your character to death with no consequences.\n\nAnyway! In short:\n\n+ Tailored story.\n+ Lots of choices to make.\n+ Diversity.\n+ Compelling story.\n+ Great music\n\n- Really bad UI.\n- Wish you could personalize the characters a bit.\n- Wish all choices mattered more in the end.\n- Food & stamina plays no role (that I know of)\n\n7/10","November 18, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/T_Mike/recommended/274310/","T_Mike","Todd Michael","http://steamcommunity.com/id/T_Mike/","1161 products in account","The biggest accomplishment of this game is how it opens a window into the hell of struggling game design, self-aware in its obsession to deliver complex game structure and say something meaningful. The developers are present as background characters poking themselves for constantly failing at this, usually with a good dose of humour.\n\nEverything in this game is built around choice and consequences, and gosh dang can it bring you down. It's probably best not to go into the story if you're interested in playing at all--just surprise yourself and and look up no discussions...until maybe you hit the requisite twist ending unprepared.\n\nMost of the design faults pop up near the end. So many decisions and their impacts snowball together; it ends up falling apart fairly sadly, reminiscent of Mass Effect's closure(--in reasoning, not in disappointment). The structure also moves more and more away from being purely dedicated to itself, to petering out in game-y design with minigames or cartoon scenarios that don't fit the game's atmosphere, a side-effect of cramming in too much ambition.\n\nBut maybe that design is the point, and is part of the story. The protagonist is writing it every night--or at least imagining it--after all. Maybe it's supposed to cross borders into blatant fiction by the desperate author(s).\n\nA unique recommendation goes out to fans of the original Deus Ex. This game shares a number of thematic and quest similarities, as well as taking clear inspiration in its color palette.","August 26, 2014","true","17.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is one of the best games I've played for a while, and I've played a lot recently.\n\nFirst of, you're not just a guy named Fred looking for his wife, Lisa and then the story goes on. You're not only creating the story; you also create the characters. Sure "Peter Pimp" and "Cumdumpster" were the first thing in my head at the moment, but nevertheless I chose them and their names so I did get a sentimental attachment to my two pixelated and homemade basturds. I played as Peter, trying to get my beloved Cumdumpster back after our messy break-up, and boy did I go through a lot of shet to go to her stupid wedding with my best friend from college in High School.\n\nIt's easy to get lost in all the different choices, I usually always go for the doochebaq-choices because that's just how I play, but this game did the sneaky thing and added the grey-zone in which you had to ask yourself "Is this actually the right choice? would I do this?". There's a few parts of the game system that was flawed, like in the old Pokémon games for the GameBoy that most oldie's probably know about, it's easy to make up a save game right before you start betting all your money on the slotmachines, or in this 'ere case - the rock-paper-scissor people... Oh and also slu.. I mean slot-machines, if you're into that. Then just hit up the save right before you lost all your money and try again. I even felt it necessary at one point, up to the wedding.\n\nSome people would probably find core parts of the game tedious (to earn money you have to go through a lot of repetitive work) but I honestly found them to be an enjoyable part of the experience, because you connect to how your character feels bored or tired as he does this, and you follow how he/she is anxious when big events happens in his life. If you do not enjoy movies like The Butterfly Effect, you probably wouldn't like this game one bit. The graphics aren't a masterpiece in itself, and I suspect it's made with a not too complex engine like RPGMaker but the execution and time put into this is fairly visible. The story is breathtaking. 10/10 would play again at some point.","April 3, 2015","true","19.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

The game begins with you in the dumps, with nothing to your name and a practically unattainable goal - that is, if you were to stay on the straight and narrow. The question becomes, how flexible is your moral compass? What would you do to improve your situation? Would you lie? Steal? Kill?\n\nHow much is your happiness worth, and how many people can you hurt before you no longer deserve it? At what point do you become a monster?\n\nThe first act of the game is very strong, as is the ending. However, the two cities in the middle are significantly rougher - they seem emptier, with less to do, some noticeable bugs and insufficient testing. Interesting plots and elements will appear without being satisfyingly resolved. It feels like that part of the game was pushed out the door.\n\nEven with its shortcomings, Always Sometimes Monsters has a very engaging story to tell, and if you have the patience to slog through the middle of it, it does reward you for your time. I wish the devs had maintained a high standard throughout the whole thing, but they are also sometimes monsters.","June 18, 2014","true","12.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The story can be overly dramatic at times, it is limited by its RPGMaker engine, and you don't ever have quite as much freedom as you'd live. It is a diamond in the rough. I think it is an ambitios attempt at a kind of RPG we haven't seen often before but is becoming more common in that it attempts to explore a modern day, realistic fiction setting.\n\nI believe Always Sometimes Monsters succeeds in its goal of causing the player to face themselves and the actions they're willing to take to win the game. There are no monsters to be slain, no magical items to retrieve, no experience to farm, only seemingly mundane choices that seem arbitrary at first, but can later (and often) have a profound effect on your world. Maybe not THE WORLD itself, but your world. You're not out to save the land from evil, you're on a journey of self-discovery. I found myself intrigued with the decisions I found myself facing, and at the end I was so disgusted with the ending I recieved, I loadrd a previous save to change my character's fate. I believe that reaction crosses Sometimes Always Monsters over from being merely a game to serve as a distraction and moves it towards an artistic piece worthy of discussion. Like a painting, you may love it or you may hate it, but the fact that it made you think and feel anything is an indication that the piece succeded in its goal.\n\nIf you can get it for $10 or less or as part of a Humble Bundle, I highy suggest giving it a whirl. It does have a little replayability, as the selection of your character's race, gender, and sexual orientation do impact the game world and there are multiple branches you can take to complete the story. The endings can be lumped into 5 or 6 different branches, but Always Sometimes Monsters, like life, is about the journey and not the destination.","November 24, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story can be overly dramatic at times, it is limited by its RPGMaker engine, and you don't ever have quite as much freedom as you'd live. It is a diamond in the rough. I think it is an ambitios attempt at a kind of RPG we haven't seen often before but is becoming more common in that it attempts to explore a modern day, realistic fiction setting.\n\nI believe Always Sometimes Monsters succeeds in its goal of causing the player to face themselves and the actions they're willing to take to win the game. There are no monsters to be slain, no magical items to retrieve, no experience to farm, only seemingly mundane choices that seem arbitrary at first, but can later (and often) have a profound effect on your world. Maybe not THE WORLD itself, but your world. You're not out to save the land from evil, you're on a journey of self-discovery. I found myself intrigued with the decisions I found myself facing, and at the end I was so disgusted with the ending I recieved, I loadrd a previous save to change my character's fate. I believe that reaction crosses Sometimes Always Monsters over from being merely a game to serve as a distraction and moves it towards an artistic piece worthy of discussion. Like a painting, you may love it or you may hate it, but the fact that it made you think and feel anything is an indication that the piece succeded in its goal.\n\nIf you can get it for $10 or less or as part of a Humble Bundle, I highy suggest giving it a whirl. It does have a little replayability, as the selection of your character's race, gender, and sexual orientation do impact the game world and there are multiple branches you can take to complete the story. The endings can be lumped into 5 or 6 different branches, but Always Sometimes Monsters, like life, is about the journey and not the destination.","November 24, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can say that they are good, fitting for the games style, albeit fairly simple. I didn't mind. +Oh and the character portraits are not drawn very well; it's a bit annoying as you see them constantly, but the thought fades after a while.\n\nGAMEPLAY: From a technical point of view, and someone aware of the software's functions, I thought some of the mechanics were genius, wonderfully creative uses of the quite basic-but-open software. And yes, yes. There's quite a few tedious parts, too. The game is heavily focused on grinding to get to the next area, which will put some people off.\n\nSTORY: Not quite sure how I feel about this one. Definitely a good concept; I do like me a good videogame love story! So basic plot is "Get back to your SO, get your SO back". It's presented in a good way, however a bit slow paced. I find the lack of choice/ limitations a bit "ehh". For instance, a really good thing you could have done would be choose to life your own life, to finally...move on. But sadly the games sees this as losing. Overall it's not bad, but quite linear.\n\nCHARACTERS: Just to say that none of the characters are really memorable, and are all rather "2D".\n\nMUSIC: Absolutely...the best part of the game. I still listen to it now...really wonderful. If not for anything else, play it for the music.\n\nTL;DR 1\n\nPROS\n-INCREDIGOOD MUSIC\n-LOVE STORY\n-GENIUS MECHANICS + CREATIVE USE OF SOFTWARE\n-NICE ART DESIGN IN GENERAL\n\nCONS\n-CHARACTER ART (Except one of a cat)\n-CHARACTERS NOT INTERESTING\n-LINEAR\n\nTL;DR 2: GET IT ON A GOOD SALES, OR PLAY IT IF YOU HAVE IT FROM HUMBLE (LIKE ME).","March 25, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I had originally intended to give a "no" recommendation, changed my decision after considering many different things. Keep in mind, for an RPG Maker game, this one is extremely impressive. I craft badges based on games I really like, and I did so for this game to mainly represent the unique gameplay type (moreso than the gameplay itself) and the effort put into everything.\n\nIf you like text-heavy, story/narrative driven games, decision trees - primarily focusing on your moral compass - and love stories, then you should enjoy this one.\n\nThe aesthetics are good, the game has a good amount of detail for an RPG Maker game - the art used for the different characters is also well-done. The music is very good and fits appropriately with the gameplay. The story is decent, there is a lot of variability depending on what choices you make. In the beginning, you may select the character you wish to play as (as well as his/her love interest) - the game also allows same-sex partners.\n\nThe controls are very simple (entirely keyboard-based), especially considering that this is more of a "life simulator," than anything else. There is no option to change text-speed, however, and this can be annoying for people who read quickly - I would spam the "next" button (which also happens to be the interact button) and accidentally reactivate the conversation. I advise you to wait for the text to completely render because pressing "next" will also select the first dialogue option if there happens to be one at the end of the text; save often in case this happens to you a lot. The difficulty is minimal, the main thing you have to worry about is ensuring that you have enough money to afford food (when your energy is depleted you cannot sleep).\n\nThe gameplay is decent - if you are an immersive gamer, you will really have your moral compass tested at particular points. Near end of the game, a scene is presented that really appealed to me (and redeemed my original impressions of the game). There are a multitude of things to do: play games at an arcade, invest in "hotdog" stocks, play scratch-and-wins, gamble, and eat at different places. You have an energy meter, and this can be refilled by eating or drinking food. To progress the clock (morning, afternoon, evening), you must either complete an event or go to sleep; however, you cannot sleep on an empty stomach. To pay for food, you must either work jobs to gain money, gamble/sell items (there are collectible action figures) at the pawn shop, or even forgo payment and just try dumpster diving for dirty mackarels.\n\nThere is a time limit - you must get to x in x number of days (it is possible to fail), so you need to manage your time wisely. That being said, I was able to make it to my destination with ~14 days to spare. For money, I kept playing the stratch-and-wins - buying 10 at a time for $50 and profiting an average of $50. Near the end of the game, you have multiple gambling options, and I personally found blackjack to be the easiest (since you can just load your game if you lose).\n\nThe replayability for the game is fairly high due to the amount of available choices, however, the game has not interested me enough to warrant a second playthrough.\n\nUnderstanding that this is an RPG Maker game helped remind me some important things - I was too used to being spoiled by AAA open-world games where you have to be aware of consequences. For example, when you are first introduced to the "hotdog" stocks, the pitch suggests that it is a safer way to store your money. Considering that you have to sleep in the streets most of the time, I would deposit my money to my bank account in case I got robbed - this never happened. I do not know if you can be mugged, but in ~8 hours of playtime the only way I ever lost money was if I chose to.\n\nThe item system can also use a gigantic rework, as I sincerely believe that most of the items are purely cosmetic. This includes both buyable and findable items - about 90% of the items I have serve little to no use. Another example, I am trying to get into my apartment, but the locks have been changed. I have a crowbar in my inventory that I found, so I naturally try to use it (to no avail). I do not know if most of the items serve a larger purpose.\n\nBesides the abovementioned points, there is a lot of different things you can do in the game. There are even brief mini-games that give you a break from the normal gameplay, which I found to be very nice.\n\nIf you like life simulators - that are limited (by the RPG Maker engine) - and narrative-focused games, try this one out. Be advised, the central theme revolves around moral compasses and love, so avoid this game if those do not interest you.\n\nI will suggest you to wait for the price to go down unless you are really interested in trying it out.\n\nRecommend.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","August 20, 2014","true","10.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","5"

Having said that, the game isn’t particularly fun or enjoyable and suffers from some slow pacing.  You basically do a bunch of menial, boring minigames as part of a life simulator – set up a stage for a band, put and remove coats from racks, help an old lady clean her apartment.  Unfortunately all these minigames just involve moving your character from one place to another and picking a menu option.  The story may be the main impetus for you to continue playing but it just cannot overcome the lack of interesting gameplay.  Maybe 10 years ago this game could have survived in the gaming market but today a $10 game competes with some of the best games of all time, and Always Sometimes Monsters just doesn’t quite cut it.","June 1, 2014","false","0.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

As it is, the JRPG format makes the game quite tedious.\n\n\nThe biggest problems are the mini-games and the lack of quest markers.\n\n\nThe mini games just break the pacing of the story line. One example is a storyline where you have to hack the electoral system to rig an election. To me, the important thing is whether you decide to rig the election, and which candidate to favour; rather than interrupting it with Frogger-TRON.\n\n\nThe lack of clear quest markers is a problem because this is a top-down RPG. Think of an old style adventure game where you would scan the screen with your mouse cursor to find the interactive elements. Here, you have to walk your character around the area and try interacting with all the surfaces to find the one that triggers the next phase of the "quest". One example is when you're told to start boxing. You would think you'd go to the boxing ring, nope. How about those two guys training with the hook and jab pads, nope. The guy training at the punch bag, nope. Turns out you have to go to the guy lifting weights in the corner to start boxing. I'm not asking to be led by the nose to the next quest trigger, but some of the trigger points are counter-intuitive and/or downright obtuse. The game is about making decisions, and this element of find-the-thing/trigger just breaks the pacing of the story.\n\n\nI didn't finish the game, I found the problems I've noted outweighed my curiosity at how the story would play out. The story is good, and in most places quite mature. I would like to see more from these developers, but not in the JRPG format.\n\n","June 1, 2014","false","10.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Unlike other games, Always Sometimes Monsters makes the player actually feel like they are in the game. You're constantly brought up with the theme of choice.  Every little thing is a choice. You're not forced to do whatever it is that you're doing.  If you don't want to let the man in the first minute speak, you can kill him and be done. If you are interested in his story, you can let him speak.   No matter what you do, it's all about choice, and that's what I enjoy about this game.\n\nLet's not forget about the music and art style. Even though the game is comprised of sprites, it's still great. The music is just amazing. It fits the story perfectly. It's like a typhoon of beauty.

Every moment you play its just about you either being a horrible person or others around you being scum of the earth. They throw you with all these political kinda views and horrors of society but not in a fun kinda way. More like a rapid slap to the face with no alternative solutions. You either take path A or path B....and both make you kinda feel guilty in the end.\n\nI managed to get through the whole thing to the end and....I can't really say the ending was a payoff at all.\n\n\n\n\nSPOILERS:\n\nYour choice is to let your romance be with their new lover and you end up on the streets as a failure....but if you take your romance back, their lover will end up on the streets as a failure. None of these options are enjoyable at all. Sure the first is the proper happy ending, but how can that be when your best friend has ended up on the streets as a vagabond to be gunned down.\n\nEveryone is bitter. Everyone is whiny. And everyone is a backstabber in this game. Heck, you are even forced to be one yourself. By the end of it, I felt kinda crummy.\n\nIn all, I think its more of an ARTSY kinda game so people who like that kinda stuff will probably get a kick outta it. For me? It really has no re-play value and I didn't care for it.","January 18","false","19.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I myself am still a bit torn on what to think about it. I love the idea and the execution is...fine but not flawless in my opinion. I think it's best I list a view points that could be of interest to potential buyers (NO spoilers!):\n- my first playthrough took me about 9h30min\n- you can't create your own character by choosing what they look like but you have several different characters (and significant others) to choose from at the beginning of the game\n- the story and characters are what drives the game\n- you really should be someone who enjoys these "choose your own adventure" kind of games\n- you should also be someone who's into these kinds of stories (about ordinary people and their daily struggles mixed in with a sappy love story)\n- the gameplay itself gets rather repetitive after a while\n- besides some mini-games (which range from being kinda fun to annoying), you will spend a lot of time walking and talking\n- the game has a high replayability if you care enough about the characters and story to make you wanna see all the different outcomes and paths\nAs there are so many different paths to play, you might want to consider checking out a playthrough on Youtube or so if you are still unsure on whether to buy the game or not. Might give you a good idea about the game's atmosphere which you really should get into if you hope to have a good time playing. So all in all, I decided to recommend this game as I love these types of story-driven, choice-making games in general and commend the developers for giving a game like this a chance. And once again: I think that if you can get into the story and characters enough, it'll make up for gameplay and you'll have a good time seeing how you're character's story unfolds.","May 26, 2014","true","13.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It is available on Steam for the low price of $10. In Always Sometimes Monsters, you have just lost the love of your life and you have not payed the rent of the month to the landlord. The landlord takes your keys, leaving you homeless when you receieve an invitation that the love of your life is marrying another man. You decide to go and interfere, causing a series of events to occur as you try to get to the wedding by the end of the month.\nStory - For the ten minutes I was very confused. Then, the story began to unfold letting me know I had to get to this girl in x amount of days or else it's all over. I have actually never seen this type of story in a game, so I definitely found it quite interesting to go through. There were surprises at every turn that allowed the game to go into more depth and the story is definitely worth an honorable mention.\nGraphics  - As mentioned above, this is an RPG game, a 2D one at that. This game was created on the RPG Maker, but it excels in what the engine gives it with some very smooth looking character models and creative art for the buildings. Saying that, the graphical art is definitely not spectacular, but it definitely fits with the RPG style of the whole game, which is more than many developers can say.\nControls - The controls do take some getting used to, but they are definitely not "clunky". The controls definitely could have been better, but they work and they work with little to no response time.\nFun Factor - I was very eager to play on the game, actually staying up later in the night than any other game that has released this year, which definitely means something. The replayablity of this game is very high as you can pick different decisions and some have a big difference in the game, which is one of the things I enjoy the most about this game.\nRecap Negatives - The controls could have been better, but were overall good. The graphics are nothing special, yet it is an RPG, so take that into consideration.\nFinal Score:  9/10","June 7, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I do not plan on coming back to it.)\n\nDespite its desperate pleas to be the Indie Game of the Now, Always Sometimes Monsters is a pretentious, sloppily-written slog of a game that deserves neither your time nor your money. Its two developers are far too comfortable hiding behind its laughable mission statement to bother crafting a believable world for its cast of shriveled archetypes to inhabit, and this oversight stops any momentum that its mildly interesting premise may have afforded. If video games are going to be taken seriously as a narrative form, at some point we're going to have to admit that merely donning the airs and vestments of intellectualism without actually saying anything of importance isn't enough to warrant critical attention. The only themes I got out of three hours of Always Sometimes Monsters were "choice matters," "laziness is bad," and "you're responsible for your actions."  If this truly deserves the bevy of positive "thinking man's" reviews that this title has received, maybe I'm in the wrong line of work.\n\n4/10","August 4, 2014","false","3.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/274310/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Pretty good game, but with some hiccups along the way. The game does a great job of telling and interesting story. It is also great how it tackles multiple subjects and can skirt the line of right/wrong with a bunch of decisions. There are multiple paths to take and multiple different things to do to reach your goal. You really get invested in your character and feel like the decisions he makes are what you chose. With all that said there are some problems. Sometimes the game only gives you cut and dry decisions, even though there should be more. Some of the things don't make sense. Like how in one part you have to have the money in a casino to pay a debt beforehand, even though it is reasonable to be able to ask for some time to go get the money or win it. Also, how a casino owner can murder someone in their casino and that is normal. Both of those are both illogical and not possible, only done to force certain things the developers wanted. Also in regards to good or bad endings, I hate how games do this. In order to get a "good" ending, you have to do this long list of irrelevant things that don't actually have an effect on the choice. How would an ex suddenly decide she doesn't like you because you stole money at a part 3 towns ago that she has no idea about. There should be multiple different ways to get a certain conclusion, not one specific set of prechosen things that you didn't know you had to do early on that seemingly didn't matter in the slightest. So i think they dropped the ball bigtime there.\n\nThen there is dealing with money. For some reason you never make money, and it only seems like the game decided to do this to make life more unfair than it actually is. Rigging an election and you get a "city funded credit card" but it only has 200 dollars.....a mayor would pay you 2k or more for that. Also, selling a high level rock star electric guitar and only getting 200 dollars, once again doesn't make sense. Then the idea you need to eat every night and tons, it seems a little much. And suddenly out of the blue you need 5k to attend a wedding and 10k for a debt, when you literally get no money all game. Poor decision making by the game. It is dumb how there are basically 2 endings though, as the game could be much more ambiguous and allow for a multitude of changes. Also could have been more realistic as I said before. P.S. the boxing was terribly done and could have been reworked to make it actually work and make sense and be strategic. It is annoying how most of the game is literally just walking around and talking to people, more variation would have been nice. It also was unrealistic how you cannot eat from the fridge of someone's house who you are staying at when they tell you you can. Big mistake. The dialogue and choices were also a misstep in how they are utilized. You can press a button to make the dialogue move faster, but most of the time a choice suddnely pops up unwarranted and if you are on a conversation and you double hit skip, it will make a choice for you already on the dialogue box that is about to pop up. Since you never know when this is going to happen and the game does an absolutely terrible job of letting you know, or giving a break before a choice, you will commonly choose something already, and you can't undo it. This was the biggest flaw of the game and worst annoyance. All in all the game did captivate my attention and I enjoyed some of it, but they should have ultimately had more realistic ending that you could actually influence in many different ways. 6.5/10.","April 14, 2015","true","18.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You go around talking to your guests, which all offer a drink. Whoever you pick then becomes your character for the rest of the game as you decide their names by what you write on his birthday card.  It's a more interesting than the usual selection menu and while it may feel like a small detail, I really liked how this was handled.\n\nI very much enjoyed this game but I'm going to come across as negative review - the game is made on the RPG Maker engine, which I have used but don't particularly like. You press space-bar to progress dialogue but also choose your decision so if you're reading quickly you might occasionally select the wrong thing if you don't expect a dialogue box to show up or talk to a character again once they've finished speaking. They aren't bad but I'm not a particular fan of the engine's graphics either - individual environment sprites look very nice and the title screen is gorgeous but you can always tell that RPGMaker uses a square tile-based grid because grass instantly turns into a pavement with no overlays or curves. These are all personal grudges however and ones I'd apply to more games than just this one.\n\nThe writing isn't perfect - None of the characters converse like real people, but this is a video game so I can forgive it and the overall plot was interesting enough that while I noticed it frequently, I wasn't particularly bothered by it. I actually felt kinda bad for my character, although some of the choices made would definitely make them unsympathetic. A lot of the decisions are fairly big and really interesting - there's one right at the end that I loved and seriously struggled with.\n\nAlways Sometimes Monsters is set over a course of 30 in-game days, doing certain tasks will move time forward and at the end, you need to sleep. I enjoy games that use time as a mechanic and there was a genuine thought of '♥♥♥♥ I need to get moving, I might actually miss this wedding' while playing, so I feel it's done well.  The idea is that each day brings different tasks, certain shops are only open at x times and it's appreciated, because it gives you a direction to go in.\n\nThe initial task is to get money so you can pay your apartment rent and get the key back. When the game has things going for it, choices to make and new things occurring, it's a lot of fun to see you're taking the story and I seriously got into it. The game doesn't have enough plots/choices for all 30 days so sometimes, while it starts off very strongly, the flow can get broken and you'll wake up from your bed wondering if there's something I'm missing somewhere or if I should just spent the day making money.  For example, a certain character offered to give me a lift, which was great, they said they'd contact me in a few days which I then spent killing time because there didn't seem to be any objectives left.\n\nOn a different engine with more experienced writers, this game has a potential to be a lot better, which isn't to say it's bad. I stuck with Always Sometimes Monsters to the end and I'm glad I did - the ending was good and the journey was worth sticking with. It deserves praise for trying new things and bringing fresh ideas, not all of which work, but it gets points for trying.","July 31, 2015","true","12.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

In the beginning of the game, it felt really weird and I felt as though the game didn't know which genre it wanted to be. After getting past the introduction; however, that is where the real drama happens and I was pleasantly surprised by how great the quality of the narrative is.\n\nBasically, you are trying to get to the wedding of your ex in the next 30 days, but you are broke and have no family or any other means to help you get to where you need to go. Fufilling jobs, getting favors, and doing side missions, all the while keeping your stamina needs up are key to winning the game. There's also a choice system as well, and depending on your actions, you can change the ending of the game.\n\nHonestly, Always Sometimes Monsters felt as though I was binging a Netflix series. The game is just beautiful in terms of how immersive the storyline can be. I made myself the main character and my partner as the ex and things got real pretty quickly!\n\nAlso, I have to give the creators a round of applause for allowing not only interracial relationships but also same sex relationships as well.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent narrative with real customization options to make the story your own.\n+Game play that really keeps you on edge, clock ticking anxiety makes it exhilarating.\n+Mini-games are really fun and quite symbolic to life as well.\n+The soundtrack is really good! Very memorable soundtrack.\n\nCons:\n- The choice sections come up really fast. I wish there was a delay or something before the choices come up, because there has been numerous occasions where I would hit the space bar to progress dialogue and accidentally make a choice that I didn't want to make!!! Please somehow fix that!\n\nOverall, I would most definitely reccomend Always Sometimes Monsters. I just finished the game and I'm still emotional at the ending I got. Definitely worth the time and money. It's like reading an interactive book.

(Of course, like the game points out, there's got to be at least a million words in this thing, so, the fact that less than a dozen got spelled wrong is not damnable.)\n\nUpsetting, plot-damaging bugs abound.  Nothing game breaking, but some sources of confusion and dismay.  (A testimony, perhaps, to the power of the game, which drives one to complete tasks, to witness the consequences of one's actions and really experience the result of their action.)\n\nAs some have noted, the tone of the writing (dialogue, in particular) is occasionally sophomoric.  A fine description of it likened it to Kevin Smith - to which I would only add that while it bears a resemblance to Smith's fascination with blending the scatological and the emotional, the humane and the profane -- it also has a feel distinctly like Richard Linklater's existential slacker philosopher-poets.\n\nAnd yes, it offers a staggering array of choice in everything other than the main plot, which occasionally railroads you sharply and channels you in one, inexorable direction.  (One might note that the game never claimed to be a sandbox, and offers rather more narrative selection than any other RPG I'm aware of.)\n\nAll that said, fresh from my second playthrough -- hot damn, if you can get past that, you're in for a real treat.  This is a complicated little machine, and the charm of it isn't in the polish, but in the fact that it is something new and fresh and original and kind of brilliant.  It is some supercharged mutant unleashed on the indie gaming public, and for people who can pick up it's wavelength, it's possibly going to spoil mainstream twitch-reflex gaming for you forever.\n\nThere are some real feels that can be had playing through this thing if you give in to the immersion -- heightened, rather than than in spite of, the occasionally cumbersome interface.  Some of the mini-games had me holding my breath, or tense, concerned about the consequences.  Some of the more emotional moments evoked a powerful, visceral reaction.  One noteable moment of horrific violence involving a poorly secured satellite dish made me laugh out loud, torn between horror at what I had so casually done, delight at the response from the NPCs, and shock at this unexpected shift in tone and action.  And while the dialogue is occasionally a little clunky, the underlying narrative structure and overall outlook of the game was done by someone with a fine capacity for empathy and a more than uncommon understanding of the human condition.\n\nIf anyone out there still has doubts about a videogame's capacity to be a storytelling medium or a work of art, point them at Always Sometimes Monsters, which in uniqueness and singularity of vision is surpassed, possibly, only by - maybe - a work of artisinal obsession like Dwarf Fortress.\n\nFor you fans of post-modernism -- you are in for a treat and then some.\n\nEven if this game, in play, was a disaster, I would have given it a postive review for it's ambition and it's outlook.  A relief, then, to be able to endorse it even more full throttle than that -- this game is really playable, and despite a little bit of 'ugh, I have to play THIS level again?' lends itself well to more than one replay.  I'll probably let it cool down for a week or three, but I can see myself returning to it soon.\n\nI simply can't say enough good things about this game.  Thanks, Vagabond Dog, for an awesome experience.","May 25, 2014","true","43.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I enjoyed this game all the way through, at times the game was a little bit boring, like where I found myself doing things like killing pigs twice a day just to get $100, but other than that it was an excellent experience. The game throws a lot of tough choices which change everything depending on what you choose, some of these choices are really difficult to choose from and they also add a lot of tension to the game. The game also features fun little minigames. The storyline is brilliant and makes you want to just keep on playing just to find out what happens. I was very happy with the art style and soundtrack.\n\nI rate this game 8/8 m8.\nWould gibus again.","July 6, 2014","true","12.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's designed so that players can take a great number of diverging paths through the story and choices will have lasting effects on the story.\n\nThough it is an RPG in some form, always sometimes monsters is not about galiantly slaying dragons to save a princess in a mystical land. It is in fact set in modern day life and has no combat. Yep thats right no combat, the game is about living through the eyes of your chosen character, living in his or her set of circumstances. Essenatially is a game about the modern human experience and all the trails that it entails.\n\nWhen the game starts, you are at a party for Larry who appear to work at a book publisher. You first take control of larry and can talk to the people in his apartment, depending on who you toast with, this will become your main character. Once selected you take control of the main character and head out onto the patio where depending on who you talk to will determine your other half and ultimately your sexuality. After this point the characters all toast with larry after he offers to sign you up to publish your book that is a work in progress.\n\nThe game then skips to one year later and you find yourself in your run down apartment, broke, single and owing your landlord $500 rent which you must somehow find by the end of the day or risk eviction. Its clear early on that everything has gone horribly wrong for you so your first task is too not get evicted and so you head out to find some work. As the story progresses, you find out the reasons why your in the position your in now, why the love of your life left and some important meaningful twists along the way.\n\nThe gameplay is limited in the game you have the ability to move and interact with objects thats it. There are various mini-games in the game that range from playing video games in the arcade to the processes involved in the various jobs you may encounter. Each day includes a morning, afternoon and night cycle. You will have limited time during the day to accomplish tasks, usually the time will progress after you have done a certain task for example should you go to a job in the morning, once you finish it will be afternoon. The day night cycle is also important for certain events, an example of this is if someone is meeting you at night, should you miss this appointment you won't get a second opportunity. The last major gameplay element is stamina, your character has a stamina bar that can be refilled with food and drink, it's important to keep your stamina up especially if you end up sleeping rough in the streets or you may not survive the night.\n\nThe game can be very tedious at times, it can be frustrating and annoying. The limited gameplay and controls can take it's tolls, as can real life. While it is frustrating and tedious at times once your involved with the characters and story it becomes irrelevant. There's so much to experience in the game that the lack of gameplay and ultimately variety doesn't matter.\n\nThe games content deals with multiple social, domestic and financial issues. Even right at the beginning of the game your tasting desperation. Love issues,  money issues, unemployment and more are right at the beginning of the game. The experience of the situations you come across in the game will resonate with you personally. Many people including myself have encountered many forms of desperation in life. Depending on your choice of character, race and sexuality in the game will also change things too. You will encounter racism, prejudice and more.","May 27, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A good or a bad friend? Do you want to save a life of a person or let him die? For some of these i literally had to stop for a bit of time  to think about it and these decisions are really hard to make, like life is generally.

You can also put hundreds of packages into a van until you realise at the end that all this time was lost for nothing (srsly dont, just dont do it, i raged so hard). And if this didnt convince you, you can also masturbate under the shower and poop in the toilet :D Nahhhh but seriously this game is awesome, you need to buy it to understand what im talking about.

Despite the fact that there was zero combat, it still kept me quite engaged - mainly because I was invested in the narrative.\n\nThere were small things I could nitpick about it, like the mini-games you use the gain money are quite mind-numbing. However, that's pretty much all meaning jobs. So I understood what they were trying to capture there, but it was a tad too on the nose.\n\nAt the end of the game, your choices are reflected very well in my opinion. There were some complaints about you, as the player, making the choice of others, but I was a little more forgiving of that. Needless to say, my ending was rather dark. It made me very sad because I've had to make those choices in my personal life and could relate to how brutal that can be.\n\nIf you are interested in games with a decent narrative and don't mind the mini-games, I would highly suggest giving it a shot. It's not often a game makes you sit down and reflect on your own choices. A game that has the ability to do that has my recommendation.","March 6, 2015","true","15.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

About halfway through I stopped really caring because of a few reasons.\n1. The game sets you up as a character who is perceived as hated by most everyone, yet is still wildly important (even outside of the scope of their own narrative) for some reason.\n2. You don't have to play to this character at all but the game will always act like you do.\n3. The plot's predictable, I knew about an hour in who the guy in the alley was going to turn out to be (though apparently it can turn out to be someone else in the good ending? Whatever.)\n\nEventually I was just "okay whatever I just want to get to the end" and went all sociopath on a lot of things. Whoops, me rushing got some scumbag killed. How terrible. Oh no, I lost a blackjack. Time to save and reload, because you can do that in real life. It's just not believeable. I know the intention of the game isn't to be "fun" and I was fine with the tedious parts. I had more issue with trying to figure out how to progress the game at certain points, though. And the game seems way too eager to criticize you for choices when it doesn't give you all the options available.\n\nI like the overall concept of this game and it's certainly not bad but it mostly left me frustrated by the end of it.\n\nThough honestly I'm not sure how to even review this properly. It'll probably get a second playthrough at some point, since I think it merits it (a lot of stuff I didn't do from the sound of things...)","January 14, 2015","false","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They could build houses out of their own dung and forage for change down by the shore. They could even set up little shops where they exchange pickles and dirty moonshine for spare change. In time, they'd have their own thriving economy. Their sons and daughters would be brought up int he same way, they would evolve genes to become expert change hunters, sending people to the mainlands to collect change and malt liqour, fetching a high price at home in place of their dirty moonshine full of ♥♥♥♥.

There will some MINOR SPOILERS, but I will mostly refer to the begining of the game, but ever so vague. Well, let us begin :)\n\nStory: You are a character that has his/her life is in shambles and loses his/her boyfriend/girlfriend after the prologue of the game. Soon enough, you recieve an invitation to your ex's wedding ceremony that will occur in 30 days. It is your job to go get your ex back. Or is it?\n\nGraphics: It's pixel art so what do you expect? Kidding aside, it suits the game quite nicely in my opinion.\n\nMusic: I love the music so much. Many songs will repeat, but you will never get tired of it, at least I didn't.\n\nGameplay: I did not say this before, but this game will not appeal to everyone because all you practically do is read. I see this game more as a Visual Novel rather than a game to be honest, but it is a really good one at that. There is a lot of text in the game, but with good reason. This game is all about choice. A lot of games that are out now have "choices" in them, but this has to be the best game to deliver choice thus far in my opinion (Yes I have played Mass Effect 1-3 and Witcher 1-2 and I love them both if that means anything). Every choice you make, whether it being in dialogue or in action, it carries weight. What I love even more are that these choices are very subtle. There is no moral meter, light/dark, or red/blue. All of the choices are grey and does not have a big sign showing "Make big decision here!!"\nThere are also various minigames to play to break the reading which are actually quite fun.\n\nPros:\n+Story\n+Music\n+Gameplay\n+CHOICES\n\nCons:\n-Gameplay (I put it here twice because there is a lot of reading, but it didn't bother me)\n\n\nIn all, I had a great time playing the game. I believe that it was worth the $10 (got it for $9 though). The story is very engrossing and can sometimes give you the feels. In the end, we are Always Sometimes Monsters.\n\nIf you read this far, thank you because this was my first review and I carried 100 boxes Vagabond!!!!","May 23, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Mass Effect, Fallout 3, and others like it are all victim to having choice systems with no consequences. Always Sometimes Monsters nails the choice thing in spades.\n\nIt's set up like an old-skool rpg, with a top down view. No need for a mouse on this game, so if you're a laptop gamer with no mouse, check this out. I don't want to spoil anything, but you play as a person (you choose the gender, in a rather unorthodox, but pretty cool way) attempting to stop their true love from marrying the wrong person. This game is amazing, but the only flaw is in the temp. agency jobs. You can work at a temp agency to make money, but it gets tedious FAST. It's a small part of the game, but it does make me get bored easily, however, the inventive story and thoughtful storytelling pretty much makes up for that small flaw.\n\nIn short: choice is weighted, buy this game if you're a fan of old-skool RPG-style games with tons of meta-humour and pop-culture gags.","May 25, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

If you ever played The Sims 2 on PSP, it's akin to this in the sense you're just an ordinary person trying to do tasks to stay alive and accomplish your goal. Since there isn't too much in terms of complex gameplay, the game has to rely on its story, which is serviceable but nothing special.

Never have I had a game make me cringe, especially a 2d rpg, the people's personalities, are like that from a novel, realistic but a bit over the top, it's not the annoying sunshine happy land and idiotic random remarks and comments you get from normal npc's in most games.\n\nI still feel let down, and this will probably be a game I pick up and play when bored and have nothing to do, but for the 9$ I got it for, it's ok, and to all the people who undoubtedly will complain its not worth the price, it's the cost of a cup of coffee and a donut nowaday, if your to poor, dont buy it, it's a story about you.","May 22, 2014","true","6.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Buy it, its good.\n\nAlways Sometimes Monsters is all about choice. Will you be a nice guy/gal to everyone you meet, or will you steal  and cheat your way through? A basic plot synopsis would be you are a struggling writer who is kicked out of your apartment the day before you get a wedding invitation from your ex girl/boyfriend. You make it your mission to get to the wedding and jumpstart your career, but what you do along the way, and what happens when you get there, is up to you.\n\nIt has a really cool intro in picking your character. You will talk to a bunch of people at a party, and whoever you choose to take a drink with is your character. The same idea goes for your love interest. It has a very Pokemon-esque or RPG Maker like art style, one that I quite enjoy.\n\nBut it also has some very annoying mechanics. There is no mouse based support, all actions must be done through the keyboard. There is gamepad support, but I don't have one and therefore cannot comment on it. But to me a PC game where I can't use my mouse is really frustrating. Scaling the screen is also bugged right now. I could scale my screen down to a small resolution, but if I wanted it to go back, no amount of F6 would make it so unless I restarted. There are also typos and accidents galore in the text. For example, one time it called the same person a man and a woman, in the same line of dialogue.\n\nBut this game has plenty of positives. The choices you make in this game are everywhere. You never know how important a choice is, but it is amazing how much choice you really have. It mostly does boil down to a simple Fate system similar to a Fable-like morality, but quite enjoyable none-the-less. This bonanza of choice also means a replay is almost necessary. I loved seeing the different results my second time through. On my first blind playthrough it took about 10 hours, and I have played through it twice so far, and have no plans to stop now, despite the problems. Music and the soundtrack were nothing to write home about, and there is only around 6-7 songs, little to no sound effects, and no voice acting at all.\n\n\nPROS AND CONS\n\n+ Choice. It is what this game is all about, and they did a great job with it. There is at least three endings, and almost assuredly more.\n+ Characters. While what you and your love interest look like is up to you, what you decide changes how people react to you. I was a lesbian couple in the first play and lots of people were uncomfortable with it in the game. Just a nice touch.\n\n- Mechanics. As already described, this game could absolutely use some more time in the oven and smoothing of some edges. Lots of typos, and annoying systems.\n\nOVERALL: 8/10. For only 9 or 10 dollars, this is a great pickup. But just be aware that at least as I am writing this, there are some problems that I hope get fixed.\n","May 25, 2014","true","21.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game made me hurt.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, on to the actual review.\n\nThe game is split into several different towns that you move through on the way to win back your love. There is no tutorial, the game drops you into the world and immediately starts throwing punches, left and right. You get kicked out of your apartment and learn that your love is marrying someone else at the end of the month. The atmosphere of desperation is palpable as you struggle to rustle up enough cash for a bus ticket, though that's not the only way to get to San Verdano...\n\nIn terms of actual gameplay, Always Sometimes Monsters doesn't really offer much. The job missions tend to be repetitive and tedious - whether or not this was an intentional choice I'm unsure, but it certainly reflects the boredom such tasks would inflict in real life! The side missions that actually provide a modicum of entertainment value cost money and generally provide no reward for their completion. These, however, pale in comparison to the most glaring flaw in the entire design: the boxing minigame. In order to take a high road, you must complete this four-part debacle - it took me five days. There is no way to definitely win any given boxing match, as it is essentially a six-piece rock-paper-sickle game and you have to guess what sort of punch or dodge your opponent is going to use. Foes have tendencies, but don't always stick to them, so you can still be KOed due to a random anomaly.\n\nThese things aside, I was wrapped up in my journey across the country. The story pulled me in and made me feel for my character, tugging me further down the road - and here is where I found a flaw in the diamond, as it were: The journey felt so urgent and important that I hardly felt able to stop and look left or right. I often found myself with downtime between main quest missions, but side activities that didn't feel tedious and trite were difficult to find. The few times side missions were hinted, such as running into a frustrated woman at city hall and then again at the drug store, I couldn't figure out how to progess any further. The rest of the game felt bare-bones, without much content beyond the main quest.\n\nDespite how negative this review looks, I would recommend this game - for the price and the experience, this is a worthwhile investment. The ending offers the opportunity for flawless victory and crushing defeat, and sadly, for me, mine was crushing defeat. To play this game, I think you need to not view it as a game, and instead try to step into the shoes of your character. Emphasis on the RP in RPG.","May 25, 2014","true","26.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You are in control of a main character who isn't clear cut good or bad and the choices you make aren't always so simple to make. Do you ruin another person's life to save another person life? Do you object taking a reward or do you take more than what someone says you can take? Do you stab someone in the back to get ahead or let your own life crumble to make someone else happy? The game often asks those kind of questions and expects you to answer. If you can accept that not every story has a happy ending then you probably can embrace this game cause chances are you probably won't get the "Good Ending" on the first try but if you keep trying you should be able to. The story and the journey to find out how the end plays out are part of what makes this a good game and a different experience from other games out there.\n\nI like how the game allows you to choose the main character and love interest in a way that isn't as simple as click this box for male or this box for female. Also this game does allow you to have same sex couples too for those that don't want to play as the straight couple. I wish there was a way to customize your character but there are a few varieties to choose from. For some of the major characters you can see their motivations and see the reasoning behind some of the things they do for better or worse as the game goes.\n\nSome of the games drawbacks are that there doesn't seem to be a run button(You will wish that you can run sometimes), the choices while sometimes in the grey area of right and wrong they don't always have positive or negative impacts on the world after the fact and don't make you like it mattered. Some of the choices do affect game though and in the end you have to answer for your choices and actions(Think last chapter of the Walking Dead videogame season 1) Some of the mini-games are fun and are nods to classic games(Like Frogger and Pac-Man)  however most of the jobs that you have do to earn cash are boring and repetive (I guess just like real life).\n\nFor this price I feel the game is worth while and you will be playing this game for several hours to try get the good ending for you and your love.

However, this feels like more of an adventure game than an RPG being that there is no actual character advancement.\n\nThe mini-games are subpar (but they are only mini-games, after all) - but they are, unfortunately, occasionally required.  In fact, a particular mini-game can bog down progression temporarily until you master it (or guess your way through it).  However, the actual story narritive is great, and you'll want to talk to every person you come across to uncover both humor and drama that are thickly spackled around the story of the actual protagonist - your protagonist.\n\nSo many decisions littered so liberally throughout the game and several ways the game can end lend to a good amount of replayability - in fact, you'll probably find yourself playing the game repeatedly just to see what might happen if you choose to behave a different way, or assist different people.","May 27, 2014","true","15.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's hard to talk about it without spoilering, I need to admit that, so I intend to keep it spoilerfree yet tell you "enough" about it.\n\nWhat do I pay for?\nWhat you get is a game made with the famous RPG-Maker - in whatever version. For those who don't know: That means the graphics are not highest standard. Though I have to say that this game has an amazing menu structure compared to what most RPG-Maker games have. It's not standard and you can see that the developers of the game put much, very much effort into it. They really tried to provide us, the players, with all necessary information and give us tough choices to make.\n\nIt's the little things\nTalking to people. Usually if you speak with an NPC they have one line and repeat themselves constantly if you try talking to them again. Here they have a couple of lines they say - which is very refreshing! There's sidequests, LOADS of minigames - some of which I don't get but that's just me. Additionally to that, the characters have personality. They have a background. And most of the characters - mostly those for that you can do something - have an avatar. Now if you know RPG-Maker games, that usually means it's a little square with a face, right? Not here. Nope. They let artists help them and they did a splendid job! The characters have not the usual totally exaggerated facial expressions, they have a body. You usually get to see people from head to mid-thighs. That adds to the atmosphere of the game, absolutely.\nOh. Right. And you can choose what gender you want to play and what gender your partner shall have. You can choose from about - what - ten people? Let's say ten for your main character and another ten for your partner!\n\nThe main story\nIt is a lovestory, yes. But the game doesn't define itself by the lovestory. It's all the choices that come across your way, all the possible ways to solve your problems and piling up more problems as you go. It's watching a character who grows close to you with which you identify over time getting past obstacles to find his/her way. I played the main story mostly and I've been very well entertained through it. I can't say there would've been a moment in which I felt bored in that game and that - for me - is something special.\nSomething about the romance - don't read if you don't want to get spoilered at least a LITTLE: The romance felt a bit flat. The characters fell in love too quickly and the ending was pretty aprupt, I got to admit that. But it's not bad, because if you want to play a game where you go on dates and feed each other chocolate, play a dating simulator.\n\nBottom line\nLong story short? Buy the game. It's amazing, it's fun and I felt like I finally paid for a game again in a suitable amount for what I get from it. And I might add: I don't like to buy games at high prices (high beginning at >25€). You get minigames, you get a lovestory, you get choices to make, you get to think about consequences more - it's fun. Do it.","May 31, 2014","true","21.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And I must admit it is very interesting. This game is heavily focused on story. I have seen so far one choice which can change the outcome of the story I could have either  Talked a character called Jack out of commiting suiced or talk to him and not be able to stop him from doing it. If he doesnt commit suicide you get a free bus ride :D  Overall this game is very good but there are some things that kinda I wish were implemented.\n\nIn this game I found myslef lost at some points. Not knowing where to go what to do. Eventually something happend but it took a while to figure out what to do. Also there is no mute button for the music/soundfx's which I would like alot as I would like to have something of my playing in the background or no in game music so I can skype with friends.\n\nOveral this is a good game but feels empty at times. It would be better if there was a mute button though and the little box for a screen feels kinda odd to me.\n\nI would give this game 9.5/10 I really think a mute button should be a feature.\n\nThis game is worth a buy.","May 24, 2014","true","8.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It managed to make me attatched to the main trio that are thrown into the game (You, your lover, and your best friend aka Sam.) and even some side characters! It felt somewhat slow at times but at others I was often torn between choices. I warn you now if you play thins game and often make wrong choices this game WILL make you feel like crap. It really brings out the underbelly of reality, and how life is often unfair. Also how ♥♥♥♥ can hit the fan REALLY fast. Its such an open system that you can play this several times and stll get several endings (at least I pray there is, I've already started replaying). Its soooo good! I know for me personaly I felt like I was going through a life time of choices and my idea of right was slowly morphed over the course of the game.

You are in control of a main character who isn't clear cut good or bad and the choices you make aren't always so simple to make. Do you ruin another person's life to save another person life? Do you object taking a reward or do you take more than what someone says you can take? Do you stab someone in the back to get ahead or let your own life crumble to make someone else happy? The game often asks those kind of questions and expects you to answer. If you can accept that not every story has a happy ending then you probably can embrace this game cause chances are you probably won't get the "Good Ending" on the first try but if you keep trying you should be able to. The story and the journey to find out how the end plays out are part of what makes this a good game and a different experience from other games out there.\n\nI like how the game allows you to choose the main character and love interest in a way that isn't as simple as click this box for male or this box for female. Also this game does allow you to have same sex couples too for those that don't want to play as the straight couple. I wish there was a way to customize your character but there are a few varieties to choose from. For some of the major characters you can see their motivations and see the reasoning behind some of the things they do for better or worse as the game goes.\n\nSome of the games drawbacks are that there doesn't seem to be a run button(You will wish that you can run sometimes), the choices while sometimes in the grey area of right and wrong they don't always have positive or negative impacts on the world after the fact and don't make you like it mattered. Some of the choices do affect game though and in the end you have to answer for your choices and actions(Think last chapter of the Walking Dead videogame season 1) Some of the mini-games are fun and are nods to classic games(Like Frogger and Pac-Man)  however most of the jobs that you have do to earn cash are boring and repetive (I guess just like real life).\n\nFor this price I feel the game is worth while and you will be playing this game for several hours to try get the good ending for you and your love. Just be prepared to know that people are always sometimes monsters.","May 27, 2014","true","11.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

However, this feels like more of an adventure game than an RPG being that there is no actual character advancement.\n\nThe mini-games are subpar (but they are only mini-games, after all) - but they are, unfortunately, occasionally required.  In fact, a particular mini-game can bog down progression temporarily until you master it (or guess your way through it).  However, the actual story narritive is great, and you'll want to talk to every person you come across to uncover both humor and drama that are thickly spackled around the story of the actual protagonist - your protagonist.\n\nSo many decisions littered so liberally throughout the game and several ways the game can end lend to a good amount of replayability - in fact, you'll probably find yourself playing the game repeatedly just to see what might happen if you choose to behave a different way, or assist different people.","May 27, 2014","true","15.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You get minigames, you get a lovestory, you get choices to make, you get to think about consequences more - it's fun.

And I must admit it is very interesting. This game is heavily focused on story. I have seen so far one choice which can change the outcome of the story I could have either  Talked a character called Jack out of commiting suiced or talk to him and not be able to stop him from doing it. If he doesnt commit suicide you get a free bus ride :D  Overall this game is very good but there are some things that kinda I wish were implemented.\n\nIn this game I found myslef lost at some points. Not knowing where to go what to do. Eventually something happend but it took a while to figure out what to do. Also there is no mute button for the music/soundfx's which I would like alot as I would like to have something of my playing in the background or no in game music so I can skype with friends.\n\nOveral this is a good game but feels empty at times. It would be better if there was a mute button though and the little box for a screen feels kinda odd to me.\n\nI would give this game 9.5/10 I really think a mute button should be a feature.\n\nThis game is worth a buy.","May 24, 2014","true","8.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game gives choices but never really makes them feel like they've really had an impact. This time, in this game, "Always Sometimes Monsters" Delivers tat impact.

With the ability to follow the story or even forgo it this game is a marvel.\n\nWhen seeing the breaking of the fourth wall I instantly fell in love. This is a game that, at first, I figured wouldn't work. I mean a game where the main gameplay mechanic is choices and dialogue trees . . . but it works. It's a wondeful achievement and I cannot wait to see what these guys do next.\n\nOne major issue I hadd with this game is f12, mostly used for screenshots in steam, is the game reset button. . .

You then play as a black man who looks like a young Forest Whitaker who doesn’t really do anything other than walk around and talk to rich people. Always Sometimes Monsters is a great example of the overbearing upper class fighting the liberal youth of the underprivileged children of the urban cities and if you are looking for a deep, complex social analysis of modern racial struggles I would recommend this game.","November 11, 2014","true","1.9"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

The reason I love it is because it is different. In a way if you play the game seriously and try to make choices based on what you would do in the situation it kinda analyzes you. Always Sometimes Monsters also adds in a lot of replayability because it is very open to how you shape the story.\n\nSo people who are into more action and fast paced gameplay with defined enemies may not want to purchase this game because you will find none of that. In this game you are the enemy if you choose to be and so is life itself.

"There is none good, no, not one." During my ten hour playthrough I constantly thought of these Biblical teachings so that I would make the best possible "morally right" choices through the game. Then again, morals are only based on popular opinion, and this game really digs deep into our morals. No matter the conclusion, be it a sad, a good, or a controversial ending, the outcomes really weighed upon me, which goes to show that a game doesn't need great graphics to tell a good story. That is what I believe the developers at Vagabond Dog were trying to do: make a story to be remembered for years to come, be it sad, good, or controversial. For ten dollars, Always Sometimes Monsters will take you on a journey of love, sacrifice, hate, and greed.

But a quick internet search proves the opposite. Looking back, I can see that (virtually) every decision one makes in this game is about profiting money or not, and the choices made by the player change more about the NPCs lives than their own. I also could not yet understand how the very beginning of the game, the part with the mafioso guy, relates to everything else. In conclusion, the developers could have had put a lot more effort into the storyline, as it can be pretty deceiving, and the teaser video is also very misleading.\n\nOn the other hand, if one does not care very much about the storyline they can enjoy the game for a while. The pixel graphics and sprites are very well-made, but could have been better if the developers have used less colours and some dithering. The close-up of the characters are sometimes too anime-ish and ordinary and do not fit the game style. The soundtrack is the part which I have little or  nothing to complain about, and can act as a filler for the feelings that the story fails to deliver.\n\nTalking about system requirements, this game needs a lot of disk space (320MB+) compared to it's graphics (here comes in the dithering and limited colour palettes I talked about, it could have reduced the image size A LOT). Sound could also have been better compressed, and the developers could have stuck to just one sound algorithm, instead of using both MP3 and OGG. This game is also very CPU and RAM demanding, and will probably not run in older or “weaker” machines. But I think that this all is because of RPG Maker. I also could not make the game fullscreen, as it would just lose the window borders and stay the same size. Doubling the window size makes the graphics lose quality due to interpolation. I also could not take screenshots with the Steam hotkey (F12) as the game would just crash or quit to the title screen. But I think these problems are caused by Wine.\n\nLast thing is that Always Sometimes Monsters really lacks a tutorial or a key setup menu. The player isn't really supposed to know the controls beforehand and has to guess them.\n\nAfter all, I feel that I cannot relate or empathize with this game's plot, and that's just because it is pretty shallow, linear and filled with “gratuitous violence” (like lots of people dying all the time). As the first game I bought on steam it was a very disappointing experience. I'll try to finish the game with at least one character, but I think this game is not really worth my time.\n\nLong story short:\n\nGraphics: 7/10 – Nice pixel graphics, but sometimes seeming out of place;\nSoundtrack: 8/10 – The best part of this game is the soundtrack;\nStory: 2/10 – Could have been much better if the developers had put a bit of effort into it;\nSystem: 1/10 – Consumes way too much computing resources, there are better games out there which are less resource-hungry.\n\nOverall: 4,5/10\n\nP.S.: I apologize for any spelling error or weird sentences, as English is not my first language.","December 25, 2014","false","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shonaningyo/recommended/274310/","shonaningyo","ShonaNingyo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shonaningyo/","215 products in account","I like RPGs, and I find that the closer to real life it is --no magic, supernatural ghosties or demons or 'anime logic' plaguing it-- the more invested I am in it.\n\nYadda yadda yadda, it was a fun game. You have no tutorial from the very start. If you've played a game of this type before, you can *assume* (and be correct) in that you move with arrow keys/WASD and confirm/prompt with Space/Enter, mouse not required. That's good!\n\nWhat I found confusing was the very first scene, which was essentially your sprite lobby in the form of a party. You choose which person to take a swig of alcohol with (being the unofficial straight edge person that I am it didn't feel right, but whatever, I'm still a child in an adult woman's body so I should suck it up to keep the game moving xP), and then choosing among the throng on the patio who your "lover" is. I didn't know this was how my avatar was chosen so I picked a cute-looking guy in a brown hoodie and once I realized I was picking my partner's avatar I just walked up to a nice intellectual with a blue sweater.\n\nTogether, we were ALEX and MISCHA. And our love, for the long game time it was--and the fairly brief real time minutes it was--was beautiful. But I had to go and ♥♥♥♥ it up and now I'm pining for my babe as a deadbeat writer in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ apartment.\n\nAnd that's where I start! In a rundown, bum-filled city with a day to procure $500 to pay rent because apparently I'm that irresponsible and that's only the first 10 minutes of the game! Freaking Adventure Quest up in this ♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nThe little observations my character makes are a mixture of deadpan snark and actual emotion. When you pick a choice between being a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or actual decent human being or at times neutral, the dialogue corresponds with it. I find that in some RPGs your character is secretly aligned with a temperament already and if your choices go against that temperament that you have built up or is already in place, your choice is played out halfheartedly, which is lame. So what if I want to change my character's outlook half way through?! The puppy needs a home! I don't care if I robbed that game's safe of their start-up money two minutes prior, I'm a changed man/lady/sprite-thing!\n\nThis game is a slice of life, find-your-own-way, make-ends-meet, there-are-quite-a-few-ways-you-can-go-about-this, but-don't-♥♥♥♥-it-up-too-hard-ya? RPG that I settled into almost immediately. The problem with ME, not the game, is that I'm so indecisive. I'm that person who has at least three fingers on different pages when reading Choose Your Own Adventure books (one joke from Family Guy comes to mind "AAah! a dragon! Lois my finger was on the page! Do you see it Lois?! Do you see!") so making big 'this or that' decisions in this game was nail-biting and I glanced at one of Steam's "Perfect Ending" guides just to see if I was heading in a relatively good direction on my own (I was, hurray for me!).\n\nI don't know about you, but games like these...I play as if this were real life because as delayed as I am in understanding social skills, I still recognize and understand that there is right and wrong to be followed. I played my character as close to my own personal tenants as possible and reeled in urges to steal as much as possible (I just love snapping up free things. It's a curse and a blessing) but I think what makes this game worthwhile is realizing that my decisions are--morally at least--the right ones and I'm a bit proud of myself for guiding my imaginary self through this gray concrete jungle to something hopefully better, filled with understanding, connections with old faces and new ones, and trying to set things right.\n\nAnd I recommend this game if you want to feel like I do. Realistic situations (at least from my limited perspective, ha), engaging characters that you actually care to read what they say (not entirely memorable, but I recall who they are when I see them appear time and again on my journey to that big sunset stretching across the highway or whatever I'm aiming for), and a little leeway for you to do a bit of what you want on the side while still keeping in mind that you're on a schedule as soon as you sign yourself up for some commitments and odd jobs. It really is like real life. Sort of. A fraction of real life.\n\nOh, quick critique!\n\nI found that I was pressing the equivalent of the fast-forward button for text because I hate waiting for it to be spelled out and instead like it to be just all there for me to read at once and then continue; when I did I often pressed a choice that I didn't know was going to appear and made a few mistakes. Quite frustrating because I'm used to fast-forwarding, then after pressing "continue" the prompt comes up then. Just now I told a guy to ♥♥♥♥ himself. Why must the rudest choices be highlighted first!? Grrrr","December 22, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like a life simulator. It has a dark-ish general story and all, like most games, but you get to decide how to get there. I know, I know. You heard that before, right? Well I will honestly say that this game actually achieves that idea in a way where it makes you think about your life and how you want to live it. I dream to make games like this. It takes you on a journey you (Hopefully) won't forget. You get to pick your main character and his/her love interests (which is a great design and makes you connect to your character more). If you like story driven games, this is for you and I suggest giving it a playthrough (If not more, because trust me, you will want to play it again to see if you can get a different ending or maybe make a better choice then you did before). This game will start with a confusing beginning but it'll all make sense at the end. Now this game does have a couple of cons that I have to state at least. This game is heavily driven on text. If you're not a big fan of reading, you might want to stray away from this game. You will not appreciate it all if you can't appreciate the text. Now that being said, I did spot a FEW mistakes in the spelling and some mishaps on pronouns. For the grammar nazis out there, I just laying that out there. But for a game that probably has over 5000 words in it, 1 or 2 mistakes is just being human, or just being sometimes monsters... SORRY! Had to throw that somewhere in there!\n\nTo shorten this up though, I'll just make a pros and cons list:\n\nPros:\n+A great story that leaves you thinking about your life\n+Choices that make an impact on you\n+Humorous at times\n+Well designed (for a RPG Maker game)\n+Great Characters\n\nCons:\n-Few Spelling/Grammar errors\n-My ending made me feel the feels! ♥♥♥♥ you for your feels!\n\nRating:\n8\10","January 11, 2015","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a story driven game it has shockingly bad writing. The game is about the struggles we face in everyday life, yet the story was completely detached from reality. I mean, there are actions can potently lead to the deaths of multiple people without any repercussions, even though you *spoiler alert* wrote it into a journal which you published into a book!\n\nAnd you know the scene in the dark alley at the start? That’s what got me to keep playing because I wanted to see how the rest of the game tied in to it. Guess what? It doesn’t. Those characters showed up at the very end, and are completely shoed in to justify the first scene.\n\nThe writing is also extremely pretentious. It spends too much time talking about philosophy of right and wrong, rather than showing through their action of its character. Which is a wasted opportunity, as many characters has potential for development (like Mark). The saying “show, don’t tell” really applies here.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much non- existence. Which is fine in “To the Moon” (another story-driven rpg-maker game), because it’s short and to the point. While in this game, I spend 15 hours in this game and still haven’t finished it (I watched a let’s play if you are wondering how I know the ending). It is drawn out and tedious, which would have been okay if the story was good, but it wasn’t.\n\nAll this would have been forgivable if the developers weren’t so ♥♥♥♥ing pleased with themselves. It’s okay to be proud of your work; it’s also okay put yourself in the game as a character.  What isn’t okay is *spoiler alert* to have a book in the game called “Always Sometimes Monsters” and calling it a masterpiece, and saying that “nothing captures the human spirit quite so well” which it clearly doesn’t, and of yourself show up to offer the author  1 million dollars to turn it into a game.\n\nWith all that said I hope they learn their lesson and make a better game next time, games like this are few and far between.","January 19, 2015","false","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact, for me, it directly influenced my endgame choices.\n\nI definitely enjoyed playing it through, and even though I know how it goes, I'll be going for another few playthroughs just to see how my decisions change the gameplay and ending.\n\nOverall, this game is probably good for at most 4 or 5 playthroughs if you're just looking to see the endings, but there are so many little subtle things that you can experience that don't directly impact gameplay... they're more of little side-events that you get to see, so there's definitely still room to enjoy the game beyond "I've seen all the endings" and I'll probably play a few more times through, just to explore... then I'll put the game away for a while until it feels fresh again, which I think it will. That's part of the beauty I see in this game: almost anyone will be able to relate at least somehow to the events that play out.\n\nIt's a shining testament to what people can create with the RPG Maker tool with a bit of creativity and a unique approach to game design.","January 21, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Have you played To the Moon? If yes, go to 3. If no, go to 2,\n2. Play To the Moon, go to 3\n3. Did you like To the Moon? If yes, go to 4. If no, go to 6.\n4. Are you a masochist who would genuinely enjoy a depressing and hopeless story that makes you feel lower than the dirt in the gutter that you step over on your way to work every day? If yes, go to 5. If no, go to 6.\n5. Play this game...and enjoy being miserable.\n6. Liberate tuteme ex inferis. (Save yourself from hell)\n\nImagine, if you will, if To the Moon and Tell Tale's the Walking Dead had a baby...and then both parents immediately died after the birth to leave the child in the care of Spec Ops: The Line. That child would grow up to become Always Sometimes Monster.\n\ntl;dr - the above is all you need as far as a recommendation is concerned\n\nIm seriously on the fence about whether to truly recommend this game. On one hand, it is well written and has a genuinely engaging story. On the other, it makes me want to shove glass under my fingernails as penance for ruining everybody's lives.\n\nYoull notice I mentioned To the Moon a lot and for good reason: this game feels like it came from the same developer. Its an 8-bit retro game thats pretty much a serving plate for a really good story (To the Moon was infinitely better, though). You dont sit down to enjoy the plate; the plate is just the method of delivering the food (aka the story). And boy does this food taste like depressing sadness cooked in a fine horrible-people wine...\n\n*spoilers* *spoilers* *spoilers* *spoilers* ...and rants below\n\nDont say I didnt warn you. 2 final thoughts/rants (on the story):\n\nThis game presents itself as a decision based game...its a dirty liar. All of the story elements happen irrespective to your decisions, and in more than one situation I actually had my decisions hyped up as being super important and then the game pretended like the decision never happened. One particular moment stands out:\n\nYoure offered to either spend 3 days hunting down 3 car parts through tedious side-quests to fix up a car and win a race...or spend one afternoon to cut the opponent dude's brake line and have him burst into flames literally right in front of his 4 little children (I was in a hurry, dont judge me...though it was hilarious after the fact). The next day, the guy who put you in the situation in the first place, set up the race, a true blue Christian from head to toe, is a pastor at the church, and LITERALLY just presided over the dead dude's funeral with his little children crying "DADDY NOOO" goes up to you and acts like nothing happened and is like "Hey! Ready for that car trip Whatsyourface?" in the most cheery way possible. The decision is only mentioned once more in one of the game's many random pointless questionnaires that means absolutely nothing about whether you regret your decision. Consequences? In a game based entirely around consequences?! Pfft, pass...\n\nLastly, the ending was a huge ****slap. Basically, there is no happy ending; dont even try, youll just screw things up even more. There is literally nothing you can do to get back together with your love interest. Dont believe me? Do some Googlefu and you will.\n\nSince Steam forces you to give a yes/no recommendation, I chose my opinion because I am a little happy I played this. Beware, though...this game is definitely not for everyone.","January 6, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The responsibility of choosing your own way in life and making important decisions really grabbed my attention when playing through this. It is not your average RPG in which you play a linear story making choices that don't necessarily affect the state of the world and the relationships you have with the people in it, Infact, the choices you make will definately affect the world around you and the way that you are treated by other characters definately towards the end of the game.\n\nThe visuals are pretty standard for an RPG of this type, but the attention to detail is definately worth a mention, If you want an interesting visual experience and a great story, this game can definately provide you with both. There are a few graphical problems, particularly with the Hospital Lobby area, the food plates seem to be hovering in mid air and are being eaten by people standing at the ends of the table instead of being sat at it, I don't know if this is a known problem, or if vagabond intend to deal with it, but it isn't an experience ruiner for sure, so don't let it affect your opinion too badly.\n\nThe music in this game is incredibly atmospheric, and provides a lot of mood setting for the particular towns and areas. The Laser Destroyer Team did a great job on it and they should be proud of the masterpieces that they produced. One of my favourite tracks is 'Hit the Town', and I suggest you give those a listen if you're into 8-bit themes.\n\nTOTALS:\nGraphics: 6/10\nSound: 9/10\nStory: 9.5/10 (Absolutely insanely good, but not perfect in every way)\nPolised? --Couple of minor scratches 8/10\n32.5/40\nOverall experience rating: Garunteed memorable game!\n\n"RPG lovers will love such a personal and exciting experience ;3" - Bunnieth\n","December 4, 2014","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A year ago, you signed a deal with a publisher and foresaw a bright future with your significant other. What followed was a chain of events that would set your life downhill for the next year.\n\nNow, you are alone. Your career is on the verge of collapse. Your wallet is empty, and so is your stomach. Your ex is getting married in a city across the country, and you are invited. You are homeless because you could not pay the rent.\n\nWould you steal and lie, or work honestly?\nWould you do everything you can to win back your love, or learn to let go?\nWould you attend the wedding to voice your objection, or give your regards?\nWould you leave your friend to die, or sacrifice yourself for their good?\n\nThese are some of the questions you will find in this game.

My experience with RPGs have always been leveling up, fighting monsters, or completing some mission, which for the most part is not included in this game and the fact that this game is a story driven one. However, this is not a bad thing because this game does allow you and the main character to level up more on a personality level that is not recorded but more developed in your head as a play style. There are some minor choices in the game and some major choices in the game that affect the outcome that you get at the end. There are some parts of this game that left a bad taste becasue of the boringness and very flat dialouge, however these are eclipsed by the more plentyful colourful parts of the game where you are constantly thinking about what to do and what to say becasue you want to find out what happens next. As for the graphics the art work was neat and I liked it but what really caught my attention was the music, even on the most mundane task the music kept me playing. In the end I would say to try this game but only on a bundle or a sale.","January 23, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have no tutorial from the very start. If you've played a game of this type before, you can *assume* (and be correct) in that you move with arrow keys/WASD and confirm/prompt with Space/Enter, mouse not required. That's good!\n\nWhat I found confusing was the very first scene, which was essentially your sprite lobby in the form of a party. You choose which person to take a swig of alcohol with (being the unofficial straight edge person that I am it didn't feel right, but whatever, I'm still a child in an adult woman's body so I should suck it up to keep the game moving xP), and then choosing among the throng on the patio who your "lover" is. I didn't know this was how my avatar was chosen so I picked a cute-looking guy in a brown hoodie and once I realized I was picking my partner's avatar I just walked up to a nice intellectual with a blue sweater.\n\nTogether, we were ALEX and MISCHA. And our love, for the long game time it was--and the fairly brief real time minutes it was--was beautiful. But I had to go and ♥♥♥♥ it up and now I'm pining for my babe as a deadbeat writer in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ apartment.\n\nAnd that's where I start! In a rundown, bum-filled city with a day to procure $500 to pay rent because apparently I'm that irresponsible and that's only the first 10 minutes of the game! Freaking Adventure Quest up in this ♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nThe little observations my character makes are a mixture of deadpan snark and actual emotion. When you pick a choice between being a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or actual decent human being or at times neutral, the dialogue corresponds with it. I find that in some RPGs your character is secretly aligned with a temperament already and if your choices go against that temperament that you have built up or is already in place, your choice is played out halfheartedly, which is lame. So what if I want to change my character's outlook half way through?! The puppy needs a home! I don't care if I robbed that game's safe of their start-up money two minutes prior, I'm a changed man/lady/sprite-thing!\n\nThis game is a slice of life, find-your-own-way, make-ends-meet, there-are-quite-a-few-ways-you-can-go-about-this, but-don't-♥♥♥♥-it-up-too-hard-ya? RPG that I settled into almost immediately. The problem with ME, not the game, is that I'm so indecisive. I'm that person who has at least three fingers on different pages when reading Choose Your Own Adventure books (one joke from Family Guy comes to mind "AAah! a dragon! Lois my finger was on the page! Do you see it Lois?! Do you see!") so making big 'this or that' decisions in this game was nail-biting and I glanced at one of Steam's "Perfect Ending" guides just to see if I was heading in a relatively good direction on my own (I was, hurray for me!).\n\nI don't know about you, but games like these...I play as if this were real life because as delayed as I am in understanding social skills, I still recognize and understand that there is right and wrong to be followed. I played my character as close to my own personal tenants as possible and reeled in urges to steal as much as possible (I just love snapping up free things. It's a curse and a blessing) but I think what makes this game worthwhile is realizing that my decisions are--morally at least--the right ones and I'm a bit proud of myself for guiding my imaginary self through this gray concrete jungle to something hopefully better, filled with understanding, connections with old faces and new ones, and trying to set things right.\n\nAnd I recommend this game if you want to feel like I do. Realistic situations (at least from my limited perspective, ha), engaging characters that you actually care to read what they say (not entirely memorable, but I recall who they are when I see them appear time and again on my journey to that big sunset stretching across the highway or whatever I'm aiming for), and a little leeway for you to do a bit of what you want on the side while still keeping in mind that you're on a schedule as soon as you sign yourself up for some commitments and odd jobs. It really is like real life. Sort of. A fraction of real life.\n\nOh, quick critique!\n\nI found that I was pressing the equivalent of the fast-forward button for text because I hate waiting for it to be spelled out and instead like it to be just all there for me to read at once and then continue; when I did I often pressed a choice that I didn't know was going to appear and made a few mistakes. Quite frustrating because I'm used to fast-forwarding, then after pressing "continue" the prompt comes up then. Just now I told a guy to ♥♥♥♥ himself. Why must the rudest choices be highlighted first!? Grrrr","December 22, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

THERE ARE SOME HINTED SPOILERS!)\n\n(This Is Just My Own Personal Opinion And How I Felt The Game Was To Me And You Might Feel Different To My Point Of View So Please Be Nice Kay? =)\n\nIt wasn't a game where you can just get the best ending by just rushing to the end and picking the right dialog, it was focused on choices and life decisions that can cause your own story to end suddenly by taking the wrong turn in life.\n\nThere are some flaws that I felt made the game feel annoying at some points like the boxing minigame or earning enough income in a short time open up another dialog option later in the story but without knowing all this beforehand you'll be left with just one thing, your own personal choice. (and this is without being a cheat and reading a how-to guide!)\n\nThe epilogue felt open ended and you cannot revisit the previous town/cities to check up on how they are all doing and your main love interest (if you choose to persue it) simply locks him/herself in a room and you end up having a limit set of options you could do.\n\nI truely wished there was abit more to the story in the epilogue, I kinda felt cheated after going through everything just to have my main love interest lock him/herself in so I cannot see or talk to him/her and having it end just like that because I felt there could be abit more story between the main character and the love interest rather than relying mostly on flashback/dreams and maybe having them go together to revisit the town/cities the main character have gone to and see where it goes from there.\n\nHeres hoping for dlc or a sequel! but I doubt they'd do that, happens too often~ =P\n\nAnyways, this is a good game in which I will play again to see what else it has to offer and the main theme of the game is probably the choice in life and maybe something else =P , I hope you enjoy it if you do buy the game, its total recommended game to get!","December 23, 2014","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From Day 1, there are quite a few options available to you, and many choices you can make. The game claims to run on a system where every small choice affects you, but in the end that doesn’t really happen.\n\nThe games plot is linear – no matter which decisions you make, you always end up travelling between certain places to make your way towards your ex’s wedding, although there are a few options on how to do that dictated by what your do in the places you visit. A lot of short side missions never really do anything – the phrase “You’re a good friend” appears several times throughout the story, but these characters never really do anything else afterwards. One of the side missions even seems like it’s going to reappear near the end (when it turns out a big event happening at the same time as the wedding is one you can win a pass to for someone) but that doesn’t go anywhere, the kid you help out is completely missing from the last arc. No matter your actions, you’ll end up in the final situation where all that happens is you might have locked yourself out of the endings.\n\nSpeaking of the endings… my main gripe with this game is that they’re unsatisfying. Endings don’t necessarily need to be happy, but all of the outcomes for ASM leave a sour taste in one’s mouth. To start off with, the stamina system (which exists solely to keep you spending money on food or fishing) means that if you go to sleep when it’s too low, game over. It’s far too abrupt. Obviously it doesn’t need to be dramatic, but a little cutscene of what happens during the night would help rather than the screen flashing “YOU DIED IN YOUR SLEEP” and taking you back to the title screen. I presume something similar happens if you manage to waste enough time to miss the wedding – although there may be some event that forces you to get there anyway. As for the main endings, some of them flat out don’t work – such as you becoming a millionaire but inexplicably becoming a hobo, and others just see that characters don’t work together. Even the ‘perfect’ ending sees your love hint at being discontent with the situation, before leaving you in a pointless epilogue which seems to exist just so you can play the video games freely or try and hit up a high score in time spent in the shower, which could have been accomplished by adding an extra option to the title screen upon completion.\nThe moral of the game seems to be that you either have to screw people over or be a successful gambler to make any money. I disagree with it but I understand why the developers have done it.\n\nHowever, for all its flaws, I did enjoy the game (sans the ending.) Of the 10 or so hours I put into it, I enjoyed most of them – the story is nothing spectacular, but it’s enjoyable. The graphics aren’t the best and the music choice is all over the place but I still liked playing it (even if most of the time was spent save scumming on scratch cards, races and casinos.) The developers insert themselves from time to time and there are other brief moments of humour which certainly help with the experience.\n\nAll in all, ASM claims that it presents a story which is heavily decided by the choices you make. As you’d expect, this isn’t the case because that would be a development nightmare. Despite that, the game is mostly enjoyable despite having a bitter aftertaste due to the unsatisfying endings. While I don’t think Vagabond Dog have hit it off with this game, it looks like there is a lot of potential so I’ll probably keep an eye out to see what else they’ve got in store in the future.","November 16, 2014","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every "main quest" has some cash output for you to progress, but these "main quests" do not give enough money. After you are done with these "main quests", you are stuck to do an odd job at a employment agency to get the remaining cash to progress and these jobs are very tedious and boring, unlike the rest of the game.

I began to not care what people were saying\n-Annoying pauses in gameplay so that emotes can pop up above characters\n-A variation of about 2-3 emotes\n-Character pictures are very cheesy\n-No character customization, I was really hoping for some\n-Picking your sexual preference is very confusing at the beginning.

It's not some hardcore shooter game, it's not a game with horror or some big budget art game.\n\nIt's a game about how messed up humanity is and can be. It's one about choice.\n\nWhile this game has many redeeming features, there are some noticable problems. Problem one, the looping of the music doesn't flow smoothy. There are gaps just before it loops which really jolts the atmosphere. Problem two, apart from going to sleep and dying, if you starve your character there is no consequence. Problem three, there are slight bugs relating to the endings and god did I hate the continous 'ending'. You get stuck in the house and can do nothing except play games. While to others this may seem like a fufilling ending, showing the looping nature of human life, to me it felt awkward. I looked around for ages trying to find some hidden thing and found nothing.\n\nI may have complained quite a bit about this game but I honestly recommend it.

I haven't beaten this game yet, but I'm a chunk of the way through. I think I've pretty much won. I guarantee you I haven't.\n\nThe choices you make define who you are. I killed a woman, or put her life in serious risk, for $30 towards my salvation. I fell on and killed a man attempting to destroy a city, all for money I never got. I made children watch their father die for a car. I made some horrible choices. Consequnce is real in this game. The choices I made I never believed would result in death. People are dead because I need to go across the country. When you are desperate, every choice you make seems to harm those around you.\n\nAlways Sometimse Monsters is scary.

A year ago, you signed a deal with a publisher and foresaw a bright future with your significant other. What followed was a chain of events that would set your life downhill for the next year.\n\nNow, you are alone. Your career is on the verge of collapse. Your wallet is empty, and so is your stomach. Your ex is getting married in a city across the country, and you are invited. You are homeless because you could not pay the rent.\n\nWould you steal and lie, or work honestly?\nWould you do everything you can to win back your love, or learn to let go?\nWould you attend the wedding to voice your objection, or give your regards?\nWould you leave your friend to die, or sacrifice yourself for their good?\n\nThese are some of the questions you will find in this game. The game is not a typical RPG game. You don't have weapons, you don't kill people unless you choose to.\n\nIn life, sometimes there is good choice and bad choice. But sometimes, there is no choice at all. What would you do? How far are you willing to go when your life, happiness or future is at stake?\n\nThis game has, in my opinion, one of the best stories I have ever seen.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lgvereor/recommended/274310/","lgvereor","Orthopaktis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lgvereor/","370 products in account","First off, controls, regardless of what game or genre, this is important as hell, and the developers clearly took a giant heaping ♥♥♥♥ all over this. The main problems are very sensitive and annoying movement controls - huge problem on the hacking levels and vents, but also they brilliantly decided that F12 would make you exit to the menu and lose your progress with no confirmation dialog, anyone who's used Steam for a time knows F12 is screenshots. Thanks, I got to watch the wedding scene all over again after being a few seconds from "winning" with what I'd call a perfect ending (girl + journal) because I decided to take a screenshot for my wife!\n\nI can't rate graphics due to the style, but I did witness the off characters walking through walls instead of doors, walking over desks (like the P.I.'s office) and other sprites, occasional graphical glitches, but nothing severe.\n\nAdditionally, on the note of glitches, on my first playthrough I did everything exactly the same as my perfect playthrough, but at the Casey/journal dialog, I was blamed for a lot of nasty things I didn't do, and I utterly lost no matter what I chose in the casino level. Those things weren't mentioned in the second playthrough, except they accused me of rigging the election when I didn't, and I otherwise won. So it's clear there's som save corruption going on there in both my playthroughs.\n\nNegativity aside, the story was great and touching, however considering the emphasis on choice, and less emphasis on graphics, I think the endings could have been more diverse which would have given more replay value, but they were good. I especially loved the diverse character choises, but it would have been interesting if the characters you chose could effect the playthrough, like if you chose a large/muscular character you could choose the security uniform choice and/or be blocked from choosing the vents on the hacking/election level, but that's just my opinion.\n\nOverall, I give the game a 7/10, it really gets you thinking, and really pushes your feelings and motivation/choices.\n\nExplained: How to Get Perfect Ending - [Spoilers]\nFirst I need to say, the perfect ending is getting the girl and the journal/book deal. Ultimately, this is easy.\n\nObviously the first tip is to be a good guy, all the way through. When you are playing you will see two pictures on your [ESC] or pause menu, you and your lover. As the game progresses, your lover's moves further away or closer to yours depending on your choices, at the beginning of the game your lover's picture will be close to yours, roughly the 75/80% mark. There's no way to tell what is the actual 100% mark, unless you have the same characters as me and look at my placement (mine didn't move any since I arrived at Salt City, aside from the tux). Unfortunately the 100% appears to be the necessary requirement for the girl and the deal as another save thats slightly lower, maybe at 95%, was a game "loss".\n\nDO NOT BUY THE TUXEDO\n\nWhen you buy and put on the tux, you will see your lover's portrait move roughly 10-15% AWAY from you, meaning the tuxedo is negative on your final score (maybe it makes you look pompous/money hungry?) and will ruin your ending. This is the one choice I am certain hurts your ending because I tested it being so close to the end. With the tux, she chooses her fiancee over me every time unless I save him by giving the journal (paying debt won't work) and ask him to cancel the wedding in the Casino, without the tux I pay off the debt, get her back, and ger the journal for myself.\n\nQuite simple actually, and the hint (the portraits) was staring us in the face the whole time.\n\nSome other notes:\n1. Couple score has nothing to do with the ending, it's a code saying what two characters you picked. It was the same for me on all three my playthroughs with the same characters all through the game.\n2. Fate score has nothing to do with the ending either, and appears to affect chance at winning lotto, casino games, and other chance based stuff, may also affect the speed on the race. I'm not sure what changes it though, as it seems erratic, do something good, goes up, do something good, goes down.","August 24, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Always Sometimes Monsters has a lot of potential but is just lacking overall. The pace is juuuuust slow enough to be considered a hindrance, and while it is definitely a game that makes you think about the morality of your choices, there's a final step it isn't taking. In the end nothing really ends up having consequence. I got it half off so it's not like I'm upset about buying it, and honestly I think I would have been okay paying $10 even because it does have a lot of good qualities. But overall it sits pretty neutral with me so if I had to say yes or no, I'd say no- the bottom line is you're not missing a life changing experience by NOT playing this.\n\nI'm not completely done and I do plan to finish and maybe play again to see if much changes depending on your choices, but I'm far enough along where I'm pretty sure my feelings won't change by the end. Again, the game isn't awful by any means, but I can't exactly justify raving over it.\n\nOne thing that did really frustrate me though: the game quits when you try to take a screenshot! Another review had stated this but stupid me tried to do it anyway, and of course I was right in the middle of something...waaaay annoying. I wonder if this is something with games made in RPG Maker? because To The Moon does the same thing...except instead of quitting the game pauses, which I think is a thing Always Sometimes Monsters could use to incorporate to save some frustration.","August 26, 2014","false","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The choices are kind of a mixed bag, as much as I liked the different scenarios and branching I found that too many of them were just black and white moral choice.  In fact I can’t recall a single one where I had to sit there and think “Wow, what should I do?”; it was always “Yeah that’s the good karma, that’s the bad”.  Still I don’t view that as a true negative as the game is a blast even with binary moral choices.\n\nThe main issues I had with the game are that I didn’t care at for the characters and the conflict that the story revolves around feels hollow.  For the characters; all of the key ones are kept in the background too much so you really don’t gain a connection to them.  Rather the game just tells you have a connection and leaves it at that.  The PC isn’t much better; I had hoped to play him more like myself but sadly you can select the action and never the tone.  Even playing the game as unselfishly as possible you're still going to come off as a jerk.\n\nI’m not going to spoil anything about the conflict but odds are you’ll see it coming by the second city (and see the ending coming even before that).\n\nOverall I had a great time playing the game up until the big reveal and from there I had to force myself to finish it.  If you’re the type of person who can play to a certain point and stop (and enjoy interactive stories) or ignore a percentage of a game then it's defineitly worth  a look.  But if you push through until the end there’s a chance you’ll came away from it unsatisfied. 6/10","June 7, 2014","false","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my first review of any of the 43 games in my library that I thought worth the review, it's that good. My only concerns were a couple very knitpickey things: automatic choice boxes when I'm flipping through text could cause me to choose things I didn't want like not writing in the journal, food was always my biggest concern and a lack there of caused me to die in my sleep(not to mention the prices and scarcity of money), those were my only concerns with the gameplay. Now the story. Holy Lord. I'm reminded of a tumblr post mentioning a game idea where the player had to make a series of choices thinking they were the hero, but as the game progresses the choices become harder and harder and the player realizes they were the bad guy all along. I set off to do the big hero choices and be the most nobel of men...nope. I started off pretty well making somewhat minor mistakes, then bigger ones. The biggest fault I can place is on no one but myself, because these were choices I thought I would make. This is a phenominal game that anyone with a taste for RPG's will love. A word to the wise though, be careful, stick to your own path, and above all, don't relate this to yourself and those around you in case you stray from your path.

Rather than show right and wrong choices, or even presenting "morally grey" options, it lets you choose whatever suits your own moral compass and any quirks you might have; above all, it feels very human. In most games, even morally grey decisions are easily categorized, which kind of simplifies it to the point that it feels artificial in some aspects. This game encaptures the complexity you'll find in most situations in life. This gives it a realism almost impossible to describe.\n\nI do wish they'd give another confirmation prompt for saving; I keep ending up saving when I mean to load.

This game is a great game for people who like a thick plot and choices that can change everything you know that is near and dear to your heart. if you don't...then just don't get this game. here are the pros to the game. The graphics are phenomenal the player and npc sprites are nice. the world is good and the top down perspective just makes it all work really well together. The dialog is really nice it makes you feel as if you are the character and you are talking to the npc.\n\nNow the game play is pretty good. it plays like the over world in the old pokemon gameboy games were the character is in a overworld and he can go into biulding and interact witht he nc int he towns, or in this case a city.\n\nNow come the cons. when you start the game it doesn't really tell you when you are selecting your character it just puts you in a room and you have to figure out what you have to do. for some people they will get this rigth away and have no problems, but for other they might be wondering what is going on. this is only minor thow because it will let you change your character if you are unplease by who you selected.\n\nSometime the game will delete you saved data and you will have to either start from a auto save or start from scratch. I only see this as a minor problem and will really only affect you if you are far in the game or just don't like doing thing more than once.\n\noverall this is a good game and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes game where you are the one who is making the big decisions and doesn't mide reading for about five minutes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/regaltv/recommended/274310/","regaltv","Big Buff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/regaltv/","443 products in account","First, and most importantly, you should not go into this with any preconcieved notions about anything. Don't assume this game is going to be one way or another. Play it, all the way through the roughly 6 hour story, and take it for what it is: a personal game about choice.\n\nNow, then. Always Sometimes Monsters is a story heavy RPG-esque game. It contains themes that are big in modern society, and manages to still handle them gracefully. Though I have played one run(and plan to do a few more), I feel what I have seen and played is a solid feel for what the game has to offer. This game is, in the weirdest sense, trying nbot to be a game, but more a narrative that takes place within the constraints of a video game. This litle tidbit is explored in a neat post-credits cutscene. I thoroughly enjoyed the 8 hours I've played so far, and I find that this was definitely a good investment. However, this is a review, so it should be lookedat from an objective standpoint. Please keep in mind, I have only done one full playthrough, so I can only vouch for certain aspects.\n\nCharacters: The characters are, to be frank, very fun. They have enjoyable lines which can make you laugh, cry, and possibly be very angry. I played as a standard white-bread hero, chasing a pretty white girl, so the story didn't incorporate race, sexuality, or gender into it, because it was a fairly standard setup in a video game. My character was, while a bit whiny, quite likeable. I wonder how much the actual lines spoken by your character change from person to person. The characters are flawed, but they don't have a hell of a lot of depth to them. You can really only take what you see on the surface, because we so rarely se the inner thoughts and emotions of these people. Other than that, I found the characters well-made, if a bit shallow.\n\nGameplay: You're going to pressing the spacebar a lot in this game. Gameplay usually stays on the standard path of learning about people, picking dialogue options, and sifting through menus. However, occasionally, the game deviates and has little set minigames(although games could hardly be used to describe them. They serve as very rudimentary tasks made to earn money to pay for food and bus tickets to other cities. They are, quite possibly, the biggest downfall of this game. They are boring. They're dull, repetitive, and they put you to sleep. They wouldn't be an issue were it not for the fact that they play an essential part in the game. You need money, and to get it, you have to do these jobs. It kills any pacing the story has, and just creates boring, mind-numbing situations for the player. I understand that the guys at Vagabond Dog were probably making them like this to make the point that "Yep, work sucks, but you've gotta do it." It doesn't make the task any less tedious, and the gameplay any less ♥♥♥♥ing monotonous.\n\nThe Story: This is the big part here, people. Unluike most games, where gameplay is your primary concern, this game needs a good story, otherwise it's no better than half the trash we have in the industry. Fortunately, Always Sometimes Monsters does have a good story. I wouldn't say that it's oscar-worthy, nor is it even gold-star writing. But it's certainly noteworthy, and holds it's own against other story based games. The writing is good enough to keep the player invested in the story, and the actual dialogue feels natural and like how it would sound in real life... usually. There are times when the lines just don't feel like they click, but I digress. The story keeps the player involved in the growing world around it, and your choices form the story around you. You could choose not to rob your neighbor for money... And people will bring it up, later on. The choices have an impact(However slightly) and it's nice to see them constantly coming back.\n\nReplayability: Come on, do I really have to say it? There are plenty of ways to replay this. Maybe you play as a black man with a white woman. Or a woman with another woman! Or a black woman with a white woman. Or a white man with a black man. Do I have to go on?\n\nAll in all, Always Sometimes Monsters may not be the greatest game there was. It may not go down in history as one of the great story-based games ever. But it certainly deserves your time, and shows that there is still some creativity left in the gaming industry. You may find yourself enjoying what the game has to offer, or you may find yourself hating it all the same. The thing is, that's still choice. And after all, choice is one of the only things we truly have in this world. Don't waste it.\n\nOn a side note, one of the few things that really bugged me was the post-gamer. Maybe I am not fully exploring, or I'm missing something, but it seems like the sole purpose was to play the little games that Vagabond Dog put in their big game. I find it a little lasy, but I don't plan on playing post-game.\n\nEdit: After having finished a second runthrough, I will say, not a hell of a lot changes. You will want to playthrough to try different choices placed throughout, and to see various different scenes that are affecxted by your choices. After the second run, I've only come to love this game more.","July 4, 2014","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Some good, some bad. You never know. Not until your first playthrough.\n\nBecause this is a game that requires multiple playthroughs to really "grasp" it, and see all of its endings.\n\nBut I guess that's kind of the point. You can play as a character with which you recognize yourself, that you can play as yourself really. It's part relationship simulator, so you can have straight/gay relationships no problem, part eNovel.\n\nAnd the game can be emotionally hard. Myself, I took a decision at the end which resonated with my own personal history and decisions in the past. And I did have a tightening of my heart. Because I recalled that moment and it made me actually tear up a bit.\nBut then, the elation that comes with knowing that, right now, I'm good.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I feel it's an introspection simulator. You get from the game what you put into it. You can be good or you can be bad. The choice is definitely yours. Just like in real life.\nAnd as you play, especially on the first playthrough, you'll take decisions... which later on, you might regret taking. Or you may not, especially if you want to know what happens in the storyline if you take a decision instead of another.\n\nBottom line is, I am not sure how to review this game.\nI can definitely recomment this game, that's a given.\nBut I'm not sure how to describe it or how to review it.\n\nOther than "it's worth the money", I don't know what else to say...","September 20, 2014","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can either jump in playing "as yourself" or to roleplay your character with certain motivations. My first playthrough I mostly adhered to a "never let down your friends"-type of attitude and I felt satisfied at the end, even if my choices didn't eventually lead me to what I wanted.\n\nBut that's exactly what this game is about: Life. Even if you do all the choices you think will get you to your goal in the end either the journey may have changed you or the choices never were the right ones.

Started out pretty good, and went downhill after about 2 hours.\nIt just didn't deliver as much as I thought it would. It was tedious, unbelievable, and unsatisfying .\n\nLet's start off with "tedious". To make money, there are various jobs in the game. Jobs like packing meat or tofu into boxes, or sorting weed or other plants into baggies. And let me tell you, they are no fun. Most people know of the infamous packing boxes into a truck scene. You could literally spend about 25 minutes going back and forth putting these boxes into the truck, and if you think "Let's see what happens when I get to 100!" you will be very disappointed, my friend.\n\nFor the "unbelievable" part, I just mean that some positions you're put in don't make sense. Really. This game tries to be dramatic and put you in "hazardous" situations, but it just comes off like it's trying too hard. Like it really wants to make your character's life miserable. And you know how this game is basically about you trying to get to your ex's wedding? There's a plot twist (a pretty obvious one) that is totally unbelievable, as in, unrealistic. If you really look at the characters' backgrounds, it doesn't make sense. Seems like it's just there for the sake of having a plot twist.\n\nNow for the unsatisfying ending, no spoilers. Like I said, I love games where the decisions you make affect the story, but in the end, no matter what you do you'll get the bad ending (and that's not a spoiler. You actually start off at the end of the game). I played several times to see all possible different endings, and even when I did everything to get myself the best possible ending, I still ended up homeless. I just don't understand.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't regret buying this game. I still play it every now and then. It's got it's perks as a game with a lot of stuff to do and decision to make. I'm just adding some criticism since all the other comments here seem to be pretty positive.\nJust saying, expect to get frustrated and question a lot of things.","December 11, 2014","false","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought i heard him say during the game that it would be worse if he stayed home and didn't do anything. I was expecting if I did get rejected that my character might live an ok life without the girl. Not going insane and becoming homeless all over again.\n\nSecondly, I really didn't enjoy myself 75% of the game\n\nI feel like if there is some part where you are supposed to enjoy it, it is at the end if you get the good ending. From some of the other "your descions will impact what happens in the game" type games that I have watched and played, I've enjoyed myself more. The main parts of those games are enjoyable and captivating. The only enthralling part in this game was the things in Salt City you had to do. Besides that Dubstown and Beaton weren't my peice of cake. However I do understand that Dubstown had to miserable because you had to start from the bottom to get to the top.\n\nAt the end, I think what i want is a neutral ending. Something where i'm fine not getting the girl. Basically do away with the whole gun holdup seen at the beggining and end of the game.\n\nBUTTTTTT, All in all this is a pretty great game.

The game has a lot of replayability, especially when taking into account all of the different options one can make throughout the game, making each replay different from the last.","December 8, 2014","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The responsibility of choosing your own way in life and making important decisions really grabbed my attention when playing through this. It is not your average RPG in which you play a linear story making choices that don't necessarily affect the state of the world and the relationships you have with the people in it, Infact, the choices you make will definately affect the world around you and the way that you are treated by other characters definately towards the end of the game.\n\nThe visuals are pretty standard for an RPG of this type, but the attention to detail is definately worth a mention, If you want an interesting visual experience and a great story, this game can definately provide you with both. There are a few graphical problems, particularly with the Hospital Lobby area, the food plates seem to be hovering in mid air and are being eaten by people standing at the ends of the table instead of being sat at it, I don't know if this is a known problem, or if vagabond intend to deal with it, but it isn't an experience ruiner for sure, so don't let it affect your opinion too badly.\n\nThe music in this game is incredibly atmospheric, and provides a lot of mood setting for the particular towns and areas. The Laser Destroyer Team did a great job on it and they should be proud of the masterpieces that they produced. One of my favourite tracks is 'Hit the Town', and I suggest you give those a listen if you're into 8-bit themes.\n\nTOTALS:\nGraphics: 6/10\nSound: 9/10\nStory: 9.5/10 (Absolutely insanely good, but not perfect in every way)\nPolised? --Couple of minor scratches 8/10\n32.5/40\nOverall experience rating: Garunteed memorable game!\n\n"RPG lovers will love such a personal and exciting experience ;3" - Bunnieth\n","December 4, 2014","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
