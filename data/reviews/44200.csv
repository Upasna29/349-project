You have a color. Planets generate ships depending on size. Ships attack and defend 1:1. Deplete a planet of enemy ships and it's yours. This sounds simple, but it plays out in frantically-paced battles where you have to micromanage planet-by-planet, while overarching resource-management also affects outcomes and turns of fate.\n\nA round takes about ten minutes to play, so it's easy to get in a casual round. Unfortunately the server browser leaves a lot to be desired so sometimes you spend another 5 minutes looking for a game that hasn't started and isn't empty. There are still a number of regular players although there tend to be few populated servers to choose from.\n\nStill, when this goes on sale, it is worth picking up just to witness the simple, elegant strategies that unfold when you remove all the crazy additional variables that most RTS games introduce. Galcon Fusion doesn't reinvent the genre, but it streamlines it better than anything else I've played. It's also available on a bunch of different platforms, so yay Galcon.\n\nBuy it! And one protip: don't immediately attack someone with all your ships when a round starts! You might survive long enough to enjoy it!","December 19, 2013","true","46.6"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","37","42","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ujuidarehcram/recommended/44200/","ujuidarehcram","UjuidarEhcram","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ujuidarehcram/","989 products in account","Galcon Fusion is a micro-RTS, where you take over planets with ships and eventually conquer your opponents' forces.\n\nI'll start off with the good. This is a simple game that's very easy to learn, and the simplicity of the graphics really helps. The battles are won or lost purely by numbers: troops will kill eachother one-for-one. As a result, battles come down to who can produce troops the quickest, and that will be the player with the most planets. It can lead to some interesting strategies... I had a three-way game where I held the most planets while being bombarded by the full might of the other players. Keeping my planets was a back-and-forth struggle, because I had to retake my planets within seconds or die a quick death, eventualy getting the smallest advantage that I could use to take one more planet.\n\nNow, for the bad. The levels are randomly generated, which adds some diversity, but is often unfair. While there are many game modes, they still boil down to the same basic gameplay, and it gets repetitve (with added frustration from bad maps). And the controls are terrible on a PC. I played this on a tablet, and it was a little better, but I yelled at my computer a few times when I couldn't do what I wanted. This game requires quick thinking and rapid movement. It requires what StarCraft players would call "good micro strategy". Moving from one planet to another with clicking is fine, but dragging was unreliable (required to move troops to an allied planet). Multi-selecting planets is really useful, but double-clicking and box-dragging were both unreliable as well. It really sucks when you know what you want the game to do, but the game refuses to do it.\n\nAlso, the sound is slightly annoying.\n\nOverall, This game is a fun diversion for a few hours, and not much more. I probably wouldn't pay over a dollar for this. There are plenty of games of similar quality on Kongregate (though I don't think those have multiplayer).","May 28, 2014","true","2.3"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

It defeats its enemies by crashing headfirst into them. For as long as you control a planet, it makes more space triangles. You can then use these to get more planets. Which, in turn, allows you to have more space triangles.\n\nSometimes, there are other players pitting their space triangles against yours. Standard protocol in those situations is to engage in space triangle warfare. Some other times, there are also allies who help you crush the enemy space triangles with their own.\n\nSo, just like bullets, you keep throwing space triangles at the enemy until it is no longer able to throw his own back at you.\n\nSpace Triangle Warfare.","February 19, 2011","true","4.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It lacks both any sort of singleplayer other than random skirmishes, and simple multiplayer features that are normally considered de rigueur, like private matches.\n\nThere's better, if somewhat less pretty, free Flash versions of it, basically.

There are only 30-40 people playing it and they have been playing it for a while, so it's impossible to find any matches for your level.\nAnd game is mostly defined by having a good start on the map, especially 1v1 is determined by a random dice roll while generating the map.\n\nSo If you like luck based games, try it. Otherwise you will just keep on quitting matches five seconds after looking into the map. I've found it similar to playing chess where a dice roll determines who gets which pieces. Even if you win, you won't know if it was skill, or luck.\n\n","June 14, 2014","false","12.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

In the style of "liquid wars", it's a real-time strategy game where you send out your ships to capture planets, which generate more ships, so you can capture more planets. Doing this while your opponent tries the same is what makes it fun. TONS of different game modes and even a cute "retro mode" option make this an EXCELLENT buy for sub-five dollars.

Probably most in multiplayer mode. So it can be very, very relaxing up to speedy challenging and tactical.\nI also looked a bit around and found out some interesting informations about Galcon on the Kickstarter page of its maker Phil Hassey. He claims to have invented the RTS genre of swarm games… And in Galcon Fusion you can actually try different rule sets of the base game. – You would also find his "community manager of Galcon" washing goats in a shower – and talking about further plans… Or you find Phil fiddling amongst his goats… well! Also amusing was for me to find a Steam group only to share videos of Galcon gameplays… ;D Some are even enjoyable to watch ;) – Galcon is a small game that I recommend for various small and some challenging reasons.","March 6, 2013","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It is also real time, as such instead of taking turns to attack adjacent planets, you send your ships anywhere you like and se them travel the distance on screen and the enemies reacting to this.\n\nThe game has a single player mode with several difficulty levels... the hardest is really unforgiving mind you, you have to cut its supplies off quickly before it overwhelms you.\n\nBut it also has multiplayer, with lobbies, multiple players, teams, and whatnot. These battles can get pretty hectic since it usually becomes everyone versus the guy that is winning at the moment, yet veteran players can  be left with just a single planet and then end up conquering the board.","July 3, 2011","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is deceptively simple and the true strategy involved captivated me on a base level like few other games have before. For those who may not know much about this game, you control planets which generate ships. Using these ships, you can attack other planets and gain control to generate more ships. The ultimate goal is to gain control of every planet. On low difficulties this is extremely easy, but as you go up one notch to another the AI becomes very difficult and the game becomes more and more addicting as you must overcome these new challenges by thinking of new strategies.\n\nI would recommend this to both a hardcore and a casual strategy gamer as there's something here that both can enjoy.","June 10, 2012","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game modes make sure that you are never bored and always adequately challenged. I haven't played the PvP on the game but I doubt that really hinders this games unique design. This game proves that, even with mediocre graphics and less than complex game design, it will always be fun.","January 2","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
