However it's charming aesthetics and floaty jumping challenges had me on "chillax" mode in no time. This is a quick pick and play platformer, but who's physics based challenges require an practice to master. This isn't just one game, it feels like 9 different ones. Most level themes are creative, abstract, and interesting to play through.\n\nPRO's- Unique aesthetics. Charcoal penil on Strathmore 500 charcoal paper. Love it.\n\n\n- Interesting space themed floaty platforming.\n- Induces relaxed enjoyable gameplay.\n- So many modes, surely you'll find a handful that really grab you. High value.\n- Local multiplayer and AI opponents for the Sports Day modes.\n\nCONs- Not much incentive to replay.\n- Not as enjoyable for long stretches.","February 26","true","10.6"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","12","18","3","0"

The way you move your character and how the physics work, they all come into play to make this game really calm, this is the sort of game you would play if you want to pass time or you dont want to watch the Super bowl halftime show. This game is not meant for a full playthrough straight off the bat, like i said before its more of a sitdown for five minutes and see how far you get in the game. But then we come to the different game modes, Moon Life,Star Light,Sports Day. They all have there different play styles so Sports Day is where you can challenge friends, or the AI in 6 different sport games its a competitive type gamemode where you just challenge people. But taking a look back at the physics for perfect universe there odd physics, the moon physics dont seem to be right they seem to "Heavy" you could say, I found that when jumping to get to the other point or objective I would be falling short, and not be able to always make the jump, so i think the physics could use some tweaking other then that the gameplay was good.\n\nMaps\nThere is not a wide variety of maps there is about 10 in total (Rough Estimate) and they all seem to have the same attributes especcially the physics, they all seem to be the same they all seem to heavy I found it somewhat hard to get to, another spot or the objective I felt like I was always falling short of the object I was wanting to get too. But there is still a lot of variety to maps I enjoyed the variety a lot for the maps, just the physics need to be changed.\n\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics fit into the games play style and just the style it is it's meant to be a chill game so the black and white tie into it, while I was playing it felt even more relaxed with the black and white and not to much going on. But since theres not a lot with the graphics I dont know what else there is to talk about it because it's just basic calm graphics.\n\nVerdict\n85/100 Chillaxed game that you can just sit down and pick up whenever.","March 1","true","1.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/405720/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Before I begin I must advise that this review is based purely on the single player levels in the game. There are over 70 levels for single players to complete so on that basis alone there is more than a sufficient amount of content within the game that if you lack people to play to get your money’s worth.\n\nPerfect Universe is a monochrome completely hand-drawn and crafted precision action game developed by Will Sykes Games. It may in fact prove to be one of the best packages of mini games that I’ve had the privilege of playing. The highlight of the game for me are the hand-drawn graphics. These are simply delightful and are very pleasing to the eye and demonstrates that black and white is still a very much viable color palette in 2016.\n\nThere are three primary game modes followed by a fourth. The first of these modes is titled ‘Perfect Moon.’ In this mode you need to run around objects and avoid obstacles while collecting all of the different gems on each level. This is probably my favorite mode of the game. Giving you the ability to glide as well as leap provides you with a significant range of strategies that you can utilize. Sometimes the strategy that you feel will be best ends in spectacular failure. The tutorial levels – and this holds true for each of the three primary modes – begins easily enough but by the third or fourth level the difficulty really begins to ramp up. By the time that the difficulty reaches super crazy levels I was having so much fun that rather than getting aggravated by my miscues I was quite happy to try and try again. Unlike some other games that make you wallow in your defeat starting a new round is exceedingly quick. The load times are minimal all throughout the game which was another advantage.\n\nThe second mode, ‘Moon Life,’ is one that I have seen before. It’s essentially a copy of the mechanics from QWOP only Sykes has taken the mechanics and taken the gameplay to the next level. You’re essentially tasked to do what you did in Perfect Moon – collect the gems on every level in the fastest possible time while using these mechanics. I’ve never been very good at QWOP and I wasn’t very good at Moon Life. However, don’t allow my inability to succeed at this mini game deter you. I can definitely seeing those who enjoyed QWOP falling in love with this mode.\n\nIn the third mode, ‘Star Light’ you control a rocket and again you’re tasked with completing each level in the quickest possible time. The rocket powers along on a well designed physics engine so you’ll have to bare in mind speed, thrust and gravity in order to succeed at being fast. At times this mode felt a little like breakout because of how zoomy the rocket actually is. But that’s not a negative in my book as the mode gave me the most laughs.\n\nSports Day features six multiplayer sports games based upon the core gameplay mechanics featured within the single player modes. Each of them can be played as a single player – there has been AI built into the game for all but the golf mode which can be played alone – but I am certain that the most fun in this mode will be had with local co-op couch party play. My favorite of the modes here was the mini golf. This is probably because I found that the AI in the other ones was almost flawless and without dedicating significant time into improving my game I just wasn’t skilled enough to challenge the tough AI.\n\nIn all, this is a wonderful collection of mini games. Other developers would have, and have in the past, dedicated entire games that feature less levels to just one of the modes featured in Perfect Universe and have not been criticized at all for it. That Sykes has developed them all himself as well as the graphics and decided to combine them into the one package for $9.99 is an absolute bargain that will present to you several hours of entertainment. An easy recommendation.\n\nSteamified score: 8/10 – beautiful hand-drawn graphics, fantastic value for money and a purely relaxing experience. Something for everyone.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit http://www.steamified.com/\nPlease feel free to join our wonderful community on Steam","March 9","true","6.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Just started playing so I will update this if things changes but this is a fun, little time killer.  Perfecting every level will add some to replay value.  We'll see how long it takes to finish (I'm guessing a couple hours for a complete play through, but not necessarily perfect).  I'm playing with keyboard  and this works fine, although I suspect it would be better with my Xbox controller.","March 3","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a really fun, casual puzzle/platform game. I love the style of the game and the overall gameplay is very smooth. It's a great game to play when you just want to chill and have fun with a game that doesn't involve killing everything you see.","March 1","true","0.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
