"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torrie/recommended/377140/","Torrie","Torbin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Torrie/","329 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst thing first, this game is fun. It is a LOT of fun. That said, it does need a whole lot of work. That is stating the obvious, as the game literally just came out a few days ago. Do not get discouraged by the glitches and bugs, as these are very normal. That said, my experiences have been mostly negative.\n\nI started the game, which loads amazingly fast and runs like a dream for me, and found myself a nice quiet server to play on. The people on the server were extremely kind and quick to help me learn how to play and what to do with things. So off I go, mining up debris from the shore and being completely lost and confused in this amazing archipelago when I realized.. I'm about to starve! But that's ok because I have a busicuit! So I eat my tasty little bit of bread and realize.. I also have a raft! Sweeeeeet!\nA tiny bit of trial and error and a few embarassingly silly questions into map chat later.. and lookout world, I am afloat on the most AWESOME rigged up raft ever! Then things get even better when I find floating trash. WOO HOO! I got myself  some string and a car battery, couple other odd things.. and now I can make a fishing stick! I won't go into detail on how long it took me to figure out that cooking the fish makes them much better to eat.. but it took a while. I will go mention that at one point when I got off of the raft, I was attacked by a shark. I know what you are thinking.. "Hey, stupid, you just get out of the water." but no.. I tried that. You see, this shark was ON A MISSION! So there I am, squealing in panic, as this shark HOVERS out of the water and up a hill after me. It was very intense for a little while, but I did manage to pickaxe said smiley shark in the face.. to death.. and got some super tasty "Shark Chops" for my effort. Yummy.\nNow at this point I have a pretty good stockpile of resources from my adventures, and I will tell you now that it does not take long at all to build in this game. Four hours into the game and I had enough resources to build anything I wanted. So I build a small base and figure out how to make a small shipyard, and I made a jet ski. That's right! SPEEDY BOAT! And boy is it fun. There are whales too.. and you can jump these beefy guys with your jet ski for almost endless fun! And then.. get shot in the head from half way across the map by someone with a sniper rifle who you never even saw. Well that's ok, it is a "survival" game after all. Just.. you don't have to survive the world, you have to survive the people. That's fine.\nBack to the base finally because I forgot to build a cot, but the devs are kind enough to respan you with another super raft AND A BISCUIT! I found my jet ski again and got it home and then built myself the big ship yard. Now things are getting VERY good. Took me less then two hours to be in the big gunboat. I got to say.. driving that thing is FUN. It actually takes one person to steer while someone else runs the engine for you, making it a loooot of fun. Puttered around for a bit, refueled it at the refinery, went to head back home in the pitch dark. Now I didn't think much of this because I had a friend on the front of the boat with a flashlight.. then I am suddenly looking at the respawn timer again. Another headshot.. IN PITCH DARKNESS INSIDE THE CABIN OF A BOAT!\nBy now I am somewhat annoyed.. but what the heck.. My buddy and I respawn and get the boat home.. only to find two guys waiting for us outside the base. Only.. we didn't know they were waiting for us. Because while we leave our game settings normal, meaning when it is night time it is DARK.. some people can still somehow see well enough to get two head shots almost instantly. They kill us, steal our boat, and leave.\nThis should give you an idea of the player base. There are diamonds in the ruff, but within four hours I have been killed a half dozen times and every sintle one was a headshot. That doesn't seem like a coincodence to me, so be ready for that if/when you do start to play. All the same, we trundle on. By now I have about.. 12 hours in the game and I've built and driven pretty much every single vehicle in the game. Some are more fun than others, but all of them have their uses. I've also had most of them stolen from me. The game desperatly needs some sort of anti-cheat. Not to mention that the moment you log out, someone will come by and somehow demolish your metal walls in a few minutes, take everything you worked for, and be gone before you get back.\nPros : The game is FUN. Really fun. Even if you do loose everything, it doesn't take long to get it back. It is fast paced and when you loose something, it really is not a big deal. Aside from the sea plane, the vehicals are realistic to drive and a lot of fun to use. Flying sharks! Yes, I am counting that as a pro because it was so absolutley terrifying and hylarios to see that I think everyone should experience this.\nCons : Cheating. Watch out for the players. A lot of them are legit.. but the cheaters are out there. No lights for your base. This means the cheaters can see you in the dark but you will not be able to see them coming for you. Base defenses MUST be manned to work. There is no automation so the moment you log out, everything you have is forfeit and will be taken from you. Not might be.. not could be.. but WILL be. You will have to start from scratch most days.. but at least it doesn't take very long.\n\nI would gladly promote this game to anyone who wants a nice fast pased game, but I would never label it as a survival game. It's very much more a FPS game with construction elements in it and a food bar you have to keep full with a very occasional bite to eat.","April 12","true","18.4"," 55 of 65 people (85%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","85","55","65","20","2"

The balancing (weapons, strength of walls, rescources, Sharks etc.) is very well done and the amount of content is absolutely ok for an early access alpha game that has just been released. On top of that, patches come out very frequently and the devs and admins in the forum seem very friendly and communicative.\n\nBut I'm not going to recommend to purchase this game atm, because it is absolutely overun by hackers. I played a lot of survival games and I've seen cheaters in a lot of these games, but this is far beyond playable. I played on very different servers (PVE only, Official Servers, private PVE/PVP servers) and there were hackers around at least a couple of times a day. I lost all my stuff by flying/through walls going hackers so often that I'm forced to stop playing this game. It says that with the latest patch the anti cheat system got improved. It took less than an hour to loose all of my stuff to a hacker after I downloaded the patch. You can't release a game that is obviously so vulnerable to cheating. I'm really happy to change my review into a positive one if this is solved, but for now I'm forced to avoid this game.","April 22","false","44.9"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","31","38","0","0"

This game is great with friends and you can have fun for hours exploring the wasteland, building, raiding.\n\nAlso this game isnt very demanding and should run on most pcs and still look nice which is awesome.\n\noverall i rate 10/10 and i hope this game goes places","April 9","true","6.7"," 42 of 57 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","42","57","9","0"

I definitely felt like most of these textures and objects were some of the default textures but I looked past the graphics since the game is in alpha. The server I spent my time in was nice and quiet since I am not big into PVP in survival games so I was really able to explore and figure out the mechanics of the game since there is not really any instruction or tutorial to the game. The next thing that caught me off guard a little is the fact the if you get sharks close enough to land they will literally begin to fly around in the air as though they are swimming and will follow you relentlessly which one did to me for a lot longer than I appreciated. The day and night cycle is nicely spaced out although nights are VERY dark and whenever I tried to go into options I was instantly faced with a "Are you sure you want to keep these settings" screen which left me unable to actually change anything. The game is nice enough to start you off with a pickaxe and a flashlight at least so you are not completely alone in the dark. The game follows pretty much any other survival game mechanic in that you must salvage metals and wood to build however one thing I really appreciated about this game is that you do not need to build every tiny item in order to build your goal item. If you want to build bolts to build a door you can, otherwise if you have the material needed to build the bolts and the door already then you can just build the door and the bolts will be constructed automatically as well. It took me a while to figure out how to build a base in order to fully feel safe in this game but I appreciated how blind I felt to everyhting. For still being in alpha I can recommend this game. It is the right amount of challenging and fun and as long as the developers keep to their word about the future additions I can see myself playing more of this.\n\nMy review is based off of my playthrough. Everything I talk about, including the flying sharks can be seen here:\nhttps://youtu.be/l2dYxFukfyw","April 11","true","1.6"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","27","33","3","0"

I honestly have never wrote an honest review before but here goes...\n\nDAY 1: It was just me, and I get my bearings of how the mechanics work and this is what I found out...\n\n1. Resouces come from only scrap piles, floating logs, sharks, whales, floating garbage piles, and other players.\n2. press tab to build or craft\n3. boats are your friends, if you don't have one so is land\n4. The community is friendly to new players\ncool right?\n\nDAY 2: So I got my bearings and started on a swedish server and made my first hut.. not a bad hut but a shabby one made of sweat tears and a whole lot of resources. At the same time I buy two more of this game for my friends so they can see what I talk about on how cool this game is.\n\nDAY 3&4: My friends join me in my hut we build walls, weapons, and finally jet skis, which in turn made gathering alot faster and more profitable. We met some friendly Canadians, and we weren't ready to defend ourselves so we didn't engage alot but we held firm, we got off for awhile and when we get back we realize we have been looted while we were gone and I realized I didn't build any windows to stop people from crouch jumping into our base so I did some remodeling to plug up the gaps. My compadres decide to use their newly built guns to exact revenge but hilariously they started this while there was a 3-faction war happening in the middle of the map between the "elites","UWS", and the "DOGS" and boy they had the guns. shortly after they lost our skis and their guns and whatever they had on them at the time, a raiding party of the "elites" had a massive ship and two skis come and loot us. The next part was hilarious to me when the second raiding party of the "UWS" came with a gun boat and two skis, we had to break the news that we were recently raided and had nothing to give them and pointed out that half of our tower's walls have been blown to smithereens. So in turn they went on their merry way east back to the warfront.\n\nDAY 5: From experiencing the previous days I decided I was going to be the leader and vouch that we would have no personal weapons outside of our base other than harpoons and it has been peaceful since then so far. afterwards we focused more on electricity and base defenses rather than personal arsenal. the first defense was a tier 3 anti tank turret that could fit on a warship(we put it on a tower) and its ammo is stupid expensive but at least its devastating power is gruesome, plus if we don't have ammo at least its daunting. we made a windmill and now are currently focused on whale hunting and agriculture because we have realized we are actually not the biggest fish in the sea.\n\nSo those are my five days of gruesome playing and when I look back on this, this seems to be more of a story than an actual review... hopefully this gives kinda a picture of what it is like such as progression and for now notice these days are not real days but game days. We have actually been playing it about 3 days now and only 2 of them was with my friends so the progression and mining isn't too bad. I hope you enjoyed my drearily long review/story and I HIGHLY recommend this game more than most I play and definitly more than ark and this doesn't require a supercomputer to play.\n\nENJOY!\n\n-JangoXIII","April 14","true","17.8"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","29","37","10","0"

This game runs on Unity which has boatloads and boatloads of hackers, both figuritively, and litterally.\n*Advertised Battle mode is not in game, which was a main buying point for me.\n*Virtually no game population. I saw a peak of 8 players on the most populated official server. Theres 30+ servers, and maybe 12 players online in the whole game.\n*Many exploits and bugs that happened in H20 are indentical to ones in Rust at launch.\n\nVerdict : I want to play this game, I really do! But the same reason I left Rust, H1Z1, Aftermath, and such games remains. There is no effective anti-cheat, and it looks very much like this game will be plagued by hackers for its lifetime.\n\n*Note - As of this writing, Hackers can do the following, Spawn any items, Instant kill whole server, teleport to players, and ESP. Furthermore, according to offsite game forums, you can use cracked versions of the game to play online, grant yourself admin powers, and disable showing your steamID.

Yes, I have been impacted by the hackers but the Devs and some of the server owners have been working hard to catch and ban as many as possible. The latest anti cheat program is providing a little more protection but more work needs to be done. Thankfully we are not having to wait weeks or even months to get things done, the Devs are putting something out a couple times a week to address problems.\n\nMy personal opinion of the game is that it has a ton of potential. The fact that you can easily get into the game, gather resources and make weapons in no time at all says a lot for where the Devs want to take this game. We have already had some battles over teritory and even equipment such as boats and ships. In its vanilla form which is what I would categorize this game to be in its current form sets the stage for bigger things to come. Is it worth the 18.00 spent to see what its like. Definitely!\n\nFind a server where there appears to be a few admins on and play for awhile, of they are doing their job, then you'll see them kick or ban players who are hacking or exploiting game glitches. At the same time also take note if the admins are using their powers to only benefit themselves.\n\nOr clan [KGB] has two servers up at the moment. The first one (Smoke on the Water) was ok. By that I mean we managed it as best we could without any Anti Cheat associated with the game. We banned quite a few people but at the same time we were hacked just as much. Either everyone was killed on the server or it was a selective kill situation. Although that  server still exists for the time being we will be taking it down completely in a day or two.\n\nWe now have a new server up Called [US] Smokers and Jokers [KGB]. We have at least 4-5 admins currently approved to conduct normal operations, such a update, restarts, kicks, bans and a few other commands. WE do not exploit for our own needs. This is a PvP server so we ill do battle like anyone else. Easy Anti Cheat is active. The server is located in Dallas Tx. I hope more of you are considering buting this game because it really does have the potential to become something big.\n\nGood Luck\nPhoenix","April 24","true","48.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Combat is buggy, Gameplay is lackluster, and the map is rather small for how quickly you can traverse it on a makeshift raft (which you spawn in with). Rather small in this instance is that you can travel from one corner of the map to the other in about 10 minutes real time (to give you some perspective), on that starting raft.\n\nCurrent max players is 40, which is sufficient for the map size, but that player count will need to increase with the map size (I read that there are plans to increase the size and player count in the future).\n\nThe biggest challenge you will face is dying to people that aren't there. It may be desync, or something along those lines, but if you can't see someone, how can you survive their attacks?\n\nAfter a few patches it may be a better place in regards to the invisible player issue (hopefully the duping and placing objects on your friends to push them through other players walls is also fixed), but I would hold out for a while until there are more releases for this very very Early Access game. There are also issues with the camera clipping through walls (other players viewing into your base, you viewing theirs).\n\nMaybe I'll come back to it in the future if these issues are addressed...","April 10","false","1.1"," 55 of 95 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","55","95","5","4"

With the vehicles it's simply Rust on steroids. For an alpha the game runs fairly smooth. Being able to fly AND drive ships gives clans a lot of room to play with different startegies.\n\nWord of advice though: Wait a few months before you get this. Right now there's just waay too many hackers (from the classic aim bot all the way to blowing up everyone's ships and manipulating other players' inventory - easily available from sites like these {LINK REMOVED}https://goo.gl/qxYGmy) and players abusing admin privelages on private run servers (giving themselves 100x rockets so they can go grief, etc.). There's even a pirated version floating around with hacks already integrated, which may explain the abundance of hackers across servers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IoCZbzvBDQ). Right now there's only 4 official servers with barely any admin oversight. If you don't want to wait you will be able to find the occasional empty server that allows you to explore and experiment with the game.\n\nUntil the game is actually playable as the game design inteded I cannot recommend the game.

There are jetskis, gunboats, makeshift cargoships, rusting battleships, HELICOPTERS, PLANES!!! The landscape is a warzone, no one is safe. Only the boldest of players will be able to overcome the struggle of living in this chaotic enviornment.\n\nKeep in mind however that this game is still a work in progress. There are aesthetic problems that eek me like how hip firing the ak47 feels like shooting out of a broomstick. Not to mention the physics seem 'odd' at the very least. For example, a player can dive into the water with the jet ski, flip upside down while still on the jet ski and not submerge into the water script wise or suffer some form of consequences.\n\nMore so I wish that player built buildings could be destroyed by other players. I learned this the hard way when I wasted 7 rockets attempting to infiltrate a base under siege by my clan. At least we destroyed their recon copter and jet skis though XD.\n\nOverall, when you guys play this game. Keep an open mind. I hope ya'll have a fun time and I hope to see you on the battlefield.\n","April 9","true","14.9"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","20","33","2","2"

This game allows you to do so much so early.  It feels like it has a good build system, good gun play, vehicles, aircraft, so much more! DOn't miss out on this just because it didn't get the hype that Hurtworld (which is not even close to as fun) got. Play this now!!!!! Make this the next popular survival! It deserves it!

What a great choice that was! This game is in Early Access, but it is well fleshed out and has simple but fun mechanics. Just like I said previously, this game is like Rust, so there is a crafting system and guns and vehicles and building and clothing, but the one thing that is different, are the players; they are very kind and wont kill you right when they get the chance (or at least from my experience.) There are a few glitches with voicechat, a flying shark glitch (which is hilarious), and a flash light animation glitch, but all-in-all, nothing game breaking.

Without Kevin Costner... (Sorry ladies ;-) ) It's your regular survival situation, with water, sharks and whales. Player vs Player (with support being added for PvE), base building, crafting and vehicles. You will need boats or aircraft to get around, a vital part of the game. Above or below the water, you have plenty to explore and discover. Watch out for flying sharks!\n\nSo why purchase H2o?: Support the developers so they can continue to grow and improve this gem of a game. Early Access is not the full game, and it will take time. If you wish to give the game a chance to reach its full potential you should support it now. Even if you don't play. Wait for closer to the full version if you are looking for a fully fledged working game. Jump in now if you want to assist in finding bugs and getting them fixed. It's only though your actions, as a player, that any problems can be found and fixes be found.\n\nSome may think I'm bias, being part of the community team in the forums, but I've been part of the test group for some time prior to release and seen the struggle the developers have endured to get the game to release on Steam. They will need more help now that testing has turned the corner into the next phase, and with the great many avid supporters that have purchased the game I am very confident that all the issues with connections and anticheat woes will be sorted out in no time.","April 21","true","270.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

This is definetly a game you should play with at least 2 people.   This game does need some work and the only thing that is making it unplayable now is the hacker situation.   I will spend hours making a base then wake up the next day to find it 90 percent destroyed by hackers that duped rockets.    that being said this game should be playable after they initiate a anti cheat engine.       There are a few things that would make raiding and making your base un raidable by making sleeping toons,   the game may be too early for that but it would be made alot more fun if you get to loot eveything a clan has , because all you have to do is log out with all your prized items.      Another thing they need to do is take off 3rd person view,  not only does it make it unrealistic but it makes it so you can see the layout of other peoples bases.       I will be taking a break from H20 until the EAC or some other anti cheat engine is enables.

Plus, the devs are constantly updating it, communicating with the community, and trying their best to work out bugs.\n\nThis game is pretty much water world Rust, but that is ok because it really does a good job at it. The water looks stunning, there is a lot of land and ocean to explore, plenty of ways to build bases, things to craft, players to meet, and things to do. I personally love this game.\n\nIn terms of performance, the game runs very very well. I am not sure, but I do believe there is a 60 FPS cap but that is fine since the majoity of people only have 60hz refresh rate monitors. The game is not demanding at all. I run this game in Ultra all them time, as well as my friends, and some have lower end PC's and they don't get any frame issues.\n\nServers are very good for the most part: Good population, good players, good ping. On some servers there are a few hackers/duppers. They duplicate items and will teleport you, but they are very rare and are mostly asian. (Korean I think)\n\nDefinetely give this game a go. If you don't like it, refund it.","April 10","true","46.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nav6maini/recommended/377140/","nav6maini","My Chanclas *Lord BuckLed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nav6maini/","103 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHello everyone,\nThe dev gave me a free alpha key, and, unfortunately, I actually played this game. I have not been able to fully immerse myself into the world of hide-and-holdout, but there is still potential for this game. This potential is unmet, as of right now.\nI left comments to help build the game, and here are a few of the comments between me and the dev(s):\n\nMe:\nHello Devs,\nI change my steam name frequently, so in-game I'm usually not of the same name, but I am apart of that SpiceBoyZ clan.\nThis game has some potential, potential to be a cliche survival game. I like the concept of aqua-warfare. The detail on the water is beautiful, if I may say. However, there are plenty of issues in this game, making me think it is not really ready for early access in two weeks.\nJump physics are garbage. I don't know if is supposed to be like that, but they just don't flow right. If I jump forwards, I don't want to be able to freely strafe left and right, or back and forth. It's just not realistic. Maybe you guys are just going for an arcade feel, if so, I would make the graphics more arcade-like, which would also make the game actually run smoothly on my computer. My friend has a GTX 970 and a 4690k can only run the game at around 40 fps... which is mind-boggling for this more simple, minecrafty-seeming game.\nPhysics in general are not really good. When I ram into a boat with a jet ski, part of me goes into the boat, part of the ski slips on the boat, and another part of me die on the inside.\nI also hate that you can't cut down trees or other physical objects. It makes it as if there's not much to do in the game. What's the point of exploring if you're just going to find the same sCRAP everywhere?\nPlease don't turn this into a cliche survival game, especially one with little to nothing to do. If you want, you can contact me for more, if I find it.\nPeace,\n-Nav\n\nDev:\n@nav61 First of all, I think your judgement is really severe after reading all this, it looks more like you are trying to discourage or hurt but nevermind ^^ Well - 1. We decided to use air control here because you jump alot in h2o, you have lots of jumps to perform from high places and let me tell you that when you die with four hours of farming only because you felt from a high place ... you're mad. And anyway I don't see how it can be a "bad" thing, as it is the very first "problem" you're talking about ^^, the realism has nothing to do with this as a smooth gameplay prevails - 2. "My friend has a GTX 970 and a 4690k can only run the game at around 40 fps..." ... you're a liar ^^ cause I have far less and I have 60 FPS most for the time with max settings - 3. I'm agree for the strange physics concerning the collisions between boats, but still, it has never been a true problem for the gameplay.. it's only an esthetic bias. - 4. Here I don't know if you're accusing the trees, but again, it isn't a matter of gameplay, but a personal judgement. It doesn't really matters if you can't take wood from palm trees if you can get it on something else, but okay, I'm agree that the game is kinda boring with less than 10 connected players. But you can also consider the fact that since the game will be released soon, I have spent the last months to make the basis more stable. I was not working on beautiful promises to finally release a totally bugged game. Well, maybe you're looking for another game, more realistic, more like you personally want. Finally, I'm sorry if i seem rude but you were kinda rude to me, as your review is based on pretty nothing. Even if I know that there are lots of things to develop still, that the game is still at its beginning, I know that if you really wanted to help the project, you would be proposing solutions, and not speaking about "garbage" or anything. I mean no offence, I am open to the critic, when it is founded. Peace as well :)\n\nMe:\nWhat is true though, about this game, is that there is a lot of potential. While playing with my friends, we have a real good time exploring and creating our base. There just feels like there's too much lack of contact, hence my description of my experience. Think of it this way... I wouldn't comment if I didn't care. I want this game to be good!\n\nA link to find these comments (and other comments): https://trello.com/c/S6C6mo7D/371-you-can-leave-a-comment-here-to-report-a-bug#\n\nThank you for taking your time to read my feedback.","April 16","false","6.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","4"

Takes 9 tries to launch, crashes if you do anything, and IF you are able to get in and play more than 35 seconds at a time, you will starve, fishing does not work, the sharks are ridiculous, so don't go in the water.  These guys need about 6 more months of 24/7 before this would qualify for PRE PRE PRE alpha.\n\nSteam needs to get their heads out their arses and have some miniscule amount of standards to which a game, and I use that term in the loosest possible way can be SOLD.  And before you fantards of the WoW generation jump on me and cry early access, remember before you came along there WERE STANDARDS.  They were lowered because you are morons.","April 19","false","16.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

It has a rust legacy feel to it but with vehicles. Lag can get bad if the server you play doesnt do any restarts but it is very much playable. The building doesnt leave alot to the imagination but there is enough interesting stuff to build that will keep you going.\n\nThe vehicles in this game are really the big selling point for me. There are hovercrafts, helicopters, sea planes, jet skis, cargo ships, ect.. and you always spawn with a motorized raft.\n\nIt's only $18 bucks and if you dont like it within 2 hours of gameplay u get your money back.

So the H2O map is 1/4th of the chernarus map (numbers provided by "Sheek"), but in my opinion the chernarus map is in itself not that big.

Well that recommendation is based on what you are willing to deal with, don't take it he wrong way but this game is in early access and be aware of this. Most of the negative comments about this game are because of people not realizing what early access means. It is in development, bugs will be fixed, better ways to play will be implemented. So my recommendation will be yes if you believe you can stand dealing with bugs such as dying out of nowhere because u froze and you still take damage. Hackers because no anti cheat yet (work in progress/top priority) have your base be glitches through and lose everything. Although these bugs do happen it doesn't happen all of the time. If you are like me and you can stand some bugs and such because this game has so much potential than yes k do recommend if not, I do not recommend. That's pretty much enough said but I am going to mention that you should not hate on the game because you died through your base and lost all of your ♥♥♥♥. It's early access, early access is not an excuse for money (in this case) not an excuse to release an un-released game it means it is in development.

Its a cool concept and good idea but its barren. Not many people play it and if youre into the base building type of games you should be playing rust. Driving around on my various water craft looking for some kinda pvp is all this had become. The pvp is just meh when it happens and its very clunky at its current state. The game is really slow paced. Its a cool game for like 5-10 bucks but thats about it. Another thing to note is that you can attack someones base and destroy one of their walls but they can just instantly replace that wall once its broken down. If you do ever find another player roaming aound and island the encounter lasts a second or two and unless you guys are lanned together there will be many latency issues where you are getting melee hit by someone who appears to be 10 yards away from you. This game is a cool idea but needs a 2016 logistcs update to graphics and overall playabilty, cause like I said it feels like an old game.","April 20","false","16.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Can't even imagine higher graphics settings.\n\nI'm sure it's fun on a beast gaming rig, but the recommended and minimum specs seem to be total BS, you'll want a much better PC then what's it states to run this game well.  Just a FYI.\n\nI will re-review this game on a higher end gaming PC and after some optimization has been done by the devs.  However, right now I cannot recommend any survival game that is this demanding, especially when so many good survival games are obviously so much better optimized, and they are in early access as well (Rust, Hurtworld, The Culling, etc)","April 9","false","0.2"," 13 of 42 people (31%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","31","13","42","4","8"

It's another generic survival game with absolutely no ambition. It is of my opinion that these type of games are only made so the devs can make a quick buck and then abandon it.\n\nAs for the game itself...\n\nThe map is very bare bones and does not have the apartment buildings that are shown in the second advertised video. Official servers (dominated by non-english speaking asians) hosted by a crappy host and the private ones by immature power abusing admins. Join a game and you will be killed on sight as there are absolutely no incentives for team work. The low poly almost 2d AI sharks are beyond a joke and are more of an annoynance. This game looks like it was made with an old version of Unity. Oh and i also forgot to mention their is a big hacking problem as there is currently no anti-cheat.\n\nA "Waterworld" version of rust sound good in concept, but I'd rather watch Kevin Costners movie than waste my time with this game. This is no waterworld, the map is far too small.\n\nIn my opinion the game is very rushed and should have been in atleast another 6 months of development before even being considered for a steam early access release.\n\nI score it 4/10.","April 12","false","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

HOURS of gameplay lost.  Total BS.  It's one thing to have to deal with PVP while you are there, quite another when you cant be on for a few days, and everything you have is taken.\n\nAnly a few bugs encountered in several hours of play... and then only minor...  server problems were a bit more of an issue.\n\nVehicles...\n\nPlane:  Uhhhh.  No.  Just no.  the controls are horrid.   A pilot should assist the devs in aircraft behavior (Ill volunteer!).\nPlane doesn't turn when banked... which is not good.  Plane noses up... when you push the mouse forward... exactly the opposite of what it should...  (devs!)\n\nWater craft:  Jet ski, hovercraft work well and as you'd expect.  Standing up on the Jet ski sometimes tosses you in the drink, but no biggie...\n\nHovercraft is just plain ol fun.   Heavy gun turret available.\n\nCrafting is nearly effortless.  Like it.  Well balanced.\n\nNight is... well... *dark*, and there are no craftable lights... so when you are on your base at night... you'll be running around with flashligts.  Hope this is fixed soon.\n\nSharks can occasionally take to the air and fly like a scene from Sharknado... which is hillarious.\n\nDecent variety of weapons/ammo.\n\nI like the island layout the map has... it's not massive, but it's not small either.  A jet ski can cross it in under 5 minutes, I'd guess.\n\nBuilding is not too difficult when you get how it works...  be sure to read the docs on the dev web site.\n\nThere are electrical systems, and "crop" farming of sorts.  Solves your food issues for sure, but one bug is that crops don't survive server resets.  Harvest and store regularly.\n\nAs mentioned, your stuff isn't safe while you are off the server.  Until this is fixed, it's a total deal breaker for me.","April 10","false","46.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
