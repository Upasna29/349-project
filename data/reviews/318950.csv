Can only use controller for second player. Confusing game layout and weak gameplay.\n\nMy 4 year old girls perspective: Can't play as Rapunzel with controller (doesn't know WASD very well yet), can't navigate to the story line or extra "stuff" with adult interaction. Not really kid friendly game. They really want to like it, but it is just too many problems for them to stay interested.\n\n\nThis is a game that requires I play it with them, which is fine if the game is good, but this is not one. I was hoping for a game they could feel empowered to play on their own, but this is not it. I would pick other co-play games for kids over this one and sadly my girls would as well.","October 11, 2014","false","0.7"," 112 of 124 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","112","124","5","5"

So far out of all the craptastic Disney games that we've tried, this was failed the least. Is that a good thing? No, it's not. It is still a poop show from a UI, storyline, graphics, and overall attempt as a game.\n\nIn this game, it's identical to the movie Tangled (as it should be) but after the static animated intro movie, you are thrown into the tower with pretty much little to no instruction of what the hell you are supposed to do. My 4 year old daughter is trying to figure out why enabling a remote control only enables the second player, and going into the options provides no outwardly displayed way to change player 1 to use a controller. We never figured it out and decided to move forward and play the game..except...we didn't know what to do.  Let me help out anyone else whjo gets stuck within the first few minutes of the game. You are supposed to open the Map and then travel to your first Journal Entry, "The Frolic". It doesn't tell you that. It doesn't indicate that. You are simply supposed to be a magical effen genie and just know that crap as a kid...I guess.\n\nThis is only the fourth Disney game I've watched my daughter play (and subsequently played the game myself) but it's a real consistent pattern. These games are void of any lackluster or dedication to quality or gameplay value. Aside from slapping a Disney logo on it, these games will remind you of crapware that plauged the late 90's and ended up floating in bargain bins in CompUSA's or SILO's across America. It's probably developed by some Indian Ocean outsourced company that held the rights to make a game for Disney. Do not buy this crap anymore. Please. There are so many great indie developers that make amazing games and pour their hearts and souls into every detail of a game. And then there is this utter poop.\n\nIf this was made in America, then you should be embarrassed of your work. You probaly have a Disney logo in your portfolio that says you did work for Disney and people probably see that and think you're talented. Boy you fooled them.\n\nBuyers Beware.","October 25, 2014","false","1.9"," 46 of 61 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","46","61","0","0"

My dad thinks that it has horrible graphics and especially when she goes down the stairs. Her hair is up but it is supposed to be straight, go down, then go sraight again. Her hair has the most horrible graphics we've ever seen. I didn't like playing it at all, we couldn't even see the guards when they were coming. We couldn't jump on the little cliffs - it was horrible.","January 8, 2015","false","0.7"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","17","23","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terracorex/recommended/318950/","Terracorex","Terracorex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terracorex/","4078 products in account","I got this game as part of the Disney Princess and Fairy Pack, when it was on sale.  I'm not sure whether the whole pack is really worthwhile, but this seemed to be a cute game, and I liked the movie.  However, I should have known that the target audience of this game is for 10-year old girls, so the game is incredibly saccharine sweet, which is a bit hard to stomach for an adult.  Even so, I managed to endure playing through the first level of the game, "First Frolic".\n\nThis game is a bit like the LEGO games in that they require the cooperative interaction between two characters, here Rapunzel and Flynn, each of whom have their special abilities, to navigate through a series of levels with various obstacles and bad guys to overcome.  Rapunzel can spin her hair to grow flowers which occasionally results in a little critters that she can add to her drawing book and finds colors along the way to add to her painting palette.  She can also use her hair to swing across gaps, and lower her hair so that Flynn can climb up.  He can, on the other hand, use his little sword to cut through bushes, climb vines along a wall and find secret treasures with his treasure sense.  Both of them can attack bad guys, Rapunzel uses a frying pan and he uses his sword.  In this case, you whack the bad guys until they fall asleep and they magically disappear.  Very Disney.\n\nOne interesting component of this game is the co-op play, where the second player can join in via a game controller.  In single player mode, you switch between the two players with the TAB key, but the controller is missing such a button, so you cannot play the game in single-player mode just with a controller.  You will keep needing to hit the TAB key to switch between them (which is often), so it makes it impractical to play this game with only a controller.  Since there is no way (that I could see) to change controller settings, this effectively means you need to play the game in single-player mode using a keyboard moving around with WASD buttons.  While I had no problem doing this, a young girl for which this game seems to be intended, may find this cumbersome.\n\nHowever, one nice aspect of the co-op play, when you have two players, is once the two players are separated beyond the edge of the screen, the screen automatically splits so that each player can run and go wherever.   When the players get close enough together the screen unsplits. This is not the way the LEGO games work, where the two of you must stay within the same screen.   This is the first time I have seen this auto split/unsplit screen feature, which is a nice feature that I wish other co-op games had.\n\nEven so, I do not recommend this game mainly for the reason that I found the game to be repetitive, and frankly, boring.  The level I played seemed unnecessarily long without really enough stuff going on to make it interesting.  Every time Rapunzel approach a cliff, she would "Oh a swing! I can swing across here."  I found this sort of thing to be very tiresome after a while.  Again, I understand the audience is a 10-year girl, but I really don't see this game as being very playable by someone so young, and anyone older, will find this game tedious at best.","December 4, 2014","false","1.3"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","24","36","2","0"

There is no way in-game to change this. So unless you have a 3rd party program to map the keys from the keyboard/mouse to a controller then this game isn't worth it.\nThe Devs really need to fix this, since the intended audience for the game isn't likely to be used to using a KB&M.","February 13","false","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If there was a halfway thumb, I would chose that. I really liked being able to lead the CP because of all the times they get stuck. I liked the cutscenes very much, but the story seemed....a bit lacking. I got lost quite a few times and it was really easy to get confused about the objective. Another problem, there is no windowed mode and virtually no video settings.\n\nThe final and worst issue I have with this game, is that there is no tutorial on the controls. For younger children this would be a big problem. Even I had trouble figuring out the special keys to switch characters and such.\n\nThe price is a bit high too. I got it on sale and it was worth it for $10. I know it's because it's a Disney game, but really? If it's on sale for $10 or less than I would reccomend it if you don't get frustrated easily.\n\nI have to say It was a fun little game to play despite the issues listed above.","March 15, 2015","true","4.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
