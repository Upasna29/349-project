They started out with a template that was very successful and have been tweaking it into a new game that offers different tactical options for the players to consider.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe good:\n\n\n1)  When I first played I enjoyed it so very much.  I could watch modern day soldiers fight and try to survive without me telling them to do simple things like "duck behind cover when 50 dudes are shooting at you!"  The AI of each soldier knew to do that better than any previous incarnation of the MoW series.\n\n2)  All the old goodies from the MoW series were part of the game.  Cooking grenades, stances for soldiers to stand, crouch or lay prone.  Accuracy modifiers stances as well as using cover.  The damage models of soldiers seem to be carried over as well.  It's a good system and works great for this game.  Love it.\n\n3)  Very stable game with a few eceptions.  Many of the MoW games have been plagued with OOS and disconnection issues.  Players dropping out of the game mid battle isn't something you have to worry about with this game.\n\n\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n1)  Units are locked by level.  Nobody likes it.  The developer has stated that they give players the tools they need to win with basic squads and only elite squads are locked.  This is a half truth.  The elite squads do have better stats but there are a few that are totally unique, such as the grenadier squad that has rifle grenades that can shoot soldiers who are behind cover.  There is no basic unit that can do that.\n\n2)  Vehicles have wacked out damage models atm.  I'm sure they'll be fixed but it's game breaking to see a 6P50 technical snipe a humvee with twice the armor halfway across the map when the humvee needs to be at least half that distance to even damage the pickup truck that has no visible armor whatsoever.  When vehicles were introduced the game balance was thrown way off.\n\n3)  If you have no control points then your soldiers have no way to re-supply their ammo.  None.  To me this is giving the winning player even more advantage and seems a bit silly.  Also Anti-Tank infantry cannot resupply at all.  Once their rockets are used they are officially rifle soldiers and you have to BUY another Anti-Tank squad if  you need more tank busting done.\n\n\n\nThe ugly:\n\nAll the players who loved MoW loved the Direct Control feature.  It's what made the game unique and made the game amazing to play.  It's a feature that no other RTS game has matched thus far.  Unfortunately it's also a feature that's being chopped up and sold as a lame imitation of it's former self.  When players who have supported the game cried out that they wanted back the feature that makes the game fun for them they are told that they are abusing god mode mechanics that give an unfair advantage.  Nobody agrees with this.  It does however take time to learn the Direct Control system and that is something that casual players do not like to do, invest time.\n\nIt would seem that the developer is catering to the casual crowd that loves facebook games and hello kitty.  They have told the old school hardcore player base who love the gritty gameplay that they're no longer  important in the CtA universe.  The playerbase that is important is the kind that blows huge chunks of cash on simplified games that have no depth whatsoever.  This guy bought (A)?  Ok buy (Anti-A).  He bought (B)?  Ok buy (Anti-B).  No more using skill to beat the odds, it's just a point and click adventure where you sit back and watch the show while giving vague orders to soldiers who can only perform one duty.\n\n\n\nIn it's current state I cannot recommend this game.  It could be something amazing if the developer listened to the community about what they do and do not like.  However they simply add features in and refuse admit when those features are bad for the game.  This is a red flag for me.  It is a red flag for many others as well.  The player base went from 900+ online playing in multiplayer games to 180.  Whatever their vision for the game may be the fact remains that nobody wants to play a game that has dead multiplayer.  Nobody.\n","August 16, 2015","false","27.8"," 163 of 203 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","163","203","7","13"

Units are unlocked by level. This means that players just starting out are at a disadvantage to more experienced player not only because of the lack of experience but also because they do not have the same selection of units available to them. This just makes the learning curve even steeper. I'm not quite sure what the developers were thinking. That would kind of be like playing chess with one side having all the pieces while the newcomer only gets pawns.\n\nTo those that say the one can simply play against bots: It doesn't make sense that one should have to skirmish against bots for 20+ hours to gain "experience". Bots don't play like people do, and if one thinks it is going to make one better at the game, then one is quite foolish. As far as changing parameters? Why have parameter to restrict access to begin with? The community isn't that large to begin with so all this does is make it less likely newcomers will stay when they are fighting against veteran players. What does it add to the mulitplayer experience? Eugen had this for Wargame: European Escalation, but then figured out that it was moronic and dropped it in the later two games.","November 7, 2015","false","7.8"," 135 of 176 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","135","176","5","10"

It has a well done AI for those who do not compete well in online matches like myself. The AI is actually a challenge on the higher levels and the game provide a small variety of maps. The small amount of time I have put into the game already feels well worth it.  Sadly there is only two faction as of now and it does seem the team is interested in making an addition to the faction but nothing was set in stone.\n\nThe game has a test feature which I find is always over looked, It often causes crashes due to a overload of units but it is fun to experiment with all the units.\n\nMost of the voice overs are ripped straight from the previous games much like a couple sounds but so far the new sounds are fantastic and show great promise. I have only seen infantry combat and I believe that is all that is in the game as of now but this was enough to justify my purchase. This game shows great potential, this phrase can often ward of suspicious purchasers but this is a well done Early Access game. Little to no bugs and a very good showcase of what's to come.\n\nThe graphics are very well done, some people are concerned this is a reskin but it looks like custom models and meshes have been done and that those comments are more anger than truth. The game modes are pretty familiar but the game does feel different.\n\nThe third person mode works like a charm, like in men of war you are able to seamlessly transition and use the mechanic as much as you need.\n\nThe guns and weapons feel a lot stronger, people die quicker and the game feels a lot less forgiving. In men of war charging right into a bunker and clearing it was a possibility, not in Call to Arms however. The enemy will kill your entire squad if you are not positioned right. Sometimes this gets annoying but it is realistic and great for strategy. Long range engagements can last for a long time and I feel this really sets the games mood and gives you or the enemy the ability to use it as a distraction.\n\nThe inventory system is a basic rip from the men of war system but there is no blame. It is a good system that works flawlessly, along with the highlighting bodies and weapons hot keys/mechanic.\n\nI am unsure if the price is justified in its current state for people who are no hardcore fans but I believe in my own bias way that in its current state I made a wise purchase even if the game wasn't finished.\n\nThe implementation of Workshop already is fantastic and people haven't waited to start adding new thing to the game.\n\nThe tools to adapt the game are superb and if you owned any previous games by the devs you know what to expect, a quality and proffesional map editor.\n\nI have made several videos of the game which you can find here if you are still undecided: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzExFRZtGr851dUhdp6NbRirfhqIOczRm","July 31, 2015","true","31.0"," 107 of 142 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","107","142","0","2"

The experience i've had with it are buggy, it crashes on start up 60% of the time, and it feels like im playing a pre alpha when it's expected to leave Early Access in Q3 2016. Theres problems in the game itself in which I see it as a way to keep players playing the game by making you earn XP to use troops in each faction. Which is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as theres the moment when you play with a higher level player and you get stomped when he pulls out a tank that you haven't even unlocked yet. This is completely unfair for those who start out, and the majority of the community from i've seen has been against it. Unless theres a way to disable it which I haven't seen.

But the levelling system is completely bullcrap like others have mentioned. I rarely play offline as I don't have the time, mostly I like jumping in to my own customized battles quickly in skirmish during office lunch breaks and just have fun blasting tanks off. But the locked units seriously turns you off.\n\nI know this is Early Access, and I hope the levelling unlock unit mechanism would change.

To say it is close to beta is a farcry from reality. Please, for the rest of us reading these reviews, no need to proclaim "Satan is out to scam us again!" I see it too much, arrogant reviews about how a game is lacking large amounts of content. "It's like this game's in Alpha stage or something, sheesh!"\n\nSingleplayer (Deluxe Package):\n-2 missions\n-showcases basic vehicle/infantry combat\n-very short lacking story elements\n-custom missions are becoming available already\n\nMultiplayer:\n-Idk about anyone else, but I'm having the usually horrible online issue of stuttering around @ 60 FPS\n-handful of good maps (all at night o.o) to mess around on\n-Infantry only as of now\n-BOTS!! (a huge selling point for me)\n\nEditor:\n-Almost as fun as the base game\n-Includes several units the Singleplayer/Multiplayer doesn't to mash together in giant battles\n\nGeneral:\nCompared to AS2, the game has been cleaned up quite a bit. Textures, effects, sounds, etc. have been improved quite a bit. Inventories (ammo especially) are being handled quite differently. Vehicles seem to have thicker skin this time around, being able to withstand a shaped charge or two. Infantry status plays a much larger role now it seems. Specialized troops will wipe the floor with regulars. All in all, I am enjoying what I paid for. $30 is a lot for a deluxe edition in its current state, but we must remember that price is not only for what the game entails now. It is for the finished product the developers are advertising us. A product that I have no doubt will be top quality.","August 3, 2015","true","20.9"," 59 of 83 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","59","83","7","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/For7une/recommended/302670/","For7une","Fortune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/For7une/","144 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst, let's address a central question that may or may not be in your mind as you're reading this review.\n\nCTA = MOWAS2 reskin?\n\nEffectively, yes.  The sounds of guns, tooltips of weapons, hints and tips in loading screens, UI, font choices for events (vehicle hull damaged/destroyed, penetrating hit, exp tickers when achieving kills etc), direct control of infantry and vehicles and the overall functionality of game mechanics are identical.\n\nSo what gives?  To preface my actual review of the game and its content in terms of pros and cons (I mostly play RTS games and have racked up a few ten thousand hours across varying franchises), I'd like to open up a bit further about the whole Call to Arms / Men of War Assault Squad 2 mess.\n\nAs you may or may not be aware, MOWAS2's development issues, while layered in part to incompetence from staff, can also be explained by the Ukraine Crisis, as a part of the development team were Ukrainians and, one of the main publishers of Men of War in the past has historically been a Russian company.  MOWAS2 is virtually unsupported today, and even during active development it was very apparent that the game did not build upon MOWAS1 in any way.  To me, a humble consumer, MOWAS2 seemed like a blatant cash-grab.  Mind you, I'm not a veteran of the MOWAS franchise, so I can largely forgive the nature of its development as I assumed the game would be developed past a certain point.  It was not.\n\nCTA blumbered out of no where and was in part funded by crowdsourcing.  The daily playercount as far as the consumer is concerned is from 40 to 50 people, with a spike of perhaps 15 people online at once (oh boy.)\n\nThat was the preface, now on to the review of the product itself:\n\nCall to Arms is topical, it features a fictional arab fighting force (GRM) which you'd be forgiven for mistaking for ISIS, and a Gulf War era US military, though without Javelins.\nWhen considering multiplayer versus play (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4) the game's pacing takes place in 3 stages:\n\nInfantry,\nMechanized,\nHeavy mechanized.\nEach of these stages lasts roughly 5-7 minutes, so your average game should not take past 20 minutes no matter the size, as the amount of resources given per player is a fixed amount (boring, in my opinion) and after incurring X losses you just stop getting income, period.\n\nThere are no heavier tanks past the Bradley, BMP-3 and Stryker MGS, though the fact they want to implement the Abrams is almost painfully obvious.  AT Weapons are limited to the RPG-7, LAW and AT-4 rocket launchers.\n\nThis is where any original ideas end.  The rest of the game and its mechanics are familiar to anyone who has played more than 5 hours of the MOWAS franchise, which is a let-down.  There are 2 arguments that are popular to excuse this fact, first:  "It's only 20 dollars!" and second "It's in Alpha!"\n\nTo the first point, 20 dollars is a nice price.  It's genuinely what this game is worth if you intend on purchasing it.  To say that it's "only" 20 dollars is like saying that a cheeseburger is "only" 1 dollar - is it a bargain?  Or is it just the maximum amount of money the producer can ask without being scoffed at, at this point?\n\nTo the second, and this is funny, CTA is actually more stable and better streamlined than AS2, which is just bizarre to me.  This 20 dollar title is better polished during Alpha, than MOWAS2 ever was after years of development.  I'd love to give CTA the benefit of the doubt in terms of developmental stage but I highly doubt it will ever become more stable than it already is.\n\nPros\n\n- It's a cheeseburger, good value\n- More stable than the platform used to develop it (Assault Squad 2)\n- Better balanced overall in terms of infantry small arms, penetration values of AT Weapons and vehicles\n\n\nCons\n\n- Its a cheeseburger, not a filet mignon\n- Already has achieved its full potential minus 1 or 2 units prefaction, and it's in "Alpha"\n- A few desynch-inducing bugs\n- Tiny community\n- No new creative thought, it's same old mechanics with a new narrative\n- Elite infantry are far too good, infantry AI is detrimentally bad\n\nCTA relies on its multiplayer component for replay value, without a community this replay value does not exist.  While I would like to recommend the game based purely on the fact that it's stable, relatively balanced and rewards skill and tactics (but only to a certain point, sadly, especially the BTR-80 can wipe out infantry armies in seconds at long distances), I cannot recommend it based on the fact it does not have enough players to give you, the customer, any reasonable replay value.\n\nThis game needs around 10,000 active, daily players to be able to deliver what it promises.  However, due to being a MOWAS game and therefore having a learning curve that requires patience, it does not seem to have a very good retention rate for players.  People tend to buy the game, try it for 10 hours, and then never looking at it again so sales figures are deceptive.\n\nShould you buy it?  If you're a MOWAS fan and want to support the developer, yes.\nIf you're an RTS fan who's looking for a new game to dedicate to, create content (YouTube, Twitch) or be part of a community, this is not the game for you.","October 18, 2015","false","48.3"," 73 of 107 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","73","107","6","1"

In the future, that rating will likely be even higher. If you like reading, go ahead and read my "comprehensive" review about the main aspects of this game. Keep in mind, I'm just a dude who played the game and want to tell potential buyers about it. I'm not a professional critic in any sense, so technical or in-depth analysis will not really be included in this review.\n\nOk, I am going to start this review with what I believe is one of this game's greatest strengths; the modelling. The models for the units and vehicles are perfectly made, being both accurate and well polished. The American infantry alone is enough to make me stop and say, "that is badass." Everything is accurate from camo to gear. Infantry and vehicles on both sides just look amazing and there's really nothing else to say. They really do astonish me.\n\nAs with any game on this engine, the GEM editor is included. This allows VERY indepth editing for scenarios or fun. CtA stands out with its access to the Steam Workshop, so scenarios can be shared and downloaded instantly. This makes this game have endless scenarios and the mod support is great. I expect there to be many great mods on the workshop for this game.\n\nThe online for this game is easy to access, and when paired with CtA's user friendly menu, a player can seamlessly move from tab to tab. Joining a game with friends or strangers is fast and very simple to do. Nothing is confusing about the online mode or the menus.\n\nOne thing I have noticed in other reviews is people complaining about the "American bias". This is absolutely not true in this game. The sides are completely balanced, but have different strengths. The USA's strengths are strong infantry and vehicles that are very effective but cost a lot. The GRM has a different approach. They have weaker infantry and vehicles but they bring on the pain just as much as the Americans by coming in large numbers for low prices. This difference between the play style of the factions adds a lot of diversity to this game. It is another great aspect that makes this game stand out from its competitors.\n\nOnce in game, the objectives are simple and you always know what you're trying to do. Combat is very good in this game, as it offers unique combined arms combat. Infantry can support vehicles and vice versa. Tactics are important and the AI is very competent (for the most part). Explosions run rampant in the later game, and this engine's unique destructibility allows buildings and vehicles to be blown apart or run over in a very realistic fashion. HE rounds can blow holes in walls, sending the building's occupants running. It's a very neat experience.\n\nThe new sounds give incredible immersion. They environments have great ambient noises and the new vehicle sounds are just plain menacing. The gun sounds are still relatively average, but almost all of the sounds in this game go above and beyond and immerse you into the battle.\n\nThe maps in this game are just awesome and highly detailed. They provide dynamic combat and allow for some daring maneveurs and flanks. The map makers created something that is immersive, beautiful and functional as a battle arena. They vary in size, region and climate and the units respond to these changes in changes of camoflage. They are a definite strength to this game, and even if you hate the maps currently in the game (which you won't), you can even create your own in the editor.\n\nOne thing I would like to point out is this game's direct control mode that sets it apart from its competitors. It even sets it apart from MoW. When in direct control of a vehicle, the camera immerses you, giving you a 3rd person view of the battle through its eyes. Zoom in and you're looking through a gun port, ready to engage the enemy. Infantry camera angles don't differ much from MoW, but in the editor a first person mode is available. This is a neat mode, but the clipping of the soldier's weapon makes it a little disappointing. It also can't be accessed in an actual game, so it's uses are small.\n\nThe ingame UI is great and user friendly. The map tells you everything you need to know and is a very useful tool when in direct control of a unit. It's all very simple, but allows for complex actions. It looks great, as with most aspects of this game.\n\nThe development team seems competent and dedicated. They are very vocal and are well connected with the players. This is great for this game as it allows for the players to have a say in what the developers work on.\n\nSo far, I've mostly talked about what I like about this game. Currently, it has only a few problems, most of which can be fixed by adding new units and unit types. There are no gamebreaking problems or bugs but I'm nit-picky, so here's a few small complaints:\n\n(Devs fixed resupplying vehicles problem)\n\n(Devs are taking action to improve game modes mentioned)\n\nA problem I have noticed many people complain about is the voice acting. The voice acting is ripped straight from MoW. While this is a problem, keep in mind this game is early access. Voice acting comes later. The developers are likely focused on new maps, new vehicles and new game modes, things that we can all agree are more important than voice acting. The voice acting isn't bad at all anyway, it's just repetitive hearing the exact same shouts we heard from MoW. This is completely negligable anyway, because the voices aren't really noticed a whole lot when your in combat.\n\nThe rest of the problems I have with this game are mostly about lacking units and vehicles. Currently, it has all of the units and vehicles required to play, but it doesn't really have a whole lot of diversity with its vehicles. There are Humvees and Technicals, Strykers and BTRs, Bradleys and BMPs and some tank options. All of them have one or two alternate types that have different features like TOW missiles or more armor. The vehicles this game is currently missing are vehicles like transport trucks, "heavy recon" vehicles like MRAPs or MAT-Vs (the addition of those would be ridiculously awesome), and it is also missing static weapons. Long ranged artillery, whether it be fixed or tracked is missing from this game as it only offers hand held mortars and rifle grenades for artillery. Static heavy MGs or AT weapons (tripod based) are missing, so if you want a static AT weapon, you will have to buy an entire vehicle and make it hold in a position. The addition of static weapons would be critical, and provide new defensive abilities to the player for modes like Domination or Evacuation. Air vehicles, while they are modelled and in the game, are not accessible while in a match, should be implemented. This would add a whole new level to the combat, literally.\n\nThis game is very, very good. It's the game I have been looking for since I started playing MoW many, many years ago. It's modelling and maps provide a beautiful and immersive experience which is perfectly paired with awesome lighting, great combat and exeptional destructability.

I think there may be a policy breech as there is no description or disclaimer as to why you have the pay an additional $5 over the price of the deluxe edition or that there is no SP content in the base version.

The game can be tricky to learn if you're new to the Mow series but once you get to playing the game more over time you will understand how to play the game.

So far there are two Factions in the game the United States of America and the Global Revolutionary Movement that both specialize in their own styles of play. Also would like to point out the hate on the game ATM on how small the Online battles are people you have to realize that Modern battles arent fought with numbers like WW2 anymore its fought with technology and skilled small units.

I decided why not get it cause it looked great for a EA game. Turns out I was wrong...\n\nNo single player, the quality of everything is poor compared to the videos I've seen (it's lagging even when I play a set up bot game), lag is everywhere from graphics to characters, the sound quality is worse then I saw in video, and although it claims 70 something people were in game, there was less then 12 people on the 'internet' with one game that I couldn't play in cause no one joins. Essentially what you see in the video here is what you get, but in a much much poorer quality. If I wanted to play something like this I'd just go play Company oh Heroes, the first game - it at least doesn't lag all the time and the quality is still much better.\n\nI don't like giving bad reviews, I believe I avoided ever doing so. But I can't help it as I feel I wasted money on this game. I was so disapointed between the videos I've seen and the few games I could actually play that I felt I had to make a review warning that quality of gameplay is nothing like in video; what you should expect is is older graphics, bad voice acting, and a super laggy everything. I honestly don't know what I wasted more of, my time or cash - guess time since I will be seeking a refund if possible (I've never tried before so im not sure if I can even get one for EA games, guess we'll see).\n\nAdditionally. I forgot to mention that the last game I tried to enjoy lagged at one pan (I just tried to move over to another zone under attack) and the game frooze causing a massive crash of the game giving me a radical error message.

Was it worth it even while it was on sale? No. Maybe it will be at a later phase, but not right now. Barebones is what this game is as of late, might as well get MoW Assault Squad 2 and mod it.\n\nEDIT -\nIt's still not really worth it. The new menu they've implemented seems cool, but it's actually quite confusing. It took me ten minutes just to find the exit button, which is dimmed in the upper right corner. You can call me blind but this can be a problem for other people as well. Singleplayer in my experience is still non-existant if you just buy the regular version of the game.\n\nThey've also made it so that it's quite difficult to play singleplayer skirmish. This again falls back to the crappy menu interface they have added. There is also the fact that YOU CANNOT play this game offline in my experience, since starting a singleplayer skirmish automatically boots you into an online lobby. Because it boots you into an online lobby, you cannot play while offline because it cannot create the lobby in the first place. I found this out a while ago when my internet went out for a few days, and I felt like playing this game. To my disappointment, I couldn't. Even if I could start a singleplayer game with internet, there is still the fact that I have to add a password to the lobby in order to prevent others from joining. It sounds easy once I've said it, but it was difficult for me to figure out when you combine it with the interface.\n\nAlso, unit locks.\n\nThat's it. Crappy menu interface, unit lock, inability to play offline (currently), and the difficulty to start a singleplayer game.

CtA is like many early access games out there that hasn't been fully finished yet where there's bound to be plenty of bugs & crashes here and there from time to time which is expected. But from what I can see so far from the several updates and patches to fix bugs, it seems like it's fully focusing on multiplayer so far and at the same time it's degrading every aspect of the general environment of the game itself. Game functions have been altered/changed without improving anything, they've been updating and adding/fixing issues but at the same time creating more problems and errors/crashes for the game, it's like when someone has a problem with their hand, they'll just cut it all off & add a prosthetic one on without finding a cure and it seems what they're kind of doing in a way.\n\nAgain, it is an early access game and many problems still needs to be solved by the help of gamers and such, but at the same time currently its not worth your 20 bucks on it unless you wanna pay to do the work for them in a sense. There's just not enough content currently in this game to be worth anyone to pay for it's price at all in my opinion,  even though I did right off the bat went for the Deluxe Edition for the SP experience, then again I only end up finding out you only get 2 Single Player missions and later only after patches and updates those missions become semi broken.\n\nSo conclusion is, if you got the extra bucks and wanna do the "pay to work" scheme then go ahead and get this game and help the creators find a ♥♥♥♥ ton of bugs and then report to them with minimal content to play with.

Very fluid run.\n\nLacking some content such as further vehicles and units, but it is to be expected for this EA.\n\nIf you have enjoyed any of the Men of War series...I strongly urge you to pick up this gem and support the EA, you will not be dissapointed.","August 8, 2015","true","1.2"," 34 of 56 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","34","56","0","0"

No, not in the slightest.\nWill it be worth it´s money? Maybe.\n\nI do play the Men of War series since Men of War 1. And since that very little has changed, especially the graphics haven´t since the release of Men of War back in 2009. Compare those screenshots, there are just a few changes, like higher tex resolution and bump maps.\n\nMen of War (2009)[images.bit-tech.net]\nCall to Arms[cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com]\n\n\nAnd for now the content is extremely limited and just some infantry squads were released which means that you will find much bigger variety in a mod for MoW:AS 2 called “Red Rising” which already has multiple factions (Germany, USA, ISIS, Russia and various other nations) and tanks such as the M1A1-M1A2 Tusk 2 and the T-72 with reactive Armour. And for now I have to admit that I prefer this mod for being much more detailed and already more realistic (because of more realistic firing ranges). But Call to Arms doesn´t really feel like it´s a step forward to new era of weapons and technology. It really feels like being stuck with an STG 44 and a body armour.\n\nSo will this be a good game? I am pretty sure it will, but charging 19,99€ for a tiny alpha and recycled systems which has been converted to a modern theme is ridiculous. Especially when there’s already a better mod around which has the same graphics fidelity and more content. Have a look and that screenshot:\n\nRed Rising Screenshot 1\nRed Rising Screenshot 2[lh3.googleusercontent.com]\n\nHere compare those two as well, they speak for themselves:\n\nUnits from Red Rising\nUnits from Call to Arms[www.digitalmindsoft.eu]\n\nAnd bear in mind this game is from the same publisher which charged 9,99€ for a proper Third person feature in Men of War: Assault Squad 2. And I rarely seen any later improvements on units with this publisher and developer.\n\nDecide for yourself if you want to support this.

This can be seen as a negative or a positive, some people like the high degree of control you can have over each of your units. Thankfully, I have noticed my men using grenades on their own accord more often, so thats a good thing! If the micro aspect turns you off, know that it can be negated by playing higher point games where you simply don't have the time to micro your soldiers. However, you will want to micro your valuable assets like heavy tanks, keeping them in cover while poking out to take a shot and then moving back into cover.\n\n-SOUND! Holy hell the voices are AWFUL! Gun sounds also need a lot of work.\n\n- If you didn't like Men of war games, this won't really change your mind. The units do feel quite more powerful however, and the factions play very differently from each other. For instance, each ragtag militia squad has several AKMs that have full auto capacity. You will see bullets flying much more often, and tracers everywhere! I am a fan of the changes.\n\n-NEEDS BOTS IN COMBAT / LAST STANDING MODE.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/302670/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1505 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCall to Arms is a Real Time Strategy military game. For an Early Access game, it already shows a lot of promise. I find it similar to Victory Command, which is better known as it was free for some time on Steam.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You have to control your units in order to beat other teams. You are slowly gaining point and with these points, you can buy soldiers, armoured vehicles and other units.\n\nPros:    There are already quite a few games like this one, but this one does not fail impressing me. The commands are easy to figure out, the whole setup is clear and you shouldn't find it hard to get into the game. This is really good for attracting new players (and making them stay, of course).\nI don't usually rank the Options menu that high in my reviews, but the quantity of things you can set is amazing. You can change values of pretty much anything when it comes to video, audio and controls.\nYou can play singleplayer (with a little trick) and multiplayer. Surprisingly, there is always a certain amount of people playing this game, so you won't be the only guy in an empty server, as it happens to some games with that level of recognisability.\nThe amount of tutorials is astonishing. There are more than 30 tutorials in several difficulties and about 40 tips to help you play.\nI love the music in this game. There are multiple tracks, from orchestra music to choirs and they really fit the whole war scenery.\nThe game is being regularely updated with maps, missions, bug fixes and improves. This is how an Early Access game should be developed!\nThere is also Workshop support for more maps and missions. If you are into that, you can also use the Editor that comes with the game.\nCons:    The replay menu is, well, broken. After clicking it, I get a critical error in a few seconds and the game crashes. I believe, however, that this will be fixed eventually and I will correct my review when this is fixed.\nThis has to be said: Store screenshots are not realistic. This is not how this game looks like.\nYou have to own the Deluxe Edition to get access to singleplayer missions right now. Since this game is in Early Access, it is a bad idea to restrict access to one of the integral parts of the game. This results in less people testing it and might lead to buggier final product. The singleplayer campaign will be unlocked for normal buyers, too, when the game is out of EA.\nThe final verdict:This is not a full product yet, but it is already filled with contend and fun. There is also workshop support for even more missions. The gameplay is filled with possibilities and it is very easy to learn. Despite having some bugs in Early Access, I definitely recommend this game for RTS fans.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.\n---\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 26, 2015","true","5.6"," 46 of 80 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","46","80","4","0"

EDIT: A bunch of vehicles are now available in MP: humvees, armed pickups, strikers and btr-80s. Also they are not planning air vehicles for MP only for SP (this might change).\n\n-Deluxe Edition unlocks Single Player and the three SP missions available right now, with more missions being released during Early Access. Single Player will be available for everyone at the release.\n\n-If you don't want to play against other people, you can host games and play with bots, you will still gain XP.\n\n-You can create your own maps/mission with the GEM editor, identical with the one in previous DMS titles. The game has workshop support, a few custom maps and missions are already available to play.\n\n-Plenty of placeholders and missing features, everything you see is subject to change and it will be improved or replaced. You can check the Roadmap topic to read about the development schedule. Other factions may be added depending on the games success.\n\nBuy this game now only if you want to help the DMS make a better game. If you hate playing an incomplete game with bugs and what not, just wait for the official release (Q1 2016).\n\nIMPORTANT!\nCtA will feature a 3rd person view for vehicle direct control instead of the birds eye view perspective from the previous games. This feature was announced from the beginning (2013) and the devs are determined to make this change for CtA. They said they will release on official mod for the old direct control but it will not be in the game by default.","August 3, 2015","true","59.8"," 29 of 51 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","29","51","4","7"

It does indeed sound awesome and the gameplay is also pretty interesting. However, this game is still in alpha/beta-version and it has been like that since 2015. There are new updates every now and then but the main problem is still around, even after a year.\nNow, I am pretty damn sure that my rig is way above the required specs, but I have yet managed to play a full session without crashing, and this happens regurlarly.\nI open the game, edit my settings/vid options, insta-crash. Tried doing it again, but then bam! Another crash...\nI open the game in safe mode, then I find out that my vid settings did actually get saved for whatever reason. I then proceed to a skirmish match, plays for like 20-30 minutes then crash.\nI open the game in editor mode, access violation error crashes after a bit.\nAlmost reaching 2 hours, I immediately refunded the game.\n\nTLDR;\nThe concept is nice, but the game is horribly broken.\n\nMoWAS is way better than this.","May 28","false","1.5"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","21","36","2","0"

I first thought they would have it coexist together till they completly removed it for vehicles. I don't even think they had asked the opinions of the community first that were actually supporting them with money but they didn't get the thing they wanted for their money and some people can't even get  a refund which is really sad. I came to a conclussion that I wont be telling my friends to buy Call to Arms and I will not be saying it is a great game till they have put in our beloved Direct Control\n\nMy Opinion now: I think the game has made some good changes lately it is going to add more entities and it is adding some cool features. MP is starting too look fun too because a lot of people are buying CtA.

I'll repost a few things I discussed in Rokko's review's discussion section, the review that is currently at the top.\n\nThe old DC is still available! You have to click the button on the HUD, rather than press the Hotkey. In the bottom left corner there are four small boxes, stacked vertically: a skull and crossbones, a wooden crate, a blue/red man portrait, and an upward arrow type symbol (that is the top box). That last symbol is the direct control button.\n\nJust so everyone who hasn't played CtA yet is clear, the new direct control is the old one, but from a lower, fixed camera angle. That's about it. The idea is to make it harder to see enemies from across the map and hit them though multiple buildings when you wouldn't be able to see it in real life. It also gives the direct control a more action type feel. This is in keeping with the direction that CtA is moving as a whole with closer range infantry combat as the focus. There will be more additions to the new DC like a gun camera zoom mode, and no range limitations in DC to make up for the limited view. It will allow tank combat from a more realistic perspective, rather than the omnipotent, gods eye, hit everything from the old DC that was totally OP for people who were good at it. Keeping the old DC in would drive away new players for whom it is an awkward and somewhat ill-conceived system that gives too much of an advantage to veterans. In 4v4's I can cruise around the back half of the map with a GRM tier 2 AP technical and easily get a dozen Humvee kills with that one vehicle because I know how to use the old DC and the newer players don't. It is a game-breaking exploit that will drive away new players in frustration. Here's a thread where the developer covers their reasons for the change:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/302670/discussions/0/537405286661241101/\n\nTheir new style of DC is in development, whereas the old style is polished after many years. You can't know what the new DC will really be like on release, and it isn't fair to compare the alpha version of the new DC to the polished version of the old DC. It's not about liking the new DC as it is now, but appreciating that this is a new feature that will take time to get right, and that once they get it right they will phase out the old DC (a nice compromise I think).\n\nI can say the same for other missing features. As the road map on the CtA sticky covers, things like more vehicles, the inventory, menu, UI, HUD, more game modes, full single player campaigns, more multiplayer maps, voiceovers, animations, etc...are all in the process of being developed and changed. It's absurd to complain about missing features in an early access Alpha release where they straight up tell you that those features are not in yet, and even go so far as to give you a timeline for when they will be in:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/302670/discussions/0/530646080847272442/\n\nOn the whole, Call to Arms is an immense improvement on the Men of War formula. It focuses on intense infantry engagements, and emphasizes cover, flanking and actual tactics much more than previous MoW titles. The maps are tighter, more urban, and with much more thoughtful placement of abundant cover and positions to flank from. The graphics are better, and the overall feel is more visceral and engaging. I've enjoyed playing the multiplayer this past week more than perhaps any time playing MoWAS2. I just played a few rounds of assault squad for comparisons sake and was shocked at how lackluster it seemed. CtA is in early access Alpha and I'd already rather play it than assault squad.\n\nI'm writing this review because I know how important the top reviews are for a game to succeed, and how commonly people can be turned off of buying a game because of one internet troll's loud, ignorant complaining about something they don't understand and isn't yet fully implemented. I like the direction they are going, and I am excited for the eventual full release, and I would hate to see all that potential dashed to pieces because of low sales due to a few misconceived, negative reviews of the alpha version.\n","August 19, 2015","true","120.2"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

And no, you are not put in matches with people of equal level. It is very likely you will be in a match with someone that simply has more and better options then you.\n\nDirectly Control is no more in the sense anyone who is familiar with it would know. It is now being billed as "3rd person experience" and frankly right now it is kinda meh.\n\nThe feature is not finished, so it is unfair to jump to any conclusions other than the Direct Control from games gone by in the series, is no more.\n\nThe game itself looks rather decent. It plays much like its cousin AS2. It simply has no content.\nThey haven't pushed any boundries at all.\nAerial units will not be featured in multiplayer at all. I am not sure what they will be able to do with them on a single player side of things, as of now they appear to be nothing more than a prop.\n\nThe maps all feel very redundant. The landscape and atmosphere is kinda blah, but again nothing looks bad per say.\n\nYou only get two nations ( factions ) USA and some made up fictional muslim cliche middle eastern separist group.\n\nOnly a couple units feel "unique" most of them just seem like re-labled duplicates.\n\nYou see the truth is most of these things will get swept under the rug of "Early Access"\nAnd truthfully, justifiable so when considering what early access is.\n\nAs far as single player, I have no clue, they are selling a "deluxe" version of the early access game which grants you early access to the skirmishes which will be made available to everyone, for free, upon completion.\n\nSo now we have companies selling us early access to content within an early access game.\n\n"Yo dawg, I heard you liked early access, so I put some early access in your early access!"\n\nI wouldn't expect too much, and maybe for you what little it has to offer will be enough.","July 31, 2015","false","2.4"," 54 of 104 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","54","104","3","0"

Maybe the development team can do something new with CTA that will revitalize the MoW style gameplay -However, I think they're going to try and preserve what they have in order to mirror what they believe is a 'winning' equation from the MoW franchise.\n\nNot everything is bad, and there have been some slight improvements that I'd like to highlight that really stand out for CtA:\n\n-Ammunition/Weapon management - Players no longer have to manage individual bandoleers/clips/belts of ammunition. Each weapon comes with a standard amount of ammunition that is automatically attached to the assigned weapon. This is a massive improvement over the old system, in which players were forced to manage weapons and their associated ammunition allotment by picking up individual clips of ammunition for their Soldiers.\n\n-Vehicle Control - When players toggle the direct-control mode of a vehicle, they are now seated directly behind the vehicle in a stationary, third person view that roates with the turret of the vehicle. I never enjoyed the direct control management of MoW - I was always torn between looking at my target and looking at my vehicle. The new system feels much better and handles like a 3rd person view, rather than whatever the old system was trying to be.\n\n-Depth of Field - This new graphical setting is a welcomed addition (also recently added to MoW) that improves performance, especially when utilizing the new direct-control mode.\n\nAgain, I think there are few improvements to the game, but nothing that would be considered ground breaking. I'm willing to toggle this review, considering the game is still early access - I just dont see this going anywhere different than MoW","January 1","false","43.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I've played a bit of multiplayer (when I could find someone else who was playing) and spent some time in the single-player missions. This game is an attempt at a modern Men Of War, and does it well in some areas, but not so well in others. So far the campaign is a bit lacking and is prone to bugs/glitches, and in my experience (although limited) the multiplayer does not run very well. My recommedation for the average Steam member is to wait until a final product is released with all of the issues ironed out.

Being able to choose to command between one soldier and a whole unit is what makes this game unique, spreading your squad the way you like around objects out smarting your opponent. Also each soldier has his own amount and type of weapons u can use  which makes combat intense and unpredictabe. The speed of interaction between movement and combat makes the battles feel realistic. You can always control a soldier or vehicle in 3rd person if you wish to and use your aiming skills to defeat enemy units.

Will i be able to play this Digital Mindsoft title without suffering permanent eye damage?

I especially like the loading bar in this game cause it does totaly not look like the Windows Vista taskbar - original design. At all does the UI feature some fancy features, just like the global chat where you can say "WTB GF" and pray for someone to answer your offer. Or you just look at the list of players who are online - sometimes it does even show when a developer is playing the game. It's realy nice to know that one of these VAC-banned gods is playing at the same time i do.\n\nNow about the gameplay, it mostly evolves arround beeing too low level to call in any units that can harm the enemy, or you get simply kicked out of lobbies for beeing too low level - maybe this new gameplay system is a bit hard to understand for the casual gamer, but as their CEO allready said, just go grind exp by killing bots!

The Balance\n\nThe Balance, is pretty decent, currently favouring USA, but tanks aren't implimented so this may change or even out. I'd still say I am not a big fan of the basic model, as it is right now.\n\nYou have 2 factions GRM and USA, the GRM is nearly identical to the USA with the exception that everything they have is worse but cheaper, and they get 1 extra guy per infantry squad, though not support squads.\n\nThis is boring to me, as all it means is that as GRM you lose more guys but generally play the same just slightly less effective, so far GRM does not have a single unit that is better than the US counterpart, you just get more. And I could give a lot of examples of this, but there is no need, because this is litterally all the thought there is put into it.\n\nBear in mind, i am not saying it's unbalanced. i am just saying their balance model is boring, and not at all like in Men of War.\n\n2. Realism\n\nRight now there are many flaws in the physics and behavior of a lot of equipment, SPG-9 works like an RPG dispite being a recoiless rifle, and the speed of projectiles is dubious, I understand this isn't high on the list of things to get done. Luckily this is mostly quite easily changeable with mods, and when there is time to fix this it probably will.\n\n3. Unlock System\n\nUnlocks in mow2 were annoying, but they were kinda fast, and you could turn them off in custom games.\nIn CtA you can't turn off unlocks, they are always on.\n\nThe game punishes you for being good, since you get basically no XP for winning, but lots of xp for killing and losing units. Which means that long drawn out games that are basically a tie, will give you more XP than skillfully defeating the enemy by capturing and holding points.\n\nI really hope this will change, atleast so that unlocks are sensible, though i'd prefer them being removed though i understand some people like this sort of thing.\n\n4. New Direct Control View\n\nIs honestly not a problem, a lot of reviews seem to think it is, I am as much of a men of war veteran as the rest of them, but while i at first didn't like the system very much, i think it has a lot of potential.\n\nFirstly it looks cool, being down to earth.\nSecondly after the update to it, it is much easier to navigate with it, and i'd go as far as to say that it's more useful for urban fighting than the old direct control is, because with the new system you can actually see through allys.","August 25, 2015","true","118.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

That doesn't make it bad. However, because I have a certain opinion about early access games, I will be happy to follow it as it develops, but I don't think I'll shell out the cash until I see a finished product. Unfortunately these early access games are a trending issue that I believe shouldn't exist. Regardless of what you charge, I believe that you shouldn't, until the game is done. With that being said, it shows lots of promise, and if it's half as complex and interesting as the games that came before it, it should be a great title to look forward to.","December 30, 2015","false","1.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

And some people think GRM is underpowered. (Now apparentely they are overpowered, make up your minds).\n\nI will say this game is a lot more casual than Men of War is but I am having a lot of fun with it right now playing against the bots. Though there are only 2 factions to play as USA and GRM, there is talk of more being added in the future.\n\nThe maps are very good looking as well as the models and textures in general. I haven't played much of the singleplayer but it seems to be shaping up nicely. I always wanted a modern version of MoW and this hits the spot and it will only get better from here.\n\nThe game modes are a nice change of pace with Evacuation and King of the Hill as well as classic Domination and Last Man Standing. Hopefully there will be more game modes in the future.\n\n\nI recommend this game to any MoW players. If you're curious, buy it and see what you think. You can always refund the game under 2 hours playtime (and under 14 days).","January 5","true","27.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

But here is my reasoning for the the thumbs down.  (Please note this review is of the games current state right now)\n\n-  Now my biggest hate of this game comes from the amount of content in this game.  Now yes there is a editor and yes you can download maps off of steam  (Even though there isnt many).  And sure you can play multiplayer but its just not the same type of gameplay.  Now this content I am talking about is single player.  Little did I know you have to BUY the single player which is $15 dollars.  I wouldnt mind but $15 dollars for a single player campaign and a few extra goodies just isnt acceptable.  And I know its in earley access so not all the content isnt going to be in the game but no for the few missions of single player you have to BUY it.  I wouldnt mind but this game is in earley access and already there is DLC just to play a part of the game that shouldve been included with the full game in the first place.  Other than that the game is very fun and if you dont need a single player campaign and just want to 1v1 against AI or play against other people then that is fine and I recommend the game but if you are more of a single player guy than you will be disappointed.\n\n-  Note this review is of August 29 2015 and things might change.","August 29, 2015","false","3.8"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","2"

Perhaps won’t be a good idea to release it with this locked permanently but being forced into a certain play style does actually give one a chance to see that the game can be played and enjoyed in more way than one.\n\nLove the way the game looks and feels, love the Arabian music, and really do have much higher hopes for this game even than when I bought it. Some of the battles I had today were thrilling. I used a method of winning that I don’t think I’ve ever used in the past fighting away from his flags and mine in a far off corner where he ended up bleeding his army white trying to dislodge me in an attempt to get access to my last remaining flag. All the while I was saving for mortars and keeping what few recon men I had down. The result when these tactics work out is encirclement and happiness!\n\nIf this game was ever able to attain the success which we all know MOW has truly deserved then that would only be a great thing for us in the MOW community. Massive success will bring greater resources to the development team which would make an even better game now or in the future.\n\nWhy can’t we get behind it and wait and see and save the thumbs down reviews until after it is released?\n\nAnyone should be able to see it is early days and already is looking very promising.\n\nAnyway I’m going to give it a positive review for now to balance things out a bit, and I hope that anyone who agrees with me on this and wants this game to do well will do the same. I really hope that finally this game will end up knocking COH of its undeserved perch.\n\nIf I think the game stinks on release I will happily change this review of course and I really hope the famous crash will not be present.","August 24, 2015","true","30.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","1"
