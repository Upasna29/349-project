Make a game where you start doing the busy work and work your way up where you are managing employees and then regions, etc.  The problem is this game fails at almost every level.\n\n* Pizza making: almost no feedback telling you what you're doing right or wrong.\n* Delivery mini-game: Horrible controls, frustating "physics".\n* Managing employees: boring.\n* Managing stores:  Supposedly there is competion, but from what I can tell they don't actually do anything.\n* Events: Occasionally there are events that happen, but they have little more impact on the game than Monoply Chance cards.\n\nIn the later game, you're mostly sitting around sending employees on vacation, wating for more money to buy another store.  There's just a lack of anything to do in the game other than make rude shapes using the pepperonis.\n\n---------------------------------\n--- Re tried the game 2015-01-16 after the new patch\n\nHere's what's improved:\n* Pizza making: Customers' tolerence for what constitutes "lots of" or "a little" ingredient is much relaxed so you don't have to experiment by counting ingredients anymore.\n* Pizza prepartion: There is now an extra step in making a pizza which involves timing the cooking phase.  This adds to the challenge when multitasking.\n* New inventory system:  Having a new system to play with is good and adds some depth to the game.\n\nHere's what's not improved:\n* Delivery mini-game: The driving still my least liked part of the game.   I think the biggest problem is when driving fast, it doesn't feel fast, so when you hit a curb at 50mph it seems like the car unnecessarily launches into the air.  Also, I didn't mention this before, but the sound the car makes is unpleasant to the point I turn off the sound, especially so when one of the wheels is off the ground.\n* Customer Feedback:  Customers are still strangely vague about what they didn't like about a pizza.  Saying that a pizza didn't have enough toppings on a pizza with 5 ingredients doesn't help much identifying how to make a better pizza.  It would be better if the customer could comment on the ingredient that was most wrong (e.g.  "There wasn't enough cheese.")\n* Allow Employee boxes:  This new feature seems to be there to encourage players to fill orders themselves and/or get to the part of the game with store managers.  Either way, having to click a box every time I want an employee to interact with an order gets old quickly.  If I ran a real pizza shop and had to tell the employees to work on every individual order, I'd go insane.  I think this could be made better by allowing the player to promote a manager on acquisition of the second store rather than the third.\n* Cooking an order: There's a new icon that appears on the left part of the screen when an order is being cooked.  But the icon isn't associated with the the order screen, so if you have two orders cooking, it's guess work to determine which order to click "Perform" on to stop cooking it.  Having the cooking graphic on the order line itself would fix this confusion.\n* Costs: With the addition of ingredient purchasing, money management becomes much more important, however there is almost no control of costs or prices.  As far as I can tell, the only direct control of my money I have is what I pay employees and optional purchases (advertising, events, etc).  Ingredients, once upgraded into them, must always be stocked; so you can easily get into an unrecoverable state where the cost of ingredients out-paces your income.  It would be nice to be able to turn off the ingredient upgrades.  Also it would be nice to have a daily summary of costs and income, e.g. Sales, Tips, Wages, Ingredients, Store costs, penalties, advertizing, etc.\n* Advertising:  I have no idea what affect this has on the game or how to decide what the sliders do.\n* Managing employees:  No changes with employees.  Paying them and sending them on vacation is about all you do here.  Employees are basically duplicated drones differentiated only by job and a rating of skill.  Training seems pointless when a beginner can become a master in the matter of minutes naturally.  There's no strategy needed when dealing with them, so it just feels like a chore.\n* Later game:  There still doesn't seem like much here, just more of the same.  Have I just not played enough, is there a new mechanic after getting into new regions?\n\nI'd say, overall the updates to the game are in the right direction, but I still cannot recommend the game.  I wish the developers the best and hope those that do like this game continue to enjoy it.","January 10, 2015","false","5.5"," 202 of 235 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","202","235","6","9"

I had been looking forward to playing it for a while, but I found the gameplay mechanics to be too frustrating to be fun. My main problem is with the pizza making, it takes way too long to make the correct pizza orders, having to click and count each ingredient 20-40 times when you have 4 ingredients on just one pizza (and orders often have multiple pizzas) just isn't fun. I wasn't that impressed with the rest of the game either, upgrading ingredients and delivering pizzas which I was looking forward to, got old quick. I can see that some people like this game, but if you're a perfectionist like me and want to make perfect orders, I don't think this is for you.","December 1, 2015","false","1.0"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","24","29","3","0"

It seems like no matter what you do, you always put on too few toppings. There doesnt' seem to be any indicators of how much is "a lot" of pepperoni or "a little" either, so no matter how much or how little I put on, the customer feedback was the same, -- "Did you even bother to put on any toppings?" Very frustrating.\n\nThen you have to deliever the pizzas yourself, at least at the beginning, which is harder than it should be. There's an AI arrow telling you where the house is, but it doesn't actually tell you where to go. It tells you "as the crow flies" where the house is, which may or may not be where an actual road is. This results in a lot of missed deliveries because you flip your car over or crash into a house because you turned where it was indicating but it ended up being a dead-end. In this modern world of GPS, you'd think they coud've put something a little more accurate like that in the game (maybe it's an upgrade later in the game, who knows...)\n\nEventually you do earn enough upgrades to hire employees, which significantly improves your customer feedback (since the computer is now making the pizzas and delivering them for you). Still this quickly becomes a very tedius repetitve thing where all you're doing is clicking on "Yes, employee, please make this pizza for me...." "Yes, employee, please deliver this pizza for me..."\n\nI feel like this game wasn't sure what it was trying to be. This either needs to be a more functioning simulation that gives you feedback on how to improve your pizza making skills or it needs to be a more automated tycoon-style game that you don't have to remind your employees every single time to start the pizza, deliver the pizza, etc.\n\nI played this for about 2 hours. I finally ended up with several employees, and didn't think I was doing too terribly when one case of food poisoning put me out of business. Instant game over with no way to get back any of your progress. Sooooo frustrating. I definitely won't be playing this again.","February 14, 2015","false","1.1"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","26","35","0","2"

This one really falls short. I'm actually surprised to learn that this isn't an early access game.\n- UI needs a lot of polishing. There's literally a part of the interface where if you have nothing selected, a screen just reads "NO."\n- Parts of the game occasionally freeze/lock up. There's about a 50% chance that when I see one of the "clean up for the health inspector" minigames that it'll freeze in some way or not count down the game tmer.\n- The parts of the game that should be fun, like making orders, are more tedious than anything and it's very difficult to measure if you're improving on your pizza making skills at all or if it's just a total crapshoot on whether or not you get a perfect order. It just generally results in you having characters perform all tasks for you and you just click/drag icons to people's faces.\n- It just feels very clunky and unfinished. Hard to describe, but it has that very general "this game is not done" feeling.\n- Delivery part is the most fun, but the navigation is weird, the map doesn't show your destination, and as you buy car upgrades the cars seem to actually get worse in terms of handling and helping with perfect orders. Who would've thought that hitting the breaks on your car would flip it frontwards, implying that the pure stopping force of your breaks is stronger than the pull of the earth's gravity on your car/it's weight. aka upgrading your car turns it into tissue paper.\n- It's too easy. I found myself able to purchase every single upgrade every single day without having to choose any tradeoffs or have to play the game more to save up for things. But, with the way this game plays, that actually seems to be a benefit.\n\nI seriously love all food related games and really wanted to love this game, but it's just hard for me to play more than 15 minutes at a time without getting bored with the game mechanics & feeling like it's missing something.","December 23, 2015","false","15.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

I saw this is about building an empire, you get to expand your stores, there's mini quests involving mafia, there are competitors, and you make your own pizza.\n\nSadly after playing this for a bit I realized the two games are nothing alike, and comparing the two really makes this feel unfinished. Despite some patches that improved previous complaints, things still could be better.\n\nFor example, one of the quest is to make X amount of 'perfect order', which involves perfect cooking, and perfect delivery. But despite the in-game feedback telling you the food was cooked perfectly, you still do not get the credit. And to achieve 'perfect delivery', it requires you to complete the task within 1/2 of the allotted time, and isn't possible unless you are breaking traffic laws by driving 70+ mph, going through sidewalks, running red lights and driving in the incoming lane, which seems rather ridiculous and breaks the in-game SoD quite a bit.","March 19, 2015","false","10.7"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","23","37","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grinf4ce/recommended/318260/","grinf4ce","Grinf4ce.at","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grinf4ce/","54 products in account","This is my updated Review on Supreme, as there where several changes on the gameplay and I dont want to have an outdated review (You can read the original Review here: http://www.pastebin.ca/3027775.).\nThe updated review below is related to the Major Release on June 11th.\nI will only go on new changes/improvements which are related to the latest build. You can read the full review below.\n\nReview Result or TL;DRI can recommend this game. It makes quite fun for short-game sessions.\nThe developers did improve some weak points during last updates.\n\nStrong Points:\n+ Concept Idea is nice (You get order, you craft the food, you deliver them).\n+ Different Food with different Toppings.\n+ Random Events (Mafia, Flashmob, Poisoned Food) where you need to take a decision with good/bad impact on you.\n+ Feedback what you did good/bad during creation of food.\n+ Improved Driving-Expierience during Delivery-Mini-Game.\n\nWeak Points:\n- Currently none (as not parts of the game where re-played).\n\nSupreme - Updated Review (14th June)1.) Tutorial\nThe tutorial is still clear written and easy to understand.\nA strong improvement in new version is to give advises at the end of "Food-Creation"-Process, regarding the topic ammount and likes of the customers.\nThis makes it more easier to build a "perfect" pizza.\n\n2.) Technical: Graphics\nIn my last review I concerned, that there is no life in the delivery-city and no day/night-cycle.\nI was surprised during my last game session. The city looks very nice! The textures got updated, the city environment got improved. Day/Night-Cycle implemented.\n\n2.) Technical: Sound\nNo change since my last review.\n\n3.) Technical: Controls\nThe controls during the delivery got improved.\n\n4.) Lets Play: Working in Shop\nSince the last updates, this point got improved. The orders comes now via phone, computer or smart-tv. You will get feedback during the food-creation process what you did good and what not (in regards to the topics on pizza/sub/..). This makes it more easier to understand what means "little" and what means "a lot". Anyway, it needs some experience to do it perfect, but the game now supports you a little bit.\n\nYou have now a short period of time to do the job by yourself or assign it to one of your employees. The employees have an energy bar. You need to send them for a break, otherwise they will burn-out and quit ther job. In case of some employee quits / or get fired, you will automatically get another one. During my 1h session, I did not find any possibility to upgrade the single employees. Maybe it is implemented and I did not found the corresponding menu.\nAnyway, as this is unconfirmed and will not be have any impact on the review-result.\nCurrently, I cant give any feedback for the multi-store-feature (Tycoon Mode?) as I did not reach the possibility to do this.\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to buy new ingredients stock. Otherwise the customers will call you to get disappointed because their favorite food is out of stock.\n\n5.) Lets Play: Deliver the Food\nStrong improvements on this part of game.\nControlling the car is more precise and easier. The borders got removed, so you can drive across the walkway without your car get flipped (btw it is still possible to flip it - but another way). If your car flips, you can reset it and will get put onto your wheels again instead of the delivery failed.\nYou still not need to consider the road traffic act, but as the time seems to be shorter than previous, and the car dont flip on walkways, this makes more fun!\n\nAfter delivery, you will get a good overview of the delivery-stats and the store reputation will increase/decrease.\n\n6.) Lets Play: Upgrade your shop\nUnlocking ingrediences, sides and cars is remain unchanged.\nThe store-tier upgrade seems to be offered automatically during the game (after some days).\nThe update makes it possible to hire employees (during my game-session only cooks/drivers).\nIt is now possible to get multiple orders when the reputation is high enough (makes it more easy to put enough workload on your employees).\nMaybe I dont found appropiate menus, but it seems that the company upgrades such as advertisment got removed (unconfirmed).\n\n7.) Lets Play: Manage your shop\nI was not deep enough in the gameplay of new version to give a review about this.\nThere are still funny and new random events where you need to take decision.\n\nAnyway, when I checked the last updates, it makes quite fun to play the game. So I will change the recommendation from No to Yes for this current Build.\nAs soon as I continue playing my savegame and check the multiple-store-feature, I will update this review again.\nIf you have any questions, please come back to me.\n\nBest regards,\nGrinf4ce\n\n//Edit 1: Added TL:DR section.","January 11, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

I've wanted to buy it for quite some time since I've seen one of my favourite streamers playing it... But here's the thing: since the new update, it's no longer the same game. I know that the update was supposed to make it better, but it just made it awful for me. Now random events pop up no matter what you do (even when making pizza or driving) and you might click on answers without getting the chance to actually read the event. The driving is awful; the game is buggy (I've been asked multiple times to put "ranch sauce" on the pizza... while I don't have that sauce, and of course putting BBQ sauce or pizza sauce doesn't work). It's repetitious and boring, the gameplay is confusing (how do I get employees ? How do I interact with them? I have NO clue). The game seemed nice in its earlier version, now it was simly a pain to play. After 30 minutes I already wanted a refund, I forced myself to play 1 hour more to see if the beginning was just boring and then it would get better, but it doesn't seem so. I've now gotten a refund.\n\nTL; DR: Got a refund because the game is buggy, not what I was promised from previous videos because the last update changed it COMPLETELY for the worst, and ultra repetitious-boring.","June 14, 2015","false","6.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

Whenever someone wants a lot of something on their pizza, I make sure to completely cover the entire pizza in whatever they wanted.  It's all about giving. In all honesty, it's not about what you want, it's about what the customer wants. After all, like Mr. Krabs said in episode 69 of Spongebob Squarepants, "Krusty Towers," "We shall never deny a guest even the most rediculous request."

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kkddpp33/recommended/318260/","kkddpp33","kkddpp33","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kkddpp33/","179 products in account","The game starts off very slowly.  You're the only employee in your pizza business, so it's your job to both make the pizza and deliver it.  You choose your toppings (very limited at first), manually place them on the pizza, then hop in the car and WASD deliver it to a green area in a city.  You have an ample time limit to deliver in.  It seems like the only danger is flipping your car if you brush up against a curb during a turn, which automatically forfeits your delivery.  Other cars driving on the roads will stop if you cut in front of them, so it seems like you would only hit them if you were trying, or were very reckless.\n\nAfter you've delivered a few pizzas, you get to buy some upgrades.  First toppings (olives, bell peppers, ham, etc), then sides (pasta, garlic bread), and eventually shop employees.  You can upgrade to hire chefs, drivers, and janitors.\n\nThis game's speed is absolutely exponential.  Where the pizza deliveries initially drag on, once you make your first hires, it starts to explode.  Suddenly the game is about pizza shop management instead of pizza order fulfillment.  You can then unlock additional shops and regions, and you can keep tabs on your competition's stores.  You can hire managers to watch over your employees' productivity and wellbeing, then hire regional managers to supervise those managers.\n\nIt was almost too hard to keep up after I made the poor choice of unlocking all the regions at once and opening a store in each - expansion strategy is definitely important in this game.\n\nYou'll have employees who quit because they're overworked, along with kitchen fires, political decisions, mafia proposals, etc. that show up in a small event feed in the upper right hand corner.\n\nI'm definitely not done playing this game, but I thought I'd jump in and provide a review while the sale is going on.\n\nAs for my opinion: yes, definitely buy this if you like sim games.  The devs are obviously still engaged in improving the game and you should be able to get several hours of play out of it.  However if you lack patience, this may not be the game for you.  There are quite a few pizzas and deliveries to make before the game scales up to the management aspect.\n\nTL;DR - 7.5/10 would recommend, but devs are involved so that number will go up as they respond to comments.  Gotta have patience as your store grows.  Don't run into the curb.  If your employee is slacking, fire them.","January 13, 2015","true","2.3"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

The descriptions of the pizzas I had to make were vague e.g a little cheese. How much cheese is this? What is considered "a little"? These are some questions I asked myself. The driving was wacky and that's why I enjoyed it\n\nIn conclusion this is a fun casual pizza shop/franchise running simulator, I just wish the pizza making was more informative in regards to how well I was doing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_b27K2Drso&list=UUV3Kx3vCAIKxx5H7Lh7SzQg","January 17, 2015","true","0.8"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jerfox/recommended/318260/","jerfox","Kyu Kilari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jerfox/","395 products in account","Updated as of the new update:\nI played about three hours of the newest update and i have to say it is a huge improvement on the old version of the game. I have to say that All of the things that were added and removed were really good changes for the games I will expand on all of this later on in the review. Although I recommended the game earlier this year but just not the price point i can say that just like last time the I would not have paid 15 dollars for this game. But on sale for 10$ or 7.50$ is well worth this type of game.\n\nPros:\n- Driving mini-game has been updated so that you can’t flip the car anymore as easily.\n- Creation mini-games stayed the same. (They are good as they are and did not need changed anyways)\n- There is no more clicking a button to clean your shop anymore! (Yay this made no since without an applicable mini-game for it or something else)\n- The new overview screen. While this is no longer a pizza I can see why this was changed to allow more than a couple of shops to own. I think I saw it’s possible to have up to over like 70-80 shops or so.\n- The UI Overhaul! This was a great change because of the old UI had just so much fluff that it made no since to see all of this information when there were not really anything good about this.\n-The new manager and employee system. You can have one manager and four employees now. This is also all on the same screen as your shop. It makes it easier for you to view everything you need without having to cover up and important parts of what’s going on.\n- The new drag and drop to employees (before managers) for them to get the order. This allows for more player interaction and i had fun sitting there and trying to micromanage some shops until they had managers this time around. I wanted to make sure that no phone call was going unanswered and made it interesting and fun for me to go through all of this.\n- Etc... I guess I will expand on more later if I remember any more pros about this game.\n\nCons\n-Like I said previously the price point of the game is still a huge concern. 15$ is still a big price for a game like this. But when a sale goes on for like 7.50$ or 10$ it will be well worth the pickup price for this game.\n- I don’t really know about any more cons for me personally but if any arise I will update this review as well.\n\nSo I will say that i give this game a solid 8.5/10 for me. If anyone likes a management sim type game this is the game for you. This allows for more of that than anything else. You can now drive during the day and night and that’s cool. But it’s a relaxing game and not to be taken seriously. So yes i would say to pick this up!\n\n\n\nPrevious Version Of Game:\nI’ve played the game for about two hours and was able to get through a majority of the early game. I plan on continuing to play later on but decided I had to write a review on this game soon. When the game launched there were a lot of negative reviews on it by those whom only played it for like ten to twenty minutes that said how bad the game was. I felt like they didn’t give it a fair shake so I decided to invest a couple more hours into the game. The price range of fifteen dollars is understandable and affordable for me but I would suggest if you’re interested in the game to give it a chance as well. The tycoon aspect of the game is definitely in here but not like other tycoon games. It’s not like you can customize your shops looks and such but you have to make sure each store stays profitable and you not go under. The events are definitely great throughout the game but I hope that there is more to come in this aspect as it seems to be a really strong part of the game. The mini games are something we get to see for a very small amount of time, i.e. for the first thirty minutes to an hour on a new game but I always went back to play the driving mini game because it is pretty funny physics. The whole flipping car and trying to drive off road is enjoyable. I wish there was a mode to just drive around the city and not deliver but that’s just me. The creation mini games are funny little things that I don’t think are supposed to be taken as serious as people wanted. There are sure cut ways to make the pizzas perfect and horrible and it’s a bit of a learning curve but I was able to get used to it quickly. The main part of the game is the management part which I saw some people call a management sim. It’s pretty much like. With the patch that hit earlier this week we were given the management of the food stock in your stores. Now onto what I think are the pros and cons of the game.\n\nPros:\n- Pizza Creation Mini-games\n- Other Food Creation Mini-games\n- Driving Mini-games (On Both Lists because it’s needed for the game but has one main issue)\n- Management part of the game\n- Random Events\n- Pace of the game\n- Upgrades\n\nCons:\n- It’s a management emphasis so it’s not for everyone.\n- Price is an issue for some people that I have noticed but wasn’t for me but it’s going on this side.\n- Driving physics (They are pretty hilarious during some times but it feels bad when you flip by barely hitting the curb right before getting the delivery zone)\n\n8/10 - Would actually recommend to anyone who likes pizza, tycoon games, management games, or just want to play a casual game that they can pick up. That’s what this game is under which is casual because of the fact that it is not to be taken so seriously. It’s a game to sit back and kill a couple of minutes up to hours on some times. I enjoyed all two hours that I have thrown into this game and I will be updating this review in a week or so to continue my feelings on the game if they have changed after I get more time into it. Take all of this with a grain of salt though and try it for yourself because the only way for you to know if you like the game is to watch actual gameplay of it or play it yourself.","January 17, 2015","true","9.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Luckily, you can hire a driver or two as you get further along into the game that will automate that process.  I find reputation hard to build, mainly because I’m having a lot of trouble figuring out how much of a particular ingredient to use.  When the customer complains that there aren’t enough toppings (or too much), it doesn’t tell me which ingredient I messed up on.  Either there needs to be more detailed feedback or the perfect order requirement needs to be a bit more lenient, in my opinion.  Otherwise, it’s a fairly addicting game that I’d happily come back to as time permitted.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPguaJKkArE","January 15, 2015","true","2.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

It's easy to hop in, play, save your game and continue right where you left off later. You start off as a small pizza shop owner having to do all the leg work yourself. You then progress to upgrading your shop to something better, hiring employees, managing their pay, vacation, skill, training, forming different kinds of advertising campaigns to get the best reputation results (when you get more popular, you then have to start being able to juggle 10+ orders per shop being placed at the same time).\n\nMix that in with the fun random events like the actress outside that you can help or leave to the mob, laundering money for the mafia and later starting a war between the gangs, influencing politics and backing a potential Senator (or later a President), and this game is a breath of fresh air and simply fun to play when you need a break from other standardized (copycat) games (*cough* survival games plaguing early access).\n\nI don't understand the people posting negative reviews about a $13 game they only played for 10-20 minutes. At the beginning it's more about making your customers happy, personally making and delivering the pizzas (and later the wings, breadsticks, subs, and other unlockable items) so you aren't going to be doing pure management up front. I don' t think this game is meant to copy other tycoon games but be a fun simulation of its own, starting from the bottom and working your way to the top.\n\nOne thing I do like is that the developers seem to be active and trying to make the game better.

My driving skills are put to the test during every delivery. I thought I mastered it and last night I guess I wasn't paying attention and flipped my car. The management system is fun, but could be a little deeper. The events are fun and comical and have surprise endings based on your choice.","January 11, 2015","true","8.0"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","0"

If you're too lazy to read what this games all about then at the bottom there will be a TL;DR.\n\nTHE MAIN GOAL:\nThe main goal of "Supreme" is to run a successful pizza industry so successful that everybody sees your pizza and the most superior, or get shut down (or possibly DIE) trying.\n\nTHE BEGGINING:\nSupreme is a pizza buisness tycoon. It may be new and the graphics may not be all that great, but the game is very fun to play. In this little slice of heaven, you start by naming the CEO (you), the company's name, and the company motto. At the beggining, you will have a horrible pizza joint set up, you will be the only employee, and nobody knows who or what you are. You will have to deliver the pizzas yourself when you don't have any drivers, but delivering was personally quite fun for me. The driving physics can be a little wonky at times, but it could also be pretty humorous. Random events will happen including the Mafia which could make your progress either very difficult or very easy. What you decide to do for these events will either be good or bad. The neat thing about this game is that everytime you decide something, there is a random chance of it being good or bad. Certain events only occur at certain times with certain stats set, while others happen at random. Since no janitors are hired, you will have to clean the restraunt manually whcih cost $10 every time you clean it. Making pizzas can be very difficult for some, once you get used to it, making pizzas will be super easy.\n\nTHE MIDDLE:\nAfter awhile (2-3 hours on average), you will be getting to the point where you have bought employees and have bought some other restraunts along with some regions. Employees get unhappy if you don't send them on vacations to regain energy or give them a raise here and there. Sometimes employees will make customers mad because they cooked their food wrong or sometimes they will get lazy. If this happens, you can fire them, or make them more happy and productive and possibly send them for training. Employees are very usefull after a while, at the beggining they're useless since the orders can be done faster yourself. Your employees can go on strike, or you could fire them to make things strict around your company. Other restraunts can be bought after a little while into the game, and other employees can be hired there. The global map is represented with a pizza, pretty cheesy if you ask me. Other restraunts become vital to completing your main goal, but there's another vital part of becoming the main place to go for pizza around the globe, which is ofcourse, REGIONS! Regions are used to increase the area where you can build. The government will get angry at you if you try to build yourself a little monopoly so don't just buy out on the world that quick, or be at risk of being shut down. If you have noticed by now, you will be getting alot of more events depending on if your reputation is high or low. If it is high, kids might think twice about prank calling you and vandalizing your restraunt. If your reputation is low, you might get a phone call from your wife telling you that a bunch of kids left decapitated rabbit corpses on your lawn (yes, stuff like that happens). If you ever decide you jump into politics and help a guy become president, things can go two ways, he could be a good guy, or a bad guy. If you accidently (or purposly) got a bad president elected, people will hate you for supporting him.\n\nTHE END:\nAfter a while (a LONG while), you will make it to the top. Once up at that point in the game, you can continue to deliver pizzas... for ever... and ever... and ever... and ever... but hey, you can start over and experience a new journey, and do things you didn't in your last playthrough!\n\nTL;DR?:\n9.5/10\nA very good pizza buisness tycoon which has replayability, the only downside is the graphics which for me, doesn't matter.","January 15, 2015","true","5.5"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

I wasn't paying attention to my money and was 1 dollar short, i had already hired the cleaning crew, it told me i was out of money and needed to get a loan. In my real life evrything i have is paid for and i no longer do the owing money to the man thing, so i said no to the loan. Heck it was only a dollar. After i said no to the loan- boom game over out of money business closed-game over.

Make a game where you start doing the busy work and work your way up where you are managing employees and then regions, etc.  The problem is this game fails at almost every level.\n\n* Pizza making: almost no feedback telling you what you're doing right or wrong.\n* Delivery mini-game: Horrible controls, frustating "physics".\n* Managing employees: boring.\n* Managing stores:  Supposedly there is competion, but from what I can tell they don't actually do anything.\n* Events: Occasionally there are events that happen, but they have little more impact on the game than Monoply Chance cards.\n\nIn the later game, you're mostly sitting around sending employees on vacation, wating for more money to buy another store.  There's just a lack of anything to do in the game other than make rude shapes using the pepperonis.\n\n---------------------------------\n--- Re tried the game 2015-01-16 after the new patch\n\nHere's what's improved:\n* Pizza making: Customers' tolerence for what constitutes "lots of" or "a little" ingredient is much relaxed so you don't have to experiment by counting ingredients anymore.\n* Pizza prepartion: There is now an extra step in making a pizza which involves timing the cooking phase.  This adds to the challenge when multitasking.\n* New inventory system:  Having a new system to play with is good and adds some depth to the game.\n\nHere's what's not improved:\n* Delivery mini-game: The driving still my least liked part of the game.   I think the biggest problem is when driving fast, it doesn't feel fast, so when you hit a curb at 50mph it seems like the car unnecessarily launches into the air.  Also, I didn't mention this before, but the sound the car makes is unpleasant to the point I turn off the sound, especially so when one of the wheels is off the ground.\n* Customer Feedback:  Customers are still strangely vague about what they didn't like about a pizza.  Saying that a pizza didn't have enough toppings on a pizza with 5 ingredients doesn't help much identifying how to make a better pizza.  It would be better if the customer could comment on the ingredient that was most wrong (e.g.  "There wasn't enough cheese.")\n* Allow Employee boxes:  This new feature seems to be there to encourage players to fill orders themselves and/or get to the part of the game with store managers.  Either way, having to click a box every time I want an employee to interact with an order gets old quickly.  If I ran a real pizza shop and had to tell the employees to work on every individual order, I'd go insane.  I think this could be made better by allowing the player to promote a manager on acquisition of the second store rather than the third.\n* Cooking an order: There's a new icon that appears on the left part of the screen when an order is being cooked.  But the icon isn't associated with the the order screen, so if you have two orders cooking, it's guess work to determine which order to click "Perform" on to stop cooking it.  Having the cooking graphic on the order line itself would fix this confusion.\n* Costs: With the addition of ingredient purchasing, money management becomes much more important, however there is almost no control of costs or prices.  As far as I can tell, the only direct control of my money I have is what I pay employees and optional purchases (advertising, events, etc).  Ingredients, once upgraded into them, must always be stocked; so you can easily get into an unrecoverable state where the cost of ingredients out-paces your income.  It would be nice to be able to turn off the ingredient upgrades.  Also it would be nice to have a daily summary of costs and income, e.g. Sales, Tips, Wages, Ingredients, Store costs, penalties, advertizing, etc.\n* Advertising:  I have no idea what affect this has on the game or how to decide what the sliders do.\n* Managing employees:  No changes with employees.  Paying them and sending them on vacation is about all you do here.  Employees are basically duplicated drones differentiated only by job and a rating of skill.  Training seems pointless when a beginner can become a master in the matter of minutes naturally.  There's no strategy needed when dealing with them, so it just feels like a chore.\n* Later game:  There still doesn't seem like much here, just more of the same.  Have I just not played enough, is there a new mechanic after getting into new regions?\n\nI'd say, overall the updates to the game are in the right direction, but I still cannot recommend the game.  I wish the developers the best and hope those that do like this game continue to enjoy it.","January 10, 2015","false","5.5"," 202 of 235 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","202","235","6","9"

There's an AI arrow telling you where the house is, but it doesn't actually tell you where to go. It tells you "as the crow flies" where the house is, which may or may not be where an actual road is. This results in a lot of missed deliveries because you flip your car over or crash into a house because you turned where it was indicating but it ended up being a dead-end. In this modern world of GPS, you'd think they coud've put something a little more accurate like that in the game (maybe it's an upgrade later in the game, who knows...)\n\nEventually you do earn enough upgrades to hire employees, which significantly improves your customer feedback (since the computer is now making the pizzas and delivering them for you). Still this quickly becomes a very tedius repetitve thing where all you're doing is clicking on "Yes, employee, please make this pizza for me...." "Yes, employee, please deliver this pizza for me..."\n\nI feel like this game wasn't sure what it was trying to be. This either needs to be a more functioning simulation that gives you feedback on how to improve your pizza making skills or it needs to be a more automated tycoon-style game that you don't have to remind your employees every single time to start the pizza, deliver the pizza, etc.\n\nI played this for about 2 hours. I finally ended up with several employees, and didn't think I was doing too terribly when one case of food poisoning put me out of business. Instant game over with no way to get back any of your progress. Sooooo frustrating. I definitely won't be playing this again.","February 14, 2015","false","1.1"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","26","35","0","2"

This one really falls short. I'm actually surprised to learn that this isn't an early access game.\n- UI needs a lot of polishing. There's literally a part of the interface where if you have nothing selected, a screen just reads "NO."\n- Parts of the game occasionally freeze/lock up. There's about a 50% chance that when I see one of the "clean up for the health inspector" minigames that it'll freeze in some way or not count down the game tmer.\n- The parts of the game that should be fun, like making orders, are more tedious than anything and it's very difficult to measure if you're improving on your pizza making skills at all or if it's just a total crapshoot on whether or not you get a perfect order. It just generally results in you having characters perform all tasks for you and you just click/drag icons to people's faces.\n- It just feels very clunky and unfinished. Hard to describe, but it has that very general "this game is not done" feeling.\n- Delivery part is the most fun, but the navigation is weird, the map doesn't show your destination, and as you buy car upgrades the cars seem to actually get worse in terms of handling and helping with perfect orders. Who would've thought that hitting the breaks on your car would flip it frontwards, implying that the pure stopping force of your breaks is stronger than the pull of the earth's gravity on your car/it's weight. aka upgrading your car turns it into tissue paper.\n- It's too easy. I found myself able to purchase every single upgrade every single day without having to choose any tradeoffs or have to play the game more to save up for things. But, with the way this game plays, that actually seems to be a benefit.\n\nI seriously love all food related games and really wanted to love this game, but it's just hard for me to play more than 15 minutes at a time without getting bored with the game mechanics & feeling like it's missing something.","December 23, 2015","false","15.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

I saw this is about building an empire, you get to expand your stores, there's mini quests involving mafia, there are competitors, and you make your own pizza.\n\nSadly after playing this for a bit I realized the two games are nothing alike, and comparing the two really makes this feel unfinished. Despite some patches that improved previous complaints, things still could be better.\n\nFor example, one of the quest is to make X amount of 'perfect order', which involves perfect cooking, and perfect delivery. But despite the in-game feedback telling you the food was cooked perfectly, you still do not get the credit. And to achieve 'perfect delivery', it requires you to complete the task within 1/2 of the allotted time, and isn't possible unless you are breaking traffic laws by driving 70+ mph, going through sidewalks, running red lights and driving in the incoming lane, which seems rather ridiculous and breaks the in-game SoD quite a bit.","March 19, 2015","false","10.7"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","23","37","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grinf4ce/recommended/318260/","grinf4ce","Grinf4ce.at","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grinf4ce/","54 products in account","This is my updated Review on Supreme, as there where several changes on the gameplay and I dont want to have an outdated review (You can read the original Review here: http://www.pastebin.ca/3027775.).\nThe updated review below is related to the Major Release on June 11th.\nI will only go on new changes/improvements which are related to the latest build. You can read the full review below.\n\nReview Result or TL;DRI can recommend this game. It makes quite fun for short-game sessions.\nThe developers did improve some weak points during last updates.\n\nStrong Points:\n+ Concept Idea is nice (You get order, you craft the food, you deliver them).\n+ Different Food with different Toppings.\n+ Random Events (Mafia, Flashmob, Poisoned Food) where you need to take a decision with good/bad impact on you.\n+ Feedback what you did good/bad during creation of food.\n+ Improved Driving-Expierience during Delivery-Mini-Game.\n\nWeak Points:\n- Currently none (as not parts of the game where re-played).\n\nSupreme - Updated Review (14th June)1.) Tutorial\nThe tutorial is still clear written and easy to understand.\nA strong improvement in new version is to give advises at the end of "Food-Creation"-Process, regarding the topic ammount and likes of the customers.\nThis makes it more easier to build a "perfect" pizza.\n\n2.) Technical: Graphics\nIn my last review I concerned, that there is no life in the delivery-city and no day/night-cycle.\nI was surprised during my last game session. The city looks very nice! The textures got updated, the city environment got improved. Day/Night-Cycle implemented.\n\n2.) Technical: Sound\nNo change since my last review.\n\n3.) Technical: Controls\nThe controls during the delivery got improved.\n\n4.) Lets Play: Working in Shop\nSince the last updates, this point got improved. The orders comes now via phone, computer or smart-tv. You will get feedback during the food-creation process what you did good and what not (in regards to the topics on pizza/sub/..). This makes it more easier to understand what means "little" and what means "a lot". Anyway, it needs some experience to do it perfect, but the game now supports you a little bit.\n\nYou have now a short period of time to do the job by yourself or assign it to one of your employees. The employees have an energy bar. You need to send them for a break, otherwise they will burn-out and quit ther job. In case of some employee quits / or get fired, you will automatically get another one. During my 1h session, I did not find any possibility to upgrade the single employees. Maybe it is implemented and I did not found the corresponding menu.\nAnyway, as this is unconfirmed and will not be have any impact on the review-result.\nCurrently, I cant give any feedback for the multi-store-feature (Tycoon Mode?) as I did not reach the possibility to do this.\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to buy new ingredients stock. Otherwise the customers will call you to get disappointed because their favorite food is out of stock.\n\n5.) Lets Play: Deliver the Food\nStrong improvements on this part of game.\nControlling the car is more precise and easier. The borders got removed, so you can drive across the walkway without your car get flipped (btw it is still possible to flip it - but another way). If your car flips, you can reset it and will get put onto your wheels again instead of the delivery failed.\nYou still not need to consider the road traffic act, but as the time seems to be shorter than previous, and the car dont flip on walkways, this makes more fun!\n\nAfter delivery, you will get a good overview of the delivery-stats and the store reputation will increase/decrease.\n\n6.) Lets Play: Upgrade your shop\nUnlocking ingrediences, sides and cars is remain unchanged.\nThe store-tier upgrade seems to be offered automatically during the game (after some days).\nThe update makes it possible to hire employees (during my game-session only cooks/drivers).\nIt is now possible to get multiple orders when the reputation is high enough (makes it more easy to put enough workload on your employees).\nMaybe I dont found appropiate menus, but it seems that the company upgrades such as advertisment got removed (unconfirmed).\n\n7.) Lets Play: Manage your shop\nI was not deep enough in the gameplay of new version to give a review about this.\nThere are still funny and new random events where you need to take decision.\n\nAnyway, when I checked the last updates, it makes quite fun to play the game. So I will change the recommendation from No to Yes for this current Build.\nAs soon as I continue playing my savegame and check the multiple-store-feature, I will update this review again.\nIf you have any questions, please come back to me.\n\nBest regards,\nGrinf4ce\n\n//Edit 1: Added TL:DR section.","January 11, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

I've wanted to buy it for quite some time since I've seen one of my favourite streamers playing it... But here's the thing: since the new update, it's no longer the same game. I know that the update was supposed to make it better, but it just made it awful for me. Now random events pop up no matter what you do (even when making pizza or driving) and you might click on answers without getting the chance to actually read the event. The driving is awful; the game is buggy (I've been asked multiple times to put "ranch sauce" on the pizza... while I don't have that sauce, and of course putting BBQ sauce or pizza sauce doesn't work). It's repetitious and boring, the gameplay is confusing (how do I get employees ? How do I interact with them? I have NO clue). The game seemed nice in its earlier version, now it was simly a pain to play. After 30 minutes I already wanted a refund, I forced myself to play 1 hour more to see if the beginning was just boring and then it would get better, but it doesn't seem so. I've now gotten a refund.\n\nTL; DR: Got a refund because the game is buggy, not what I was promised from previous videos because the last update changed it COMPLETELY for the worst, and ultra repetitious-boring.","June 14, 2015","false","6.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

You're the only employee in your pizza business, so it's your job to both make the pizza and deliver it.  You choose your toppings (very limited at first), manually place them on the pizza, then hop in the car and WASD deliver it to a green area in a city.  You have an ample time limit to deliver in.  It seems like the only danger is flipping your car if you brush up against a curb during a turn, which automatically forfeits your delivery.  Other cars driving on the roads will stop if you cut in front of them, so it seems like you would only hit them if you were trying, or were very reckless.\n\nAfter you've delivered a few pizzas, you get to buy some upgrades.  First toppings (olives, bell peppers, ham, etc), then sides (pasta, garlic bread), and eventually shop employees.  You can upgrade to hire chefs, drivers, and janitors.\n\nThis game's speed is absolutely exponential.  Where the pizza deliveries initially drag on, once you make your first hires, it starts to explode.  Suddenly the game is about pizza shop management instead of pizza order fulfillment.  You can then unlock additional shops and regions, and you can keep tabs on your competition's stores.  You can hire managers to watch over your employees' productivity and wellbeing, then hire regional managers to supervise those managers.\n\nIt was almost too hard to keep up after I made the poor choice of unlocking all the regions at once and opening a store in each - expansion strategy is definitely important in this game.\n\nYou'll have employees who quit because they're overworked, along with kitchen fires, political decisions, mafia proposals, etc. that show up in a small event feed in the upper right hand corner.\n\nI'm definitely not done playing this game, but I thought I'd jump in and provide a review while the sale is going on.\n\nAs for my opinion: yes, definitely buy this if you like sim games.  The devs are obviously still engaged in improving the game and you should be able to get several hours of play out of it.  However if you lack patience, this may not be the game for you.  There are quite a few pizzas and deliveries to make before the game scales up to the management aspect.\n\nTL;DR - 7.5/10 would recommend, but devs are involved so that number will go up as they respond to comments.  Gotta have patience as your store grows.  Don't run into the curb.  If your employee is slacking, fire them.","January 13, 2015","true","2.3"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

The descriptions of the pizzas I had to make were vague e.g a little cheese. How much cheese is this? What is considered "a little"? These are some questions I asked myself. The driving was wacky and that's why I enjoyed it\n\nIn conclusion this is a fun casual pizza shop/franchise running simulator, I just wish the pizza making was more informative in regards to how well I was doing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_b27K2Drso&list=UUV3Kx3vCAIKxx5H7Lh7SzQg","January 17, 2015","true","0.8"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jerfox/recommended/318260/","jerfox","Kyu Kilari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jerfox/","395 products in account","Updated as of the new update:\nI played about three hours of the newest update and i have to say it is a huge improvement on the old version of the game. I have to say that All of the things that were added and removed were really good changes for the games I will expand on all of this later on in the review. Although I recommended the game earlier this year but just not the price point i can say that just like last time the I would not have paid 15 dollars for this game. But on sale for 10$ or 7.50$ is well worth this type of game.\n\nPros:\n- Driving mini-game has been updated so that you can’t flip the car anymore as easily.\n- Creation mini-games stayed the same. (They are good as they are and did not need changed anyways)\n- There is no more clicking a button to clean your shop anymore! (Yay this made no since without an applicable mini-game for it or something else)\n- The new overview screen. While this is no longer a pizza I can see why this was changed to allow more than a couple of shops to own. I think I saw it’s possible to have up to over like 70-80 shops or so.\n- The UI Overhaul! This was a great change because of the old UI had just so much fluff that it made no since to see all of this information when there were not really anything good about this.\n-The new manager and employee system. You can have one manager and four employees now. This is also all on the same screen as your shop. It makes it easier for you to view everything you need without having to cover up and important parts of what’s going on.\n- The new drag and drop to employees (before managers) for them to get the order. This allows for more player interaction and i had fun sitting there and trying to micromanage some shops until they had managers this time around. I wanted to make sure that no phone call was going unanswered and made it interesting and fun for me to go through all of this.\n- Etc... I guess I will expand on more later if I remember any more pros about this game.\n\nCons\n-Like I said previously the price point of the game is still a huge concern. 15$ is still a big price for a game like this. But when a sale goes on for like 7.50$ or 10$ it will be well worth the pickup price for this game.\n- I don’t really know about any more cons for me personally but if any arise I will update this review as well.\n\nSo I will say that i give this game a solid 8.5/10 for me. If anyone likes a management sim type game this is the game for you. This allows for more of that than anything else. You can now drive during the day and night and that’s cool. But it’s a relaxing game and not to be taken seriously. So yes i would say to pick this up!\n\n\n\nPrevious Version Of Game:\nI’ve played the game for about two hours and was able to get through a majority of the early game. I plan on continuing to play later on but decided I had to write a review on this game soon. When the game launched there were a lot of negative reviews on it by those whom only played it for like ten to twenty minutes that said how bad the game was. I felt like they didn’t give it a fair shake so I decided to invest a couple more hours into the game. The price range of fifteen dollars is understandable and affordable for me but I would suggest if you’re interested in the game to give it a chance as well. The tycoon aspect of the game is definitely in here but not like other tycoon games. It’s not like you can customize your shops looks and such but you have to make sure each store stays profitable and you not go under. The events are definitely great throughout the game but I hope that there is more to come in this aspect as it seems to be a really strong part of the game. The mini games are something we get to see for a very small amount of time, i.e. for the first thirty minutes to an hour on a new game but I always went back to play the driving mini game because it is pretty funny physics. The whole flipping car and trying to drive off road is enjoyable. I wish there was a mode to just drive around the city and not deliver but that’s just me. The creation mini games are funny little things that I don’t think are supposed to be taken as serious as people wanted. There are sure cut ways to make the pizzas perfect and horrible and it’s a bit of a learning curve but I was able to get used to it quickly. The main part of the game is the management part which I saw some people call a management sim. It’s pretty much like. With the patch that hit earlier this week we were given the management of the food stock in your stores. Now onto what I think are the pros and cons of the game.\n\nPros:\n- Pizza Creation Mini-games\n- Other Food Creation Mini-games\n- Driving Mini-games (On Both Lists because it’s needed for the game but has one main issue)\n- Management part of the game\n- Random Events\n- Pace of the game\n- Upgrades\n\nCons:\n- It’s a management emphasis so it’s not for everyone.\n- Price is an issue for some people that I have noticed but wasn’t for me but it’s going on this side.\n- Driving physics (They are pretty hilarious during some times but it feels bad when you flip by barely hitting the curb right before getting the delivery zone)\n\n8/10 - Would actually recommend to anyone who likes pizza, tycoon games, management games, or just want to play a casual game that they can pick up. That’s what this game is under which is casual because of the fact that it is not to be taken so seriously. It’s a game to sit back and kill a couple of minutes up to hours on some times. I enjoyed all two hours that I have thrown into this game and I will be updating this review in a week or so to continue my feelings on the game if they have changed after I get more time into it. Take all of this with a grain of salt though and try it for yourself because the only way for you to know if you like the game is to watch actual gameplay of it or play it yourself.","January 17, 2015","true","9.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Luckily, you can hire a driver or two as you get further along into the game that will automate that process.  I find reputation hard to build, mainly because I’m having a lot of trouble figuring out how much of a particular ingredient to use.  When the customer complains that there aren’t enough toppings (or too much), it doesn’t tell me which ingredient I messed up on.  Either there needs to be more detailed feedback or the perfect order requirement needs to be a bit more lenient, in my opinion.

It's easy to hop in, play, save your game and continue right where you left off later. You start off as a small pizza shop owner having to do all the leg work yourself. You then progress to upgrading your shop to something better, hiring employees, managing their pay, vacation, skill, training, forming different kinds of advertising campaigns to get the best reputation results (when you get more popular, you then have to start being able to juggle 10+ orders per shop being placed at the same time).\n\nMix that in with the fun random events like the actress outside that you can help or leave to the mob, laundering money for the mafia and later starting a war between the gangs, influencing politics and backing a potential Senator (or later a President), and this game is a breath of fresh air and simply fun to play when you need a break from other standardized (copycat) games (*cough* survival games plaguing early access).\n\nI don't understand the people posting negative reviews about a $13 game they only played for 10-20 minutes. At the beginning it's more about making your customers happy, personally making and delivering the pizzas (and later the wings, breadsticks, subs, and other unlockable items) so you aren't going to be doing pure management up front. I don' t think this game is meant to copy other tycoon games but be a fun simulation of its own, starting from the bottom and working your way to the top.\n\nOne thing I do like is that the developers seem to be active and trying to make the game better.

If you're too lazy to read what this games all about then at the bottom there will be a TL;DR.\n\nTHE MAIN GOAL:\nThe main goal of "Supreme" is to run a successful pizza industry so successful that everybody sees your pizza and the most superior, or get shut down (or possibly DIE) trying.\n\nTHE BEGGINING:\nSupreme is a pizza buisness tycoon. It may be new and the graphics may not be all that great, but the game is very fun to play. In this little slice of heaven, you start by naming the CEO (you), the company's name, and the company motto. At the beggining, you will have a horrible pizza joint set up, you will be the only employee, and nobody knows who or what you are. You will have to deliver the pizzas yourself when you don't have any drivers, but delivering was personally quite fun for me. The driving physics can be a little wonky at times, but it could also be pretty humorous. Random events will happen including the Mafia which could make your progress either very difficult or very easy. What you decide to do for these events will either be good or bad. The neat thing about this game is that everytime you decide something, there is a random chance of it being good or bad. Certain events only occur at certain times with certain stats set, while others happen at random. Since no janitors are hired, you will have to clean the restraunt manually whcih cost $10 every time you clean it. Making pizzas can be very difficult for some, once you get used to it, making pizzas will be super easy.\n\nTHE MIDDLE:\nAfter awhile (2-3 hours on average), you will be getting to the point where you have bought employees and have bought some other restraunts along with some regions. Employees get unhappy if you don't send them on vacations to regain energy or give them a raise here and there. Sometimes employees will make customers mad because they cooked their food wrong or sometimes they will get lazy. If this happens, you can fire them, or make them more happy and productive and possibly send them for training. Employees are very usefull after a while, at the beggining they're useless since the orders can be done faster yourself. Your employees can go on strike, or you could fire them to make things strict around your company. Other restraunts can be bought after a little while into the game, and other employees can be hired there. The global map is represented with a pizza, pretty cheesy if you ask me. Other restraunts become vital to completing your main goal, but there's another vital part of becoming the main place to go for pizza around the globe, which is ofcourse, REGIONS! Regions are used to increase the area where you can build. The government will get angry at you if you try to build yourself a little monopoly so don't just buy out on the world that quick, or be at risk of being shut down. If you have noticed by now, you will be getting alot of more events depending on if your reputation is high or low. If it is high, kids might think twice about prank calling you and vandalizing your restraunt. If your reputation is low, you might get a phone call from your wife telling you that a bunch of kids left decapitated rabbit corpses on your lawn (yes, stuff like that happens). If you ever decide you jump into politics and help a guy become president, things can go two ways, he could be a good guy, or a bad guy. If you accidently (or purposly) got a bad president elected, people will hate you for supporting him.\n\nTHE END:\nAfter a while (a LONG while), you will make it to the top. Once up at that point in the game, you can continue to deliver pizzas... for ever... and ever... and ever... and ever... but hey, you can start over and experience a new journey, and do things you didn't in your last playthrough!\n\nTL;DR?:\n9.5/10\nA very good pizza buisness tycoon which has replayability, the only downside is the graphics which for me, doesn't matter.","January 15, 2015","true","5.5"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

It's under the "Casual" section for a reason... It's just a chill game about running a pizza shop! I would compare it to Lemonade Tycoon or Game Dev Tycoon, but even more in depth. Not only do you run pizza shops, you get to MAKE the product you're selling. I did a video though if you would like to see how these elements actually play out. :)\n\nhttp://youtu.be/NAvtxgakRLY\n\nThe scenery looks awesome, the gameplay mechanics are easy to learn and it's a lot of fun. I think this is one of those games that simply isn't meant to be taken too seriously. As I always say though, do some research before spending your money. :)","January 12, 2015","true","4.0"," 22 of 50 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","22","50","3","0"

I had hoped of starting my own pizza company, working my way up through the ranks of the local pizza shops.. Boy was I wrong..\n\nI've gone bankrupt, I've had to take out loans, I've wrecked my car 150 times and I've had to sell my kittens...\n\nIf you buy this game, expect to rage at some point.. but but but, the main thing to remember is: "Love the rage". The game is great from the start and you'll have loads of fun with it. I haven't gotten fully into everything yet but it is a good game and worth playing it through to see what happens.\n\n9/10 ~ Needs more Ducks.","January 10, 2015","true","3.3"," 16 of 39 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","16","39","0","0"

It is not nor was it meant to be the next Batman game or whatever. Graphically it's o.k. What it is though is a pretty fun little game that you can pick up and put down quickly; yet it leaves you thinking what you could do to improve business. It is similar to Cook, serve, delicious but much more detailed. If you like that game or want to pretend you own a restaurant then this is for you. My daughter and i can play this and i don't have to worry about zombies etc. and she can learn a little about business. Fun note. I was doing quite well in the game added: new items, cleaned the store, bought a new car for deliveries then i decided to clean the store one more time before taking more orders. I wasn't paying attention to my money and was 1 dollar short, i had already hired the cleaning crew, it told me i was out of money and needed to get a loan. In my real life evrything i have is paid for and i no longer do the owing money to the man thing, so i said no to the loan. Heck it was only a dollar. After i said no to the loan- boom game over out of money business closed-game over. I was cheesed at first and i'm sure some stupid little kid that doesn't know anything about life would be really mad but... that's business- out of money out of business. I decided it was a good touch to the game after all.","January 9, 2015","true","1.8"," 10 of 29 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","10","29","0","0"

This game really hits home with me. The music, the quality ingredients, every single detail is a mirror image of life in a pizzeria! I am telling you, the delivery missions are probably the most fun I've had playing a game.. ever. The customer interaction is accurate (You have no idea what you're doing and they're yelling at you because of it) Ultimately I would reccomend this game, but not the actual pizza man lifestyle!\n\nEdit: They changed the driving mechanics, the ai doesn't stop at red lights anymore, the update somehow made the map look worse than it did originally and it just all around doesn't feel like the same game it used to.

The delivery time counts down so fast I never get the pizza there. There's no tutorial that I can find. At first its just the phone that you can click on and alerts and everything is so fast. Apparently I can make a good pizza but I don't 'drive' well enough to get it there so I don't earn anything, this is not fun.  A tutorial for new players would be nice with extra time to learn how to drive with a keyboard would make sense.   I'd like the option of slowing things down in the options menu, but there's nothing. I can't see myself playing this again anytime soon.\n","April 11","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
