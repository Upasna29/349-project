This is a new twist of the Aveyond games with a new Darkthrope.  Even if he is "evil" and cursed to marry a witch - he is a very likable character.  You have a great quest to complete and a new group of heros - along with a few favorites from previous games.  Of course you can have a marriage at the end . . . . if you get enough attaction points.

Despite the lack of an item/setting to speed up movement (thus making travel rather slow), the humor and plot (failed villain turned reluctant hero) more than make up for spending a little too much time trying to get to people and places. There has been some commentary on Ingrid "forcing" her love interests into a relationship, but having actually played through each of the romances, the men never felt forced to me.\n\nOverall, Boyle is the perfect mix of "Oh [insert divinity], we have to save the world!" heroism and "Why can't I just torture innocent villagers in a dungeon?" villainy, and AV4 is bold, beautiful, and brilliant.\n\n4.3/5\n\nAdditional note, I bought this game when it first came out and received a free Steam Key for writing a review.","February 2","true","22.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cjjasp/recommended/433920/","cjjasp","cjjasp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cjjasp/","8 products in account","I am a full-on Aveyond Kingdom fan. Amaranth/Aveyond Kingdom and John Wizard are my 2 favorite game makers, and they frequently collaborate with each other. Their games are reminiscent of the old Square Soft games, for the Super Nintendo with strong stories and fun sidequests. They are as much fun as The Legend of Zelda or any early Final Fantasy game ever was.\n\nAveyond Kingdom’s Aveyond 4, Shadow of the Mist is in many ways, a more polished production than their earlier work.  The graphics and backgrounds are the best they have produced by far. The storyline is both deep and hilarious, and the characters are, for the most part, engaging.\n\nThis game incorporates the traditional elements of puzzle-solving, action, and adventure into a neat and enjoyable package. There are the usual elements of high fantasy, with the characters ruthlessly poking fun at themselves. The enemies are creative and fun to fight.\n\nBecause they are failed villains, Boyle and Ingrid are unhappily in love, and that storyline adds ongoing humorous elements. Myst and Robin are naive and make good foils for Boyle and Ingrid. Hi’beru and Rowen arrive later in the game, and Phye arrives so late I did wonder why he was included at all. As a Draghar, Phye does have some power, but I think like a writer, so in my opinion, all the characters should be in place at the midpoint. Because he arrives so close to the end, we don’t get to know him as well as I would have liked.\n\nI purchased the game the day it was released. I have played the game through to the end four times. The first time through, I had Ingrid join Lorelei’s coven and married her off to Boyle. With that scenario the game played smoothly with no glitches. I was in love with the game!\n\nThe second time through I had Ingrid join Jinx’s coven, but when I tried to complete the task of selling the craft in Robin’s store, the game froze and I had to take drastic measures to close the game down. No matter what I did, in this scenario the game froze at that point every time.\n\nSo I went to their website and, following the suggestions in their forums, I reinstalled the game. I never got past that point on that particular attempt.\n\nSo I started a new game, and that time I had her join the transformations coven. This went well for the most part, but with one major flaw. Ingrid gained the ability to transform into a dragon, but the skill didn’t appear in her menu. When I went out to the forums to see how to solve that, the answer was that it would be resolved in the next build. I was disappointed, as I did want to have the ability to play her as a dragon.\n\nHowever, that time I married Ingrid off to Hi’beru, which was cute.\n\nThe environments that the game is set in are lush and beautiful, dark and moody. The music is amazing and really contributes to the enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe game is fun, hilarious, and when it works properly, it’s a great way to spend 25 or so hours.\n","February 16","true","58.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I think the reason I am able to call myself a gamer today is all thanks to Aveyond 1.\n\nSo now, Aveyond 4 was released a month or so back, and I think it may just be, my favorite Aveyond so far, the characters are interesting and genuine right from the beginning. The combat was very involved and fun. The music in this game is just as good, if not better, than the pervious games, a majority of the songs, have personality, which I find makes the game, in general, better.\n\nIf your thinking about getting this game, I suggest you do it, it's worth the price.\n\nAlso, military squrriels.(they're the best)","February 2","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is my first ever review, too! Mostly because I'm super lazy. Now here you go: 10/10\n\nThis is a great game. I've been a follower of the Aveyond series since it first came out years ago, and (unlike many series), the quality has only gone up with each game.\n\nStory and writing: The story is amazing. Aveyond is what got me into RPGs in the first place, and I've yet to come across another that has such well-written characters and a cohesive plot. It's made me laugh from the get-go and has a bit of a different spin from the other games; this time, you're playing from the perspective of a retired villian who's sort of forced into the role of hero. It's original and well-done, without gramatical or spelling errors.\n\nMusic: The soundtrack is, as always, incredible. Aaron Walz has really outdone himself with this one.\n\nGameplay and controls: There are both keyboard and mouse functions, for whichever you prefer, and everything is really easy to figure out without being annoying. It's pretty stnadard, but in a good way.\n\nArt: Aveyond has given me extemely high standards for art, and is the sole reason why I'm hesitant to play many other RPGs that aren't quite up to par. SotM very much keeps with this standard. The art is beautiful and expressive, and unlike many other games that have decent art to provide nothing more than a visual, the art in this game really adds something. The expressions are hilarious and personal, and you can really tell that a lot of effort was put in.\n\nCombat: Simple without being boring. It's turn-based and the abilities of each character are truly well thought-out.\n\nMy impression as a whole: Play the damn game. It's very much worth the price (and to be honest, one of the only games that I'm willing to spend more than $10 on), and the more people who play, the easier it is for the series to continue on and flourish. If you're new to the series, absolutely give it a shot. Hell, give all of them a shot. They're all great. If you're a veteran, well, you probably already own it. 10/10","February 2","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The option to choose the degree of difficulty and the added hidden goodies all add up to make a great game.

Just plain fun.\n\nFrom the makers of the Aveyond series (all wonderfully made), this is a departure from the original storyline. It is a complete, stand alone game, although there are some subtle references to the previous games, they are there to give you a chuckle, but in no way impact the story.\n\nYou play Boyle, a villain, who becomes, through many misadventures, an unwilling hero. The characters are all unique, with unique skills/attributes/mannerisms. While the main story is very linear, there are TONS of side quests to pursue. Some are mentioned in your log book. Some you will stumble upon, and need to remember.\n\nThe battle system is great, turn based, and each character has very different skills to work with. The artwork is a pleasure to look at. But I think where this game shines is just the sheer "funness". The writing was just hilarious in so many parts. It's like being part of a group of people that are thrown together, and are always fussing/quipping, jabbering, etc. I loved that!\n\nI did get a Steam key, since I purchased the game originally on the Aveyond website. It took me almost 32 hrs to complete the first time around. If I had one complaint, it's that early on there is a LOT of walking around, back and forth, but once you get to the mist system, it's much quicker/easier.\n\nJust tons of fun, and great replay value too, since you can chose to do a few things differently with your characters (as some can get married, but you have to figure out how, and to whom).","February 2","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When I first began playing Ahriman's Prophecy, my daughter was just beginning high school.  I was excited, as our new computer had a brand new operating system called Windows XP.\n\nFastforward to last summer.  My granddaughter came to stay with my husband and I for the summer.  She played through Aveyond, Aveyond 2 and the various chapters of Aveyond 3.  She quickly fell in love with the games, as had her mother and I years before.  When I told her that the release of Aveyond 4 was on the horizon, she became at least as excited as many fans of the Fallout series, awaiting Fallout 4.\n\nAveyond is a familiar place, and has seen at least as many changes as the lives of the wonderful people who make up the fanbase. If you're looking for an intense, fast paced game with gore and violence aplenty, move along.  If you'd like to recover some of the innocent wonder and happiness the world so callously tries to strip away, welcome to The Kingdom. Relax, sit back and just...play.\n\nIf you've ever had a beloved pet go missing, you'll know very well the depths of despair and challenges of finding them  and bringing them safely home again. In Aveyond 4 you'll revisit this issue, but with a wonderful twist.  There are riddles to be solved, mountains to climb, tournaments to win, and a narcissistic king who simply will not take no for an answer.   Aveyond 4 is packed with various  quests.  There are old friends, new heroes, dragons, elves and wicked witches. Have you ever pondered the meaning of a particularly disturbing nightmare?  Someone in this game might have the answer. Love, betrayal and wonder await you.\n\nIf you've ever enjoyed wandering around town and country with a good friend while the rest of the world is quietly slumbering, aiding a hilarious faction that desires to rule the world (a top secret faction that might actually do a better job than the figurehead in place), give this game a try!\n\nThis game is not a race, it's a meandering walk throught he woods, exploring every leaf, feeling the wind in your hair and the warmth of the summer sun on your face.  Slow down, lock your inner critic in the dungeon buy this game and just enjoy.\n\nI purchased this game from the Aveyond website a few months back.  When I heard that Aveyond 4 was coming out on Steam, I wrote to ask of I could review the game here.  The deleloper was kind enough to send me a key code for downloading the game here on Steam.  I delighted for the opportunity to review it.  Give Aveyond 4 a try.\n\n\n","February 2","true","29.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There are a couple of long-lived recurring non-playable minor characters from earlier series, but they do not play major roles in this game.  This is also a complete game, unlike the 4-part Aveyond 3.\n\nYou can play this with either a keyboard or a mouse.  I generally prefer the keyboard unless I am trying to navigate tricky terrain or avoid a bad guy without a fight.\n\nThis is a long, detailed, well-imagined fantasy game.  There are battles, and you can have up to four fighters (plus one minion) from amongst your seven party members (you won't have seven party members the whole game, for most of it you will have fewer than seven).  Each character has different battle skills and strengths, and you may not want the same fighters in every situation.  You will have a chance to experience the battle interface during the demo.\n\nThe party does not always remain the same, either.  Although Boyle is the main character, occasionally other playable characters will have quests without him.   All the characters have unique backgrounds, and many are very different characters than we have seen in previous games.\n\nThere is a lot of fun, snarky humor in this game, especially with two of the MCs (Boyle and Ingrid) being an ex-villain and a witch.  Possibly reformed characters make great reluctant heroes.   Boyle's primary loyalty is to his dog/wolf Fang.  It takes him a while to get used to being part of a group.\n\nI don't want to give away much of the plot, but there many different locations in this expansive world, allowing for many different creatures and scenery.  (Mountains, forest, farmland, desert, seaside mining town, swamp, dreamscape, etc).  There are a bunch of main quests, and a fair number of optional side-quests with useful rewards.\n\nThere are several options for replayability, too, especially involving Ingrid, who can marry one of several men, depending on who she fancies and how much work she puts into it, and also join one of three witches covens, each with its own unique spells.  Eventually I want to try al the options.\n\nSo, try the demo and see if this is the sort of game you like.  (Note: the first half-hour is more scripted than the rest of the game, so do not be misled or turned off by the initial nudging).\n\nAlso, my tip to you - save early and often, especially before battle.  And talk to everyone you encounter.\n\nI had (and am having) lots of fun with this game and I hope you do too.  In some respects it is like immersing yourself in an interactive book/movie and experiencing a deep and nuanced world.  You might have to put more effort into it that the normal shooter or point-and-click games, but you will be rewarded for your efforts with a unique experience most games do not give you.  Most games are forgettable and interchangeable, but I always remember the Aveyond games and characters long after I am done playing.  Aveyond 4 makes me smile and forget about the real world for a while.\n\nDisclaimer: I bought the PC version of this game when it was first released in December, and received a free Steam key from the developer.\n","February 1","true","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The characters are well developed and the humor is great.\n\nBattles are challenging without being a chore, but certain enemies are tough even on the easy setting.  I found very little grinding to be necessary on the normal setting - usually just needing to switch my party around to suit certain enemies.  Every character is useful at some point.\n\nThere are plenty of sidequests with great rewards and some puzzles that are fun to work through.  I have played completely through the game three times to try all possible covens and get all the different marriages at the end.\n\nThe main con with the game is that there is a lag in certain areas.  Shutting down background programs helps a little, but doesn't really fix it.  Another minor issue is that you have to buy items one at a time which is a bit of a pain when trying to stock up before a boss battle.\n\nWhile the game does have references to the previous games in the series, it is not necessary to play them first and this game can stand very well on its own.","February 1","true","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

By far, Aveyond 4 has been my favourite contribution. Although it says Aveyond '4', don't let that fool you! This game is very much a standalone game. It's set in the same universe as the previous Aveyond games, but other than a few teeny tiny references that don't matter much to actual gamepla\ny, you don't need to play previous games! Still, I think this game would be an amazing beginning to an Aveyond journey, and I sincerely hope anyone who purchases this game goes back and plays the past games. <3\n\nThis game is in a style I adore, and the plot is fantastically witty, along with dialogue that can compare to some of the most popular games on the market.

The dialog is funny, clever, cute and well-written.  All the grammar and spelling is correct (one of my pet peeves is games with incorrect grammar and spelling, the Aveyond ones are safe from that).\nThis is an RPG Maker game with very cute sprites.  The sprites are very nice, and you can actually tell which sprite is which character.  The art (the non-RPG maker generated art) is lovely; the character art in particular was great, with very expressive faces (that actually looked like realistic emotions instead of something out of a Looney Toon).\n\nI recommend this to anyone with a good sense of humor, and anyone who likes RPGs.  If you liked the other Aveyond games, you'll almost certainly enjoy this.

I highly recommend you all try this but here are my thoughts on the game.\nPros:\n-Beautiful artwork, You will be able to tell a how much work was put into every area.\n-Humor: Its not often when you find a good game full of humor and I actaully laughed out loud twice\n-Story: Very good story, not the best in the world but definitly a reason to buy the game\n-Great community: The devs are involved and always ready to help and so are the people i have met who play the game\n-Good playtime and replay value: You will get plenty of playtime I believe i have a little more than 30 hours on just one playthrough (I am a bit slow) and I intend to do another playthrough\n-Combat: While the combat system isn't the most uniqe I just LOVE how all the different characters have there own uniqe abilities and systems for those abilities. Its not just the boring use mana to cast a spell, or have a basic attack\n-Puzzles: There were some puzzles that I really enjoyed to solve, my favorite part of the game was the probably the dungeon which is a very confusing hour puzzle, that I loved to solve.\nThere are more benefits that I loved but those are probably the main ones\nCons:\n-Navigating the map: It takes a while getting used to navigating the world map and it can be a fair amount of walking getting to where you want to go sometimes\n-Vauge quest descriptions sometimes: Sometimes a quest can be kind of vauge and its hard to figure out where your supposed to go or do.\n\nAll in all I definitely reccomend this game.","February 3","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Music (for me) is the most important thing in a video game lacking voice over. aveyond 4 blew my mind with its music.

And I loved how every party member had their own little endings and the consequences of the sidequest we played too!\n\nMy favorites were Myst and Hi'beru. Really loved it when Myst angered Boyle.

Remember that moment when he was like "Fang is my true love"? this is a type of unconditional love. Because as far as I know, love extends beyond romance type.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/velveteeth/recommended/433920/","velveteeth","glitter slug trail","http://steamcommunity.com/id/velveteeth/","9 products in account","I have been a long-time fan of all the Aveyond games--they've followed me through childhood--and playing Aveyond 4 as an adult has been a great way to come back to the series. Each of the games is their own experience, and while in certain narrative ways Aveyond 4 feels like a regression, as far as gameplay goes, the series has grown in some fantastic ways. Though I feel as though the protagonist was the wrong choice for this game, the game maps are extensive and rewarding, and the arc of the game is smooth and fulfilling. The way the game plays is excellent, and the narrative aspect mostly provides context for how to view it, so although I was largely disappointed in the story of the game, I loved Aveyond 4 as a whole.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience and would wholly recommend it. That said, this review is largely narrative critique.\n\nTHE NARRATIVE:\n\nNarratively, Boyle felt like the wrong choice for the protagonist. He is not engaging as a main character--the humor regarding 'retired villains' and 'heroes' fell flat, and it felt reductive. The best part about him was his relationship with his dog, but that dedication is not enough to make a protagonist. An attempt at humor regarding evildoing in a comical tone is not enough to make a protagonist, either. While the backstory about how he found his dog as a pup was touching, it does not offer strong enough motive for him to be the main character of this story. He is mostly a static character. While he does admit that doing good is pretty good, it is dulled by the joke of it all, and the retired supervillain aspect diminishes the entire relationship of good and evil. Basically, it seems as though he was truly good all along, and the only amount of growth is in his awareness of this, and it is not enough to drive an entire game. His personal stake in this journey is not, narratively, the strongest one.\n\nBoyle is looking for his dog; Myst is looking for her brother. In order to find his dog, Boyle must find Myst's brother, who was snatched by a demon. Even the game's title, "Shadow Of The Mist", suggests that Myst is the one with more to lose, here. Boyle plays the reluctant hero, but it is irritating to have what feels so much like Myst's story filtered through this flat, reductive joke of a retired supervillain. Myst has never been away from the mountain, and while she also needs to find her little brother, she longs to see the sights outside of The Mist. She has so much to learn, so far to go. She has the most reason to go on this journey to defeat the demon and save her brother, and she has the farthest to grow. She is the most dynamic character, at a tipping point of her life.\n\nIf Myst were the main character, the framing of this game would've been much more powerful--and it would've offered a kind of serious beauty to it, too. In that way, it would mirror Aveyond 2, which was personally an extremely successful, gorgeous game with a very gentle, fairy-tale like story. This still would've been light-hearted in (many ways, and a grand heartfelt adventure, but it would've also had the background context of a fairy-tale. This game could've so easily been absolutely incredible, beautiful, had Myst been the protagonist. She has every reason to be. Also, her background as a Myst Wraith is so much more compelling than the dull, simplifying joke of the Retired Supervillain.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY:\n\nThe maps are beautiful. They are detailed, extensive, and so very rewarding. The chests are set up so that they can be seen when strolling on the most obvious paths, and while it does take some challenge to look for them, it is not to the point of frustration. Taking the effort to go the long way around for a chest that was seen ten minutes earlier is always worth the effort. The color schemes of the maps are brilliant, well-thought, and the layouts of all the buildings are varied, textured, not tired and reused. Each part of the journey has its own distinctive map which feels like its own little area within a larger world, which helps create a better idea of this lush, full world of Aveyond. The only complaint here is that some of the maps are so ambitious that they lag on soe systems. I also loved how purposeful all the sidequests were; everything was important.\n\nThe battle system is set up in a spin of the traditional turn-based system. It makes battles so much less tedious. Each character has a different role in battle, with their own pros and cons, and it is very fun to think about how best to use each character. Myst has a few different abilities, including a healing and shapeshifting one, and using these abilities does not require a cost of mana or skill point, although it does mean that these abilities aren't as powerful as ones that would have a cost. Boyle's darkness points are replenished with physical attacks, and he uses these same points to cast magic, and it is very fun to have a wizard type who is also a formidable physical attacker--in addition to his minion, whose attacks add additional damage at every turn. Those are only two of the characters, but all of them have roles that aren't so simple as deducting a mana / skill point cost. The character battle roles are fun, and the battles demand a measure of attention that makes it so they aren't a matter of grinding through the same predictable battle rhythm again and again. It's more fluid than that.\n\nThe only thing I would say is that there are many characters who get introduced too late in the game to really develop an affection for them, or a feel for their role in battle, so they don't get the opportunity to shine. It's more difficult to care about them, when there is so little time to get familiar with them.\n\nLASTLY:\n\nIn a lot of ways, I do not think Aveyond is the right arena to even attempt deconstructing Heroes or Villains--that seems more the space of cape comics and games inspired by those. It felt odd and uncomfortable to reference that type of Hero vs. Villain relationship in a largely original, fantastical world such as Aveyond. Also uncomfortable in the game was the way sprites from popular anime series appeared in prominent side quest characters, as if, no one would notice Hetalia sprites or Chi from Chobits acting in ways that seemed to serve no purpose, no reference, to their original series at all. It was not right to include representations of those licensed designs in this original game being sold for its own profit. Original sprites should have been made by the Aveyond team. Both of these aspects broke immersion of Aveyond as the world of Aveyond, an original fantasy world with, largely, its own mythos which does at times reference outside ones, like Aveyond 2 and the Snow Queen, and moments like referencing the Fruit of the (Greek) Gods (a pomegranate) in Aveyond 1.\n\nIn terms of media representation, the Aveyond series made such an impact on me as a kid realizing that girls and women were powerful, complex characters, and to see them in positions of power, as heroes unqualified by the acts of men, it was incredible. And honestly, if I wanted to play a game about a man, I'd look literally anywhere else. That was one of the first reasons why Boyle failed as a protagonist for me. He has nothing to add to the conversation. He is not refreshing in any way. There are countless characters like him, and there are so few respectful representations of women in games, especially Fantasy ones known for their trope of women as reward for the (male) hero's triumphs, damsels in distress, or as vile and petty temptations of evil.\n\nAll this said: I loved this game. It may be because I played it most recently, but it was my favorite game to play. But, narratively, it doesn't compare with Aveyond 1 or Aveyond 2 and the way those games stayed in my heart. I still had a blast, though, and am looking forward to replaying it\n\n*Disclaimer: I received a free Steam key for this review, and I originally got the game elsewhere.","February 4","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is the 4th in a series set in the same universe. All games are independent from each other and can be played independently.\nAveyond 4: Shadow Of The Mist is a classic RPG game that follows a story line, but allows to create your own fighting team from a group of characters that can join you. It involves monster fighting and puzzle solving.\nThe graphics are old school.\nThe story line traditional, but the dialogue funny and tongue in cheek.\nThe game has 3 difficulty setting.

It allows for players who have anywhere from no time on their hands to three months. You can have fun playing this game no matter how much or how little you can devote to it. The storyline is entertaining, the characters are great fun, the minions are delightful, the side quests are enchanting, and the mini-games are cute. The characters themselves are actually diverse enough in their abilities to make your party selection an actual act of strategy whereas it used to be mostly a question of which magic weilder/fighter balance do you prefer; now you have to decide whether you want healing, fire, magic, multi-attacks, dream magic, or assorted team-attacks.

It's more fluid than that.\n\nThe only thing I would say is that there are many characters who get introduced too late in the game to really develop an affection for them, or a feel for their role in battle, so they don't get the opportunity to shine. It's more difficult to care about them, when there is so little time to get familiar with them.\n\nLASTLY:\n\nIn a lot of ways, I do not think Aveyond is the right arena to even attempt deconstructing Heroes or Villains--that seems more the space of cape comics and games inspired by those. It felt odd and uncomfortable to reference that type of Hero vs. Villain relationship in a largely original, fantastical world such as Aveyond. Also uncomfortable in the game was the way sprites from popular anime series appeared in prominent side quest characters, as if, no one would notice Hetalia sprites or Chi from Chobits acting in ways that seemed to serve no purpose, no reference, to their original series at all. It was not right to include representations of those licensed designs in this original game being sold for its own profit. Original sprites should have been made by the Aveyond team. Both of these aspects broke immersion of Aveyond as the world of Aveyond, an original fantasy world with, largely, its own mythos which does at times reference outside ones, like Aveyond 2 and the Snow Queen, and moments like referencing the Fruit of the (Greek) Gods (a pomegranate) in Aveyond 1.\n\nIn terms of media representation, the Aveyond series made such an impact on me as a kid realizing that girls and women were powerful, complex characters, and to see them in positions of power, as heroes unqualified by the acts of men, it was incredible. And honestly, if I wanted to play a game about a man, I'd look literally anywhere else. That was one of the first reasons why Boyle failed as a protagonist for me. He has nothing to add to the conversation. He is not refreshing in any way. There are countless characters like him, and there are so few respectful representations of women in games, especially Fantasy ones known for their trope of women as reward for the (male) hero's triumphs, damsels in distress, or as vile and petty temptations of evil.\n\nAll this said: I loved this game. It may be because I played it most recently, but it was my favorite game to play. But, narratively, it doesn't compare with Aveyond 1 or Aveyond 2 and the way those games stayed in my heart. I still had a blast, though, and am looking forward to replaying it\n\n*Disclaimer: I received a free Steam key for this review, and I originally got the game elsewhere.","February 4","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been following Amaranth Games since Aveyond 1 and I'm a huge fan of Aveyond series and JRPG in general.\n\nI highly recommend this game, because first of all it is really enjoyable and fun to play, you don't get bored while playing and that is very important for me as a player. It contains so many funny situations and exellent humour, characters that are not your everyday cliché heroes, beatiful maps and places to visit, and don't get me start about those amazing puzzles and dungeons. I mean you really need to try the Halaina Dungeon, it's one of my fav things in the game. You also can do many other things like: joining a coven, marry your characters, join the night watch...yes there is a night watch and quests that you need to complete at night, collect some cute things, pumpkin smashing etc. You can choose between 3 covens and 3 characters, and 3 difficulty modes to play, so the game has a replay value as well. So give this game a chance, trust me, you won't regret it :)\n\nKudos to Amaranth Games team for making another beautiful and highly enjoyable game :)\n\n\nMoony\n\n\n\n","February 7","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So what's a villain to do?  Retire.  That is until your dog goes missing after a mysterious fog settles over town.  And now you must go back out into the world to rescue him.\n\nAnd so the game begins.  Full of wit, well designed gameplay and surprising endearing ex-villains, Aveyond 4 has lived up to all my expectations.  I especially love that this is a full length game, not somethng that is over in the first few hours.  After 17+ hours of game time I'm still discovering new areas of the map, unlocking new side quests, and making progress on the main storyline.  There's still plenty of game ahead and I'm excited to see where it goes.\n\nI originally purchased this game on the Aveyond website when it was first released.  I have been a fan of Amaranth Games since Aveyond 1 and I'm thrilled to see this latest installment with its twist on the classic hero's journey.  I received a free key to download the game here on Steam so that I could share my impressions of the game with the Steam community.  I fully recommend Aveyond 4 to anyone who likes good humor and great RPGs.","February 2","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Soon, I got a free key for Steam from the developer and am excited to see this title finally out on Steam!  I completed the game in a blind playthrough in about 26 1/2 hours between Steam and the non-steam installer.\n\nThis game has all of the humor of the other games in the series, but has the unique twist of featuring a villain as the protagonist!  Some of the ongoing storylines from previous games find their way into this one as various cameos, which will appeal to fans of the series.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's a fairly easy to pick up RPG.  Instead of the archetypical classes you find in other fantasy based games, each character has their own set of skills and abilities, and each character obtains their abilities in different ways.\n\nThe story is engaging, and even the side quests are interesting and entertaining.  My only complaint is that the difficulty of the monsters in the last zone of the game is FAR above the difficulty found in the rest of the game... for instance, the monsters in the previous zone would hit my characters for 1, but in the final zone could kill with bad RNG.\n\nAside from that nitpick, the game feels polished and plays well on an XBox One controller, despite having to use an analog stick instead of a D-pad.  My only suggestions for improvement are the lack of a scaling full screen mode, and the ability to remap controls.\n\nIf you like engaging, story-driven RPGs, Aveyond 4 - or any Aveyond game, really - is for you.","February 9","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I downloaded the demo anyway and even before I reached the end I was hooked.\n\nI finished the game once now and it took me 28 hours, I've done all main quests and side quests and used the developer's forum a few times for help, otherwise it might have taken me even longer. There are many quests, side quests, goodie caves (and I haven't even discovered all of them) and entertaining dialogues. The fights were just perfect for me on the "normal" game setting, not too easy, not too hard. I also love the certain decissions in the game lead to other endings. I must also mention that the music adds to the fantasy themes, every town has suiting music, which somehow gives you an even better "feeling" of what the town would be like.\n\nIf you're a fan of RPG style games or just like pretty pixels and love a story and lots of quests, I'm quite sure this is a game for you too. I received a free Steam key for my review, but already bought (and finished) this game a month ago from the developer's platform.","February 3","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely not his style but totally mine.  I have been a huge fan of the Aveyond series for years.  I actually purchased this directly from the game maker and then got a free steam key from them for writing a review.  To date I have over 20 hours of game play and it's so much fun.  The characters are interesting and funny.  Puzzles are challenging.  This is a great game in the Aveyond series with updates in its gaming system.  Anyone who likes RPG that has a sarcastic fun sense of humor is going to love this game and the whole series.  Super pleased that it's not by chapters like the last game.

I highly recommend you all try this but here are my thoughts on the game.\nPros:\n-Beautiful artwork, You will be able to tell a how much work was put into every area.\n-Humor: Its not often when you find a good game full of humor and I actaully laughed out loud twice\n-Story: Very good story, not the best in the world but definitly a reason to buy the game\n-Great community: The devs are involved and always ready to help and so are the people i have met who play the game\n-Good playtime and replay value: You will get plenty of playtime I believe i have a little more than 30 hours on just one playthrough (I am a bit slow) and I intend to do another playthrough\n-Combat: While the combat system isn't the most uniqe I just LOVE how all the different characters have there own uniqe abilities and systems for those abilities. Its not just the boring use mana to cast a spell, or have a basic attack\n-Puzzles: There were some puzzles that I really enjoyed to solve, my favorite part of the game was the probably the dungeon which is a very confusing hour puzzle, that I loved to solve.\nThere are more benefits that I loved but those are probably the main ones\nCons:\n-Navigating the map: It takes a while getting used to navigating the world map and it can be a fair amount of walking getting to where you want to go sometimes\n-Vauge quest descriptions sometimes: Sometimes a quest can be kind of vauge and its hard to figure out where your supposed to go or do.\n\nAll in all I definitely reccomend this game.","February 3","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved this game!  I'm a big fan of the whole Aveyond series.  This one ties in nicely to the other games, but you can definitely play it without having played the others - there's just little bonus jokes and such that you only get if you've played all the games.  The dialog is funny, clever, cute and well-written.  All the grammar and spelling is correct (one of my pet peeves is games with incorrect grammar and spelling, the Aveyond ones are safe from that).\nThis is an RPG Maker game with very cute sprites.  The sprites are very nice, and you can actually tell which sprite is which character.  The art (the non-RPG maker generated art) is lovely; the character art in particular was great, with very expressive faces (that actually looked like realistic emotions instead of something out of a Looney Toon).\n\nI recommend this to anyone with a good sense of humor, and anyone who likes RPGs.  If you liked the other Aveyond games, you'll almost certainly enjoy this.  If you liked Cthulhu Saves the World, you'll like this (IMO this is better than Cthulhu - the art is nicer and you can actually follow the maps).  Try the demo, it's a good representation of the game play.","February 13","true","52.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
