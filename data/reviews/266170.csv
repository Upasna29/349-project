I knew going in that the game had a lot of negative reviews, but it was impossible not to at least give it a try and I'll admit, I really, really wanted this game to be good. I mean, it just sounds like it should be awesome. It's basically like Terraria, a game I currently have nearly 2,000 hours of playtime in, with the ship-building mechanic from Space Engineers, and set in a richly detailed steampunk world of floating islands and flying sky whales. There's no way this isn't the greatest game ever made. Right?\n\nSadly, it's not the greatest game ever made. In fact, it's not a great game at all, or even a good game, or even a mediocre game. Windforge is a game which is fundamentally, fatally flawed. By way of explaining how, and because lists are easy to write, allow me to present to you The Top 3 Things Wrong With Windforge!\n\n3. The Graphics\nHere's the thing about the graphics: some of them actually look amazing. The flying whales and the krakens that live in the lower regions of the world, and the larger objects like the giant balloons and clocktowers, are all lovingly rendered. The watercolor background is pretty nice too. It's obvious that the developers really worked hard on the graphics. So what is up here?\n\nIt looks blocky and awful, like my house is built from stacked up lincoln logs. This is because there's no blending or tiling with the graphics, which is weird because even Starbound and Terraria have that. Also, there's an awful lot of these blocks. In Terraria your character is three blocks tall, and in Starbound it's four. Here? Freaking eight! These blocks are tiny is what I'm getting at, which makes construction and destruction a massive chore.\n\nWhat else makes construction a chore? The painfully bad attempt at 2.5D graphics. Everything is in this weird 3/4ths view which I'm sure the developers thought was just so cool, but really it just gets in the way. It's hard to know what block you're digging at with your jackhammer when you're mining, and it's hard to see what you're doing when you're building on a ship or a home base.\n\nAlso, what's with my furniture? It looks like it's just painted onto the wall instead of actually sitting on the floor.\n\n2. What Do These Numbers Mean?\nI'll admit, math was never my big thing. I mean, I'm not completely stupid with numbers, but it never came as easy to me as other things. That said, what the hell do these numbers mean?\n\nMy ship's mass is only 524, and I have 1,389 vertical thrust, so shouldn't I be able to move up and down fairly well? No, I can't. For that matter, why is my vertical thrust only 1,389? My three propellers provide a total thrust of 13,500 (4,500 x 3), so how is that counteracted so greatly by a mass of only 524? And shouldn't my bouyancy of 30,000 totally cancel out the mass issue anyway? Honestly, it wouldn't be that big of a deal if I just knew what these numbers meant. Is my mass 524 kilograms? 524 tons? Who knows? The fact that there are no units given for these numbers just makes them all feel arbitrary.\n\nAnd no, I'm not so stupid that I can't figure out adding a few extra propellers will let me move again, but I shouldn't have to guess at it. And if you DO want me to have to guess at it, then why bother giving me the numbers at all? It's not like they matter.\n\nThis issue doesn't only affect airships either. It's also a problem with armor, weapons, pretty much everything. Earlier in the game my character picked up a set of bronze full plate armor. I was excited because it gave her 30 more defense than my old set of leather-bronze bandit armor, so I put it on and went out to fight some people, and noticed that the bandits who were previously dealing 46 points of damage a shot with their pistols were now doing... 46 points of damage a shot. Seriously, what the Hell do these numbers mean?!\n\n1. Movement\nSo, if I was designing a game about floating islands and airships, and I had to name what I thought would be the single most important aspect of the gameplay, the one thing that I absolutely had to make sure I didn't screw up no matter what, I would have to say that would be a good jumping mechanic. I mean, we're dealing with a game world where one missed jump means, at best, you fall and break your everything on the next floating island down, or at worst you fall all the way into the planet's core and burn to death. That's not a pleasant way to go.\n\nThat said, this game has what might just be the worst jumping algorithm of any game I've ever played. You move too fast, and it's too hard to control where you end up. Even walking is dangerous, as stepping off a slope means the jumping algorithm takes over and sends you rocketing over the nearest ledge straight to your death. I found that latching my grappling hook on to the ground was a necessary step whenever I was near a ledge, so that when I fell I would at least be able to stop myself.\n\nOh yeah, and let's talk about the grappling hook. I'll admit it's fun to swing around on and feel like I'm a steampunk Spiderman. Even so, the grappling hook isn't much better than anything else. It's too fiddly and too slow, it never seems to connect when you need it to, or else it connects to the wrong thing. Even when it does connect right, it's too unpredictable; sometimes you just stop and hang there, and other times you spin around at high speed, usually straight into your airship's propellers.\n\nThat brings us to the last mode of movement: airships. Airship movement is... passable. It's a bit wonky sometimes itself, mostly due to inertia and the difficulty of making yourself come to a complete stop. (Seriously, Space Engineers had the inertial dampener system for a reason, Windforge developers.) Also, my ship felt like it had a weird desire to keep drifting upward which always made it very hard to dock properly. Of course, there's also the weirdness of the numbers which I mentioned before, where you always seem to have either not enough thrust so you can barely move, or else too much so you rocket across the map with a slightest touch of the buttons. It's a good thing repairs to your airship are free, because you will crash into things constantly.\n\nMy Rating: 2/5 BAD\n\nI find that the games I give a rating of 2 out of 5 are generally ambitious failures, and this is no exception. It's clear to me from the detailed nature of this game that the developer really wanted to do a good job. The artwork is great, aside from the afore-mentioned problems. The game world is very interesting and well thought out.\n\nIt's just a shame that the game they built around this concept is so poorly built. Like Dr. Frankenstein before him, the developer brought his creation to life as a shambling mess that can barely function and will probably end up being the death of us all - I know it's sure killed me more than a few times.\n\nOriginal review posted here.[knightlyreviews.blogspot.com]","October 17, 2014","false","29.1"," 506 of 564 people (90%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","90","506","564","32","16"

Now it's no Terraria, but it's fun enough once you get used to some of its quirks.\n\nWays in which Windforge distinguishes itself:\n• It has a nice stat leveling system that allows for customizing your character's abilities, though the goal is to eventually max out every stat.\n• Building airships is actually pretty fun.  And because no single ship is right for every situation, you'll build several.  Will you go with a slow, highly armored gunship that doubles as your base of operations, or something small and speedy but defenseless?  Will it resist acid or fire?  Will it float!?  Testing and refining your designs is almost worth the price of admission alone.  I think.  How much is this game again?\n• It dares to go against politically correctness and encourages whaling.  Take THAT, you animal rights fascists!\n• Features a hyper-realistic** prison break simulation.\n• Likely no other game allows you to fall so far, for so long to your death.\n\nAnyway, if you loved Terraria, you won't regret buying Windforge.\n\n\n* To be honest, diamonds don't factor into the game much.  It doesn't have to make sense.  The Beatles were doing a lot of drugs at the time.  Just go with it.  The diamonds aren't used for crafting anything, but you can sell 'em for a quick buck.  You'll make most of your money through selling off the parts of ships you've pirated and dismantled.  I guess they could've called it "Terraria in the Sky With Pirate Scrap," but that isn't as fun to hear when you're tripping balls.***\n\n** Not really.

It's such a good concept, but Devs aren't focusing enough on game play details.  Every negative review I read on here before buying is correct.\n\n-Character control is terrible.  It uses an acceleration based system that doesn't accelerate fast enough and acceleration doesn't go away fast enough.  So, if you tap a key to move left, about 1/2 second later your character shoots to the left and slides to a stop.  Good luck trying to navigate all the cliffs and islands with this terrible movement system.  It really doesn't make sense that the devs sit around testing this game and think to themselves "yeah, these controls are really good, everyone will like this."  Maybe they just got used to how bad it is.  I have spent way too much time trying to get used to the ♥♥♥♥ controls in this game.  They need to go play terraria (or any other successful side scroller) and see how responsive that is and match it.\n\n-Because of the 2.5 D and the fact that there is a weird generic non-tiled overlay on the edges of what you are mining,  when you mine to your left you cant see what you are mining.\n\n-2.5 D is cool in theory but makes building and mining pretty frustrating.  I'm not sure what they can do about it at this point, so I'm just trying to get used to it.\n\n- Way too easy to make a fortune by selling random crap blocks.\n\n-Crafting UI needs work, and more sub-categories.  Pretty much everything is categorized under Misc. or Building.\n\n- Frequent crashes losing hours of progress (remember to save...).\n\n\nThose things may not sound like a big deal, but they make the game really difficult to play and suck the fun right out of it.  They have more work to do and as it stands I would not reccomend this game.  If they fix the above things, it would be as fun as terraria, with an awesome spin.","November 16, 2014","false","32.7"," 70 of 83 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","70","83","0","2"

As an open world game it's a lot of fun - you can build and explore as you want.  There's all kinds of different creatures, environments, etc. to explore.  There's also a fantastic variety of weapons, building blocks, ship parts, etc. to use in the game.  So it keeps you interested.  I haven't played all the way through the story, but it's pretty interesting as well, so you can at least have some objectives and targets in the game, if it's too open world.  It can be challenging at some points, building ships that can try to take on skywhales (good luck), but after time you get better and better at building things - think about Skyrim, the first time you fought a dragon you probably died and by the end of it dragons were no problem, right!  For people who like minecraft, but want something deeper, and with a story, this is a lot of fun.  I also really like the art style throughout the game, it's not pixel or super simple like minecraft, but much more artistic and colourful.  I'm hoping that if enough people buy the game, they add the option for multiplayer - I would love to set up a server of Cordeus, with friends who could build and play all together (imagine a ship with 4 people on it roving around the planet!).

If that sounds good to you then you should get this game.\n\nOther good things:\n-The materials you make your ship out of determine its durability and maneuverability.\n-There is a story and an endgame, but you can keep playing after you've finished it.\n-The materials you make your equipment out of affect the stats of the items.\n-The grappling hook is fun.\n-The late-game gas makes for some tense exploration moments when you have to get out of your ship.\n-Increasing your stats gives you very useful perks.\n-You have one chest of infinite holding and can place access points to it anywhere which makes item storage very simple.  Some may view this as a negative.\n-Ramming other ships is super fun.\n\nBad things:\n-The controls take some getting used to.  Everything has some weird kind of intertia to it, plus every ship I made had a tendency to drift.\n-The view makes building a pain.  Foreground blocks can obscure the view of background blocks that they are not actually covering which makes it difficult to tell if your ship is airtight.\n-There is only one method of fast travel and it is not very useful.  You will spend a lot of time just flying from one location to another.\n-Building a stationary base is pointless.  The lack of fast travel means you would spend even more time just travelling to and from the base.  The power system in the game doesn't really update properly in a stationary base so it is hard to get power to devices without using a lot of generators.  It's even harder to get a stationary base airtight partly due to the view but also because you can't tell if the generated background blocks are blocking gas or not.  The item chest makes it so you don't need an area to store items.  I understand the point of the game is to build flying bases but some people would probably like to have a stationary one as well.\n-Monster spawning can drive you nuts.  When a kraken spawns right beside you while you're looting a ship and you don't notice it until it has rammed a hole right through your ship and then you kill the kraken and just finish repairing your ship when another spawns right beside you and does the same thing.\n\nI played through the game twice to get all of the achievements and enjoyed both playthroughs.","December 9, 2014","true","106.5"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","37","45","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neversleeps/recommended/266170/","neversleeps","neversleeps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neversleeps/","2450 products in account","I just completed this game and felt like I should chime in on what I liked and disliked.\n\nAt first I felt like this was going to be like Terraria, it is and it isn't. It's very much its own game, themed around progression through crafting.\n\nThe setting is unique, in that it's flying ships and floating islands. The ships vary from houses to battleships. There's different factions in the game but there's no way to increase or decrease your standing with any, which would have been a nice feature but it's also not necessary. The cities are very unique but in their uniqueness I'd also complain that they're really hard to navigate at first as they have an almost randomly generated feel.. I have no idea if this is the case as I know the bulk of the game is procedurally generated but it wouldn't shock me to find out this is the case.\n\nThe world itself is massive, by the time I had completed the game I had been through roughly half of it.. I say 'been through' but for the most part I didn't explore half of the areas I went into and just sailed through them quickly on my way to places. I bought every crafting recipe I came across and still had about a hundred that I hadn't discovered also.\n\nThe downsides to the game in my opinion, were that I started skipping vast areas of the game because it felt like it was just going to be more of the same.. I'm sure I missed things, there's likely entire types of generated structures that I didn't stumble upon but after I had explored a few areas of each type it felt like the rest of the areas were going to be like that and there were a huge amount of them.\n\nThe game also makes itself too easy on you. There should absolutely be difficulty settings, it feels like the game itself is stuck on easy for this type of game as it has no death penalty in the slightest. You lose no gear when you die, you don't have to retrieve corpses or craft new gear.. essentially after you've upgraded your gear to the next tier there's literally no point in going out and mining that type of metal again, especially in the late game when you're mining the zones seem to throw abundant amounts of low level metals at you that barely serve a purpose.\n\nThe game also instantly hands you a 'radio' which is a no expense, unlimited use, get out of jail free card. It's ridiculous. It says it wont work 'if it's too dangerous' but in my experience dangerous in the radio's opinion is indoors or while actually falling. Some of the funnest experiences I had in the game involved not using the radio and grappling onto passing ships or whales to carry me to other places or to hijack the ship completely as my own. I can understand there being situations in the game where you're stranded and you need a way out, but I'd like to bring up the point again that there is no death penalty in the game. Dying serves exactly the same purpose as the radio and it's always possible to die. There needs to be a penalty for both or at least difficulty settings that add such a thing.\n\nAnother issue I had with the game was that you spend a large amount of the game learning to craft 4 exotic materials. They appear to be the highest grade materials in the game, but through playing the game I never had access to the materials as I never gained the materials to create the furnace required to make them. I checked the forums and this issue was listed as fixed but it absolutely wasn't.\n\nIt feels a little silly to complain about this, as the materials I did have access to made me incredibly overpowered by the end of the game anyways. The final boss battles were amoungst the easiest I've ever had in a game as the damage was just practically non existant. I'd like to pat myself on the back for some clever strategies on some of them but at the same time I almost feel like it was possibly poor design and incredibly poor AI that made it possible.\n\nThese points aside, I found the game genuinely fun and I would recommend it. It has it's flaws and it took a while to grow on me but after it did I was sucked in for a few solid days until completion.","July 9, 2014","true","54.1"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","32","40","0","0"

And to be fair, Windforge is not a game that could be considered "complete" - there's numerous areas it could have done with more work, from story to the conspicuous lack of multiplayer.\n\n(Ok, there's a pretty prolific bug that might kill the game before it starts up as well, but for the sake of argument we'll ignore that.)\n\nBut despite this, despite what it never quite had, Windforge is a phenomenal game, and it's a true testiment to its solid design that it still achieves what many other full games fail to.\n\nOstensibly, Windforge fits into the same genre as games like Terraria and Minecraft, but whereas those sand-box world-builders are divided into sections of "building bases" or "fighting badguys" (and very little inbetween) - your building efforts directly correlate to combat-success, because you're building flying bases.\n\nThis, coupled with a solid crafting system that never sees older materials being upper-classes by newer ones (Early-game Iron is often a component for more resilient later-game alloys as an example), the enjoyable combat and movement, with the added aesthetics of stunning visuals and an amazing soundtrack makes Windforge the sort of game you can easily sink tens or hundreds of hours into.\n\nAnd it has to be said, Cordeus (the world of Windforge) is one of the best realised game worlds ever. Mechanically it gently encourage the player to up their game and rebuild their ship/gear through the environment alone. Falling meteors in the upper atmo? You might want to protect your hydrogen balloons then! Poisonous gas on the lower level? Pack an air purifier and/or breath aparatus.\n\nIt's amazing how the game can flip from platformer to near-lovecrafting survival from one zone to the next, though of course, a skilled player can often play around these, but it's nice to know there's the option to craft a solution as well.\n\nI don't disagree that this game could have been more, but even with what you've got, it's a worthwhile experience.\n\nSo if, like me, you're looking for something different, give windforge a go, but if you want something that's highly polished and can be played with mates, maybe give it a miss.","March 7, 2015","true","147.3"," 41 of 56 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","41","56","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cyanidekoolaid/recommended/266170/","Cyanidekoolaid","Cyanidekoolaid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cyanidekoolaid/","696 products in account","Windforge is another entry into the gaming genre I'll call "2-D world-mining-sandbox". In the past few years this genre has really exploded after the success of Terraria. So what does Windforge bring to the table that could make it really stand out? The graphics are something to behold, at times they are glorious. There's also the fact that instead of building a small base like in many of the games you can build air-ships that you can actually pilot around the world of sky islands. However right now the game is really held back by the controls.\n\nThe first notable difference between this and other games of it's type is the perspective. It's got a titled perspective that gives the blocks a "3-D" view, even though the characters and gameplay are still 2-D. It really makes the looks stand out when compared to the others of the type and is very distinctive. The tile sets are also very comprehensive allowing things to really be customized. There exists a type of "fog of war" that covers parts of islands that haven't been explored. It uses a generic tile and pastes it areas that haven't been explored yet.\n\nThe graphical choices have lead to some clunky gameplay that really needs to be refined. The shape of the tiles can make it difficult to know exactly which one you're mining(or building) at any time. When trying to do things like clear tunnels though land it can be quite annoying; you end up having to just hold the mouse button down and hover over the whole area hoping to knock out the one that's blocking your way. The fog-of-war patterns can also be sorta confusing as they're not always clearly defined from the other aspects of the game. You can easily think you're jumping to safety only to find what you thought was a solid wall was really just a fog-of-war pattern that covered empty space as you fall to your death.\n\nThe combat in the game is another major difference between this and other sandbox world-mining games. The player driven combat is more ranged based. You'll be using guns most of the time and firing and dodging bullets is an important part of gameplay. However the bullet speed is very low, so don't expect much challenge in this department. It's very easy to simply hide, shoot, hide and defeat almost any enemy on foot. You can also do the tricks common to this type of game such as building a wall that prevents enemies from reaching you, but allows you to shoot through if you want to further reduce the difficulties.\n\nThe airships are what really sets this game apart. You can create airships of many different shapes and sizes. You combine balloons, engines, propellers, guns, controls, and design elements as you wish. It allows you to truly create some airships that are beautiful, functional, or even both. The air combat can be a bit rough at first, but it gets better fairly fast. It's a lot more enjoyable than that of the player character. Unfortunately you do still have to get off the airship to gather resources or strip defeated enemy airships of their parts, and the clunky character controls make that rough.\n\nIn the end the character controls simply kill this game. They're just too floaty to find enjoyable. The grappling hook(which plays a major part of a game involving sky-islands) just makes it worse. The thing moves so slow it's almost nearly useless when you need it to save you, and a pain in the butt when you don't. The physics are okay in the airships, but once you get on foot they get really strange. Your character can swing around at insane speeds sometimes and other times will just fall straight down. The character controls lead to many deaths that really felt cheap and like true time wasters.\n\nSo in the end right now I'd say to give it a pass, I just can't get past the character controls. Some of the airship parts I got a glimpse at makes it seem as if they get really cool later on. I mean there's giant grinders you can attach to your ship to grind up the sky islands from the air. How badass is that? Multiple types of ship guns to take down enemies of types. Giant sky whales to really test your airship in battle. I just wish the ground play was  a bit more together and didn't make me want to pull my hair out.  Maybe they'll work these things out and focus more on the things that could make this game cool. Increase bullet speed and other factors to make ground combat a challenge. Rework time wasters by making ground mining faster and movement tighter. Rework grappling hook all together. Then you'd have a game based on fast bullet dodging reflexes on ground and air with tight movement, would be a great game and really different from the others in this genre.","April 26, 2014","false","2.8"," 53 of 77 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","53","77","0","0"

Too much of the basic mechanics is awkward. For example, the player moves quite fast, but this makes precise positioning difficult. But to move downward through a hatch you must be EXACTLY in the right spot. If you don't stop precisely in the center, you just run right over it. There are too many hatches in this game to sit there fighting the controls trying to get through each one.\n\nAnother very fundamental mechanic with problems is block placement and destruction. They've opted for a 2.5D isometric presentation here, which looks good in screenshots, but causes difficulty during play. Every block is something like 1x1x4, which means they overlap one another and it's hard to pick out exactly the one you want to break, or to place one in exactly the right spot. It's just very confusing compared to the true 2D of Terraria.\n\nAt this point I have to recommend NOT to buy this game. Once these fundamentals are addressed, that will hopefully change.

You figure them out after playing with them for a while, but they seem to have only the bare minimum of functionality required to use them. Why can't I use the mouse wheel to change between items in my hotbar? When I craft a workstation, why do I have to place it in my hotbar and then select it and use it in order to place it?\n\nThe character animations look pretty damned stupid, (this is common for games that try to use hand-drawn art, but in this case it's exaggerated because the guy re-orients his limbs and torso to look at the cursor and ends up looking like a marionette).\n\nThe maps are sort of ridiculous. Yeah, you're way up in the air in a world that apparently has poisonous gas instead of a surface. The game autosaves from time to time, so if you manage to fall, you'd better just break out and load the last autosave immediately. If you let it go for a screen or two it's going to save while you're falling, and your descent is going to pass several screens and end with your doom. You don't respawn either. If you die it's game over, and you can load a save. It does keep 2 autosaves, but it seems like a far better solution to just design sane areas.\n\nHit boxes are almost like an experience in coin flipping, which is exacerbated by the fact that your weapon fire is not precise, so even if you manage to aim perfectly at the high speed critters that are whipping back and forth again and again like ducks in a shooting gallery, you have to fire three or four times to get a straight shot, and then the bullet has a 50/50 chance of passing right through the thing.\n\nYou think I'm exaggerating? Try mining something. You stand right next to a stationary object with the jackhammer out and you place the cursor over the tile you want to mine. Something else gets torn up, probably in the background somewhere, and you have to creep the mouse around in circles until you find whatever bizarre sweet-spot the tile's hit-box is on. Want to mine the tile immediately beneath that one? Well, you can try moving the cursor straight downward, but honestly it's a crap shoot. You may or may not end up mining the tile you're after.\n\nIn any case, considering that Terraria sells for $10 at full price and $2 on sale, I'm sort of miffed that I kept this $15 turd on my wishlist for so long. I was excited when I finally got my hands on it, and pretty badly disappointed when I finally played it.","January 5, 2015","false","0.6"," 43 of 64 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","43","64","2","0"

Literally out of nowhere, with a huge amount of content. Where did they hide it for all this time?\nIt's got some incredbile vibes. The world is atmospheric (ha!), with skywhales floating around peacefully, pirates ambushing travelers, wonders and many many dangers...\nThe process of building and flying an airship is pure joy. Having a grappling hook right from the start, also, opens up for a lot of cool moments. Disable that ship engine? Grapple over to it, knifing the crew out, and start stripping it bare for repairs after the fierce battle... then jump out as the last engine of the flying carcass dies out to a fire, barely managing to rappel yourself back to your ship\nIt has some quirks. Hit detection is a bit off. There's some evident screen-tearing when moving on foot at high speed, and the occasional crash paired with the not so generous autosave makes for some frustration (thankfully, you can save anywhere)\n\nIt is incredibly open, which means you'll both be able to screw yourself over completely by going almost right off the bat in areas meant for waaaay higher levels (the death penalty is simply respawning in town, which considering the size of the world, is both good and bad), leaves you with almost no direction whatsoever after the small tutorial... but that also gives it that incredible exploration vibe.

Ok, isolated, each of them are only reinterpretations of other ideas previous games already implemented, but I'm talking about the whole thing.\n\nAs any other sandbox, Windforge is all about exploration and char development, with the innovative difference of being around steampunk themes. Cave exploration, a wide variety of weapons and building materials, different kinds of enemies to fight, random encounters, farming, skill training, crafting and alike, it's perfect if you like to explore and collect.\n\nOther distinctive characteristic of the game is the ability to build fully functional flying machines, and attach them with everything available, from turrets to spiked blocks, which can also be your home, if you wish so. Flying mechanics are also clever enough to make you spend some time figuring out the best design for your airships. Also, caves in Windforge start to collapse once you reach the dirt layer, so you need to watch where you're digging. Besides other interesting details, soon after starting your exploration through the world, you'll find yourself collecting resources and piece-by-piece building your flying fortress to triumph over enemies in the skies (which goes from air pirates to flying whales).\n\nThe only bad thing here is the absence of multiplayer, which is understandable, since it was one of the stretch goals when it was funding in kickstarter, goal which wasn't unfortunately achieved. The devs have plans to implement it in the future, though.\n\nIn other words: must buy. Nice game for a fair price.

It is set in an open steampunk world where you can explore the skies and find so many incredible things hiding around.  However there are a few reasons I can't recommend this game without seroiusly considering its cons.\n\nI'll start with the pros.\n\nPros\nThe game looks very nice.  It's not fantastic by any stretch, but the graphics fit fairly well.\nIt has some excellent music.  The soundtrack, unfortunately, doesn't contain that many songs.\nIt's got a fairly deep crafting system.  There's a whole load of stuff you can make, from fire infused gatling guns, to   sausages you can beat people with.\nAirships are completely customizable.  You can make it look any way you want, and still be relatively functional.  There's absolutely no limits to the ship building system.\nThe grappling hook is so much fun.  Leap off your ship and sink your grappling hook into the one your boarding, swing up onto deck, and take out the people there with your custom made weapon.\nIt saddens me to bring this part, but here are the cons.\n\nCons The game world is made up of zones, which become fairly cramped as your ship grows.\nMany zones have no reason to explore.  They lack a landmark and are rather boring.\nThe character devopment system could have been done better.  It's not terrible, but by no means is it adequate.\nThe story is cliche and bland.  It's there, and it guides you through the world, but it isn't that fun.\nIt's not really an RPG at all.\nThe world and the lore is so interesting, yet the game lacks the depth to bring it to fruition.\nAs much as I would like to reccomend this game, I can't.  Unless you are looking for a steampunk game where you can board ships, build ships and explore the world, I would recommend against buying this game.  It feels like an unfinished product compared to many great indie games that exist out there.\n\nAll of this being said, I look forward to playing the next game that is released by Snowed In Studios.

Building a huge expensive ship with workshops and so on may be cool, but it serves no useful function in the game.

However, what you do need to before purchasing is that there are bugs. The optimization is terrible, the psychics are sometimes weird, sometimes the A.I.s just stop what they're doing, even if you're shooting at them, standing around confused, the controls are lofty (which is sort of good for these sorts of games where you're flying all around with grappling hooks, though this makes it feel like a task to walk from point A to point B), and at times you'll find yourself flung at high speeds while using the grappling hook for no apparent reason. The worst of these problems, I believe, was the optimization (keep in mind this error only happens for a few). When exploring temples, it would get so bad the combat turned into more of a how to predict where the bad guy will be throughout the lagging. But, getting past that, this delivered an experience like none other. This is one of those few games that has created memories for me. I still remember the time I jumped off my airship onto the back of a whale and killed it with a knife, thinking of a way to stop my fall as we fell through the air towards certain death. I had so much whale meat after I carved it out on the side of a done that I was encumberd for so long and didn't know what to do. Or the time I was boarding a huge whaler ship and then a whale came across the fray, so it was madness of bullets flying through the air as it rammed into the side of the ship we were fighting in, sending us flying away, then crashing further below. I was uncertain whether I should use this to my advantage or fight for dear life alongside them to kill the brute. Or even the time I got into a ship and saw the odds were so against me I ran to their engine room to destroy their engines, sending us crashing and scavenged what I could from the wreckage. That's the thing I love about this game: that feeling of falling through the sky, that fight-or-flight response, wondering how the heck to save yourself. I could divide my time into exciting scenarios through and through. Stories are great, but what is the game, you may be asking. Well, you fly around the world with this neat map system with three zones: the below world, which has toxic gas you need to fix your ship and your character up for to counter it, monstrous creatures instead of air ships that I will let you discover for yourself (it might have ships, too, I can't remember), the middle is the normal forestry place, and the sky world above is mostly free some stuff other than a few dunes here and there littered around. Well, maps are great, but what do you really do? The goal is to loot special temples (along with a few other odds and end jobs, though mostly you're left to yourself, which I love). You can get blueprints to be able to craft items and can use your money to buy stuff and train your person in a few traits, such as agility, wisdom, strength, etc. (I’ll let you discover the wondrous perks may do. I am not an expert on that area, anyway). Looting temples really leaves something to be desired, sadly. (The lag I have makes everyone a nightmare, though, yet again, only some have this glitch). They go on forever, it seems, and though you can keep a mindset of, 'get in, get out', I'm a perfectionist so it doesn't feel right to not explore every room. The items and money scattered around are just enough to make it feel like you're missing out. I think that bad guys keep spawning, too, which is annoying. Mostly, I found myself standing around, boredly shooting at turrets until they exploded and then moving on, drilling holes into the ground because I didn't feel like taking any more trash from the spikes. So, why do you have to loot these temples? Well, some are just small plain ones for fun and loot, though there are the special ones that require you to find and kill the boss there and collect the tablet which triggers the trap--the best part of the temples, in my opinion (the walls and floor will start changing, sometimes spikes will start to appear everywhere and bits of the roof will fall down and hurt you or close some paths off (which you can drill through if you want), so you're on a clock to get out of there and hop into your jolly parked ship and bring it to a person who will give you tons of money (unless your ship gets destroyed by an enemy and you have to improvise. That, again, is what I love about this game. That feeling of just sitting somewhere wondering how you're going to overcome this next obstacle: should I wait for someone to come along and take a ride on their ship (or steal) or make a small ship on the fly? Of course you may be wondering what is ship building and what if you don't want to design ships in the first place? Ships require a few key things, such as generators to keep components powered (if there isn't enough power, components work worse and worse depending how much energy there is to go around, and, if there is none, they will simply stop working), propellers to move the thing around, steering thing, and, optionally, you can also add balloons to make them float better, along with guns to defend yourself. There are also a few other odds and ends, I believe, not to mention the bits purely for decor. The great part is, you really don't have to make your own ships from scratch. You start with one, so you can either keep adding stuff to it or steal someone else's and so on. It's a great mechanic because you can do as much or little as you want with your ship.\nThe air battles are fantastic. You can crash into ships, shoot them, or my personal favorite of boarding and killing everyone, claiming the boat for your own or scavenging their parts for your own creations (at the dock, you can save ships there so you never have to worry about it being lost, broken or boarding another ship on the fly when you register it at the dock. Also, the repair system is super nice. An outline of the ship always remains even when it's shot off, so you can simply highlight it with said tool and it gets repaired to the original design instead of you having to guess what went where).\nI think this game is really more about the heart than mechanics. If you're going to judge it simply because it's a game--well, it has problems. But if you're like me and look upon it like a door to a crazy adventure, step right in.\n\nIf you have decided purchase this game, my parting bit of advice to you is to look beyond the shell and instead to the heart of it--and save. I always get this tingly feeling like something crazy is about to happen so I save it--like that whale part--so I can keep reliving that one absurd scenario over and over.","April 1","true","32.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

While I played it, it was a game that kept my occupied for several hours on end. The kind of game where I kiss my wife goodnight on a Friday and don't see her again until Monday morning!\n\nIt does have its faults, but those can be pretty much overshadowed by one very high point - it has atmosphere. You will not forget playing this game; it will be etched into your brain long after you put it down, a few months and dozens of games later.\n\nThe developer has abandoned it - well, gone on to work a real job and try to earn a living. I think that term "abandoned" gets tossed around way too much these days though. This isn't an online game so there's not really and maintenance to be done or constant server upkeep needed.\n\nIf you go back to the 1990's, you could technically argue that every game released for a console back then was "abandoned" since none of them ever received an update after release.\n\nWindforge has that same feel. The game is complete and perfectly playable.\n\nEven if every feature planned may not have been fully implemented (just a guess since I don't actually know the backstory behind the release of the game) everything that is in the game is playable and works fine.\n\nIt has a strong enough story to keep you moving along and a large and expansive open world to keep you wanting to explore further, build bigger and be stronger.\n\nIt has RPG elements like character stats, NPC quests, and even has a certain SNES type of style to it.\n\nIt has survival elements like crafting and cooking.\n\nAnd it has originality - on the player's part.\n\nHere's a true story that happened earlier today:\n\nI crashed my starter ship into another ship in the higher atmosphere. They weren't trying to outright kill me, so I let it ride out for a while - our mangled wrecks hovering in mid-air. Then I looked it over and liked their ship a lot more than my own...\n\nI grapple-hook my way above their balloons and pull out my drill. I pierce a hole through their roof, down to one balloon, then proceed to set it on fire with my drill. It goes up in flames, burning holes through their floor and dropping one crew member down to the darkness below.\n\nStill no signs of aggression... I suppose the only crew member who realized my intentions was about 2 miles below, screaming his last breath!\n\nNow, it gets interesting....\n\nOn attempt one, I drill out the other balloon and the other two crew members spot me and fire their shotgun and machine gun at me. They not only destroy the balloon the rest of the way, but hit one of the large furnaces (?) behind me, it goes up in a fireball and we all die horrible fiery deaths.\n\nAttempt #2. I hold off on shooting out the other balloon and instead, swing down below to see if I can get a better angle to invade their ship. As I swing, their ship changes direction and the steel propeller sucks me in and I get processed into ground beef.\n\nAttempt #3, I sit and wait. I see one of the crew start shooting at something and a second later a HUGE WHALE rams the side of the ship, kills two crew members, tears through a wall, destroys one balloon and blows up the same furnace as before.\n\nAttempt #4. No signs of the whale. I drop down one deck and drill the crew member left off the deck to the bottomless abyss below. I open the hatch and see the crew on the other side start firing again... great, another whale! While their backs are turned, I commandeer the controls and drop the ship off screen.\n\nWe're now falling at terminal velocity with all the controls (and crew) at my mercy. The crew's being tossed around like rag doll, totally helpless.\n\nCRASH!\n\nWe smash bottom first into a few trees and then bedrock. Splinters of wood spray everywhere and the 3 crew members left flatten like pancakes due to the impact.\n\nI survive with 2 health and a badly damaged ship... but it's now MY SHIP! Mwuahahahah!!!\n\n\nAnyway, it's events like those that make this game stand out from the sea of mediocrity on Steam. Pack a PBJ for lunch one day, skip Pizza Hut and do yourself a favor and buy this game instead! You'll get a lot more enjoyment out of it than a Pizza can provide!\n","August 15, 2015","true","47.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

If you add a chest, it won't be there after it finishes loading the new area (mission I guess), because it's not in the script. I really hated this feature of the game, you lose hours of foraging if you forget to grab everything out of your chests, but then if you have to grab everything out of your chest then you can hardly move. So what's the point of having the option to make storage chests?\n\nPlus the enviroment is pre-definied and makes replayability utterly boring (everything is always in the exact same spot).","October 19, 2014","false","6.0"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","21","36","0","0"

Does that make sense? Pretty similar to controlling your character in Starbound on a low-gravity planet. Walking past some colourful plants at the beginning was kind of hard on my eyes, but I later would find out that they were supposed to stand out because you’re able to destroy them to harvest their contents. I jumped the second animal I saw and it got bugged in the wall behind me in its haste. The enemies move pretty unconvincingly in any case. Like in Starbound! But somewhat worse.\n\nAt the end of the first level was a whole “omigod you got the relic now the place is falling apart” thing, and all of the walls began turning into dirt for some reason; blocking the path I’d taken to get there. But it was happening slowly, so I tried to walk back out, and then I died due to unreasonable amounts of falling dirt. The menu presented to me was then “Go to town”, or “Load”, and the former was greyed out. So I loaded the autosave it had made for me, apparently right after I got the relic, but somehow without triggering the whole collapsing sequence. Still played the dramatic music, though.\n\nI then realised that I could use the jackhammer to carve my way out of the side of the old, unstable ruins, and spent some time picking up rocks and stuff from a mountain I was briefly considering digging to the top of to see if anything was hidden there. When I got back to the ship, my partner in crime was all “Whoa what was happening back there?” and you don’t reply, and then you fly away and there’s a huge collapsing explosion of destruction just off-screen to the right where the big ruins were supposed to be collapsing but weren’t.\nAs the ship sailed away, the camera didn’t centre on my character, but it did pause and jump to centre on her when I pressed tab to open up the inventory, and I had a lot more fun than I ought to have then, showing that game what for. Take control of my camera angle, would you? They'll think twice before they mess with me again.\n\nI would then find out in the captioned images between levels that our ship had sustained heavy damage from the hypothetical explosion, and that’s why we were flying away so fast, downwards. Immediately upon landing the terminal velocity crash, both of the crew members were totally okay, apart from the NPC one developing a sudden case of laziness and electing to be the foreman and tell you what to do while you go around making all the repairs to the ship yourself. Upon using the repair tool for a second on the balloon, it instantly repairs itself fully in terms of aesthetics, but when you talk to Ms Lazikens again she insists you need to like hold the button down on the balloon for a while to repair it fully. God. (Actually, all she says is to repair the balloon, I figured out the holding down of the button part by myself.)\n\nShe then says that “it will take some time to repair the ship fully”, you know by harvesting supplies in the form of block from the land we just crashed on, and then she talks about forges and recipes and oh god I’m going to stop playing for now because I realise that this is actually going to be probably exactly like a Starbound that isn’t as good as Starbound, because it doesn’t have as good mechanics and doesn’t have aliens and claims to be a Steampunk game but the entire plotline is centred around the fact that your society runs on Whale oil. And I didn't have the patience for Starbound.\n\nI also had intended to go for the ‘Vegetarian’ achievement for eating no meat throughout the entire campaign but unfortunately walked over the dead bodies of the animals I’d slaughtered and my character immediately devoured them like a voracious ♥♥♥♥♥, thus RUINING EVERYTHING.\n\nI got it for 0.20$ in the Humble Bundle. I may come back to it at some point, but I’m not largely motivated to. It was worth that price I think, but I can’t help but wonder if a lollipop would have been an even better deal.\n\nI could have dipped it very briefly in water and then sucked that. Have you ever tried that? It’s lovely. I used to do that all the time when I was younger. In my youngling logic, I decided that because it was so nice after putting it in for just a moment, it must be even nicer if I leave it in for longer! So, I left my lollipop in a bowl full of water and went away. When I came back a few hours later, I was devastated to find that the water had consumed it whole! The turmoil in my heart was real, and I don’t think I’ve ever truly recovered.\n\nThis looks like it has some decent elements in it but excels at nothing (this is what I've discerned from my like forty minutes of playing). But you know, that's undoubtedly just me being an unbelievable jerk and not giving it the chance. Nay, I gave it not the chance it needed, but the one it deserved. Did you like Starbound? You might like this. Good for you, go for it. I won't think any less of you. I'd be happy if you enjoyed it more than I did. Just, you know, whatever man.\n\nTLDR: Meh.","July 12, 2014","false","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Combining 2D and 3D is a very fine process and doesn't work very often, especially in this case. It feels to force to work and the extra depth provided by the "3D" enviroment makes the game seem less and less like a decent metroidvainian and more like a half baked pie. A bad pie at that. The crust looks good but everything on the inside is poorly choosen and doesn't go well together. Maybe if they had left the entire game in 2D instead of the half and half. To add to the fact of terrible graphic choices, the extra "fog" layer that covers ground you haven't mined yet is really sloppy and seems to take ques from Worms Open Warfare, and other Worms titles, revealing small circles each time damage is dealt to the terrain. Maybe if they simply blacked out the "unknown" sections and had a similar function as  Terraria and Starbound, it might work out better, but they didn't. All in all the game looked promising but as I took a "bite" into it, it turned out to be poorly put together with terrible choices in the design. Maybe some people will like it, but I don't, at least not in it current state. So if you want a good game to run around in and explore, especially with a ton of weapons and tools, go play Starbound, Terraria, Minecraft, or maybe just go play a different genre.","March 13, 2014","false","1.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

In the end, the ability to fly with your home everywhere you want, and fight other such vehicles and giant flying whales and krakens makes it up for it, for me, but I think not for everyone.\n\nThe really bad things:\n- Framerate issues on large maps with a lot of entities\n- The fake isometric view that can make jumping through holes and hatches infuriating\n- The generally "floaty" controls\n\nThe bad or tedious things:\n- Building and mining: mostly due to the strange camera view\n- Going into town for quests. Seriously, why so wide?\n- Mining. Mining is OK, but even in late game there is no way to pinpoint ore pockets of interest\n- Crafting. I love that there is such a big variety of items to craft, and especially that starting materials stay relevant in the end game. However, the interface for it has not been well thought. No search option.\n- Travelling. Travelling is usually fun, but when you need to go from one point in the map to the other, well, you'll need to hang on. A fast travel option would have been welcomed, at least between towns, and even for a cost.\n- Killing whales/krakens/ships: if you kill them in one map cell and they fall in another map cell, that's it, you've wasted your ammo for nothing, because their remnants will disappear.\n\nThe good things:\n- Super varied crafting\n- All armors have different looks in-game\n- The world and the lore, despite lacking a bit of life, is quite cool\n- The graphical atmosphere is pretty nice, even though the toxic smokes can clutter the screen a bit\n- Player progression is smooth\n\nThe very nice things:\n- Flying your own ship (even though building it might be a chore)\n- Exploring temples, when the framerate is OK, its really pretty nice\n- The fights against whales and krakens are really cool, and the reward of "mining" their body never gets old (seriously, try the cluster bomb, super satisfying to use)\n\nIn the end, it feels like the game might have been too ambitious for the means at its disposal, but for me it was a nice experience, at least it felt fresh. If there is a huge sale, then definitely get it to try it and make your own opinion.","September 13, 2015","true","30.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It takes the player on a creative journey in a air world filled with adventure and steampunk styled air ships. Unlike some games the storyline in Windforge is mostly not open-ended, you can continue playing after you have completed the main quests but there really isn't that much to do.\nThis game is another example of a game that functions and is fun to play but, sadly, lacks the polish and finishing that would make it truly great. There is so much untapped potential in the world of Windforge that this game just can't capture. There are towns but they are filled with NPCs that mostly have only a single phrase if you try to talk to them. They have no awareness of the world around them and will not make a peep if you empty the safe they are standing next to.\nThe finish and polish of the graphics are simplistic but do convey the steampunk styling. The character animation is simple and the movement a bit unrefined, making it challenging to control the character with precision sometimes.\nThe destructible world is done quite well with ore generating in the floating islands. I really enjoy games that let me get creative and this is the biggest thing that made the game fun and exciting was to build and refine my airship. I appreciated the recepie system where you can discover new things you can build. It makes more sense than some other games where you mysteriously know how to make everything for which you have materials. I wish there was a way to get specific recepies, none of the towns had a recepie for large motors so I spent half the game looking for that one recepie. A dedicated recepie vendor in one of the towns that is guarantied to have all the basic recepies would be a good idea.\nI enjoyed playing this game but the lack of refinement was abrasive. This game will not likely be one I return to like other creative games. It kind of makes me sad when I see games that have so much potential but were not able to realize it. I am a furniture maker by trade and this game reminds me of a beautiful chair that still needs some sanding and a lovely laquer finish to be a real good seller, but currently is little more than a functional place to set your bottom. Careful! you might get splinters. :)","October 16, 2015","true","61.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

AI is a bit messed up. Fast melee monsters will chase you but they are going so fast that if there is a wall they will get stuck inside or on the other side of the wall, if you jump over them they will try to change direction upwards so they will instead run through the ceiling.\n\nAlso, when you are flying your ship you will constantly be attacked by either pirates or flying creatures, which gets extremely annoying when you're just trying to find your quests location (some quests you are shown exactly where they are, some you are only shown what map it is on). After completing the first quest you will get turrets and 1000 bullets for them, but I used them up the moment I had reached the closest mission target, leaving no bullets for the return trip. The closest target was about 2 "zones" from the city and the furthest about 10.\n\nI was being attacked by a pirate while I was near the ground I stopped controlling my ship, still standing inside, it was like now the pirates couldn't see me anymore and just flew away.\n\nAiming is also a bit wonky, shoot and you miss, aim a bit more down, shoot and hit the same spot. What I mean by that is, that it seems like you can only aim at specific degree angles. So you aim to the right, but can only shoot 5 degrees upwards to the right, not directly at 0 degrees.","May 5, 2014","false","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But once you take to the skies is when the fun really begins, as you go from weak lil ship, to a gun toting armoured war ship, Destroying anything that dares attack you.\nOr maybe you want to make a ship thats good for ramming into other ships so that you can board them and take that ship for yourself, or just smash them into the nearest island and leave the remaining crew marooned.\nAnd once you get some nice artillery you can become a glorified planet cracker(uhhh island cracker?) Sending shell after shell into the floating islands so you can take the precious ores they have with ease.\nThen theres also the whales, yes they seem a bit silly at first but once you start playing the game the whales and all the other creatures that are in this world will start to fit in and it'll all make sense.\n\nThe mechanics of the game work well and the combat takes quite a bit of skill at first, as you can die fairly easily, but once you find that one special gun itll all start coming together.\nThe crafting, once i figured it out is alot deeper then it would appear. There are alot of recipes, and instead of having different recipes for every different material they just have a bar that lets you choose any variant of the item that you want to create.\nBuilding a ship is also a nice thing as you are essentially building your base they you use to take to the skies.\n\n\nNow to the gripes i have about the game\n-Yes unfortunately there is no multiplayer, at this time.\n- The tilted 3dish looks of the blocks makes it kind of hard to navigate when building a ship and for other things.\n- The fully destructible enviroments are cool, but it would be nice if instead of having to take are base with us in the skies we could settle down a home base on an island without having to worry about it being destroyed. Imagine if we could build are very own town which we could dock all are ships at...ahhh thatd be nice.\n\nBut yeah the gripes are small troubles when compared to how much fun ive had with this game.","June 29, 2014","true","23.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

To say it like this, the end of the story quest is not the end of the game. I didn't even start the story quest until i was about 20 hours into the game.

I had a blast just scavenging ships and selling the parts to vendors, so that i could get better weapons and armour.

It also includes a story and RPG elements.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay is where this game shines offering tons of crafting and other ways to satisfy multiple types of gamers. Airships can be built from scratch or you can modify your starter ship. There are weapons armor and loads of other objects and building components to craft with an ingredient based crafting system. Gameplay is somewhat like other 2D block building games however areas separated by loading screens which was unnecessary. This doesn’t kill the fun you can have by exploring. Airships are necessary to move from zone to zone since falling thousands of feet is not healthy for your character. While flying you will encounter enemies including but not limited to bandits and Flying Whales that will attack unprovoked if you get too close. With living creatures and other NPCs attacking what else is there to worry about? Meteors coming from below. These meteor showers are really annoying early on and will tear up your airship like a M134 firing over 3000 rounds into a minivan. Combat wasn’t anything new or exciting but it was fun and worthwhile. You can choose a melee approach or a ranged approach either way it was pretty fun taking down bandits and hostile wildlife.\n\nStory:\n\nFor a story well it was okay. It has those cool moments but there aren’t enough and it did feel somewhat bland however it touches on a similar real world topic the topic being our most used fuel source depleting. Whale oil is the fuel source and a replacement is trying to be found of course the only possible viable replacement is highly illegal to research. It is pretty much the typical quest to save the world/human race plot. This sort of plot is getting old thanks to TV, movies ,and other video games.\n\nDifficulty:\n\nThe learning curve isn’t too large the tutorial was straight forward. The only truly difficult part of Windforge was navigating meteor showers along with the occasional whale attack early on in the game.\n\nMajor Issues:\n\nA part of any game that degrades quality if optimization. While Visiting the first town my frame rate dropped from a steady sixty to ten and wouldn’t go above twenty. This made me cringe and is an issue that should be fixed.\n\nPros:\nCrafting System\nBlock Building\nRPG Elements\nBuildable Airships\nOkay Story\nDecent Learning Curve\nGood Combat\n\nCons:\nOptimization Issues\nUnnecessary Loading Screens\n\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

Its pretty, and diverse. Unfortunatly, that is all lost due to game breaking crashes.\nI found the game can crash at any time, and when you go back to load a previous saved game, it wont load and crashes the game.\nI found that the game obviously gets to a certain state and eventually becomes so unstable that you simply cannot play any further.\n\nA real real shame.\n\nEDIT:\nSo a patch has come out that has GREATLY improved the stability of the game, which has a huge issue for me. Ive not seen it crash once now, and my save games seem to be ok too, so thats really good news. Well done SnowedIn!\n\nThe game still needs some refining (sometimes you are constantly attacked, which gets a bit silly) and has some bugs (like enemies walking through floors and walls), but i think with a bit more work, the game will be really great.\n\nIve changed my recommendation from a No to a Yes, but with the caviet that the game still feels like a Beta, and needs a couple more updates to really get it up to scatch.

The mining is an interesting way of handling resource gathering in a very similar fashion as other 2d survival games. The problem happens that the hit boxes of everything from the mobs, ores, and even your own hit box seems to be very small compared to the models used for the objects. I am sure when I find my way further in the game there are going to be other bugs, but to me the basic elements that I wanted to play with are there. The grappling is just enjoyable and the airships are a fun change compared to other titles that are similar.\n\nI guess for the real thought on if you should buy the game or not. To me it was worth the 15 dollars as I can see myself putting some more time into the game when I'm not so busy. I went ahead against the bad reviews and bought it just to give the game a chance since I watched it for so long, and I'm not regretting it so far unlike other titles that have been in a much worst mess and for much more money.\n\nUPDATE:\nI've been spending so much time just traveling around and building onto my airship I never got around to advancing the main story line until now. I've taken on my first temple without actually beating the main boss at the end as of yet, so I guess my judgment is still lacking a little. My experience has been a mix of enjoyment along with a little frustration. I enjoy the randomness and small challenge of the temple, but at the same time I start to get frustrated due to the game throwing an unreasonable number of enemies at me. I am glade that it gives me plenty of potions or food to keep me from dying, but a few times it feels overwhelming. I still enjoy the game and still don't mind the minor bugs that I have come across. Most of the temple I kind of skipped just by using my drill and the fun grappling hunk to make my own route to the end.","March 11, 2014","true","29.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

My review may seem inaccurate as to how when i tried to play this game; which was able to run after waiting for the screen to go away, i started playing and 2 minutes into I wanted to RIP OUT MY EYES.  sorry bout that but I am not sure what is going on with this game, perhaps the fact that the cursor defines where the screen is at any given point quickly moving things around, but after two minutes I had the worst headache from playing this game.

The typical game keeps my interested for about 30 minutes, maybe an hour. (Most of the "Played" games on my profile have been just getting cards overnight.)  I've sunk over 20 hours into this game already, and most of that has just been exploring and trying different things out and not even focusing on the questline.\n\nI really enjoy the ship-to-ship combat, and the grappling hook play is really fun.  I'd never really gotten the hang of the grappling hooks in other games because they just felt weird.  This game's grappling hook works intuitively and I have a lot of fun flying around and doing things with my grappling hook.  The only downside to the grappling hook is that you can't use a gun while swinging around.\n\nAnother big plus for me is the destructible world and environment. You see it, you can probably destroy it.  I like using brute force with part of my ship to smash other ships into stuff, then while they're held pinned, gun down their people and steal their ship.  As their ship starts to fall apart, I'll usually rush in and repair it if things get too bad while I'm gunning down the crew.  Then I'll steal all the good stuff from their ship and let the rest fall into oblivion.  Another plus of the destructible terrain is that you can plan entry into hard to get to places and make a back-door.  (A quest that sends you into your first major boss fight had me accidentally take a back entrance that was one room away from the boss fight.  I opened the door and was like "What? Already?"  Then I spent the next 3 hours exploring that area completely because there are chests and such in hidden spots.  But the back door made the boss fight really easy to do.)\n\nAt the time of this review, there are a couple of crippling bugs that make it so that you'll want to use the quicksave frequently.  First, there's one that if you move stuff from your inventory to your stash or to a vendor really quickly it will cause the game to crash.  If you go slower, it prevents that crash.  Another is that there is something that overloads the physics that can cause the game to freeze.  When there's a lot of stuff going on, my game becomes a lag-fest.  For instance, there's a Temple you have to break into and retrieve something.  There is so much going on in there that the whole game starts chugging.  I have a pretty beefy rig, and even have a dedicated Phys-X card (which I'm pretty sure this game doesn't support, but I only mention it to emphasize how much I've invested into my rig).  Terraria used to have the same problems and they were able to resolve them, so I hope this game follows the same trend (maybe adopts the same solution?)\n\nMinor concerns are:\n* I wish that breaking stuff open in the temples would give better loot than healing potions and money.  I went through the first major temple and didn't really find anything interesting.  My armor is still pretty weaksauce, although I found a dual shotgun early on that was a major game changer.  One-shot kill most stuff.  (That gun is way OP for the stage of the game I'm in.)\n* The AI is pretty weak when it comes to ship-to-ship combat.  Most guys on the ship just stand around. On the ground, the AI just follows a "run directly at you" mode, and doesn't seem to have good pathfinding.\n\nThe good of this game vastly outweighs the bad, and so far the developer has been very active in the forums.  I've only had the game a few days, so I don't know how often the game is updated, but rumor is that it's pretty frequent.","June 28, 2014","true","91.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'll touch base on each of these of course.\n\nThe combat system: I loved the fact that you could fly your ship around and man the guns directly or from your control panel, which allowed you to either directly shoot at them from the turret, or fly around shooting sparatically at your opponent(the ai) not to mention that you could leave your ship, use your grappling hook to grab onto an enemy airship and climb aboard for a good old fashioned pirate raid. :D  I'll admit I wasn't a fan of using melee weapons(I discovered that you could use them to dig faster than your starter mining tool...) but I did play around with them abit and found that if I had chosen a good starter or built up my strength and vitality, it would of been a very interesting way to play.\n\nThe grappling hook: While I did discover there's also a grappling gun, I never actually made it, the hook was perfect for me since I prefer the idea of just throwing your hook into the wind and hoping you snag something as you fall to your doom. xD I will say that it was a handy little thing to keep on my right click incase I fell, or incase mid fight I needed to propell(can't find proper spelling, but I know it's a word...) myself around to avoid instant death/grab an enemy and pull him into a hole where he will fall to his death or land in a trap.(my personal favorite)\n\nThe music: I loved the feeling of the music most of the time, I wont say 100% of the time, because when I was in the temples, it was just too soft for what I was doing(usually dodging those annoying small lizards and the mass of turrets at every entry point v.v) however, when I wasn't fighting evil tiny lizards, or dodging a mass volley of turrets, the music was the right level to give me the feel of drifting along the currents in my very own airship, seeking a new target for my weapon system I've just built, or to ram into with all of my grinders on the side of my ship(hilarious moment right there...)\n\nOver all, I'd say this game is a must have for anyone who wants to build your own airship, or just plain run around swinging on a grappling hook from one side of the world to the other.(watch that first step doc, you might end up in the core!)","July 19, 2014","true","15.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

I've played Minecraft, Terraria, Starforge, and Edge of Space (and tons of other procedural games), so you could say I'm into these types of games, and Ive actually had my eyes on this one since the days when it first entered greenlight (i actually voted for it). Finally got my hands on it, and I gotta say, of all the games ive mentioned above, Windforge was the right-off-the-bat funnest game, and it also shows the most promise. Right now, its an early access experience like you might expect, but the ship mechanics are awesome, the dungeons are tons of fun, and the balance between grinding materials/buying from merchants/unlocking schematics is leagues ahead of the other procedural gen games familiar to this.\n\nIf you like the genre, you're bored, and can spare $15, this game is worth it, if not now then at least for what it will be with sufficient backing and dev support.\n\nThe current bad parts just really have to do with content and variety. All that is probably bound to change, but to name a few in case the devs are watching, more enemy ship types at all stages of the game, more towns (maybe scattered small villages? just for the merchants? or even friendly merchant ships?) and definitly more enemies.\n\nthe biggest bug that's bothered me is randomly some items, after being crafted or purchased, wont move into my inventory, it will simply dissapear. That means the materials/dollars are gone. lost as much as 30k in one shot once. thats a lot for where i am in the game.\n\nOtherwise its a wonderful experience and i will definitly keep playing and having fun while the devs do their work.\n\nEDIT\nMy hours have continued to rack up in this game. Got a lot of things on my mind but wanna keep it short. The biggest thing is content (theres too few of it). I mean, obviously its early access and the game isnt finished, but for those wondering whether it will be a "complete experience" if they purchase the game right now, well it really depends on their expectations.\n\nThe fundamentals are there though. The ship-to-ship combat remains incredibly satisfying, theres tons of freedoms for modifying your ship (construction choices will seriously influence the way you explore/fight/survive), and after a little while the 2.5D graphics grow on you. At least they did for me. World seems to have a lot more detail and a bit of much needed depth. Yea, I guess construction can be a bit clunky, but personally I have adapted wonderfully. Its not perfect by no means, essentially if you want to have some precision, you wont be building anything fast. But destroying stuff with your jackhammer feels pretty good (especially with high strength), the grapling gun is just about the most amazing mechanic in any builder so far other than probably the ship mechanics. You can swing around, rappel, pull things, fly about basically like spiderman (after practice), with just one mouse button and WASD.\n\nBut again, need more content. More dungeons, more towns, more enemy ships and more everything. The game world is huge, and there should be more content propelling you out there into the dangerous unknown. Do you know how cool it is engineering a combat/exploration-worthy vessel air-tight-ready for the Gas? Then only have to employ it a couple of times? Oh wait, that second bit aint cool at all. But its the reality right now.\n\nP.EDIT\nI forgot to mention this, because my PC's pretty meaty, but even it dips significantly in framerate every once in a while in this game, but sometimes for persistant amounts of time. I've seen others complain they cant run this game on a laptop (which seems rediculous to me in this age of computing), so be forewarned.","August 13, 2014","true","41.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I liked the platforming, and the grappling hook made for some enjoyable mechanics.  But when I got into the exploration of the temples in the game, I came to realise its major downfall.  The temples are massive, repetitive, full of beginners' traps.  They're made difficult not by clever level development or intelligent enemy AI, but instead are just full of areas where you can't avoid taking damage.   The whole game boils down to a test of how much frustration you can endure before rage quitting.  I should have known better when I read the description on the store page and it said this game is similar to contra and terraria.  Trying to simply emulate other games without putting enough effort into flushing out your own designs is doomed from the beginning.

The way levels are divided into different sections really breaks the combat with the whales, which can easily be lost when they tumble out of the sky after a difficult battle.\n\nThe inventory feels is clunky and suffers from tedium. Learning recipes for crafting, for example, means you need to click and drag books one-by-one into your area for active items and using them one-by-one.\n\nAlso, mining and building could use some work. The game has a pseudo-isometric design, and it can be unclear sometimes where the cursor is highlighting. It will often make you misplace blocks or mine the wrong areas.\n\nYet, on the positive notes, combat in Windforge is epic. While even the smallest enemy can easily kill you, the sheer range of options you have in how to approach each battle makes combat very fun. You can jump off your airship, grapple onto an enemy ship, battle its crew, steal the ship and harvest its parts. You can grind up flying monsters with your propellers, blast them with your turrets, or go outside to take them down by hand. You can grapple onto flying beasts, or surf on top of them while blasting them with your pistol.\n\nEvery battle will put your skills to the test, and every victory will leave you feeling awesome.\n\nAside from the overall difficulty, the game is particularly difficult early on. Enemies get harder to defeat the further you get from town. The key to playing is to not rush to quest objectives, and to instead take things slowly and build up your character and your ship.\n\nBuilding ships is also very, very fun. It may sound like Terraria or Minecraft, but it’s not. The building you do in Windforge is all functional, and gives you very practical tools you can use to customize your playstyle.\n\nDespite its flaws, I highly recommend Windforge to players who don’t mind a challenge, and can tolerate the lack of polish. While it needs some minor fixes, it is a rewarding game that plays with some unique and very fun concepts.\n\n(You can read my full review here: http://techzwn.com/2014/03/windforge-is-a-terraria-like-metroidvania-with-awesome-flying-airships/ )","March 12, 2014","true","25.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

This artifact must have had a lot of magic in it, because upon jumping into the air in excitement, Mr. McBugstien practically exploded and died instantly. Must have been too much for his heart. Next, after recovering the magical thingy and the temple collapsing around him, Buggy managed to escape into his airship just as the island exploded. Sadly, there must have still been some magic in the air as Buggy phased through the ship floor and fell to his death.\n\nUpon awakening at the crash site, McBugstien decided to make some repairs to his ship. He decided to make a venture into the mine to the west and after killing a Bat-Dog that, upon death, flew back with such force that it litterally evaporated 5-6 layers of solid rock, Buggy decided to decend deeper into the cavern, firing his grappling hook into the floor to make his slow decent. Sadly, Buggy must have shot himself in the foot, as he instantly died once again. Deciding that firing high powered grappling hooks near ones body is probably not the best thing, Buggy fired it into the cieling and decended down into the depths. After killing a Marauder (or at least thats what Buggy hoped it was) he jumped onto a ledge containing a copper vein. Little did Mr.Bugstien know, that the copper had been irradiated by whale blubber and procceeded to keel over and die once again. Thus ended the life of Mr.Bugstien at least until the world in which he lives becomes a little more stable","March 12, 2014","false","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, I emailed the devs and recieved and helpful response very quickly so thumbs up!  I think I've found my own bug!  I hope they name it after me :)\n\n2)  The crafting system is strong and the game is helpful enough to tell you what you need (both a strength and a weakness, depends on what you like.  Hunting recipes isn't fun for everyone, but then using my psychic abilities to work out craft recipes ala minecraft isn't always the best either)\n\n3)  The flying is fun and being rammed by a flying whale is tremendous.\n\n4)  I would like more customisation for the character.

I'm doing it because of how polarized every review I read about Windforge is.\n\nThis is Windforge. I like it but it is not the game I was expecting in great and disappointing ways.\n\nWindforge looks a lot like MinecraftTerrariaStarbound and it IS like them in that you mine things and build things, but that is really where the similarities end. The worlds of MinecraftTerrariaStarbound have a certain pace and feel about them. Those worlds welcome you, let putz around and figure things out at your own pace, and explore. The threat of night looms, but you'll never get into too much trouble that you didn't, in some way, go looking for.\n\nSnowedIn compares Windforge to Contra and I think that needs to be bold and underlined with little arrows pointed to it. Windforge's world, while pretty, doesn't like you. You run at its pace, sometimes sprinting. After building my first ship from scratch, I wanted to find somewhere slow to test it out. Windforge laughed at my puny efforts and I promptly ran into three ships full of pirates. Trouble will find you. Sometimes giant, terrible trouble that has a lot of tentacles. Sometimes five of those kinds of trouble at once.\n\nThe game is hard and doesn't want to hold your hand. Exploration and mining is less about relaxing and watching TV on the second monitor (Something I often do in MinecraftTerrariaStarbound), and more of a white-knuckled experience where you feel naked outside of your ship and dread the tentacled horror. But what comes from this is an absolutely awesome feeling when you find your feet and come out on top. If you have ever successfully played Dwarf Fortress or Dark Souls, you know what I am talking about.\n\nThe bugs are apleanty, though. If those make you rage out, you will probably blow a few arteries. I haven't run into the corrupted save bug people are talking about, but it would definitely be very sad to lose the iron monstrosity I've created. Also, the lack of handholding goes a little too far sometimes: it took my quite a few hours of play before I figured out how to register a new ship with a dockmaster. The ship needs to be left at a specific spot at the end of and slightly under the dock. Then you go talk to the dockmaster. I found out by accident.\n\nThe last issue I have is a tricky one to work my way through. A part of the game involves going to various ancient temples and fighting bosses in them. The boss fights are amazing and intense, and what happens after each one is always exciting, but exploring the temples before the boss part is dull. I have a feeling that they are meant more as obstacle courses to do quickly and efficiently and not something to dungeon crawl through, though. The habits you formed playing Skyrim will not serve you well here.\n\nSo there you go.\n\nTLDNR: I think Windforge is more like the unforgiving panic-shooters of yore than MinecraftTerrariaStarbound. Some people will love that and some people will be stressed and frustrated. Also, tharr be bugs.","March 14, 2014","true","77.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

When playing this game I was sure it was a beta or something but I was suprised to find out it wasn't being sold as an early access title. The art style is weird and assests don't really fit together, the sound effects were probably taken from a royalty free site and they sound very cheesy, and the viewpoint of the game seeing individual blocks as more like logs is unnecessary and confusing. The ideas presented in this game are really cool and the whole build your own airship thing works but there are too many other things that just don't in my opinion. Maybe after a significant amount of updates this game will be a lot better but since it's not an early release title, this cannot be guaranteed.","July 17, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

A lot of those games have potential and most of them are garbage. This game has potential and is not the latter. I just hope it isn't here just for money and they actually finish it.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun but it has a lot of problems. The build system gets pretty frustrating sometimes such as when you are trying to put a vertical propeller on and it doesn't snap. The movement is not the greatest, especially when dealing with hatches. The game is also Very difficult. I will kill an enemy and wait for the next to come then I will loot their ships. Then another enemy comes and blows up my main ship while I am looting and I have to go spiderman on them, I sometimes just end up falling off the ship though which is not fun because you go through each load wall until you hit something and die.\nThere are some performance issues I have noticed such as occassional temporary freezes and whenever you go to the temples or cities, that might just be my computer though.\n\nOne of the big highlights of the game is the hunting of these floating whales. In order to harvest the whales they must be above a land mass when you kill them. This can be problematic because some areas don't spawn them. In the upper atmosphere are "Space Whales", these guys are really bad. They have more blubber but are almost impossible to harvest because they go in to anti gravity mode and just float away when they die. The whale carcasses also seem to attract a crapload of enemies making it even more difficult to harvest.\n\nThis is an original game and it is pretty awesome. I really hope that all the problems get fixed before its official release. Expect a lot of bugs, performance issues, and frustration. I recommend this game because it is better than most early access games that come out these days. It is a lot of fun and it is still in its alpha stage.\n\nEdit: I have now gotten about 45 hours under my belt. I am adding this part to my review because I feel it is needed. I have gotten to around the end of the game and have encountered many bugs and glitches. Almost 9 of my saves have corrupted, therefore I have kept about 3 saves updated. Every time the quest tells me to meet with someone I go and meet with them and it doesn't complete the quest. This makes it so I can't beat the final boss. All in all, I don't think that this game is ready. It has loads of playability but you will be cringing through it due to frequent short term freezes due to enemies spawning in the area, and save corruption. This game was a lot of fun but I am going to wait until it gets patched a load more. I'll check it out again in a month.","March 12, 2014","false","45.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","3"

This could have been a great game but they left it totally unfinished and unpolished. There is almost no variety in enemies and most of the crafting items are the same but with different materials. The end quest is unclear and explains very little to you. Probably the worst thing of the game is the movement in land, it is a real nightmare to mine blocks with the drill and when trying to fall through the trap doors in the floor is simply horrible.","February 13, 2015","false","36.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A procedural world filled with quests, combined with the building and crafting possibilities of Terraria and a Contra-style combat. Soon afterwards however, I started up the game and was unpleasantly surprised by its graphics. The weird isometric view, with the mashup of two dimensional characters just looks odd and out of place. The ugly repeating textures all of the place were giving me the rest in terms of aesthetics. But then again, judging a book by its cover often leads to missed out opportunities. So I delved in a bit deeper. After a small tutorial section, that ended up with me flying around with a self-build flying machine, I was swayed into joy again, which was not meant to last though, as the combat soon after was more than just sluggish. The main reason being the floaty controls. Followed by that however, came the final dagger, twisted into the already heavily wounded SwashbucklingSir: when entering a larger town area, the game ditched all frames into the abyss, leaving me with measly 10 frames per second or even lower at times. Barely able to move about the place, I decided that Windforge might not be as ready to be released yet, as the developer would want it to be. An ambitious project, no doubt about it, but sadly the weird mash-up in terms of aesthetics, the unresponsive controls and the horrible performance do not earn much praise for Windforge.\n","August 28, 2015","false","0.8"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","0"

It's mostly about money: You can loot enemy ships for parts, go whaling, buy items that are actually good (vs only available by findling Xbajillion ultra rare), buy recipes for items, mine, pound a ship into the ground to mine faster..., you also buy/upgrade characteristics of your character for bonuses like double jumping and carry wieght.

Beside all that stuff that makes it less enjoyable, I still like this because it's another terreria clone,  that has a couple of new cool ideas. The best is the ship building and man is it cool. Not just build it with liike wood, iron, or diamond, it's gots lots of minerals that each have different properties that can make your ship immune to fire, chemical, lighter. You try to build the most efficient ship at killing mining, basically a moblie station. Try doing that in this game, it's hard. The music is good for this game. The grappling hook is fun to use. So don't get it yet if you don't want an early access type of game. Wait to see if they can fix the things that might annoy you, just like they do to me. Also, i got this game for $1 on some inde bundle, so that's the best price you can get.

Judge "Windforge" for what it is, not what you want "Terraria 2" to be.\nThere is NO WAY this game is under a 70/100 meta in quality.  There are far worse sandboxes out there with far higher scores.\n"Windforge" answers the question:  What would it be like if "Terraria" was steampunk and written by Herman Melville?\nMake Moby ♥♥♥♥ your personal Airship.  The physics feel damn good, especially the grappling hook, which is exhillerating like "Worms" when the ninja rope *finally* feels right.  The low-G is fun, taking a bit of adjustment from the run-of-the-mill pltaform physics.  It takes a practice, but is ultimately rewarding once you realize just how far you can push getting close to death and surviving.  Often I catch myself on a cliff edge -midair- with my hook right before I hit the ground.  Tons of hunting & gathering, with craft to match.  Classic interface for the genre with the addition of several tools, notably the Repair tool, which with a wave of your mouse fixes your ship -to your origional design- making the destruction element of the game much more forgiving and enjoyable.  The story is different, intriguing, open ended to and extent, and quite charming.  For those fooled by the graphical style while mining, the key is -unlike Terraria- aiming *past* the block you want..  then it moves along at a good pace.  With a little practice, "Windforge" is a fun adventure where the art style makes the sandbox a joy to just putt around in, or the dangerous world is a great survival escapade.  ...and, seriously... WHALE AIRSHIPS.   92/100\n"He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I'd strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even that fair play.

I had trouble with it crashing even after I upgraded my video card drivers.  I played a total of about two hours before the technical issues got to me and I asked for my money back.\n\nAs to the game itself, what little I saw was very creative.  I personally like the visuals, and the flora and fauna are very creative.  However, controling the main character was too difficult.  I expected there to be some manuvering and a learning curve for directing the air ships, but the PC herself was flailing all about, over-shooting her mark and making it hard to avoid dying by landing wrong.\n\nI don't like the weird layout of the blocks.  In Terraria, the screen is completely 2-D, so wherever you point your mouse cursor is where your character digs.  Here, it's like they were trying to give a slight three-dimensionalness to it, but that made it hard to know just where I was aiming when I was trying to shoot or to dig.\n\nI really wanted to like this game - REALLY wanted to.  It's a fabulous idea, and as I said, the graphics are great.  I just can't get past the difficulties.\n\nIf you're used to Terraria-style game play, I can't in good faith recommend this game.","October 17, 2015","false","2.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I Kickstarted this game, and bought 3 copies, having high hopes for it and trusting that the developers would do a good job.  I've Kickstarted loads of games, and this is the only one I regret (despite some of them being less than awesome) - I wasted my money.  Don't do the same.\n\nThe controls are sluggish, odd and feel disconnected; the story is boring and pointless; the crafting/construction is clumsy and poorly planned.  This isn't a survival game, it isn't an adventure game, and it isn't a builder game (like Terraria or Minecraft) - at best, it is a clunky platformer with some gimicky construction tacked on.\n\nIt is difficult to pin down any particular problem with Windforge, as the concept is a good one, and the game really deserves to be decent - but something in the implementation leaves a lot to be desired; it just doesn't work.  The whole point of any *game* is to be entertaining, and this isn't - it's boring.  It feels like work.  I want to enjoy it; it is full of stuff I should like (steampunk, airships, sky whales, resource collection, construction, adventure - hell yes!), but it is just put together with so little finesse, and such poor implimentation that it falls flat.  It is lifeless, and tedious.\n\nI guess the developer's thinly veiled attempts at money grubbing during the Kickstarter campaign should have warned me off - but, I hate to say, I trusted that they believed in the game enough to do what was required to make it good, even if people didn't throw vast sums of money at them.  I was wrong.  Honestly, I'm pretty surprised that they finished it at all - although they seem to have done only the bare minimum to achieve that.","September 8, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Everything is a bit clunky on building and not everything instantely makes sense, especially with quests. But it does have a sense of adventure to it that's quite nice and some of the art is quite good while basic blocks and such don't look great. Backgrounds and those whales look fantastic though.\n\nIt's an interesting curiosity. Not worth a lot of money but good on sale. It needs to be polished and perhaps some more content would be great but as is it's worth it on sale for the airships alone.

Wonderful artwork\n2. Great game mechanic (Terraria but with fully functional aircrafts)\n3. Lots of crafting recipes (I heard like 1500)\n4. Cool map with drastically different 'biome'-esk areas and different windstream patterns, etc.\n5. Pretty cool physics and engineering depth when building the aircrafts\n\nCons:\n\n1. Dungeons could almost be considered broken in the state that they are in (finished game) - they are either randomly generated or just poorly made. They are way too big, too hard to get in to, and completely boring.\n2. The AI is as dumb as can be as far as the enemies go\n3. Probably the biggest con is that everytime you go to a new scene (next section of the map), everything resets. This is hard to describe but those that have played the game will absolutely agree. Basically if you are mid-fight and jump to the next scene usually by accident, the game loses all memory of said fight and all that you have is much less ammo to show for it. This is made worse by each section of the map being ridiculously small.\n\nMeh:\n\n1. Music is ok. Not great. They should also have breaks in it - playing for 5 hours straight I started to really notice this.\n\nOverall, great great potential but I could not recommend the game. I certainly could see getting $1 an hour for this (for those that base value on that aspect).","August 23, 2014","false","5.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

If you like seeing airships fall out of the sky to a shot from an artillery cannon or fighting flying whales and squids.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/266170/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Windforge is a game about sailing through the sky in a home-made airship that you craft, modify, design, build and repair as you battle sky-pirates and seek out ancient artefacts. Set in a Steampunk world where everyone lives amongst the clouds, Windforge combines the destructibility, 2D perspective and mining mechanics of games like Starbound and Terraria with its unique premise. That should be a recipe for success - the concept is brilliant and early signs are good that a world of depth and exploration is about to open up before you.\n\nIn short, if I were reviewing a game design document rather than an actual game, I'd be giving it a much higher score than the one Windforge is about to receive. Unfortunately Windforge is a game beset by problems that slowly chip away at the enthusiasm earned by its obvious promise, it's a dreadful shame because there is real ambition on display here.\n\nWindforge is set in a world where Whale Oil is the primary resource used to operate industry and keep the ubiquitous airships from falling out of the sky. Your character is working for an underground organisation, tasked with uncovering the advanced technology of a race known as the 'Aetherkin', defying the laws of society in the process. Although Windforge gives you the freedom to explore and fight on your own terms, there is a central storyline driving things forward, with quests sending you off to the far corners of the sky in search of the means to utilise a renewable energy source to replace the rather less renewable Whale Oil.\n\nThe game begins by having you select the class, hair colour and gender of your on-screen avatar before throwing you knee deep into a story-led tutorial that sees you rescuing a translation tablet from a crumbling temple. It's a decent enough introduction that sees you coming to terms with the platforming and fighting elements of the game as well as operation of the jack-hammer that replaces the starting pickaxe of similar titles. Before long the tutorial takes you to your airship and requests that you mine the materials required to repair it. This is where the first warning signs begin to flash. While both Terraria and Starbound revel in the simplicity of 2D pixel art, the most basic elements such as mining and building are remarkably precise and refined enterprises. Here, not so.\n\nMining in Windforge is the first task that demonstrates that all's not well, it's never entirely obvious where you are mining, and a task as simple of grabbing a few chunks of ore quickly becomes arduous. The inherent fiddliness on display here sadly extends to building and navigation of the world as well as flying your ship. While moving your ship is as simple as using the WASD keys, a lone vine hanging down from a sky island can completely halt your progress. Navigation troubles can occasionally lead to hilarious moments as you smash your ship into a town, wrecking both in the process. Sadly the AI does not really react to this (most NPCs are quite happy to ignore a bullet in the face too).\n\nMy post-tutorial adventures in Windforge were at first thrilling; coming across a tiny aggressive ship manned by sky pirates, I leapt from my own ship to theirs, using my grappling hook to catch on to the balloon keeping it afloat, before climbing aboard and dispatching the two pirates that manned it with my hunting rifle. Now I had choices - do I capture the tiny vessel and take it to town to add to my fleet, or strip it for parts with my removal tool, adding further engines and turbines to my own ship?\n\nWindforge has moments where the concepts threaten to cohere into a satisfying whole, yet its severely hamstrung with fiddly menus, and worse controls. An act as simple as moving through a town becomes a chore, overladen with pedantic platforming and odd design that seems to have been thrown together by an army of sadistic architects. The first quest tasks you with finding someone within a town to turn in an item - typical RPG-fare that quickly becomes frustrating with the lack of direction or finesse in moving your character from point A to point B.\n\nLater quests that see you exploring temples for further artefacts too are rendered into frustrating exercises, you're constantly fighting against a game that doesn't seem to want you to play it, from movement to ship navigation, down to the act of destroying terrain – nothing is as smooth as it should be. Combat is relatively simple, using ranged and melee weapons to take down well imagined sky creatures and bandits, yet again the paucity of the AI prevents this from being as fun as it should be.\n\nWindforge is almost an oddity in an age of PC gaming where 'early access' seems to be the way to release an unfinished game into the wild, allowing creators the time and resources they need to offer a polished complete experience. What we have here is a game that would clearly benefit from extra time – and the advice and input of beta testers could have allowed it to become something more than worthy of its peers.\n\nInstead, we’re left with a game that promises so much, but falters repeatedly in its delivery. The 2D platformer with Minecraft elements and bits of the RPG genre (someone really needs to come up with a snappy name for this) is expanding in exciting directions and Windforge deserves to be a part of that. Yet the novelty of airships and battles with giant sky-whales are simply not enough to save it from its flaws, painful as they are. Perhaps post-release support will allow Windforge to transform into the game I hoped it would be, but for now it sits as a flawed gem. It veers between a showcase for ambitious design and an exercise in endurance as you grapple with the controls and wince at the obvious problems, willing the game to live up to its fantastic premise. But it never quite does.\n\nSlightly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","June 25, 2014","true","38.5"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","1"

ANOTHER ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MINECRAFT CLONE. STOP. MAKING. THESE.\n\nSeriously, I could rant for hours on how many boring games are ♥♥♥♥ out to try to cash in on Minecraft's success, but I'll leave that for another time (i.e. never since I'm too lazy). Windforge is probably floating around near the bottom of that group of garbage, since it's more or less actually painful to play.\n\nIt's glitchy, broken, boring, abandoned by its devs, and crashes more often than a plane with one wing. The airship is kind of neat as a basis for crafting, but it's unwieldy and annoying to build/fix, the map is unnecessarily broken up into segments (I think they were going for some kind of 'map sector' feel which is effectively just 'unnecessary transitions'), crafting is kind of irksome, combat is inconsistent, and finding materials is a chore. Items glitch through the ground all the time, blocks are unnecessarily small compared to your character so trying to do any kind of "mining" takes forever, cities and maps are messy and annoying to traverse. Instead of making me mad at how terrible it is, however, it just makes me sad, since this is obviously just the developers going "Hey, Minecraft is good, let's make Minecraft except 2D and steampunk!" rather than having some kind of originality.\n\nIt's not rage-inducingly bad, but I think Windforge is a good example of how the gaming industry is getting overfilled with crap pushed out by people who don't care and paid for in advance by idiots with no sense of financial responsibility. I got this from some Humble Bundle or other, and I wish I could return it, my library is already filled with "It's Minecraft except _______" games that piggyback onto Humble Bundles and other deals to try to spark some life back into them.

The game is reminescent of Terraria, with superior controls, but it lacks the depth and variety. The game has a great asthetic, but a few problems and glitches really rob the game of its potential. Key items (i.e. vulcan forge), manage to disappear from your inventory such that they can't be replaced. Occasionally, critical story elements are skipped and the story can't advance as a result. The penalty (or lack thereof) of dying seems to undermine the challenge of the game. Finally, the game could use a bit more variety: you'll run through nearly all of the random encounters possible on your first trip to a different city--well before you complete the game. Also, the weapons are quite redundant. Summary: the game has great potential, but its nearly too glitchy to finish, and lacks the substance needed to reach its potential.

And lastly a neat little tab system where different types of items would fit into, making the list of craftables a lot less intimidating.\n\n-The UI overall is great, if not a little under-res, the colours are fitting and it looks like a UI that had time put in it.\n\n-The stat system is great, it's compiled of agility, vitality, strength and wisdom and another couple. but the reason it's so good is that it is just that. a little bar that has a couple of milestones that come with awesome perks.\n\n-Lastly, the story system. I love it! it is very gripping and i enjoyed every encounter with a fellow NPC, and the idea of the game's origin and story is compelling and not seen elsewhere.\n\nCONS:\n\n-The MAJOR thing i wanted to point out is the performance coding. it is absolutely horrible; there i am, chugging along in my airship untill i hit a town, and during my visit my fps (averaging at 120fps) drops to about 15 and shoots back up as soon as i leave the VICINITY of any town. and this thing crashes at least 2 times on one of my average sessions.\n\n-The low resolution of the UI is a definite thorn on the rose. Get that tuned up.\n\n-The combat system lacks and feels very slow, whenever i'm in a gun fight the projectiles move so slowly i imagine i'm the guy from the matrix and i pretend to duck and jump over them... and the damage of both myself and the enemy (the humans that is) are just making it look like we were fighting with nerf guns\n\n-The crafting can be a bit intimidating if one takes a glance, and can sometimes be a bit TOO much effort, because either it's just me or the game because my greatest challenge so far is finding sand to make a glass bottle.\n\n-You should only be able to repair in a close proximity.\n\nThanks for reading my review and i hope you all enjoy the game if you buy it now, but if you wait keep this game in the watch list, because it has great potential and its gonna have multiplayer! :) Have fun!","August 17, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Oh god the lag. And absolutely no graphics settings beyond resolution and zoom level (you're stuck with your massive texture quality, shadows and all other graphics settings!). This gets worse the more effects are in the game (oh god the particle effects).\n\nRandomly generated maps. So, random maps are cool. However... temples can be enormous. Enormous and identical. Whoever built these temples wanted people to get lost and you might spend hours going through boring rooms trying to find the *one* room that contains the tablet you actually want. Because that's why you're in temples - to get tablets. And there's one. Out of about 200+ random rooms. That all look the same. And aren't necessarily connected. I like random, but this might have been a bit overdone.\n\nOh yeah, and as you explore more and uncover more of the map, the game lags more. Because it now has more stuff to handle in the background.\n\nOn a neutral note, a prototype screen where you could design airships and then build them in one go if you have the necessary materials would be kinda cool. No need to try to build a hangar for it and then piece by piece build it in a (lagging) city or island.","August 3, 2014","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 2D contra-like combat is very fun, as is the mining and building. Some aspects of gameplay aren't obvious, and there is a bit of a learning curve (E.G. how to effectively kill a whale). The airships look a bit hoaky, as they are essentially flying houses. However they are still fun to build and design, as you have to worry about things such as power, bounyancy, and weight.  Small things like grappling hooks make this game fun.\nMy main complaint is the lack of side-quests. Although you aren't forced to work on the main storyline, there isn't much else to do. Most of the game consists of raiding temples, and occasionally gunning down bad guys.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omnimmotus/recommended/266170/","omnimmotus","Omni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omnimmotus/","44 products in account","Pros: Great Steampunk feel, flying your airship feels great, airship building extremely varied, on-foot combat surprisingly well done, grappling hook, everything can be mined, drilled and used for building (even the flying whales!), airship repair isn't a chore, sandbox gameplay, beautiful artwork and great art style.\n\nCons: Can be fairly buggy, menus are a bit unwieldy, art style makes building a little confusing at times, AI needs work, towns feel a bit too static/plain, would benefit from additional content.\n\nBottom Line: If you can tolerate the aspects of the game that feel unfinished, you will be pleasantly surprised by how natural building and piloting an airship is. Personalizing your airship is addictive and satisfying, and flying that personalized airship feels fantastic and rewarding.\n\n\nSteampunk airships are just plain satisfying.\n\nThe moment I read "steampunk airships" as the focus of a sandbox game I was interested. I like steampunk, I like sandbox games, and building and flying my own airship sounded like an absolute joy, the kind of thing where I'd be laughing and smiling as I flew around doing whatever I wanted. As far as that goes, I was not disappointed in the slightest. :) I didn't go in expecting to find the "next big thing" in gaming because extremely high hopes almost always lead to disappointment. I went in just wanting to experience the joy of building and flying, customizing my own floating fortress as both a cozy home and a deadly war machine, and it gave me exactly what I wanted. If that sounds fun to you, buy this game! You'll get your money's worth.\n\nSomething that caught me off guard was the gameplay on foot, when not in your airship. It's surprisingly well developed and designed, allowing you to walk around your airship comfortably, go onto land to gather resources like wood or dig for metals, or leap onto enemy ships and blow them all away with a rifle to steal their ship or strip their ship for parts. (Yeah, that last part is my favorite of the three. Airship boarding = awesome.) You also have a grappling hook, the kind that allows swinging as well as pulling yourself up, and I'm a sucker for grappling hooks. If used well, the grappling hook is an amazingly fun tool. Mix it all together and the on-foot combat and movement is surprisingly deep and can involve quite a bit of finesse.\n\n\nThe game does have some issues here and there or things that need a fair amount of work. The menu system is usable and decent, but a bit clunky and would benefit from a redesign. At times it can be a little difficult to find what you're looking for in the menu, but it never got to the point where I felt lost in the menu. Some of the game's design is clearly a bit more old-school, which isn't a problem for experienced gamers but may be a little awkward for those who are newer to gaming.\n\nOne of the game's strengths - its beautiful art style that helps your airships feel impressive and satisfying - can unfortunately make construction slightly confusing. Because things in the game appear tilted, knowing exactly where to click to remove a block takes a while to learn. It's not a huge issue, but it's certainly frustrating. The game would benefit greatly from the ability to toggle building in a non-tilted mode, on a predictable grid, though most of the time you'd want to build normally to see and appreciate the art. Lastly, the game can be rather buggy sometimes, though regular patches have been improving this dramatically.\n\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nAll in all, the game can feel unfinished at times, but that's not that unusual these days with the trend of Early Access games. The part where it really matters - in this case the building and flying of awesome steampunk airships - is robust, freeform and addictive. If you like steampunk, airships and games with a focus on building and customizing, buy this game. The ability to take your buildings with you (so to speak) if you want makes it feel like your time building really means something. You don't build something cool and leave it behind to play the game; you can build something cool and use it to play the game. Ever build something in a game, like a house or fortress, and wish you could make it move? Well, now you can. Except you get to strap cannons to it and pretend you're wearing a monocle.","May 15, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At the moment, I hope the developers can fix the issues loading while traveling via airship. If you are travelling pretty fast with alot of propellers, then the game goes bonkers with trying to keep up with you. I am not sure if its optimization issues or memory allocation issues. Who knows, as this is black box testing and I can't see the code on my end. Also fix the weight issues, why can a character carry 5000+ pounds when my weight limit is 400 tops. Either toss out the weight limit or make it impossible to move with a ludricous amount of weight.\n\nThe game itself is pretty fun, it's a different flavor than terraria and starbound. Terraria feels more tested and less bugs compared to this. As I have quite a few hours in both terraria and starbound; this game seems odd. Don't expect the best items at the beginning and don't go whining about not having the best loadout in the beginning. Drills and hammers are used to bust throught the environment, but there is no clear indication of what's better; other than the materials. Diamond has to be better than steel, but what about admantium vs. diamond.\n\nWhat is good about the game? The ability to travel via an airship. The lore behind the game and about the planet being mostly gasey with some land at the top. The loot isn't borderlands epic, but some of items do make a clear difference depending on type, which is normal, quality, and master.\n\nGood tips: avoid fighting whales and krakens early, mine admantium, boost wisdom really high, and collect recipes.\n","July 25, 2014","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As many of the reviews of this game state that there is crashing problems, and janky controls and such, as of today I have not encountered any of these issues.

It looks more like a ♥♥♥♥in 2D Flash sidescroller with cutout bodyparts but much more smoother than in your average flash game.\n\nI don't know what people are talking about: I can fly my fortress around, transitions between areas are a bit long but that depends on your CPU mainly. Enemies differ between moronic creatures or annoying as hell flying serpents with fire breath.\nThe NPCs are sometimes ok, sometimes so OP they wipe you out with a single hit unless you got armor.\n\nOnly real problem is the slowing down when you are inside the cities (must be my ♥♥♥♥ CPU) and the horrid visuals that ask a lot of getting used to from new players. It tears alot and strains your eyes a bit too much with its non blocky color schemes (maybe its just my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ screen that tears the frames apart maybe something wrong with Vsync...\n\nAnyway:\nPut the health items above the movement keys, forge a mighty rifle (sell that ♥♥♥♥ing starting pistol its ♥♥♥♥) and just blow away evrything that comes in between you and your objective. The hit detection on creatures is sometimes a bit off especially when using the starting gear... but the Doublebarrel shotie fixes any worries about accuracy and damage in no time. Gathering ressources can be a chore and digging tunnels trough the islands is also a waste of time unless you got the right perks and gear. Air battles and hunting flying whales is a matter of pattern and your design preferences (maybe your ship has a lot of expendable armor on one side, maybe it can be locked into place to hold the other ship or even catch a whale carcass. Unfortunately sometimes maneuvering around smaller islands becomes a chore because even thin plants cause your ship to colide with the ground and completely slowing down your movement to zero.\n\nBest thing I like are the grappling mechanics. Hell is it fun to do the spiderman from one flying island to a nearby airship or if you fall from the sky maybe reach a nearby cliff before smashing into something. Lost your ship? Just steal one from any passersby and after reaching your fortress again demolish it to sell the parts.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlyingShisno/recommended/266170/","FlyingShisno","Flying Shisno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlyingShisno/","769 products in account","So this is a fun game. It's basically Terraria, except you can put propellers on your house and fly it around. Also, there's a heavier focus on story and exploration. The world is made up of a large amount of areas, aligned like a square grid. If I had to guess(didn't count it), I'd say it's a 20x20-ish grid, so around 400 areas in total. Each area I'd say is about "medium" in size, not very big, but by no means small. So there's plenty of exploration to do if that's you're thing. Some areas, mostly towns, are in the same spot or at least the same general area in each game, but every other area is randomly generated, so every game is different. The only exception is that some areas mostly quests and always towns, are not randomly generated but pre made.\n\nJust like in Terraria, you can harvest blocks, craft items, build whatever you like, etc. Except you don't have all the recipes for all the items at the beginning, you either have to find them or buy them, and some specific recipes are received through a quest.\n\nOne thing I like is the ship building mechanic. You build a ship pretty much like you'd build a base in Terraria. You build the frame with whatever block you want, and each type of block has different health and armor, so a Iron hull is more durable than a wooden hull. Then you put on propellers(which you can find, build, or buy) so there's at least one facing up or down for vertical movement, and one facing left or right for horizontal movement. Then you place an engine(buy/build/find), and ship control panel(used to pilot it), then bam, ready to fly. You don't need a balloon like many of the pictures show, but it helps greatly, since it gives the structure bouncy which counters a lot of the ships weight. If you go the no ballon way, then you'll need either strong propellers or a lot of them. So long as all parts(propellers/engine/control panel) are connected to the same structure, then it's considered a ship. The game also does a great job of explaining this for the most part, though it doesn't give many hints for building from scratch.\n\nJust make sure that when you build your ship, that it's not still connected to the area you're building it on. One way to counter this worry is to craft a single "starter ship frane"(not exact name), which is a platform/pallet like block which doesn't attach to anything. Just drop that down on a cheap pole and start building your ship. Be sure to register it with the dockmaster in a town.\n\nDon't worry about building a ship right off the bat, since the game gives you one which works very well. You can make modifications of course. If you want to remove anything, not just blocks but placeable items too, use the dismantle tool.\n\nThere's also a stat system with some skills too. There's Strength, Agility, Vitality, and Wisdom. Each stat starts out at 5 or 10(forgot), and can go up to 100. You're starting class determines what stat starts at 20 in the beginning, but you can go to skill trainers who will raise your stat by 1 for a sum of money. Every 20 points in a stat will unlock a skill or passive. For example, you can unlock a skill from Agility which will let you double jump, and there's another skill which let's you jump off walls.\n\nAs for weapons, there's a lot of guns to mess around with, though I don't know how much variety there is yet. There's also plenty of side quests to go along with the main quest, or you could just explore the large world, checking out abandoned buildings and mines, or maybe just attacking pirate ships and stealing their stuff. There's a lot to do, and other than the first two areas(temple and 'ship repair' area), you're not forced to do the quest. After repairing your ship, you're free do do whatever you like.\n\nAnyway, for any fan of Terraria I'd definitely recommend this game with it's general and ship building mechanics, Action/RPG gameplay, etc. Not sure how it stacks up against Starbound though, since I can't really afford much outside of bundles, but this game is definitely worth playing.","July 13, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And lastly a neat little tab system where different types of items would fit into, making the list of craftables a lot less intimidating.\n\n-The UI overall is great, if not a little under-res, the colours are fitting and it looks like a UI that had time put in it.\n\n-The stat system is great, it's compiled of agility, vitality, strength and wisdom and another couple. but the reason it's so good is that it is just that. a little bar that has a couple of milestones that come with awesome perks.\n\n-Lastly, the story system. I love it! it is very gripping and i enjoyed every encounter with a fellow NPC, and the idea of the game's origin and story is compelling and not seen elsewhere.\n\nCONS:\n\n-The MAJOR thing i wanted to point out is the performance coding. it is absolutely horrible; there i am, chugging along in my airship untill i hit a town, and during my visit my fps (averaging at 120fps) drops to about 15 and shoots back up as soon as i leave the VICINITY of any town. and this thing crashes at least 2 times on one of my average sessions.\n\n-The low resolution of the UI is a definite thorn on the rose. Get that tuned up.\n\n-The combat system lacks and feels very slow, whenever i'm in a gun fight the projectiles move so slowly i imagine i'm the guy from the matrix and i pretend to duck and jump over them... and the damage of both myself and the enemy (the humans that is) are just making it look like we were fighting with nerf guns\n\n-The crafting can be a bit intimidating if one takes a glance, and can sometimes be a bit TOO much effort, because either it's just me or the game because my greatest challenge so far is finding sand to make a glass bottle.\n\n-You should only be able to repair in a close proximity.\n\nThanks for reading my review and i hope you all enjoy the game if you buy it now, but if you wait keep this game in the watch list, because it has great potential and its gonna have multiplayer! :) Have fun!","August 17, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if it takes some time to get used to its peculiarities, like the odd ¾ side view, wonky physics bugs that make corpses or even entire ships dart off at missile-like speeds, and sometimes-questionable AI, it's still fun once you adapt, if you're one who enjoys 2D dig-em-up type games.\n\nSo, why can't I give it the old thumbs up? Well, it's not finished.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it is feature complete, for the most part – the main questline is functional and the game itself is “winnable”, but there are still bugs and crashes for the player base, and no consensus on their frequency. To top it off, the game seems more or less dead in the water, if not abandoned. While it was actively being worked on, the developers were involved with the forums here, but it seems either they've been tied up with other projects or moved on to greener pastures – neither of which give a good impression.\n\nWindforge is certainly an interesting take on 2D builder platforming, but in its current state, I can't justify a purchase in good faith.","October 26, 2015","false","65.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I zipped across to the ship as it blew my raft apart. While trying to kill the large crew another ship decides to attack the ship I just landed on! I'm getting fired on from all directions. The bullets fly fairly slow so Im dodging them, but its a lot of action and it's fun! So this crew is really putting the screws down on me when they accidentally ignite their own flamable oil drums.

I manage to kill the crew, repair the ship in mid air and survive an epic battle with so many unforeseeable hazards.\n\nThe steampunk world really fits and you are like this secret-agent-privateer who works with scientists and engineers to make even better equipment in their secret lab.

This angle helps with being able to see the action as it happens, but their is very little veriation in the zoom.\nI can also say that the frame rate is poor to average, droping sharply in many plot-critical locations.\nSpeaking of the plot, for much of the game it takes a back seat (if not stuffing itself into the trunk). While the charecter sets out with the noble goal of saving the world and socity as the world knows it, there is so little support by the in-game cast that one can forget the names of most characters, or that they even exist untill one has a quest to go talk to them. There are also so few quests that one can exsaust the side quests in an hour, and I will say that out of a 70+ hour play through, less than 6 hours were actual questing, of any kind at all. as such, one quickly devolves from an archeologist reaserching forbiden parts of the past and re-discovering world alering technolagy into an air pirate, plundering other ships to get the money for training, ammo, and other supplies, as well as ship components.\nAnother complaint, their is no good dry-dock avalable. In-town, there's just not a lot of space to work with, and out of town, one has to deal with wildlife and other ships while trying to build.\n\nThat said, I do enjoy game play. Being able to design, construct, and fly my own armed airship. I enjoy flying around, hunting down pieces of the past, trying to save the world. I love the effort that was put into this game. I love that onw has the freedom to go wherever and do whatever in this game. I even started a second play through to try and get the good toys earlier.\nI just still feel... I want to say disapointed, when I play this game. It feels like it could have become so much more, and for one reason or another, fell flat. It hurts even more when you can see how hard Snowed In tried on this. Its clear how much they wanted to do, and were unable to.\nBut what is here is a joy to play. It is an example of how a game can explore a world with a compleatly different makeup than our own, and even a wonder of its genre. I would strongly recomend it, even with all its flaws.\nMy Final Verdict: 5/10","March 12, 2014","true","250.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is reminescent of Terraria, with superior controls, but it lacks the depth and variety. The game has a great asthetic, but a few problems and glitches really rob the game of its potential. Key items (i.e. vulcan forge), manage to disappear from your inventory such that they can't be replaced. Occasionally, critical story elements are skipped and the story can't advance as a result. The penalty (or lack thereof) of dying seems to undermine the challenge of the game. Finally, the game could use a bit more variety: you'll run through nearly all of the random encounters possible on your first trip to a different city--well before you complete the game. Also, the weapons are quite redundant. Summary: the game has great potential, but its nearly too glitchy to finish, and lacks the substance needed to reach its potential.

Small things like grappling hooks make this game fun.\nMy main complaint is the lack of side-quests. Although you aren't forced to work on the main storyline, there isn't much else to do.

At release it was a mess but since then the developer has remained committed to their product and hammered out most of the real larger issue show stopping bugs and greatly improved performance.\n\nThe Positives.\nI really liked the core game-play of this game, I thought its concept is awesome, It's a lot of fun when the bugs and technical shortcomings do not get in the way.\n-Building and flying airships is fun, the concept of the game itself is fun.\n-The story is interesting.\n-Grappling hook action. Like grappling a dragon thing and riding around on it.\n-Lots of different armor, items, block and resource types, recipes to craft things, and weapons.\n-Mining resources, especially from the sky whales flying around in the environment.\n-Air combat is fun and satisfying, especially using artillery turrets on your foes.\n-Boss battles.\n-Hazards are fun. Meteorites in the upper layers, Acid rain in the lower areas. I would say the poison gas of the lower areas but that has a huge performance hit associated with it.\n-Ground combat is also pretty fun.\n\nThe Negatives (starting with the most prominent to minor irritations).\n-Garbage performance of 5-10 fps in the cloudy (trade route) region, and all of the lower poisonous gas regions where the fog effect is used. Making combat in these areas very difficult and as such a poor gaming experience.\n-Crash to Desktop, general freezing (happens every 2-3 hours roughly) Crashes have been greatly reduced with patches.\n-Poor save game system. On release there was no date and time listed on saved games, there still isn't at the moment, however they are now listed in order of date modified.\n-Enemy spawn rate is can be annoying. To the point where its hard to get anything done, like mining. They often spawn just off screen.\n-Forget building a base or an outpost. There is no way to designate safe areas outside of towns. Technically you could build a base, but enemies will continue to spawn inside it and wreak havoc.\n-No anchor/harpoon system. Airship constantly sinks regardless of how light or buoyant it is (Only on screen now, offscreen it stays put).  Often you come back and your airship has sunk either out of reach, or fallen out the bottom of the current map into the next. Since the last update: Your airship is anchor (frozen) off screen, and when at port in a town.\n-Repairs can be tedious, most of your time managing structural integrity. During the beginning of the game this isn’t an issue because the lower tier materials take no time to repair but once you make it to latter in game with better materials with more hp, repair becomes a very tedious task and to make things worse there is only one repair tool rather than multiple tiers like all the other tools have. In combination with the enemy spawn rates, even with the best materials repairing is a huge chore.\n-Zoom in-game can be annoying, there is no actual ability to zoom in or out at will through something like the mouse scroll wheel, it all depends on how far away from your character the cursor is. The farther out you zoom, the greater the impact to performance, especially in any of the fog areas.\n-Some of the physics are glitchy and annoying. Like being killed by your own airships hull when standing it it after a creature pushing on the outside has caused it to jump wildly up or downwards a huge amount.  this has been mostly if not completely fixed with patches.\n\nMy current verdict on the game is 7.5/10 (considering its an indie game with a lower budget and fair price)\n-Game-play core: good-very good\n-Graphics: average\n-Sound Quality: good\n-Art Style: good\n-Performance: Good. Still has issues but the bugs now are fairly minor. Could have benefited greatly by early access and larger base of Quality and Assurance Testers.\n\nWhat would my score be without the performance issues and bugs? Around a 7.5-8/10\nI think without the performance issues and bugs you would really enjoy this game.\n\nMy System (Understanding performance in terms of hardware):\nCPU: I7 4960x 3.6 ghz hex core\nRam: 16 GB Adata DDR 3 PC-19200\nHD (game also installed on besides OS) Adata SX900 256GB SSD\nGPU: EVGA 580GTX (performance in review with new 337.50 beta, and non-beta 335.23 drivers)\nOS: Windows 8.1 64bit","April 23, 2014","true","65.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The idea of being able to build your own airship and fly away sounds good, and the game itself is fun, even if the movement is a little glide-y, which makes some of the platforming a little difficult.\n\ntl;dr: don't buy it right now, wait for a sale and/or until they fix the crashing","July 15, 2014","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 2D contra-like combat is very fun, as is the mining and building. Some aspects of gameplay aren't obvious, and there is a bit of a learning curve (E.G. how to effectively kill a whale). The airships look a bit hoaky, as they are essentially flying houses. However they are still fun to build and design, as you have to worry about things such as power, bounyancy, and weight.  Small things like grappling hooks make this game fun.\nMy main complaint is the lack of side-quests. Although you aren't forced to work on the main storyline, there isn't much else to do. Most of the game consists of raiding temples, and occasionally gunning down bad guys. I would like to be able to build a town, raid an enemy base, or maybe even do some trading.\n","June 16, 2014","true","179.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I purchased this game in a bundle ($3.00 for a Humble Bundle of 4 games) and honestly can't believe that I never played this game sooner, or even really heard of it for that matter. As many of the reviews of this game state that there is crashing problems, and janky controls and such, as of today I have not encountered any of these issues. Not sure If I'd pay the $14.99 they are currently asking on steam (cause I'm cheap), but if you can manage to pick this up in a sale or bundle, do yourself favor. GET IT!\n\nThings I like:\n-Just the right amount of hardness (everything from enemies, to quests, to mining. It all has just the right amount of danger to make it challenging and fun.)\n-The freedom to build your own air ship ANY way you would like is just awesome. Most games don't come anywhere close to this much sandbox fun. Not to mention the thousands of approaches you can take to completing missions or fighting bosses. Drill through walls, build barriers, hijack ships, or take them head on.\n-Tons of items to craft, and weapons and items to collect.\n-The balance of weapons/leveling/health and such is spot on (So far)\n-Graphics are not the best, but they are decent, as is the audio.\n-Physics A+\n-The world and storyline are original and creative.\n\nThings I dislike:\n-Not much\n-Hatches can be quite annoying, and difficult to get through in panicky situations.\n-There is so much content that a more in depth tutorial is needed.\n-I wish they had a hardcore mode that enabled permadeath. Would make this game so effing hard! (but fun)\n-U.I. could be a bit more streamlined.","July 12, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Steampunk flying-island Terraria with airship combat.  Too bad it has no multi-player co-op, it'd be so perfect.  If you liked Terraria (personally, I loved it slavishly), then I STRONGLY RECOMMEND Windforge.\n\nAs with other games in the Terraria-clone genre, it has crafting and fighting and harvesting and so on, and all of that works well, although not necessarily better than any other game.  Crafting requires you to collect recipes in the world, which you could view as good or bad.\n\nThe questline/plot is entirely adequate, and the pacing of the plot is very good.  In particular, I always knew what to do next if I was bored with crafting/mining/whatever, but I was always free to go at my own pace.  But also, I was also never forced to stop following the plot to harvest resources.  This was really well-done game design (and rare!).  On the other hand, the plot itself, while above-average for the genre, wasn't amazing.  Really, it acted as an adequate skeleton to hang awesome gameplay on.\n\nAirship combat was really satisfying.  I admit, I descended into outright piracy for a while, as I gave in to the thrill of chasing, damaging, boarding, looting, and scuttling.  I'm not proud of what I became.  Well, except for rich.  I'm proud of the "rich" part of what I became.\n\nActually, speaking of becoming rich by doing things I'm not proud of, I'm also not entirely proud of the map segments where I strip-mined entire islands.  Like, removing entire islands, reducing them to their consituent parts, and selling them.  Lucrative as hell, though.\n\nI love games with grappling hooks, and this was a particularly good grappling hook.  Fond memories of the Worms ninja-rope were evoked, and amazing ninja-moves were executed (mostly by accident, but I'll still remember myself as a badass).\n\nI found the boss-fights pretty easy.  Although I did tend to over-prepare, which is what a game like this lets you do if you want to.  They were also not very different; the same strategy or two seemed to dominate every major fight.  It didn't feel bad, but boss fights were not as thrilling as ship-to-ship piracy.\n\nI sure wish it had multi-player co-op.  Ideally with harder challenges to match, especially harder enemy ships.  That'd be so freakin' awesome, holy hell.","January 13, 2015","true","99.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy that kind of game, you should like this game with a twist.  The twist that involves buildling airships and encounter flying whales.  Pretty interesting.

You would notice this when you are trying to make a precise movement such as getting out of a hole or the likes.\n\nWhile I do not recommend this game, but if you happen to own this game from a bundle like me, I do recommend giving the game a try.  I think it takes about an hour or 2 to feel the vibe of this game.
