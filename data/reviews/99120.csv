As a big on-rails shooter fan, I was vaguely looking forward to this, but it just plays so badly. Some interesting ideas, and it looks pretty good.\n\nI'd say one of the worst aspects, even if only a subtle one, is the player and the on-screen gameplay feel... kind of detatched, as if the player doesn't exist in the same world, almost as if it's simply a video in the back ground that you can vaguely interact with.\n\nAll in all it's just kind of mediocre. I knew it was going to be bad after hearing the reviews of the xbox 360 version, but... it's not even 'so bad it's good', just really really bland. Avoid.","June 22, 2014","false","0.7"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","0"

I really have to ask what kind of gamers are out there. I grew up playing panzer dragoon on the sega dreamcast. I been around gaming almost since it's infancy. Now a days it's about first person shooters anything else is subpar. What a shame. If you liked games like panzer dragoon or panzer dragoon orta you'll like Yar's Revenge. Rip off of original Yar's Reveng. Nothing to do with the original. Thank goodness. The original does not look this good nor play this well. To compare the both is like comparing a calculator to a ps vita.\n\nProblems-It's locked at 30fps. Go to ini and change to 60 fps.\nNot at 1080, same thing. Unluck in ini in the steam folder. Not full screen. You get the picture.\nWent to nvidia settings and set it at SLI 16x CSAA. Why? Because I could.....PCMR.","September 29, 2015","true","1.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","12","14","3","0"

This is a dual-analog on-rails shoot-em-up that's easy to pick up. The soundtrack is actually really good.\n\nAlas, I don't think this game is worth $10. Be sure to keep an eye on it during the Steam sales, though.","February 16, 2014","true","2.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Yar's Revenge was an attempt to bring back an old Atari character as a rail shooter, and it just isn't successful. I can't put my finger on exactly why, but it's just not fun. It's not just a case of fondly remembering a genre as better than it actually was, because the Panzer Dragoon games are still a lot of fun. I can't recommend Yar's Revenge to anyone.","January 20","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Was looking for a game like this. Lots of nice visuals. I like the concept of the game.\n\nWould have been fun if the mouse controller did not over compensate my movements. If I tried to move quick, the target would slam from one side to the other. If I moved slow, I didn't get enough movement. I just did not feel I had control during the game. Not like in the menu. The game play controls with the mouse didn't feel right to me.\n\nIf the game works with a game pad, I will give that a try, I don't remember seeing settings for that though.\n\nSome like the game, I don't recommend it, but that is do to my experience with it.\nTo me, even the old StarFox on the SNES is better. The controls is real nice on that game.\n\nThe intro looked good, though ran a little to fast for me to read what was being said. I would have to grab screen captures stills and read form those.\n\nOver all, not horrible, but I couldn't play well.\n\nextra:\n\nJust tried this with a control pad. The GameStop Afterglow PS3/PC controler. And it worked! And the game controled like a dream. For one time.\n\nOn the first try, the mane gun fierd by pressing the right stick button. this I did not like. It was the only thing I did not like. Otherwise it played great! Better than expected.\n\nThen I met with a porb. I tried to configuer the controler with in steam, and the controler was no longet reconised by the game, as a frist player controler. With the right triger, it stared player two. And I could move player two, but I had no wepons for player two.\n\nSo in short, this game has hidden functions for game pad control, not avalable in any settup within any options. This game seriously needs that!\n\nI feel this game would rock, if it was fixed with options to not only configuer the keybord controls, but also updare the game with the option to use a game pad, and alow configueration of the game pad as well.\n\nIf this game is ever updated so the game pad can be fully used, I will not feel like I wasted my money on this game, and would fully suport giving this game a big thumbs up!","March 8","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Story was interesting, though trying to follow some of the conversations during gameplay can be a little rough at times. Overall though, I found it to be decent.\n\nMain complaint was the controls. Definetely easier with a keyboard then a controller, though would be nice if we could map things ourselves (options seem to indicate so, but I couldn't get it working). Also, getting the game started took some configuring, though in the end, I don't think any of the tweaks actually carried over.\n\nOver all a decent game, though not worth it's full price with its issues. Would recommend it if you can get it on sale.","October 6, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
