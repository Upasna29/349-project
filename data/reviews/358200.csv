"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/358200/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","Math Rescue is a game training children to simple operations (addition, substraction, multiplication and division) and to problems (involving these). You take the control of a young kid (boy or girl) in a world where invaders stole numbers. It's up to you to restore the order of the world by solving questions. Enemies will stand in your way, use the slime to keep them out of the way!\n\nBehind this platformer game, you find a serious content: 2+2, 30:5, 8x6,10-3, etc.. In other words, to finish a level you have to answer 10 questions right. Answer wrong and an enemy will appear. You should know that there is 20 questions lying around, with secret areas, with dangers like pits or sharks or simply to get out of lids (which is representing your file). If you run out of lids or fall into a pit, you're taken back to the beginning of the level, loosing all the progress you've made.\n\nThat's why the game can become a little harder if you want the bonus.... For example, answering in order from 0 to 9 will give a bonus point. Or answering the question that's shown at the bottom of the screen by hitting the right truck (else you'll loose a lid) is also a nice add. Gathering all the items (books, ships, ice creams, smileys, etc..) will also improve your score.\n\nMath Rescue adds challenge in that way and it's a nice incentive for children to train their knowledge in maths. Even for an adult, it should do the trick. The best option that the game offers is the customization: choose the difficulty according to the children's age, choose if you want to mix the operations or not (Episode 2 and 3 have all of them, contrary to Episode 1) and choose if you want problems with words for all questions or half of them or none at all. And that option alone is interesting for anyone that would have an hard time in English. The game isn't translated and so, if you're not an English native speaker or your kid isn't, the problems will not be solved easily.\n\nMath Rescue is an old game. It's been developed a long time ago (requiring dosbox is showing you that it has some age). So the graphics are also from that age. They're colorful without so much nuances, the font used is characteristic from that age. The soundtrack is cheerful.\n\nThe commands are also easy to use, albeit if you have an azerty keyboard, the game isn't adapted for it. The only time I needed to think in qwerty was to close the game (asking to press Q to quit - however, with azerty, you have to press a).\n\nI can recommend easily this game to anyone wanting a math game for the children. While it's not the one I've played when I was a kid, I would have probably enjoyed this one. By the way, the game comes with the three episodes set in different worlds (in space, in candy land and under the sea), so, it's a nice change of scenery. True, you can find the original files for free around (and manage by yourself installation, dos-box and anything else, like I did when Colonization could be found as an abandonware) - I even found a site where you can play it in your browser. You can choose the version you want after all, it does not change anything for the game in itself: a good gem.\n\nPS: Yeah, I got the key to the 3D Realms Anthology in a bundle, enabling the possibility to play Math Rescue. And I would do it again, because I needed that game to test it because of my work in digital education.","January 11","true","1.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

Very good options for allowing kids to practice on their skill level.\n\nIt also saves a players name so you can go back with logging in with that name.\n\nFor a 25 year old game, it did it's job of letting my kids practice math and have fun.\n\nOne of my kids that hates doing math home work at the table played this fo 2 hours strait and I could see her getting better at figuring out what a word problem was asking.\n\nSo if you are thinking about picking this game up on sale for kids to play it holds up well and honestly seems to be much better than the word rescue game (but I only tried the first level of that one and felt it was very basic with picture matching, where this game let me set the difficulty to the child)\n\nSo is it worth $20, no way. But it is one of those perfect games to pick up for $1 or so.","May 10, 2015","true","2.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"
