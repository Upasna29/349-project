If something looks good in game then I will try to make it myself and if something is really hard to make in game then.. I won't even bother, haha! I liked this game because there were many recipes I had not even heard of and I ended up trying them really and they were very good. On down side the game needs fast mouse movement in pattern so it can be tiring if you have injury on your arm like I do. Good past time but price is too high for how short it is. Good thing I got it from auction!","December 30, 2014","true","22.1"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","24","29","5","0"
