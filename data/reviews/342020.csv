"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/342020/","gog-protoss","Protoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/","4009 products in account","What is BiT Evolution?\n\nBiT Evolution is a platformer that starts out in the style of an Atari game, then changes to Game Boy, NES and finally SNES style. Throughout the game you have 12+12+18+18 levels, boss fights excluded. Each level holds 20 pixels. The clou about this is that the protagonist changed between two planes, and in each plane there are some pixels.\n\nThe graphics are fitting for the systems they try to represent, although as the developer admits in the forums, liberties were taken when those enhanced the gameplay. As an example there is no sprite flickering in this game, rather the graphics feel smooth and with each system different.\n\nThe sound is the usual for platformers, but the background music is excellent. Most of the music can be heard on Soundcloud, the link is https://soundcloud.com/major-games - but not everything. An especially catchy tune from the levels 4-10 to 4-12 is missing from there, yet it should provide a great opportunity to hear the music style.\n\nThe game can be played entirely with a controller, which I did. The protagonist has different jumping patterns for each simulated system. There are two special abilities for the hero as well, learnt or found over the course of the game. The first one is rolling, which like in Metroid makes the character one "square" high. Rolling can be used as a weapon against some enemies, others can be defeated by jumping on their head, others not at all. The other one is to glide, enabling easier jumping as well as being necessary to advance at certain points.\nThe main point of the gameplay is the ability to change between two planes of existence: In the rendered world, the hero BiT must be hit by an enemy to get into the world of code. There he must find a portal to return to the rendered world. While the beginning and end of each level are in the rendered world, more than only a few times is it necessary to switch between the worlds to advance through levels. There are numerous collectibles, called Pixels - 20 in each level, to be exact - which are spread between the two planes. If one does not hunt those, the game loses most of its fun, Many pixels pose a mini-challenge to get to them, such as letting oneself get hit in the right spot or rarely navigate through a tight jump or two, but most are just spread around and wait to be found.\nAfter the game is beat, which takes around 3 hours without and probably around 9 hours with pixel hunting, a challenge mode opens. I only played 20 levels in it, enough to get the final achievements, but from what I saw so far it also has different concepts of challenge in each world. The Atari world is flooded with enemies while the Game Boy world rather demands dexterity when jumping.\nWhile throughout the main game there is a checkpoint in each level and getting hit in the world of code means being set back to the checkpoint once passed, the checkpoint is not present in the challenge mode. Some of the challenge levels require frustration tolerance, but by the short length of them the difficulty is comparable to some easier Super Meat Boy levels - always possible, but sometimes only after knowing what to do, after learning the timing.\nA great thing is that you can enter beaten levels at any time again from the world map. In the challenge mode, all levels are unlocked so they can be played in any order.\n\nAll in all, what remains is a Jump'n'Run that has obvious flaws, thereby can't be recommended to everyone. Only those who go for 100 percent completion, who want to hunt all the pixels, get all the gold stars and Steam achievements will get the most out of the game. Those who just look to rush through will have 60 levels of rather short length. For those looking to play through everything the levels might seem too many at times, but playing in short bursts at the own leisure redeems this. Speedrunners also might find the game attractive since levels are short and can be replayed easily at any time, although pixels once collected will remain collected even upon death or beating a level.\n\nRecommended: Mainly for completionists who want to get every hidden/difficult pixel and those enjoying a pseudo-nostalgia trip with quirky humor, otherwise for people who play in short bursts over several sessions.","October 6, 2015","true","9.9"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

It didn't take very long for my brain to go on auto pilot while playing through the first world. No sense of momentum makes movement precise, but also boring. The code world that you go to when you die is interesting in concept, but doesn't add much to the game besides lengthening the mind numbing levels.\n\nNeedless to say, this game isn't worth $9.99 by a long shot.

There are times where obstacles block your path, and you have to take damage and go to the "Realm of Code" to get past them.","February 10, 2015","true","2.2"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","19","32","0","0"

On the one hand, it reminds me of the old times. On the other it bores me out of my mind.\nI played to the second world and the only thing I wanted to do is quit the game.\nIf there were a good story, enjoyable gameplay elements or a way to spend your collected pixels, it would be much more interesting.\n\nI started by collecting every pixel in the first 5 levels but I felt that it wasn't worth the effort. It just made the level longer without giving me a reward (besides the achievements). So I just went from level to level, without bothering about the enemies because they were no threat. I did this until world 2, level 4. At this point I couldn't stand playing it any longer.\nThere is nothing I could do but walk. No special moves, no attacks. Even the first Mario could do better, he had a hammer. The first Kirby could fly and use enemies as power ups. But BiT only can jump and walk.\nEven the Rendered World / Code World idea is dull. The Code World has faster and therefore slightly harder enemies and looks green. That's it. You need to jump between these worlds to get all the collectible pixels and sometimes to get to the exit of the level. But there is really nothing to it.\nAlso, jumping sometimes feels unresponsive. In certain situations my character didn't respond to the jump button. But maybe it's just me.\n\nSomething I really enjoyed was the humorous dialog. Especially after beating the first world.\n\nOverall I felt really disappointed about his game.","June 24, 2015","false","2.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paragus/recommended/342020/","paragus","Paragus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paragus/","180 products in account","It's a very generic platformer, maybe too generic.  The game had potential, but ultimately it fell flat for me.  When I first started playing I was trying to collect all the pixels in each stage, then I realized they serve no purpose excpt for getting an achievement.   I feel like it was such a wasted chance to add some depth to a game that desperately needed something more to make it stand out.  Since half of the game revolves around an alternate area where a lot of them are hidden, why squander literally half of your game by having it serve no value other than a weird gimmick that trivializes death.\n\nOnce you come to the point where you stop caring about collecting the pixels in each stage, which for me was halfway through world 1, you just start running through mediocre platforming stages.   Every now and then they introduce a new mechanic, but they feel like an afterthought more than something interesting that has to be mastered in a meaningful way.   The entire thing comes off as a novelty and many of them end up trivializing already trivial stages that can be blown through in a minute or less by anyone with a semblance of skill.\n\nThere are some boss fights, most of them are pretty mindless.   The 3rd boss in particular seems woefully out of place because of a certain part where the boss will randomly catch you in a chase sequence near the end.   After finally beating it without knowing why it didn't glitch out, the game gave me the achievement for winning, then glitched out again making me repeat it.   I was glad to be done with it when it was over, only to find out the final boss makes you refight all the other bosses all over agin.   It's just a bunch of tedious filler crap at the end to try to boost up a painfully easy final boss.\n\nThe entire experience took me around 2 hours, and I could have done it a lot faster if I hadn't wasted time collecting pixels in the start.   It's not worth $10,  maybe if it's on sale for 75% it MIGHT be worth picking up.   There's better made platformers on steam for a lot less than this that offer far more in terms of gameplay and level design.","July 13, 2015","false","2.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/342020/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Summary:\n\nIt definitely plays to the nostalgic feelings that those of the NES, SNES, and Gameboy eras will remember, and it does that well while bringing an unexpected twist to what you'd expect another 8/16 bit platformer to have. This game is more so for people who like to collect, as the main draw in my mind is the ability to switch between worlds, and optimizing your ways of collecting the 20 bits per level. It's obvious that the designers and programmers were heavily influenced by the games of old, and it shows with great use of nostalgic material and little touches here and there to really play on that. While this doesn't stand out in the platforming section and seems like it could be between in 3-4 hours or less, it's a game that does something just different enough to really work with the genre in question, and is definitely worth a look within the genre.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video First Impressions: http://youtu.be/gSKXq7BvhZI\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nCollecting elements of the game challenges your use of environment and the ability to traverse it, which makes it stand out from other 8 bit platformers.\nHandles nostalgic elements and the idea of the graphics evolution very well, and knows its subject matter quite well.\nDoes something rare: making a nostalgic game but with a different theme of gameplay.\nEach worlds theme and music suits the feeling of the old systems without entirely LOOKING like those old games.\nControls are responsive and are exactly what is needed for a game like this. Perfect for the controller, but keyboard works just fine as well.\n-:\nIn terms of the actual platforming, rather basic, and nothing that stands out on that end in terms of the basic gameplay that underlies the game.\nDoesn't Punish the player enough for mistakes. Would have been nice to see that deaths took away earned pixels up to that point.","June 10, 2015","true","2.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It's a platformer that aims to be a nostalgia trip... or something like that. You need to jump and walk to get to the exit. Sometimes there will be enemies that you can jump on. Their behavior consists of walking and standing still. Exciting, right? The most exciting thing about this game is the ability to go to a code world. Remember the dark world from A Link to the Past? It's basically that, except in order to go there, you must die. In many levels, traveling to the code world is necessary to bypass obstacles. You can return to the "rendered world" by touching a portal. Oh, there are enemies in the code world too. If you die there, you are returned to the last checkpoint in the rendered world.\n\nThere are these little yellow pixels (green in the second world, that's as far as I got) scattered throughout levels.

I know there are plenty of games I could list by comparison that are probably better games, however, I think the developer did a great job in recreating that feel of the genre with a twist of their own.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/h-GnE7yVDfE\n\nPretty straight forward in it's approach 'BiT Evolution' drops you into the first world where you must jump from platform to platform. Jumping on top of enemies kills them and just about everything can kill you.\n\nFor instance, the first jump you attempt to make is impossible. There is a good reason though and why I like this game. Whenever you die you are teleported to an alternate dimension that is parallel to the world you are playing. If you die in this world, however, you will reset to the beginning of the world or the last checkpoint.\n\nAs you play, each level picked from an overworld map has 20 pixels that you must collect. You will fight your way through the generations of platformers from Atari to Nintendo, from the 70's to the 90's. So you will see levels that remind you of Mario and Mega-Man, and many others.\n\nBiT Evolution is a well done game that is the 2D platformer version of the rpg hit 'Evoland' and well worth the playthrough.

I own at least 100 games and depleted finances (thanks Steam) but unfortunately am too busy to play them all. I picked this up so I could keep my gaming skills from getting rusty. I could definitely say that even though I could afford to play short 10 minute sessions of this game occasionally, those 10 minutes were very immersive and nostalgic.\nIt's been a while since I've played a platformer, and the retro style definitely adds to the atmosphere of the game. There's enough challenge to spur you to learn, adapt, and to overcome just like a video game is supposed to do.\nIt's satisfying to comlete a level and move on, with just the right amount of humor in the game to keep you immersed.\nI will post a further update as I progress throughout the game.","September 21, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some of the soundtrack is pretty good. This doesn't make up for the boring gameplay and glitches (I'm looking at you, Boss 3). Too much time spent backtracking through the digital world and the boring as hell boss fights. The last boss fight has you just dodging EXTREMELY SLOW projectiles, followed by a rehash of the first three bosses.","March 17","false","10.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Lots of games use this old school art style, simple pixels nowadays and call themselves a retro game. However, many are failed attempts tryhing to make a quck buck off the popularity that this genre of games has the past few years.\n\nThis one is one of the better ones. The graphics change throughout the game from the old atari look up to more modern graphics such as NES, SNES, and so on. The music also changes the same way. All of it is done well.\n\nThe controls are tight, responsive, jumps all feel how they should. The enemies are a godo challenge and so are the jumps and other various platforming challenges.\n\nI like the overworld map, it reminds me of games such as super mario world. When you "die" in the normal levels in this game, instead of just dying, it takes you to a green world where you get a chance to revive yourself and get back to the actual game world. Its like different dimensions, an interesting concept and makes the game a little forgiving which is nice.\n\nOverall, I think it is one of the games you shoudl get if you like these 8-16 bit retro games, it feels like you are playing one of your old time favorites from back in the day and the controls make it an enjoyable experience.","August 7, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

A challenging, but not unforgiving, platformer.  Interesting, if not entirely original, concept.  Solid, if traditional, controls.  Being in Early Access (Really?  You guys just couldn't make the full game and release it?), there's not very much content, but it seems as though more content will be added.  For what you're getting, maybe the price is a bit steep (yeah, there's not much), but hey, check it out in a couple months, maybe?  It addds together to make A fun, if forgettable, way to spend an hour or two, though maybe, hopefully, more in the future.","February 22, 2015","true","0.3"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"

An indie platformer that displays tge differents ages of game changing along the eras the design of the stages and the age of your character with a interesting gameplay that allows you change between two dimensions in the same stage, this is noting completely innovative but it is cool and in 2D even better. The story have to be continued by the devs but so far I liked a lot.\nThumbs up!","May 9, 2015","true","22.0"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","0"
