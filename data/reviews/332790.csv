Unfortunately it has a ton of issues:\n\nThe translation is pretty bad. The developers are Russian and there's a ton of spoken and written Engrish. The main character repeats the same lines over and over whenever you pick up an item. They should've kept the original Russian voices and gotten someone else to translate the text.\n\nThe level design is awful, the first three levels are nothing but mazes with almost identical rooms. There's a radar on the screen but it only shows you and enemies as dots and nothing more. There should've been a map system that slowly uncovers the level as you move through it since they involve searching for items and, as it stands, you'll spend a lot of time running in circles searching for the last Document you need because everything looks the same.\n\nThe game tells you to conserve ammo, yet the levels are so narrow that if you try to run past enemies you will get hurt. The only way through is to shoot them.\n\nUnless this changes later on in the game the only enemy types are identical zombies that attack you once they get close.\n\nUnlike most cheap Steam games these days playing it shows that the developers tried to make a good game, but it's way too flawed for me to recommend it.","February 7, 2015","false","0.6"," 79 of 94 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","79","94","4","3"

It can hardly even be called survival horror as you find like 2 dozen batteries and only end up using 1 even though the place is bright enough to see everything for the entirety of the game anyway!  Just a pointless attempt to make it seem like it has more going on in it than it actually does.  Ammo is plentiful as well, as are health packs.\n\nGameplay is horrid.  Walk down samey-looking murky corridors, aim at shambling enemies, shoot and move on.  Your biggest enemy is getting caught on the furniture while trying to backpedal from your foes.  I didn't think the levels were hard to find your way around as some have reported but maybe the map feature is new, which really does help, particularly in the third and arguably most winding level.  The aim and shoot feature is horribly bugged, often needing to press fire several times to get one shot off.  Even the ending is complete anti-climax.  Not even a boss fight.  You just kill some more of the guys you've been killing and walk down a corridor and then the final cutscene rolls.\n\nTook 49 minutes from start to finish and even at that I was getting bored.  All dialogue and found document text is complete gobbledygook.  From what I could make out it seemed like the usual mad-scientist-abducts-people-and-experiments-on-them-to-create-zombie-mutants.  Cause why not.\n\nAvoid like the zombie plague.","August 20, 2015","false","0.8"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","28","32","2","0"

Though after 3 levels I still don't know where exactly the flashlight comes in now.\nThe guns sound like they were filled with blanks and there is no sound on impact.\n\nOnly performancewise the game is nicely done, with getting 60+ fps consitently.\n\nThe aforementioned facts are the most horrifiing things in this game, I am not joking. The zombies and other enemies as well as the ambient sounds are even less frightening than the Military Quater in Naxxramas in WoW... and that wasn't even that frightening to begin with.\n\nConclusions: I cannot, by any means, recommend this game. In the first three levels I felt absolutely no fear, which is the point in horror game in my opinion. Apart from that it looks and plays like a budget game, but money is not the problem here. It is the fact that this game takes time to play and I wouldn't dedicate any more time to that game than I did for this review.\n\nFirst impressions video is here: http://youtu.be/v9N9WIQ2nus","February 7, 2015","false","1.4"," 51 of 72 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","51","72","5","0"

Just downright horrible.\n\n- There's hardly any zombies in the game. Kill a couple at most and then waste your time wondering about the maze like corridors.\n- It's pretty short. In the short length of time it'll take you to finish, there's nothing scary at all. The game completely fails at providing even an adequate "horror" atmosphere. If anything, it becomes a comedy with all the poorly translated (the devs are Russian) dialogue and documents.\n- There's not much in the way of weapons as they all feel the same.\n- The whole point of the game is to not only escape from the dungeon you're in, but to find out why you're there. Turns out the game decides not to tell you that, and instead just ends abruptly. The devs have no plans to make a sequel (they explictly said this on the discussion section), so if you're wondering why Katrine (the character's name) is where she is, just use your imagination.\n- Not much in the way of enemies. I know I mentioned the lack of my zombies at my first point, but really this is a big problem. There's literally nobody here but you. What kind of horror game has no monsters?\n- There's just nothing to see or do here. It's devoid of any sort of immersion factor.

The worst thing about this game was the camera angle; it was set at something like a 45 degree behind the character, looking down towards the floor. It gave my neck an odd sensation from trying to look ahead all the time towards the area out of view (the cost to fix my neck by a physiotherapist would cost way more than the game is worth).\nWhy, for pity's sake, why? Either use a top-down setting with a wide view, or a first person setting so you can look straight ahead. This lame-brain notion, that looking down at the floor all the time is a good idea for a game setting, is rubbish.\n\nSpeaking of rubbish, the developers should have found someone who can speak English properly to write the dialogue and text boxes. The dialogue was understandable, but poor. Not the developer's fault if English isn't their first language, but they should have hired a reputable interpreter to cover that aspect of their production.\n\nThere was probably a lot more wrong with the game, but I didn't hang around to find out.\n\nSorry, but I found this game a real trial to play. So I stopped, rather than inflict any more damage upon myself.\nI may try Darkness Assault at some later stage, once my neck has recovered, but don't hold your breath.\nThis game gets a thumbs down from me.","May 16","false","0.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

There are only three kinds of enemies (clones, fast clones, humans). There are just three save slots. The English version is atrocious. As a translator, I find this level of localisation absolutely disgusting. The "voice actors" obviously don't speak English themselves.\n\nOn the plus side, you can get a perfect game in about 1-2 hours (depending on whether you miss any weapons, which fact will require you to replay the game — yes, the whole game — as you can't just jump to the level of your choice), and there are trading cards.","May 29","false","3.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

The game has a murky atmosphere which I feel enhances the game, although can make it look quite ugly. Sounds are pretty good too. At the very start, the game is tough, but once you get hold of a weapon, it becomes quite easy. Looking at the dev notes, they have taken away a reload feature - that would have definitely made it more challenging! Lots of people have complained about the maze-like levels and the frustration this causes - I actually think that added to the challenge. Controls were a little clunky on my laptop, but probably more workable on a normal keyboard. The ending was a little disappointing (setting up a sequel?) but overall, enjoyed it.\n\n+ Good atmosphere\n+ Challenging navigation\n+ Trading cards (actually sold them for a profit on the game!)\n\n- A little ugly\n- Short\n- Needs some difficulty levels as default has too many items to help.\n- Two of the achievements are pointless: die once is OK, but for 10 and 25 times, a bit ridiculous.","June 2, 2015","true","1.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

There is so much i dont like about this "game". The 3rd person top down idea is a nice style which has been tried and tested, but this game fell short. The map felt zoomed in at all times, you could not control the fixed angle or extend the distance. The lighting was horrid, i understand the game is called "Darkness Assault" so pun, but bad design is a thing regardless. The options menu is horribly lacking when it comes to flexability. The game is playable with certain DLC packs, but vanilla it is a terrible "survivor horror" cliche, with the Guns DLC it is a bad "3rd person action" cliche.\n\nThe game itself has a whopping 5 acts, with no big final battle, the story is confusing and feeds you nothing unless you open menus and read scraps of paper. Starts out a zombie clone game, became a cop killing game about locating professors. IMO, the only thing this game has going for it, is the rather small achievement pool and badge progression. It isnt the worst looking game out there, but the controlls are so terrible. So terrible. Straifing is a chore and combat is....well you can shoot.

It is budget titles and this is apparent through the entire game. If you enjoy the genre in general and don't mind low budget titles, it is worth the extremely low price.\n\nGoing into this game you can expect the basic survival horror elements. You will hunt for keys, weapons, ammo and health all while killing (and/or avoiding) enemies. The enemies move relatively slow and are easy to dispatch when properly equipped. The biggest challenge in this game is navigating through each level as they are basically large mazes. I actually felt a small sense of accomplishment, equivalent to solving a puzzle, each time I found the end of the levels. The game does have a nice atmosphere and some decent sound effects for such a low budget title.\n\nThere are also documents you can find while exploring to fill you in on the story, which aside from these findings and a small non-cinematic thing at the beginning of each level, is basically non-existent. The story has potential, it is just not explored in enough detail; it is hardly explored at all. You can finish the entire story in about 2 hours and there isn't much in the way of replay value.\n\nI give this game a 5/10 mostly for the very low price. I can only recommend it to fans of the survival horror genre. The game is set up for a sequel and if priced similarly I will likely purchase it.","April 23, 2015","true","2.8"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","14","30","3","0"

There are 5 levels, three of which are the basement ones, and the rest of the game takes place above them (sorry for not being too specific, but I don't want to spoil). It took me 3 hours to have it finished, but I had fun and sometimes (late night) scarry sounds even thrilled me a bit.\nI would recommend this game if you can get it on sale, which does not mean it's bad, but short. I think at the end of the game the devs even suggested the next part to come (?).\nAnd one tip regarding the map - it is available for the first three levels, but you can only access it from the documents menu (by pressing ESC), which should be somehow changed and have some key assigned (maybe 'M'?).","April 30, 2015","true","3.2"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"

Or for the traders + achievement hunters out there.\nOn the other hand you can clearly see just in the intro sequence that this is just low budget and not a game for people, who just wanna play good + ambitious games.\n\nMy personal tip: Buy it in the big bundle like me: http://www.flyingbundle.com/ ;)","May 31, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I liked the cut scenes during the chapter's. the voices were a little bad because you guys dont have a proper english talker's so it was a little hard to hear them sometimes so i just relied on the subtitle's.\n\nPro's:\nIt's a decent looking game.\nCut scene's are pretty cool to watch.\nMost of the steam achievement's can be done in about an hour of gameplay.\n\nCon's:\nThe camera is locked on in a stupid way. (wish it just had first or third person view instead of a bird/third hybrid view)\n2 of the achievements are just a pain to get xD\nSlow walking. (perfect for the first three chapter's then it's just annoying how slow you are on the fourth chapter)\nNot enough ammo for the gun/s\n\nRating: 5/10\nJust small problems that could be fixed.\nI would always run out of ammo trying to kill the gaurds cause i cant run away from them forever. they were EVERYWHERE!!!!","November 21, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
