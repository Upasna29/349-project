But for some reason, it wanted me to buy it. At first I thought of it as a mix between Audiosurf and Bit Trip Runner.\n\nMy guess was not far off.\n\nThe style of gameplay they chose reminds me of DDR with the WASD keys, and arrow keys being used. The keys are color coded for W (Orange), S (Green), A (Blue), and D (Pink). You also use the directional keys in Intense mode (where you use both WASD and Up/Down/Left/Right). The music analysis does a good job of deciding how it determines the beat of the music (Tempo, Energy Spikes, etc). It also displays how stable/unstable the song is based on the rhythm and beat. Some songs are match well, some you will noticed that the beat is not perfect. But for a music game to be able to adapt to that, I'll praise that.\n\nThe movement between different actions you have to perform is very fluid, and the speed varies with how fast and intense your song is. One song may be slow and easy to pick up, another song you may find yourself flailing your fingers on the keyboard hoping to hit something. One of the complaints I have is that there is quite a bit of motion blur when the music is fast, making it sometimes difficult to see what is coming up next. I don't think the blur is so much the game as it could be the monitor (I'm running on a 60Hz).\n\nThe timing is iffy at best, as it seems to either want to be Good or Perfect. It's difficult to determine where the best spot to execute the action is, but given it is an Early Access Game, I'll let that slide and hope it is better refined.\n\nThe game changes from running on the ground, to flying in the air, which is kind of cool. I do think that the transition from the ground to the air can be very sudden sometimes, which may make you miss a hit. Otherwise the flying is very similar. You either press the corresponding key, or hold the corresponding key.\n\nOverall, I found myself playing the game with my music collection, and I enjoyed it. All the way from Sonata Arctica, to Pendulum, and more. The amount of colors and eye candy in this game make it very appealing.  But do becareful, if you play for a long time, you may get eye strain and a headache from all the fast movement. What do you expect from a side scrolling rhythm game anyways?\n\nI highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys listening to music, and who also enjoys playing along with their music and chiming in with the beat.\n\nI know I will be sinking a bit of time into this game.","February 26, 2014","true","14.2"," 82 of 86 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","82","86","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ValkyrieIsland/recommended/270210/","ValkyrieIsland","ValkyrieIsland","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ValkyrieIsland/","315 products in account","I really love the idea behind Melody's Escape.  I can tell there was a lot of work into trying to get a working level generator like audio surf, but in a more interactive and vibrant way.  The game is a step in the right direction, but it really just doesn't work yet.\n\nBefore I go on I'd like to mention that, yes, I had VSYNC disabled and I'd recommend anyone else playing the game to disable it, as VSYNC will butcher any chances of proper on-beat gameplay.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the songs that I personally tried to play just didn't sync up in an enjoyable way.  A few of the songs I tried were:\n\nShirobon - Regain Control (this song actually worked exactly how I thought the game should function, but was the only song to really do so, for me anyway)\nMystery Skulls - Magic Animatic\nRage Awakened - Kingdom Hearts 2.5 OST\nHataraku Maou-sama! - The Devil is a Part Timer OST\nDog of Wisdom Remix (Blue Version) - The Living Tombstone\n\nThe main issue with the songs is that half the time, there was on-beat gameplay and it felt great, and the other half I couldn't tell what the program was trying to get me to tap to.  The synchronization software seems to work better with songs that have slower, defined beats.  That way, the game can recognize shifts in the song and adjust the visuals accordingly.  However, even in those slow songs, sometimes I couldn't discern if the beats for me to tap were going along with the song's actual beat, or the vocals.  So, in my experience, slower songs sort of work, and fast songs just don't work.\n\nThe level builder in Melody's Escape does very good at attempting this synchronization, however, and is probably the best I've seen so far, so I have to give it that.  But, the reason I just can't recommend it is because it just doesn't work as well as one would expect it to.\n\nThe gameplay itself is entertaining at first but quickly becomes more tedious than relaxing, primarily due to the fact that, as I said, most songs aren't actually properly to the beat.  I understand that the gameplay is more of an aid for a visual experience than an actual fleshed out game itself, but in that respect I still can't say it's very good feeling to me.  If the goal is for visuals to shift in tune with the music, then I don't believe that's been achieved.  This is very, very close, but it's not there yet.\n\nOverall, I don't hate Melody's Escape.  In fact, I really like it a lot.  But, it just doesn't play the way that I'd hoped.  Maybe in the future the game will perform better with personal music, but until then I'd wait on purchasing it.","May 21","false","1.1"," 193 of 248 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","193","248","5","27"

I am just loving this game but you must have music to play the game. I have some music on a usb stick that I recorded from music CD's I have, and when its asks which file, I just go to E drive and they all come up in the list only I dont have my songs named. I love the Mods you can subscribe to for free, so you can change Melody in many differant ways to your desired taste.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531091559&tscn=1444201118\n\nThe game is not always easy to master but not hard to learn, and I play the game using  my Xbox controller, which works very well. I just play on relaxed as for me thats the easiest to start with till I get more use to the game. I do tend to crash poor melody in to obsticals or she falls of a cliff, as I dont always hit the desired key or direction on time and sometimes it does not always respond to commands but that could be my fault as timing is crucial in this game.\n\nEach song gives a differant course of obsticals, but I have noticed for me that the same song gives the same pattern of obsticals every time I play so I can practice and get better with just 1 song.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531091974\n\nIts a very nice game to play if you have an hour to spare or you just want to listen to some music and keep occupied at the same time. I have never seen this game so cheap before at 50% off and to me It was worth every cent. ♥\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531091282\n\nI have absolutely no regrets buying Melodys Escape, its a must have if you enjoy music and dont mind a female character to acompany you through the obstacles, while listening to your favourite music. ♥\n\nWho Knows maybe the developer can add a Male Character as well, later on. This would be great, they could even maybe add some differant Animals to choose from to, this will give the game a nice twist and more interesting I think anyway.\n\n\nAnyway I love this game, Im so glad I purchased it. :D\n\n( To the developers )  Keep up the great work with this game, and I hope you consider adding some more characters to this game, in the future. ;)","October 6, 2015","true","5.7"," 47 of 50 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","47","50","0","10"

I'm NOT a twitch gamer. I thought the idea of being able to mash buttons in time to my own music was a cool idea and the graphics and art style of Melody's Escape speak to me. That said, I enjoy . . . harder music. Not death or speed metal (or really metal at all), but more of the post-hardcore, Vans Warped Tour band list variety. And herein lies my dilemna.\n\nThe game itself is fun and pretty to look at, in it's minimalistic way. But, with my own music imported, something feels . . . off.  I don't understand the reasoning (or even the rhythm) behind when I am to hit, tap, hold, etc the buttons for my songs.  It feels random, and worse so: off-beat.  Now, I understand that this is likely largely in part due to my music selections. But, that's what I want to play.\n\nWhen I tap on beat to the song and I get offsync somehow with "error" or "too late" messages, I get a little frustrated. (BTW, I've been a drummer for over 25 years so I'm perfectly capable of keeping time). I know it's a game, and ultimately the score doesn't really matter, but to me - this does.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I enjoy the game in small doses, but until I get the feeling of actually playing my music (instead of a random level kinda-sorta timed to my music in parts, possibly . . . maybe . . .) I cannot recommend it.  At least not at full price.\n\nCool minimalistic art style\nAbility to import songs saved onto your HD\nSyncopation and timing issues that just feel "off" (at times)\nSeemingly randomized levels (at times)","May 26","false","1.3"," 69 of 87 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","69","87","3","9"

I would constantly mess up due to delays and frame-rates, and it really broke the fun for me.\nNow, with a new, proper gaming laptop, and surely game updates itself, the delay has vanished.\n\nOver the time I haven't played, things have changed quite a lot. The flying scenes are completely different, and there seems to be a new, completely awesome, feature where the game slows down, brings out cinematic black bars, showing Melody fall towards the ground before having her roll forwards back onto the beat. All while synced to your music.\n\nThat brings me to my next point.\nThe fact the game can generate a level out of any song you put into it is amazing.  Although not all, the game can take whatever song you put in, and give you back a colourful, sometimes challenging level that matches the beats, drops, vocals and slides in the song.\n\nSeeing this game now as a full, proper Steam release that didn't end up as a trainwreck discontinue during E.A is relieving for me, despite the fact I never thought I would pick it back up.\n\nIf you like music games, especially ones that allow your music, this game is a great new way to experience your favourite songs, or just waste time in a music-filled heaven.\n","May 20","true","5.6"," 50 of 59 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","50","59","3","0"

Rhythm game. You press buttons/keys and you complete various actions to set a higher score and to not fail at running through the level. the levels are based on the beat/tempo/sound of your songs that you supply it. Any sound file that you use will most likely work, I've tried this with mp3s and wavs but not much else because who really uses much else?\nDifficulties include pressing one button to complete the actions, pressing 4 buttons that correspond to color, pressing 8 buttons that correspond to direction and color, and lastly a combination of more spots to hit and the previous difficulty.\nSo now the standard game rating:Story: 1/10 You are a runner, you run to the music that is playing in your headphones, you can customize the runner in the workshop very easily.\nGameplay: 10/10 Does not, will not, get old. constantly challenging, high skill wall and after you beat that to the point where you can do everything flawlessly the game is still fun to play while listening to more songs.\nPresentation: 10/10 Honestly beautiful game. There is a bloom effect on a vector style of the game. as a person who is heavily interested in a minimalist style of art this is just my thing. You don't need much to say a lot. and what you leave open, you leave a canvas for others to think and fill in.\nSoundtrack: 11/10 Your own soundtrack. what more can be said?\nReplayability: 10/10 Would there ever be a time when this game could be dated and unplayable? No. Will there be more immersive or better looking games that are rhythm games in the future? Possibly, but what you have here, is the newest and the best looking one that is also REALLY nice to older computers. Besides, even after a new rhythm game comes out, there's nothing that would make you unable to play this one. I could still go back to audiosurf if I wanted to, but by my personal preference I love the way that this game looks and feels.","May 2, 2015","true","19.4"," 36 of 38 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","36","38","4","2"

As compared to other user-supplied music games, this one is the most like DDR/Guitar Hero, so proper beat location is important.\n\nMusic test so far:\n\nMonster Killer - TheEnigmaTNG. I picked a recent addition to my library with a solid, obvious beat. Game performs as intended.\nHonor Thy Father - Dream Theater. Dream Theater is my "how good is the algorithm" go-to. The game helpfully told me that it could not find a 4/4 beat, which is accurate. The fallback algorithm performed well.\nPanic Attack - Dream Theater. I like this song, so I gave it a go, even after I did the stress test. Oddly enough, it said that it found an acceptable beat, which Panic Attack definitely doesn't have, and the gameplay showed it. I'm a little disappointed.\nFeathers (Original Mix) - Archie. In Audiosurf, this is my favorite go-fast song. Reds practically all the way. Here, it was not fast all the way. Accurate beats, and it was still fun.\nSound of Silence - Disturbed. I had to run a slow song test, and I recently discovered this excellent cover. Seriously, go listen to it. When the song was really going, the algorithm's adherance to the vocals was great, but in the slow parts, it was a bit patchy. The revelation that "slow songs are a bit boring" is not really news to fans of other music games.\n\nOverall, I'm glad that there is a rhythm game that is really trying to hit the beat accurately. Even Audiosurf is a bit loose with the beat. It's not perfect, but it is very fun.\n\nStill holding out for iTunes playlist integration. Then again, I'm holding out for that in Audiosurf 1/2, Symphony and Beat Hazard, so there's that.","May 21","true","3.4"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

And games with pretty colors. This game has (or claims to have) both.\n\nBefore I start, please note this is the Early Access version. Things can change in the future, I'll try to change my review later.\n\nSo, why am I not recommending Melody's Escape? Because this game actually doesn't have both things I love. Reasons:\n\n1) Rhythm detection just doesn't work for most songs. Most songs were discarded when I tried it (which means almost all random beats), just a few of them had confidence over 40%. And probably only 1 over 70%.\n\n2) Even if confidence is higher, you are pressing buttons outside of beats in most cases. Or you expect to press the same keys when music repeats, but no - they are mostly different and you easily miss a button because of this.\n\n3) When you miss a button which is related to an obstacle, you die and respawn in a few seconds. This is bad. Especially when beat detection isn't the best, because this means you are dying too often.\nIt really isn't fun to watch the screen sometimes for 10 seconds (mostly less, but yes, this can happen too if there's a really long slide or jump) without being able to do anything. I want to play, not wait until I respawn.\n\n4) Putting beats right after you jump and land is awful. You have pretty much a few milliseconds to react. No. This is bad.\n\n5) Difficulty. Relaxing is too easy and boring (no, pressing the same button for a few minutes isn't relaxing, sorry), normal is sometimes too hard (but that's mostly because of weird beats).\n\n6) The game looks pretty on screenshots, but it gets boring really fast. At least change the background more often. Just look at Audiosurf - there's always something cool to see. Do it like that.\n\n7) Blur. This is a big no in a rhythm game. I need to see clearly what is coming.\n\nI really wanted to like Melody's Escape. I will definitely give it a try in the future, but it's a thumb down from me for now.","March 11, 2014","false","8.3"," 96 of 149 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","96","149","0","12"

So what happened? A mix of oversaturation and minimal innovation led to one of the quickest booms and bust for a gaming genre. Recently we’ve seen PC take centre stage with games such as Osu! and Audiosurf being front runners, they’re extremely affordable and include a huge range of playable songs without the need of some ridiculous peripheral. So where does Melody’s Escape fit in here?\n\nMelody’s Escape's only limitation is the size of your music library. It is able to detect your audio files (FLAC works, Audiophiles rejoice!) and then convert them into a playable song. The gameplay is simple enough to pick up and go, while still being somewhat hard to get a perfect score in songs with higher BPMs. The goal is simple; get the highest score possible.\n\nNow one thing that may turn you off after looking at gameplay may be the fast movement of Melody. The game moves incredibly quick at times and your song of choice may not always help you concentrate. It's for the most part easy to read due to the great colour palette, the black objects help bring out the colours of the notes, also obstacles share a certain input and as such you can even use them as a second point of reference. Though it's easy to read it doesn't mean it's not strenuous on the eyes, there's a little to much going on screen at any one time and it destorys anyone who uses peripheral vision as a main tool.\n\nWhile it may be fun to play it does lack one key thing which music games are greatly known for,  improving one’s self and being able to display your improvements through scores. It’s hard to know what song is harder than another and two people could play the same song but if one is playing at a different bit rate you could get different tracks.\n\nIn saying that I still think it has its spot in the music game genre. While it may not be as hard as Osu! or have a great group experience like Rock Band. It allows you to play any song you want, whenever and presents you with a clear and easy goal.","February 26, 2014","true","20.7"," 58 of 88 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","58","88","0","4"

It's a no-brainer that I recommend it to anyone who likes music/rhythm games,  wants to try something new, or someone who just wants a more interactive way to enjoy their music collection. Melody's Escape Is a cool, sleek game that I'm glad is on Steam. Games like Melody's Escape, Crypt of the Necrodancer, and Captain Forever Remix are definitely contributing factors as to why I continually check the Early Access section of this site.\n\nDON'T BE SCARED OFF BY THE PLATFORMER TAG! In case you're like me and instantly disregard any game that has that tag. (Sorry to all platformer lovers out there; I know I only hate them because I am bad at them.)  It didn't even cross my mind that this was a platformer until a friend told me. To me, this is more of a 'press the right button at the right time' kind of game--the right time can be decent or perfect depending on the difficulty setting-- than a straight-up platformer. Not to mention the jumps and falls are both utterly epic with the effects.\n\n+You play your own music! I say can because there is no built-in music. You just have your own awesome collection to choose from and add on to.\n-Make sure it meets the criteria. Most music does. You'll have a lot of fun playing certain songs (like the suggested electronic genre, but it is much broader than that) than you would other songs. Some slow songs end up being really fast because there is no steady beat in them.\n\n+Mods!!\n\n-Eye strain. After I play, the screen sometimes shakes in my vision. But there is a guide to help with that. Basically, just focus on Melody.\n\n+You're a hot girl! As far as most of the mods go, anyway. ^_^\n\n+The graphics are super smooth and cool and it's just so easy to sink in and lose yourself in the game for hours.\n\nTips: It's way easier to play with a gamepad. With a keyboard I can only do relaxing mode.\n\nI got this as a gift (thanks Rudy!) and I have happily given it as a gift to others.\n\nAND I'LL JUST SAY THIS NOW: I LIKE MELODY'S ESCAPE BETTER THAN THE AMAZING AUDIO ROLLERCOASTER THAT IS AUDIOSURF 2.

The game pairs the rhythm platforming of Bit.Trip Runner with the 4x4 split button configuration of Before The Echo (formerly known as "Sequence").\n\nHere is a breakdown of the good/bad as I currently see it:\n\nPROS:You can use your own tracks. The game imports and generates courses VERY quickly.\nYou can adjust how difficult a course you want the game to generate, from a relaxing/casual one to an intensely difficult one.\nAlready a small community of modders building some nice alternate skins for the game/character.\nIf you miss a beat or hit an obstacle, you do not instantly fail and have to start over (cf. Geometry Dash) nor do you have to go all the way back to the last predetermined checkpoint (cf. Bit.Trip Runner). It's more like Guitar Hero or Audiosurf where you just stumble and take a huge hit to score, but the level keeps on rolling. This is a HUGE plus that feels currently missing among the major rhythm platformers, so I appreciate this quite a lot.\nIf you manage to get a long streak going, you feel really good. Like a ninja or something. There is a caveat to this, however, which I'll mention in the con list.\nCONS:The game doesn't have a lot of visual cues to indicate the rhythm, and it isn't 100% clear where the hit zone is for the beats. You can rely on your own sense of rhythm, but I feel the game currently does not do enough to visually represent beats. (Maybe have the button cue icons throb / pulsate to the beat or something?)\nThe generated beats can feel very boring. No matter how complex the rhythm of whatever song you're playing, Melody's Escape will always churn out a vanilla 4/4 beat. Thump, thump, thump, thump. No real rhythmic complexity.\nThe simple 4/4 beats, combined with not being super sure where the hit box is, combined with a lack of beat visualization, combined with the 4x4 split button config, makes songs with fast beats feel less like you are tapping buttons to a rhythm and more like you're furiously mashing buttons in a game of One Finger Death Punch (still feels awesome to get a long streak, but doesn't necessarily feel like you're in rhythm with the song).\nIn higher difficulties (medium and higher) the game is prone to just throwing a huge barrage of really fast 4/4 notes at you, which feels less like bobbing to a distinct rhythm and more like a non-stop drum roll. Again, it can feel nice in a ninja sort of way, but not very rhythmic. I think the 4x4 split button config somewhat contributes to this, since it forces the player to concentrate more on which button they are pressing, which distracts them from the beat---especially on fast songs.\nThe game feels like it very much overuses hold notes.\nThe 4x4 split button config is nice. I really liked it in Before The Echo (aka Sequence) and it can work wel here, too, but the button cues are currently too weird. The arrow cues are way too small and hard to quickly register. They need to be much bigger and more distinct. The ABXY button cues are a great size, but their shapes are too similar, and they are only partially color coded. Button cues could be significantly improved.\nWould be nice to have more variety in the generated levels. You're basically just playing the same level, with the same obstacles, and the same colors, forever. It would be nice if, down the road, there were some options to choose different levels with different obstacles types and different visualization/color schemes etc.\nThe levels sometimes initiate "speed up" or "slow down" sections at weird times or put them in places where it doesn't feel like they belong.\nIt's still in Early Access and it seems promising. There is a kernel of something here that I definitely like. It just doesn't quite feel fully realized yet. I hope to update this review at a later date with a "recommended". I'll keep my eye on it and my fingers crossed.","June 22, 2015","false","1.9"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","30","43","0","3"

Supporting formats like MP3, OGG, WMA, FLAC, iTunes®, and even some video files, this game can read almost any track.\n\nBut where "Melody's Escape" stands above other procedural rhythm games like Audiosurf, Riff Racer or even Crypt of the NecroDancer? The audio detection algorithms of this game are based on notes/vocals detection, instead of beat detection, like the other games previously mentioned. Music compass plays a big role here too. While the levels synchronize perfectly with a tempo of 4/4, it goes great too with tunes far from the traditional, like Dream Theater and Soundgarden.\n\nAbove all things mentioned, “Melody’s Escape” is a joy to play. Yes, the gameplay it’s pretty simple: just run to the music track and try to beat your own score (no leaderboards included), but it’s also fun as hell. You can easily lose track of time playing this game, and there’s always a new song to try and some neat surprises I won’t spoil to you.\n\nFor a better experience and to avoid eye strain and headaches that some people experience, remember to turn off the blur and zoom out the playfield (75% instead of 100% is perfect), on the options menu. Have fun!\n\nPROS:\n*Plays well with keyboard and controller\n*Can read almost any audio and video track\n*Satisfying gameplay\n*Steam Workshop support for skins and color schemes\n*You can make it relaxed or tense as you want - 4 difficulty levels\n\nCONS:\n*No leaderboards\n*No multiplayer (would be a blast if this had co-op)","May 26","true","13.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

Melody’s Escape fills this void.\n\nIt’s a visually impressive game, I’ll give it that; but it’s Early Access, and it’s just very, very barebones at the moment. What you see in the trailer is all you’re getting: you’re an iPod model running across silhouetted terrain and hitting notes in time to the music. You get teleported to one of four psychedelic environments depending on the music’s level of intensity. If you crank up the difficulty, you’ll need to use twin-stick controls to hit different types of notes separately: one stick to navigate terrain, and the other to collect colored orbs. The harder modes can be quite frustrating if you’re not the ambidextrous type, and personally I opted to stay on a lower skill level that didn’t make me have to keep stopping to think about which stick I needed to use. You’re scored based on how many notes you hit, how well you hit each individual note, and how long you held streaks for multipliers.\n\n(Note: if you’re impressed with the part in the trailer where she flies, you should know that they cut out that mechanic and replaced it with something else).\n\nThere are some interesting customization features. You can customize the skin of your character, or search Steam Workshop for player-created skins. You can also customize your own difficulty level with a surprising number of options.\n\nAnd that’s basically it. There are no leaderboards yet, and not a lot of variety to the levels. There are no unlockables, no powerups, and no level progression. But what’s there is very solid and bug-free, the beat detection and level generation is suitably forgiving and works well enough, not to mention that it all just looks so awesome. Seeing as though it’s an Early Access game, I’m giving it a tentative thumbs-up; if you want a classic DDR / Guitar Hero experience generated by your own music, this is for you. If you like what you see, at least give it a follow so you can see if anything becomes of this project.","October 6, 2015","true","8.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/setlin/recommended/270210/","setlin","Setto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/setlin/","128 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSummary\n\nMelody's Escape best represents rhythm synthesizer that generates various movement keys depending on the theme and digital nature of your favorite songs. The environment is always altered between each song you choose so everything is fairly different and randomized. As such since this is a rhythm game, a lot of the gameplay is created based on the music's movement. Some parts of a song can jump from being very fast paced to having a sudden drop in movement.\n\nGameplay\n\nAll of this is represented in the terrain and pace of the gameplay as it plays out by having our main character Melody doing forms of sprinting, sliding, jumping, gliding and diving whenever you properly tap or hold down the appropriate movement keys (WASD or arrow keys). This fills your star count and begins accumulating points or none at all for yourself depending if you hit directly on a beat at the right time, barely, in-between or miss. The longer you can go without missing a beat, the higher score you'll earn yourself once the song finishes whereas missing will simply reset your beat count back to zero.\n\nThe mechanics are very simple to understand and may seem rather effortless at first but eventually once you get a hold of the controls you'll eventually adapt and realize that aside from arrow movement keys, there's also cones pointing in certain directions as well. They're are dependent on whether you can press either WASD keys at the right times similar to the arrow keys. So, you're controlling not only one set of controls but a pair now.\n\nLower difficulties (relaxing and medium) require the use of up to four keys from one set of controls which allow for a more casual and relaxing experience whereas higher difficulties rotate between both sets of controls, using cones (WASD) and pointers (arrow keys) which can really set the difficulty to another level as it'll challenge your ability to multitask by focusing not only on the rapidly, rotating cones and pointers but being engrossed in the music itself (the keys for cones and pointers are customizable).\n\nSpeed also plays an important factor as you can miss a tap or two simply because the screen can sometimes just dive headfirst into a sudden burst of movement when you're attempting to focus on the next set of keys. There's a custom mode where you can decide on what keys and what type of movement you want in a song which allows for everyone's different play styles and more freedom to listening and playing alongside your favorite songs.\n\nVisuals/Steam Workshop\n\nThe game has a very basic color palette whenever Melody travels through generated levels consisting of cliffs, plains and hills. The shapes and geometry is highlighted in the background as black but the colors themselves (green, pink, blue and yellow) are seen in the movement keys. Whenever you tap a key at the appropriate time, Melody will do a specific feat based on where she's headed and the color represented will radiate alongside her flowing hair.\n\nThere are alternate hairstyles and outfits for Melody from her default but since modding is supported here, you can also choose to customize various outfits for her, different color themes for the environment and interface as well as unique skins which can entirely transform Melody into a different character you want to play as. This allows you to customize what you want and it's a welcoming sight for more personal freedom. Currently, this is the far extent of using mods in Melody's Escape.\n\nTempo and Impairment\n\nHowever, sometimes when you attempt to sync with some songs, you may notice that there's a certain tempo diagnosis before you start a song. These range from having no tempo at all, poor, good or excellent. This detects and tells you whether or not the music file you've chosen won't flow as well or have synced movement which can break some immersion in certain parts of the song.\n\nAnother thing to note is rather important and may have an effect on some people as the game can go absurdly fast at times. Certain songs, specifically the upbeat ones can lead to dizziness or eye strain due to focusing on keys that fly by and a constantly evolving screen. Those are the two major factors that have occurred in my experience so far and this is a simple warning to those who can't handle that.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMelody's Escape is very enjoyable for an early access and proves to be a simple, yet colorful, unique experience that can certainly enhance your favorite songs for you to be immersed in and playing alongside every beat. Aside from possible simulation stress that can occur, the game is flawless and is simply something you would enjoy in a rhythm game based on your musical preferences.","May 15, 2015","true","44.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

The lowest allows you to press any key, while the higher ones differentiate between WASD and arrow keys, and can require you to use both throughout the song. The range means players of all skill levels can enjoy a casual experience or more intense play, though the harder difficulties can mess with dyslexics.\n\nThe controls are simple, the aesthetic is clean and beautiful, the game works with pretty much any song, Steam Workshop makes the already pleasant visuals better, and the game is suited to both quick play or extended sessions. The game even unpauses with a timed delay to give you a chance to remember where you left off. The only potential issue with the game is the side-scrolling background.

Completing the package, you plug in your music and the game builds stages around each song's rhythm, and then you play a fairly simple game of DDR/Stepmania/name your music game to make Melody do all sorts of cool things in time with the music.  Ideally...\n\nThis is sort of the deal breaker, and where the game may fall apart depending on your taste in music.  The game's rhythm detection algorithm can really only detect very simple and pronounced 4/4 beats. Try throwing anything else at it, and you end up with a spastic spam of icons that are in no way in sync with the music or fun to play whatsoever.  Even detecting 4/4 beats, the generation still seems to vary in how each individual "note" may be off-rhythm.  For being the very core part of the game, this detection and level generation needed to be tighter.\n\nIt's a game that can wow you with some fun visuals when everything comes together and matches up to a song, but again, unless you're a fan of very specific types of music, it's probably best to pass this up.","May 29","false","2.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I was expecting the game to be like Audiosurf in the sense that you had direct control over your character, and the levels were generated such that properly navigating the level resulted in you naturally pressing buttons in time with the music.  Instead, the game is more like Guitar Hero or DDR in that all you do is press buttons in time with visual and auditory cues- the player character and obstacles are essentially just decorations or visualizations.\n\nI would have much preferred to have full control of the character so that I could jump, slide, etc. as I chose (it would be fine to have character travel still be automatic and based on music tempo, though).  If this were done, the colored arrow indicators could even be removed, and the player could choose their inputs based just on the upcoming obstacles.\n\nAs it is, I feel constantly frustrated since I'm making inputs that, in a platformer game, would cause me to clear the obstacles, but in this game, since I missed the cue timing, I crash.","May 3, 2015","false","1.3"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","28","46","0","1"

The controls are very much so Guitar Hero-esque, but each one does different things when prompted, so you might duck under a floating platform, hop over a bump, and so on with rather visually pleasing aesthetics.\n\nWhat really grabbed me, however, was the gameplay that is custom-tailored to the music you set the game to.  All you have to do is drag and drop your music file onto the game window and off it goes, analyzing the music file and creating a series of obstacles for you to overcome as you run through alongisde the song.  No other rhythm or music game I've ever played has had this kind of system where it makes the level for you just by analizing the song.  Others I've tried were Frets on Fire, Stepmania, and the like and all of those required you to place the notes/beats/moves yourself if you wanted to play a game with your own song, which, if you enjoy doing that, then keep playing those ones.  In the meanwhile, I'll be playing all the songs I want, as soon as the urge strike me in levels that are customized and built right at the very get-go.\n\nAnd as far as the visual graphics go, the captivation and beauty of such simple design elements are quite stunning, and are such a specific kind of beautiful that it doesn't distract you from the gameplay, yet you can admire it in its entirety while you're playing the song through.\n\nAll in all, 9/10. Positively addictive and truly a beautiful-looking game.  The musical analytical system is so brilliant, I could see other developers trying to emulate this sort of system for themselves.  Bravo, game devs.  Bravo.","November 9, 2014","true","7.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The only one I would say I frequently play and have somewhat become adept in is Cytus on my tablet. I stumbled upon this game while browsing early access titles on sale, and what intrigued me the most was A) the art style, and B) the fact that you play with songs from your own library. Mainly the latter. So I was pretty excited to pick it up.\n\nAt first I was a little wonky, as per usual whenever I delve into a rhythm game for the first time. I was a bit disappointed that there was no real tutorial in the game, however. There is a "how to play" guideline that somewhat helps you get started, but I feel like a tutorial would have been a more hands-on experience. I certainly hope they'll add one in the future.\n\nBut with that aside, once I got used to the controls, I had a lot of fun. A controller and keyboard are both viable methods of playing. It all comes down to your preferred play style and which would suit you the most. Personally I found both to be quite fun. You can also customize the difficulty, which I thought was handy. So if you ever think that the set difficulties are too easy or too hard, you can create one that's just right for you. It's quite impressive that the levels tailor themselves to whatever song you pick. One small detail that I really appreciated was, one of the songs I picked had a drop in it, and right before the drop there's this dramatic slow-motion sequence that I thought was really, really cool.\n\nIf you're a rhythm game connoiseur, then you will DEFINITELY enjoy this game. Heck, even if you're not, like me, chances are you'll probably enjoy it too.","December 23, 2015","true","12.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

I think it's worth the money. I think it's a great rhythm game. It plays well, it looks nice, and it can be challenging if you're into that.\n\nThe longer version:\n\nGameplay Overview:\nMelody's Escape is a side-scrolling rhythm game (I don't consider it a platformer, as one of the Steam tags suggests at the time of writing this). To start, you choose a difficulty level, and then either drag & drop an audio file onto the game window, or you search through the in-game file nagivator to find a song. The difficulty can be changed while playing, and the song will restart at the new level.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, the videos on the store page showcase it pretty well, though at the time of writing this the graphics in them are a bit outdated. "Melody" starts running, and a level tailored to your audio file challenges you to hit the notes it tandem with the tempo of the music; by default you use the arrow keys. The level is easier or harder depending on what song you choose to play; in general, faster songs are faster gameplay (the game notably has a hard time generating fast levels to very fast music, instead it chooses a slower stable tempo within the fast beat). There's four "energy levels" a song can have, distinguished by the different running speeds and backgrounds; during each of these the gameplay varies, moreso the higher the difficulty level is.\n\nIn Relaxing mode, you have only one button to push per energy level segment. It's extremely easy; it's what you would play if you're new to this genre of game, or if it's 4am and you're falling asleep at your computer. In Medium mode, all four arrow keys are utilized during the entire song, and are denoted by colored arrows and orbs. This is the most popular level of difficulty I've seen people play; not too challenging, but fun. Intense mode is the difficulty I have the most experience in. At this level, the game by default adds the WASD keys into the mix. You use these for the colored orbs now, and the arrow keys are reserved for arrows, which have now lost their color coding. This difficulty is intended for more experienced rhythm game players. Lastly, Overload is the hardcore difficulty of the game, and to progress past solid objects you must hit corresponding keys at the same time (ex. W and Up Arrow). This difficulty mode also doubles the tempo of the audio file.\n\nLikes:\nGraphics. Clean, simple art style. Nice palettes and character customizations. I love how the lights in the background respond to the background music.\nThe difficulty. It's a frustrating game in a fun way, not a flip-the-table way. I felt challenged, laughed it off when I messed up, and if I wanted more I bumped up the level, or played with the custom difficulty.\nThe custom difficulty option.\nEasy/Fast to navigate menus, and adding music from your computer couldn't be easier. Just drag & drop from a folder or itunes.\nPausing the game is fair. It shows you the screen where you left it, obstacles and everything, and it has a three second countdown before starting back up.\nThe gameplay itself is fair. When I missed a note, it was because I was too slow or I hit the wrong button.\nLatency calibration. If I did feel like something was wrong, I took the short calibration test and everything was good as new.\nThe sound effects. They're minimal, and they don't distract from the music. If you don't like them at all, there's an option to turn them off.\nYou choose when the song ends. I like that making mistakes didn't change the song volume, or end the run completely. I also appreciated how easy it was to restart from the pause menu.\nI like the level generation. Faster songs could be picked up better, choosing a higher difficulty fixed this issue for me (double the bpm, it helps). I also loved finding different quirks that only show up in some songs, for example the slow-mo cliff leap that happens during a music break.\nDislikes:\nMy biggest issue is that the intensity of the song I'm playing is sometimes not properly matched the way I'd expect it to be. Occasionally, the levels are late changing at times (ex. from yellow to pink), or sometimes it doesn't change at all. However, the actual bpm is generated very nicely.\nThe game doesn't come with its own music... yet.\nSuggestions: This isn't too big of an issue for me, considering they advertise it as a game for your own music library, but I've been led to believe there will be a soundtrack in the future and I'm eager to hear and play it. :3 (Even if it's just a mix of various artists I'd enjoy it, though I'd LOVE to hear music composed specifically for this game. Maybe some fan-made music, hmm..?)\nThe graphics are nice, however seeing the same backgrounds over and over for each song gets a old after awhile. I'd also like to see new obstacles added in as well. (Again, not a big issue.)\nSuggestions: Since the theme of the game is "escaping", perhaps  Melody could escape to other places. Outer space maybe? It'd be nice to see a new variety of places in the future. As for additional obstacles, those could be implemented as a custom difficulty feature. (Possibly something like double colors, double arrows, opposite 	color/arrow, hitting colors during arrow holds, etc.)\nI get a sense of motion blur I don't care for too much. I've read measures have been taken to fix this in the past, but it's still there for me. There is some slight eye strain because of this in my case, and it would be nice to be able to see things better when not doing a hold note.\nI would like more achievements to be added in the future. This is seriously nit-picking, but those goals were a lot of fun to play towards, and I'd love to see more at some point! Please? :3\nMisc Comments:\nIn Intense mode, I feel like a dancing octopus made of neon lights. It is a blast. This is my go-to game these days.\nOverload is amazingly difficult. It's a one way ticket to getting carpel tunnel if you aren't careful. That said, it is amazingly fun. I've only played this level a few times, but it literally overloads my brain and I love it. I'm going to be spending weeks if not months trying to beat a song in this mode.\nThe focus claimed by the developer is to make a game that let's me play along to my own music.\n1. I can get my own music into the game, very easily.\n2. The game doesn't take away from my music at all.\n3. The game generates levels that sync up with the music file well. I feel my music more when playing.\nThe dev succeeded. :3\nFor an early access side-scroller rhythm game, Melody's Escape sincerely impresses me. I've played free games of this genre in the past (before I found Steam), with somewhat varying game mechanics, more complex graphics and their own small soundtrack, etc. However, those games were designed more with the mindset that they were just another videogame rather than a music experience. They had levels, you could die, the music would stop or mess up or fade out (Guitar Hero is a popular example of a similar game, on a different branch of the same overarching genre). The music in other games felt secondary to me. But they were games about music! With this game however, this game you play for the music. Usually I play when I just feel like listening to something, but I want to immerse myself into it physically. The game knows its priority.\nAs I've seen other people say, YOUR MUSIC determines the experience you get out of this game. I encourage people who get this game to try a variety of music. Fast songs, slow songs, flowing music with no stable beat, songs with and without lyrics, different genres, etc. Each song comes with its own quirks and unique level layout. Experiment and find the music you like playing with the most!","October 29, 2015","true","33.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

But just like Audiosurf, being able to play with your music adds virtually infinite replayability. Not to mention the art style is nice, and your character is actually kinda cute (reminds me of a Vocaloid girl, in fact).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jumpluff/recommended/270210/","jumpluff","alicia, who smiles at death","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jumpluff/","184 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMelody's Escape is a deceptively simple yet challenging obstacle-based rhythm game with a lot of potential versatility in playstyle. While still in Early Access, it has almost no technical errors and the developer is extremely active, so I would recommend it to people who enjoy rhythm games, especially people who are looking for a different type of procedurally-generated music gameplay. I am terrible at obstacle running games, but I have never ever found the platforming element of this game to be obtrusive or overwhelming because it integrates so well with the beat and feels so smooth on a sensory level.\n\nThe visuals are quite polished and clear, with a striking and elegant aesthetic; they are also easily modded and customised. The colours are rich without being distracting and can be altered both ingame and via a modding interface, and provide lovely implicit feedback for passing obstacles. The gameplay is rewarding immersively with the flow of the music and quite addictive. Melody's Escape primarily syncs to tempo and tests rhythm, beat awareness, and precision in timing, so it works less efficiently with noisy tracks, but its level generation otherwise handles most genres I have thrown at it quite well and has a good fallback method for dealing with offtempo songs.\n\nGameplay\nLow BPM songs are as pleasing to play as high BPM songs, although they generally have fewer obstacles and the running pace is slower, and there are difficulty settings which treat songs with <150 BPM as if they had double their actual BPM for the purposes of level generation if that annoys you. Instrumentals and vocal songs work equally well.\n\nWhile the strength of Melody's Escape generally lies in its concept and its simplicity, the game is easy to recommend because of its many difficulty settings. There are four preset difficulty modes with different input and then a custom mode which can be used to alter obstacle density, running speed, input timing window, and input methods, which gives the player the opportunity to emphasise the challenges they would like the most.\n\nThe four input methods in order of difficulty are one colour (the track is divided into segments of different running speed based on intensity of the song, and to pass an obstacle you must press or hold the associated colour key), all colours (all obstacles have their own individual colour assigned to them regardless of segment), colour or direction (solid obstacles -- jumping, sliding, diving -- require direction key input, either from the gamepad or using the arrow buttons, while colour orbs require their individual colour key input), and tandem colour and direction (passing an obstacle requires both the correct colour and direction key).\n\nMonochrome play is relaxing and purely a test of precision, while tandem colour and direction play is a frenetic test of reaction timing and mechanics.\n\nThe sync with the track is quite good and failing to pass certain obstacles results in stumbling or respawning, so there is no way to actually fail a song as in other rhythm games which involve shooting elements, etc. The only real ingame objective that exists is to pass every obstacle (a perfect chain), but the game assigns ratings based on score and keeps track of your high score, so you can play as you wish on the mode that suits you best. This is why I have accrued so much playtime so quickly, because I found exploring the full potential of the game challenging and enjoyable.\n\nEssentially, you get out of Melody's Escape what you put into it, which is hopefully a huge and diverse music collection. It is absolutely worth its current price and even more so on sale. It is an easy pick-up-and-play game with almost no set-up overhead and a low skill floor, but possesses depth, complexity, and replay value as you attempt to master it.\n\nI disagree with some of the other reviewers on one thing; I am a keyboard-only player and really enjoy this game. I have no doubt the game is more intuitive with a Microsoft controller, but do not feel as if anything is lacking from keyboard play.\n\nTechnical\nTechnically, the game can be played with either keyboard or gamepad quite well, and no clicking is necessary. There is a slight learning curve for the colour input scheme for keyboard players because the colours are by default designed to match Microsoft controllers, but it translates fine to WASD/SZXC/etc. keyboard schemes. The visual processing can be demanding but there is an FPS counter ingame and many options to increase performance at the expense of graphical intensity (mostly bloom), which is also a matter of subjective preference anyway. Input windows etc. are all smooth assuming consistent 60 FPS.\n\nThe game has very good file handling options and does not require pre-indexing directories. You can save tracks as favourites and generate favourite folders. From experience it supports a wide variety of formats (mp3, m4a, ogg, wav, flac, aac, aiff, mpeg, wmv, and more) and also playlists (.m3u files), which sets it apart in endurance play from other rhythm games. Handles large and long tracks fine.\n\nIt does lack support for kanji, hangul, some unusual Latin characters with diacritics, etc. which can make track selection a difficulty for songs with names entirely in those characters. (Katakana and hiragana are supported, for the record). This appears to be unlikely to change in the near future and is the only potential sticking point I see for rhythm game fans.\n\nEarly Access\nAs I have stated, this game is very much alive and being worked on, and developer support is extremely prompt. However, were the developer to suddenly disappear, I would still recommend this game as is. The primary focuses of development now are perfecting visuals (which are already on par with  the available rhythm games on Steam) and fixing some very uncommon errors. For almost every player this game should be in a well-functional state and require minimal or no tweaking to maximise performance.\n\nConclusion\nOverall I completely recommend Melody's Escape to any fan of rhythm games or procedurally generated music games such as Audiosurf, Osu, etc. It is well-made, performs smoothly, has active developer support, and copes well with virtually all music types. The tracks are varied enough for such a simple set of obstacles to keep you entertained for quite some time. There are few technical issues, the levels are graceful, and the aesthetics of the game are beautiful in a way that only enhances the music. Nothing ingame detracts from the music itself but the gameplay itself is still rewarding and intense, which is to me a perfect and mesmerising balance.","July 24, 2015","true","92.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

It's challenging, never straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (no seriously, go watch some osu or Project Diva on Extreme) and enjoyable. My PC can't handle the high quality, but even at minimum is still beautiful to watch.\nThe music analyzer is good, really. Even when it can't find a good 4/4 tempo it can still make some good beats out of it. Obliviously it's not perfect, it can't replicate the huge tempo swings on other rhythm games and some music will inevitably be more accurate or well tuned than others, but on overall it makes the best out of any kind of music. I tried with videogames BGM, Vocaloid, and Japanese/Korean vocal music (Anime OST as well).\nThe only minor lackluster part for me is the stock music selection. There are a couple of tracks finely mapped to be the best gameplay experience, but they are... not enough. The main idea of the game is using your own music, but some more manually mapped tracks are kinda necessary.\n\nEven if you are not a huge fan of the rhythm game genre it's worth a shot, it's a promising game that I'm sure it will get even better with time and good feedback.","May 25","true","9.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

It uses an advanced algorithm to turn any audio track from your music library into a course Melody has to navigate.

She'll also alternate between walking, running, and flying depending on the song's current tempo.\n\nThe rapidly scrolling directional and button prompts feels like a marriage between Dance Dance Revolution, Quick Time Events (QTEs), and precision platforming.\n\nSince each song generates a unique track, and the different difficulties require different input methods, the game theoretically has infinite replayability.

The arrows/notes don't fall into the typical predictable beat of the song, instead there is a degree of complexity to it, a synchopation.\n\nLike I said, the only downside is the intense side-scrolling can strain your eyes badly.

The look is gorgeous, and is a great buy if you're looking just to push buttons and really relax with your music.\n\nMy nitpickiness all comes from being a serious hardcore music gamer.

It's great to at least get the game off the ground.  I hope to see a built-in soundtrack with proper-made stages for it, not just auto-generated ones.

I'll try to keep it up to date with changes patched in.\n\nI'm a total sucker for games that work based off your own music - the entire reason I first joined Steam was for Audiosurf. I've been excited for Melody's Escape ever since I first saw it on Greenlight, and now that it's finally released I have to say that it definitely meets my expectations.\n\nIn terms of gameplay I would best describe it as a "sidescrolling DDR" - the focus is on hitting notes corresponding to arrow keys (as well as WASD on higher difficulties), while running. The 2d platformer style is definitely different from the other rhythm games that I've personally played, and it adds a nice bit of variety to the genre.\n\nThe game itself is really pretty, with focuses on monochrome and splashes of color that give it a really vivid look. Unfortunately I had to turn off some of the more intensive settings to be able to get the best performance but I find that the game still looks striking without all the extras. The animation is very smooth and the transitions between actions (ie, going from somersaulting over a barrier to flying off a cliff) are nice and fluid.\n\nThe difficulty curve is steep but not impossible. After a few hours I was pretty consistently able to get 3 and 4 hearts on whatever song I played. It requires a bit more finesse when it comes to hitting notes compared to other music-based games I've played - the hitboxes for notes are very tight and require a fair amount of precision, a lot of which is dependent on the FPS you get. I found I had to turn the resolution way down and turn off several of the extra graphics effects in order to get a good framerate and to be able to consistently hit notes, but if you have good hardware this shouldn't be too much of a problem.\nHowever, it's also very forgiving of mistakes, simply regenerating you whenever you miss an obstacle without stopping the song - a very welcome design considering that half the reason I play music games is to listen to the song, so stopping me in the middle of a track when I die is not a good thing!\nThe game also allows the setting of a "custom" difficulty which allows you to configure what type of button-presses and the density of obstacles, among other things. So, if you find that you're not being challenged enough, or if you're having issues moving from Relaxed to Normal, using the Custom difficulty should make for an enjoyable experience.\n\nOne issue that I had with other music games is that either every song tended to feel the same in terms of gameplay, or that it was very easy to predict what type of course you would get which meant that for a challenge you ended up having to play the same sorts of music. This is not an issue with Melody's Escape - I listen to a fairly wide variety of music, a lot of which doesn't normally play well on games like Audiosurf, but almost every single track I tried produced a great level. Obviously like all music games some tracks will still play much better than others - a few songs that I found to be good in other music games didn't really provide the best experience, while others were absolutely brutal, even on Relaxing difficulty.\n\nFor an Early Access game, Melody's Escape is incredibly polished - if I had bought it as a regular, non-EA game I would still be impressed. The only missing features that I would like to have (Last.fm integration, etc) are things that have been confirmed to be added in the future. There's also support for custom skins, hairs, and color schemes via Workshop, which while I don't find incredibly necessary is still a great option to have.\n\nAll in all, this game is well worth the wait and the money I paid for it. If you're already a fan of music based games like Audiosurf and want to try something new I would highly recommend checking it out.","February 27, 2014","true","18.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Recommended.\n\nFirst generation technology of this sort of thing was pretty bad. Vib Ribbon for the PS1 is the first game I know of that tried, but Audiosurf and Beat Hazard made it very popular in the early 2010's. While they improved the formula significantly, it still mostly seemed to just detect the BPM and 'pulse' the levels to the rhythm, changing gameplay elements as the song's speed or volume changed. These games required a pretty good deal of your imagination filling in the blanks to really feel like you were playing the song, not just playing a game with background music.\n\nNot so with Melody's Escape, which feels very, very 'right'. I played through an album's worth of music with varied tempos, musical styles, and instrumentation and I would say that it felt like I was playing a hand-crafted track about 85% of the time. This absolutely blows previous games of the genre out of the water.\n\nAs for the gameplay, if you ever played Vib Ribbon, this is pretty much exactly that. It's very solid and time-tested rhythm gaming.

I played it for 2 hours without end and it felt great to play.\nI'll start with cons, since there are some that I want to mention.\n- No "early press" allowed. Some dodges I prefer to start slightly early, but this counts as a miss and disables the dodge and causes you to lose a lot of possible points.\n- Rhythm detection only follows 4/4. This means that 3/4 songs don't detect nearly as well.\n- Camera motion sometimes hides suprises like two consecutive presses/moves and won't give you nearly enough time to see it.\nPros!\n- Really lets you play any song you want, even full instrumentals, and detects them well.\n- Gameplay is consistent, without any song being too difficult or any being too easy.\n- Awesome graphics. I was super suprised at some of the 'extra' animations that occur at various points.\n- The middle mode (between Relaxed and Intense) is perfect for playing casually, allowing you to mash buttons rather than directions when you start panicking.\n\nThis is an amazing idea, and if developed further, could easily overrun other custom-written rhythm games like osu!.

I just have to give credit where credit is due here.\nWhen I first picked up this game, I expected it to be another half-decent "play to your own music" game that's being put on the Steam category, so as a music addict, I had to buy it and see what this game was capable of. When I picked out my first track and as soon as the game finished calculating the audio, the gameplay itself began. And needless to say, my expectations were passed.\nMelody's Escape is a sort of "rhythm platformer" as I like to call it which reminds me of a rather underrated game of the same genre called "Vib-Ribbon" for the PS1. It's just as easy to play, but it's also as hard to master.\nThe only buttons in this game are the WASD keys, shich are used to input multiple actions according to the direction and color of the obstacle. You break orbs, hop across gaps, break through walls, and even fly with stylish beauty. The game runs at a perfect and smooth 60 FPS, which perfectly compliments the game's vivid and colorful graphics.\nThe first thing that caught my attention when I played my first song was how accurate the obstacles were to the tempo and beat. This is by far one of, if not the best audio detections in a procedrual music game that I've seen.\nIf that's not reason enough to get this game, it does have Steam Workshop support to add some neat little aesthetic touches.\nOverall, is Melody's Escape worth your time? Yes. Especially if you love music.","June 1, 2014","true","11.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Practice makes better in Melody's Escape, so you really feel great when you conquer a song on a difficulty you're just starting to get used to. As a fair warning, the game will seem very difficult at first and can be a bit hard on the eyes until you get used to it. Once your eyes are adjusted, and you've locked yourself into climbing the learning curve, you'll have a great time.

I can honestly say that this is an interesting take on the rythm genre of games. The only issue that I have with the game is the visual blur on environment and notes. As a direct reply to all the people commenting on timing I personaly find the timing just fine. This games 9 / 10 could be a 10 / 10 if it weren't for the speed blur effect as that realy is my only problem and source of difficulty. Also I can't wait for a skin from the Vocaloid crew to pop in the workshop, as I know its going to happen.\n\n\n= Edit =\n\nI'm gratefull that you took my suggestion to decrease the blurring effect in the game and it realy did help! As for the replacing of the colour green with the colour lavander, bad choice... I can barely tell the difference between the blue, lavender and pink when I have to act on my reaction time for my develishly fast songs... I'm sorry to say this but 'Melody's Escape' has unfortunately solved one problem and gained another...\n\n= Edit =\n\nI realy like the IDEA of the Overload difficulty because it feels like a cool twist on DDR. However, it falls short on the afformentioned colour issue. Putting that aside however I love the song difficulty creator in it's entirety. The only thing I could suggest to improve it is mabey a couple more options and a colour selector for the notes and background so users could get some of there favorite colours out on the dance floor (or just put that in the visuals section of the options).\n\nAlmost there Icetecy, just change lavender back to green and you get my 10/10.\n\n= Edit =\n\nAnd with the addition of community custom colours, you have created a perfect music game.\n\nCongrats Icetecy.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I think I saw a Miku skin some where in the workshop...","February 27, 2014","true","15.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Each input has a distinctive colour on the default theme making you able to correspond the colours to the inputs rather than identifying each note individually making long streams not as fearsome as they initially looked.\n\nIf you have a large library of music then you are going to have a good time on this game, however for people with mass amounts of songs in a single genre, you might want to be careful about the purchase of this game.\n\nI jumped right into this game with my love of rhythm games and enjoyed it very much until the audio detection was incapable of finding stable tempos in my songs. In my library of 166 songs (This is all from a single genre) I am capable of playing around 25% of them due to the beat detection being unable to find a stable 4/4. The result of the game being unable to find a stable tempo causes it to engage a detection mode which is labeled "Energy Peaks". This detection would be a great work around, provided that it worked consistently throughout an entire song which I have never found to be the case.\n\nWhen the detection is in "Energy Peaks" mode, it will detect any spike in activity on a song and then place a beat there, for songs with a loud singer; all hell breaks loose on the song making you unable to correctly time your inputs unless you use visual ques rather than audatory cues which is not what you should really have to do in a rhythm game.\n\nEnergy Peaks works wonders for instumental songs though so if you are playing songs without singing then you should be able to play them all and not have to deal with bad sync.\n\nThe only thing that I feel is missing from this game is a song editor or at least some way you are able to influence how the song is generated. I have found too many songs which will change from sprinting to flying after a chorus rather than during the chorus only to return right back to sprinting after the next verse starts following the bridge from chorus to verse.\n\nSo if you have a wide variety of songs then buy this game if you are a fan of rhythm games or if you want to get into them. Although if you have a single genre which you love make sure that your songs have a prominent and stable BPM to prevent Energy Peaks from not properally syncing.","August 13, 2015","true","25.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In all honesty, Melody's Escape is as smooth as its simple art style, which i personally think is very reminiscent of an advertisement for ipods.\n\nThe concept itself is also very simple, you control Melody as she runs through the chosen track, hitting buttons to the corresponding beats. Similar to Audiosurf; Melody's Escape allows the player to use their own music, and given how easy it is to obtain free music from the internet (or whatever shady site you download from), the sky's the limit! The game's simplicity is complimented by its high level of customization that the player is given. You get to decide Melody's hairstyle, clothing (or skin, some options from the workshop are more like reskins than clothing options) and the colour scheme for the game itself. If you feel limited by the default selections you can turn to the Community Workshop for even more options to pick and choose from. And if that’s still not enough customization for you, then there’s a “ModStudio” tucked in the steam program files that allows you to start from scratch and make/edit  your own unique hairstyle etc. (Might take some figuring out but there are a few guides that go over the process). There’s also an option to make your own custom difficulty to play with; which is a nice touch.\n\nHowever, at the core of any game is its gameplay and its controls. So how does Melody’s escape score in these areas? Wonderfully well. the controls are nice and tight (although personally i would recommend using a controller over a keyboard). The gameplay of Melody’s Escape can be pretty difficult at times but the game’s learning curve is never unfairly difficult (unless you’re using an insanely high tempo song then well, you’ve only yourself to blame). Each is level is generated by some technical algorithm that analyses each song, but i’m no expert on the details. Despite the minimalistic amount of content you’re given in the actual game not counting your music, i seem to always come back to it. When buying Melody’s Escape, bear in mind that this is a game that’s best played in short bursts, not just because you’ll get bored after about one to two hours of back to back playing, but also because your eyes will get sore. Very, very sore.\n\nThe first issue with this game stems from the visuals. Don’t get me wrong, i love the art style and bright colours, but i’d be lying if i said that my eyes didn’t get strained after about a half hour of playing. Though the issue can easily be remedied with a couple tweaks to the settings as well as following general health and safety tips.\n\nIn summary, Melody’s Escape is a perfect game to just pick up and play casually whenever you’re bored, waiting or need to relax etc. It has a great visual style and it’s customization is boundless. The difficulty only enhances the feeling when you beat your high score; and as long as you don’t play for too long in one go than you’ll have a blast! It's also a great entry point into the rhythm genre.\n\nDefinitely a good game to have in any steam library.","December 13, 2015","true","99.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Then when my daughter started playing the easiest difficulty, that fear slowly crept in. But when we started MEDIUM difficulty, EVERYTHING changed. The seemingly limited moves helped fuel the struggle to complete the variety of commands being thrown at you. It became HIGHLY entertaining AND addicting. Though I agree with some reviews that certain songs- especially in higher difficulties - do not synch well with the game engine.\n\nThe controls (using a wireless XBOX360 controller) were great. You can choose to use a combination of the analog sticks, d-pad, or face buttons. You can even choose just one set of controls (like the face buttons, or just the D-pad). I used both analog sticks, and my daughter used the D-pad + face buttons combo.\n\nThere are already a ton of Workshop mods out there, including Hatsune Miku, or even Black Rock Shooter.\n\nMake sure to check SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS and some reviews. The game requires a solid 60FPS for best synchronization. I had no issues running it with v-sync, but some may need to turn on some sort of Adaptive V-sync if frames drop below 60.\n\nLet the beat flow! :)","May 27","true","18.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Melody's Escape is a great example of a music game that tries some new things! The ability to customise your player and load up your own music is a great feature.\n\nSomething I really like is how the speed of the game, colours, and the eye-catching visuals are based on the tempo and pace of your song, and all the different sections that appear -whether it be flying, floating or diving off a cliff- fits with the mood of the music.\n\nBeing an early access game, it isn't quite refined yet, but come the future I hope the game gets even better in terms of a whole bunch of improvements that will really pack the game with a whole lot more.\n\nPacked with a pretty cool workshop that is slowly but steadily growing, there's a lot of ways to stylize Melody to fit your style of play.\n\nI really recommend and can't say anything but good things about it.

I find them very entertaining and relaxing yet at the same time challenging. This is something that is hard to achieve.\n\nThat being said Melody's Escape is what you would expect out of a rhythm game; nice visuals, game play based on the music, and lots of hand - to - eye coordination struggles. However once I bought this game and started playing it, I found it very hard to stop playing it. What draws me to Mel's Escape is that the game is done in such a way that it's challenging, yet at the same time very enjoyable. The game doesn't penalize you for failing, records your progress  and encourages you to keep trying better every time.\n\nAnyways the concept of the game is very simple. You control theactions of the heroine, Melody, as she embarks on an adventure through the music. You know it's like an escape from reality, much like how most music enthusist do when they put on those headphones. Anyways Melody's pace is based on how energetic the music is, the slowest being a leisurely stroll through the city and the fastest is flying through the air like a super heroine. It is up to you to keep up with the beat.\n\nAlthough this is not the first time I have played a rhythm game which scans your music library and makes gameplay tracks out of them, Melody's Escape is certainly unique. This game is all about you and the music. Also this game seems catered to a more casual demographic despite having four difficulty settings. Finally the game is very customizeable in the visual aspect and even comes with a modding tool in the steamapps>common> Melody's Escape folder. You can make your own skins, and has workshop compatibility.\n\nA couple of downsides I have found is that Melody's Escape struggles with music with variable tempos. Those often end up feeling underwhelming no matter what difficulty setting you have the game at. Another thing is this game lacks any sample tracks, so if you want to play this game you will need a couple of mp3, mp4, m4a or w/e files to get a good experience out of it. Finally since this game is a fast paced side scrolling runner, your eyes may fatigue after a while of playing this game. You can do a number of things to reduce this however so it is nothing major, that is unless you're sensitive to motion sickness.\n\nAnyways I give this game 8 epic head dives out of 10.\nFeedback: This game needs to hit full release soon and could use some sample tracks and perhaps the option to craft custom stages. However as it is Melody's Escape is very playable, has a great amount of replayability and overall it is a pretty solid game.  This is definately a must have for the rhythm game enthusists and people who appreciate music. Trust me you will have a lot of fun.","February 10","true","262.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

However this game had some issues which rendered it nearly unplayable, despite my greatest efforts to fix them.\nFirstly, there's the incoming symbols and obstacles. They were nearly a blur and neigh impossible to focus on until I found out that you could zoom out the camera. That helped, but it wasn't quite enough. I also had to turn off the moving background to focus better.\nNext there was the lag. I'm not entirely sure the reason for this but there was massive lag at the beginning of a song, and usually at the end as well. This may simply be the song sync and saving of my results, but it was a near-standstill until I returned to the menu.\nI'm not sure if its just me, but I also found the symbols a bit confusing at times. I don't feel that there was enough indication to which direction to press, but as I said, that may just be me.\nThe good thing about this game is the fact that you can put any song or even video audio in and it'll auto generate a level and button prompts. This was something I would've loved in Kickbeat and it was done very well here.\nI suppose that in summary, if you are a hardcore rythmn game player or just looking to drop £4 on a sale item, grab this. Otherwise, if you're more of a casual player of these games like me, or  sometimes struggle to focus on a screen when there's too much going on, go get something else.","May 23","false","0.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Playing like a cross between Bit.Trip Runner and Audiosurf, Melody's Escape is the only runner/rhythm hybrid I know of that lets you use your own music, and if there is another game like it, it probably doesn't have the same aesthetics that this one has. While the quality of the game is technically determined by your music, I've tested tons of different songs and genres and so far the only genre that's consistently given an unsatisfactory experience was heavy metal or punk-style songs.\n\nThe game looks absolutely stunning and although it'll take a bit to get the hang of the gameplay (you have to be more precise than you would in other rhythm games), it's worth it in the end. I've only played a little of this game and it's already one of my favorite indie games on Steam, and it's not even finished yet. Do yourself a favor and buy this game. You won't regret it.\n\nfyi Try playing the game using "Somebody That I Used To Know" by Gotye.

The menu is barebones, the options are nearly non-existant, and the running never changes.\n\nThat would all be fine, except for one MAJOR problem -- there is no way to create your own custom map, and the music autodetection is imperfect.  It's not *terrible* by any means, but with every song I tested (Mostly Vocaloid -- heck, it's Miku running there!), there were distinct times where the map I was playing did not match with the beat at all.  Most of the time, it feels like it *almost* matches what's going on with the song, but it never feels like a cohesive experience.\n\nIf this were a free game, I would recommend it.  It's flawed and feels incomplete, but there's some fun to be had when it works.  There are several games online, for free, with already created custom maps for most songs out there.  The bad autogenerated tracks coupled with the inability to customize your own really kills the experience.","May 23","false","1.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Whatever generates the notes in the map is sort of... not all that great. I can't count the times that I've been tripped or clothslined by an object that doesn't even have a place in the song. It's annoying as Hell, that's all I'm saying about that. And another problem (that maybe others are experiencing) is the fact that you have to play basically two different songs with two different hands. It's just not practical. Imagine two songs going on in your head (on top of other random notes) that you really like then trying to sing along to one but being constantly interrupted by the other. That's sort of how it feels. But again, that may just be another personal problem. Oh, and another thing I feel the need to say again, the timing is so brutal. It doesn't give you any breathing room at all because God forbid you concentrate on ANYTHING while you are playing. I feel that you should actually have to think about what you are playing rather than just winging it every time you play (Which is what you have to do in this game because of the note system and it's need to throw random things at you) And again I state, I'm no stranger to rhythm games, so I think I know what I'm talking about.\n\nEnd of Edit\n\nSo many things I would already like to say about this game... I guess all of my issues are personal, but they may also relate to other people. So, first off, it's a little freaking hard! Now, you are probably screaming at your monitor 'Try a lower difficulty ya' ♥♥♥♥♥!' Well, the problem with that is that any difficulty below Intense doesn't feel like the actual game. Mainly because when you hover over Intense mode, it says 'Complete gameplay experience'. Now I feel like playing on anything but Intense is not getting the whole experience. (Which so far isn't a great one) And on top of that, I have serious coordination issues when it comes to this game for some reason. I mean, I played Extreme songs on Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F that were easier than this. (And for those of who know what that is, you ESPECIALLY understand what I'm saying)  But that's just a personal problem. Also, I have quite a bit of rhythm game experience under my belt (I've played osu!, Frets on Fire,  Project DIVA F, and Audiosurf very extensively) so it's not like I'm a complete stranger to the genre. But anyways, that's really all of the bad I have to say about it. Oh, wait, and it's not forgiving in your timing AT ALL. Okay, NOW that's it.\nOther than that, it is a VERY good rhythm game in general. It's beats usually make sense, the controls seem fun for someone who can actually use them, and the graphics don't look too horrible for a rhythm game. And that's all I have to compliment it by. Overall though, I would definitely recommend this game just to give a try.

I don't think any other game does this.\n\nYou can also customize the appearance of the character and level, with different hairstyles/skins/colors, which can be downloaded from the workshop. That's always nice.\n\nSo yeah, pretty much perfect.","July 20, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Whatever generates the notes in the map is sort of... not all that great. I can't count the times that I've been tripped or clothslined by an object that doesn't even have a place in the song. It's annoying as Hell, that's all I'm saying about that. And another problem (that maybe others are experiencing) is the fact that you have to play basically two different songs with two different hands. It's just not practical. Imagine two songs going on in your head (on top of other random notes) that you really like then trying to sing along to one but being constantly interrupted by the other. That's sort of how it feels. But again, that may just be another personal problem. Oh, and another thing I feel the need to say again, the timing is so brutal. It doesn't give you any breathing room at all because God forbid you concentrate on ANYTHING while you are playing. I feel that you should actually have to think about what you are playing rather than just winging it every time you play (Which is what you have to do in this game because of the note system and it's need to throw random things at you) And again I state, I'm no stranger to rhythm games, so I think I know what I'm talking about.\n\nEnd of Edit\n\nSo many things I would already like to say about this game... I guess all of my issues are personal, but they may also relate to other people. So, first off, it's a little freaking hard! Now, you are probably screaming at your monitor 'Try a lower difficulty ya' ♥♥♥♥♥!' Well, the problem with that is that any difficulty below Intense doesn't feel like the actual game. Mainly because when you hover over Intense mode, it says 'Complete gameplay experience'. Now I feel like playing on anything but Intense is not getting the whole experience. (Which so far isn't a great one) And on top of that, I have serious coordination issues when it comes to this game for some reason. I mean, I played Extreme songs on Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA F that were easier than this. (And for those of who know what that is, you ESPECIALLY understand what I'm saying)  But that's just a personal problem. Also, I have quite a bit of rhythm game experience under my belt (I've played osu!, Frets on Fire,  Project DIVA F, and Audiosurf very extensively) so it's not like I'm a complete stranger to the genre. But anyways, that's really all of the bad I have to say about it. Oh, wait, and it's not forgiving in your timing AT ALL. Okay, NOW that's it.\nOther than that, it is a VERY good rhythm game in general. It's beats usually make sense, the controls seem fun for someone who can actually use them, and the graphics don't look too horrible for a rhythm game. And that's all I have to compliment it by. Overall though, I would definitely recommend this game just to give a try.

That sounds confusing, so let me explain. The game is a nice, fresh take on the "play your music" genre. However, the game's music-to-level system is not completely functional. This isn't the worst thing, as it's an early acess game with time to fix it, and the level creator does seem to work fine on some songs. However, the result is an extremely difficult game, even on the lowest difficulty setting, as the beats are just slightly off from where you'd expect them to be. All in all, this game has potential, and if you want to get in early to help test it, you should. If you're deterred by the bugs, put this game on your wishlist. You can forget about it, and in a little while, when it's fixed, you can come back and receive what should be a quality experience.\n\nEDIT 3/16/14: After coming back to this game, I've found the detection to be better but still not perfect. I do like the custom difficulties, as making it lenient but a reasonable speed can offset the slightly faulty beat detection. Overall, I still think it's a fine game, but if you're not sold I would recommend waiting until it's out of beta.","February 28, 2014","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

At first I played my music and looked at the speed. I started on a slower note then went to a higher one. However what came odd is the timing which some may have to work with in the options of videos. Other things to note is the fact it is visually entertaining. Melody's Escape entrances one with the commands to sync with songs however those songs you have to have on your own. The game is good but using a game pad isn't fuly customizable so keyboard is pretty much default as before. If you play this don't jam mad on your keyboard, it will mess your tempo. Fun and frustrating. The songs react accordingly to the settings and song with it's own bpm. The game reminds me of certain other rhythm games however as I said adjustment to the video settings might help those getting first up in it. It has great potential and like the colors and skins. I look forward to progress. Basically breakdown:\nGood so far: Music Sync, Visuals, keyboard Controls\nImprovements: Visual Options(Basically because of everyone's so called initial trouble on discussion), Mode setting maybe beginner for those who aren't used to this, Game Pad customization compatibility, and possibly in future editions more buttons pressed with different action of visual element instead of compounding speed.\nAdditions: Skins and colors, backdrops?\n\nOver all I'd say the game has met my standards on what to expect. In terms 3-4/5. Not fully done yet. Still great potential and promise. Problems do occur time to time. Although I must admit expecting it to hit her belly is what got some of us confused as for the flying parts.

Loading music into it is a snap - you can either find the file on your drive, or you can just open your music player and drag-and-drop the file right into the game window.  The load times are very quick, even when uploading a song for the first time.  Sound quality is crystal-clear, animation is smooth.  This game did surprise me though - some sections of songs that are normally slow-paced (like the intro to Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd, for example) have Melody running at a higher speed.

There is a few problems that I do have with the game though... well 2 problems really it has no library of its own songs, I think this game would do great if it had some of its own songs in the game so you don’t have to go off finding music in files and such it gets kind of annoying though if Your desktop isn't messy like mine is and u can actually find stuff, it’s as simple as dragging the mp3 file into the game. Another little problem I have with the game is that if you play it for long periods of time it can tend to be a bit stressful on the eyes, sometimes I feel like when you hit a button to a corresponding beat the shine you get from hitting it is a bit too bright and I haven’t really found a way to change that. Other than that the game is great and if u have a few bucks to spend and some songs on your computer this would be a great pickup. The game also has workshop support so if you don’t like the runner character you can change it to whatever you want.

It is early access so there is going to be some kinks here and there but they will (hopefully) be worked out later in the development into the game. I have played Osu! before and I really loved it, and this game reminds me so much of it but except for a mouse you\nhave WASD or the arrow keys seems simple but gets so complicated.\n\nRelaxing is very well made IMO because it's so easy and that's not a bad thing, it's a great way to introduce how the keys work and whatnot and really does become relaxing when you get the hang of pressing the keys on time. However I think the difficulty jump from Relaxing to Normal is a pretty big jump but I can see why they did it.\n\nI also love the simple design! Neutral background and character makes it so you can focus easily on the keys and not be distracted by the background, I even tried the other pink background and my eyes couldn't take it. Even the pink character made me immediately change it back to the default.\n\nNow unlike Osu! the songs arn't player made and then checked by admins to see if they're playable or even follow the beat. I do acknowledge the fact that sometimes the orbs/slides don't match the beat but it was done through the program so Im not going to complain, being able to play songs that I love and that arn't available on Osu! cause they arn't made yet is pretty awesome. Sometimes it throws me off but practice makes perfect and you can separate the beat from what you see. Muscle memory kicks in and helps you through it.\n\nA few kinks here and there but ultimately a good game with a good future if it's taken care of by good hands, I hope to see this game develop further in the future.\n\nIf I had to rate I would give it an 8.5/10 because it's a really good game but some kinks in it(mentioned above) will throw off the rhythm loving crowd. And because when I end up failing in it in any part I don't rage, instead it makes me laugh and enjoy the game more.","July 26, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/secant/recommended/270210/","secant","Secant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/secant/","95 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHands down a fantastic rhythm-based game. It strikes a solid balance of performance efficiency, visual appeal, and solid gameplay. Even the early release builds feel like a complete game, and the music interpretation algorithm has come a long way; most reviews decrying its accuracy seem like they were for very dated versions, because I've rarely run into problems where the constructed level didn't match the rhythm of the song. This game does demand a fair amount of skill, however, and it's usually a good idea to start with Relaxing difficulty and get a feel for timing windows before jumping straight into Normal or Intense.\n\nMy only real gripe is that sometimes the generated levels can be very repetitive in that the obstacles are set on a constant beat matching the tempo of the song, which can lead to eye strain if you're focusing really intently on which buttons you need to press. That, and sometimes the cliff dives can be unfair because the camera doesn't reveal the next obstacle until just a fraction of a second before you actually need to hit it. Still, this will probably be addressed before the game comes out of its early release stages.\n\ntl;dr this game is good enough I bothered to get all the achievements and write a review. 9/10","May 4, 2015","true","101.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Guiding the internal musical journey of a faceless girl just feels so right.\nYou can choose Melody's appearance and the colour scheme, and even make your own Workshop submissions without the hassle of programming. The graphics are quite good, and you should be able to have them at maximum settings with no hardware issues.

I've enjoyed every minute spent playing it and find it very easy to lose a couple hours without noticing in it. The biggest attraction to the game personally is the fact that it is driven entirely by your own music. I love my music and games that involve your personal music, such as audiosurf and this. I've bought a few games of this kind on steam and This and the first Audiosurf are my favourite at the moment.\n\nThe game looks really nice. It's a simple design, but it works well. The game has nice colours and they are incorporated quite well into the games play, with melody's hair and speed lines corresponding the the current colour of the song (in relaxing) or the colour of the last orb/arrow hit (in normal/intense.) There are different skins for melody, different hair, different colours for the background, etc. making the game's look customisible.\n\nSpeaking of which, there are mods! And hopefully once the game is fully released it will have a workshop. There is already a subforum in the forums dedicated to user mdos and edits to the notes, melody herself, background.\n\nThe developer, epsi, is a very cool guy who listens to the community and is constantly updating the game based on community feedback and personal opinion. In the short time I've had the game He's released multiple updates the game making it into a much finer product than the already good game I bought. Since the game is still in early access quite a few more change can be expected to come along to improve the game.\n\nOverall, this game is very fun in my opinion. It's worth the money, and there's literally as much different gameplay as there are songs you like.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaziuma/recommended/270210/","zaziuma","Zaziuma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaziuma/","276 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI found myself enjoy this quite a bit. It manages to be a lot more like games like Guitar Hero than an actual runner, as it uses button timings, that, for the most part, are on rhythm with the song and it works quite well.\n\nThe game uses your own library of music, and it manages to find it easily, so you don't have to work to find it. I do miss an option to search for the songs though, but you can drag and drop them into the window instead, so I suppose that searching for them outside of it works as well, but in full-screen mode, that of course doesn't work, so you're stuck looking for the songs instead. I also wish that you could search for song length and file-type as well.\n\nThere are some issues with the way the songs work sometimes, and that is that it randomly, it takes a pretty energetic part of a song and instead of making it a running section, it becomes a walking section instead. This can be quite off-putting, and kind of take the joy away from you when you are ready for a blasting section of intense gameplay, though it is quite rare that it happens, so it might just be the song's fault that it interacts weirdly with the system.\n\nA personal problem I have is that when I play more intense sections, my eyes get fuzzy and I cannot concentrate that well. This is of course not something everybody experiences, but even with all settings turned off or tweaking them, I still get it. It doesn't affect my gameplay much, as I can still concentrate one one point, it's more my peripheral vision that gets a little bit wonky.\n\nI tried to put it at a lower resolution, but that didn't work either. That was also the point where I noticed another problem. The fact that it doesn't seem to fill out the whole window, rather, it puts black bars on the top and bottom of it, which is quite ugly looking, making me not want to play the windowed version.\n\nI like how you can customize your character and have the Steam Workshop integrated right in so you can use other characters, should you wish to do that, and I like how you can make your own rules to the gameplay, and it has quite a lot you can actually change.\n\nSome changes I think could be cool would be to have multiple songs play after each other, a playlist feature of sorts, and possibly a leaderboard, though that might be a little bit hard to implement since everybody is using different files and names, so not sure how that would work, but it could be possible.\n\nI think it could use a bit of tutorial that teaches you as you play, instead of the vague slideshow tutorial that you even need to look in another menu to find. While it's a simple concept that you can grasp quickly, I still felt as though I was doing something wrong the whole time. I wasn't sure how long I was suppose to hold it, or if holding it had any impact for the one button presses, and I also felt as though the way that the buttons were arrows were pressed didn't give me much feedback, so I felt as though I did it wrong.\n\nThough, while it has problems like that and things I would like that aren't there, the game is still fun, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't play a whole lot of runner games.\n\n9/10 Graphics - The graphics have a very simple style to them, the main character, Melody, looks like something out of an Apple commercial, which I think might be the point, though the works very well regardless of the simplicity. You are never confused as to which button you're suppose to press, and while I was confused if I was doing it right when I started, I got the hang of it later.\n\n7/10 Gameplay/Controls - It's a simple runner with some button press elements, it's not anything you haven't seen before, I can even name a game that does the same, Bit.Trip Runner, and it doesn't really add anything new to that either, and I wish it had something more original to it, but that said, doesn't mean that it's bad. It's smooth, it works, it's fun, it doesn't feel as though it's ever cheating you in the button presses, you always feel as though it was you that made a mistake (not that I make any of course :P), so there's nothing wrong there. I do miss a bit of feedback when you hit it, a sound effect to let you know you hit it right, but of course not something so distracting that it distracts from the songs themselves. The control side is pretty much perfect though, as all you do is click the button, there isn't much room for error, but if there was, it would make the game unplayable. Luckily, there isn't.\n\n8/10 Music/Sound - Well, of course this is a little bit hard to actually say, since you use your own music, though hear me out here: The songs are high quality, you can use plenty of file types from the look of it, and the way the songs make the levels works well 9/10. I do wish for the ability to search your songs more easily though. Sound-wise, well, there are not any sound effects during gameplay, and that might be okay for some, but I wish for feedback when I click a button, as mentioned already. There are sounds in the menu though, it's nothing special either, but it isn't annoying and it blends in well with the style of the game as well.\n\n7/10 Value - There is not a whole lot to this game. It's a simple game with a simple concept, but what it does is very good, even for it being early access. It's worth your money as it is right now, around 10€, as the game can never really be done, at least until you run out of music ;)\n\n8/10 Overall - The game is high above average, while it doesn't do a whole lot new, it does it well, and doesn't make any false promises. Pick it up if you like music, you like runners/rhythm games and you like games that make levels off of your music.","June 7, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly, it's weird.\n\nNotes are pretty exact, but they don't quite give a feel of rhythm other than the long notes. Now this may be a jarring flaw but i'll give it a benefit of doubt. As to why, it's because the visuals really hamper the player's ability to notice and react to oncoming notes (relying on sound is good but there's different buttons).\n\nThe speed of the game ( mostly when melody's sprinting ) really drives it to become more reaction-based though, and the visuals just add fuel to the fire and makes it almost impossible for anyone starting out to get used to the game easily.\n\nFor the visuals, it's really smooth, it's so smooth i could just watch it for hours. Unfortunately, sometimes when it lags (due to weaker PCs) it becomes rather painful to see.\n\nI also expect weaker eyes to break easily, as I would rate myself rather durable when it comes to tolerating disorienting effects on the computer screen. It was close to bringing me to pain.\n\nThe music loading is fast and informational, it even warns me if my the game isn't quite compatible with the song I am loading in.\n\nUltimately, I would recommend this game, it's fun to play, it's fun to watch, and it lets you load your own music. I'm looking forward to future updates to improve the experience.\n\nIt's in Early Access and should be given some breathing space for its flaws.\nSo I'll throw out some things i noticed and think should be fixed here:\n\nAudio feedback from hitting notes ( i really hope this comes in, preferably customizable)\n\nOn non-intense mode, the directional keys don't seem to function properly... it shocked me that when i tried to play using directional when starting for the obstacles... and nothing seemed to be working... and almost thought i wasted money\n\nLarger notes for when you're not flying, probably sprinting... it's really hard to see with every thing rushing by at the moment.\n\nEnd.\n\n\n\n\n","February 27, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've tried a very wide variety of genres and the only genre the game seems to have trouble with is metal, in every case I tested the song took place 90% of the time in air sequences. All other genres are detected without issue, and the commands follow the beat.\n\nThere are rhythm games on Steam where the song doesn't seem to have much impact on the game, like Beat Hazard, or when it tries to generate commands it doesn't do it very well and often times doesn't match the song, like Rhythm Zone. Melody's Escape is up there with Audiosurf as a well-programmed, unique and very fun rhythm experience. If you're a fan of the genre you owe it to yourself to pick this one up.\n\nIt's also worth noting that even though the game is in Early Access right now, it feels very complete. At the moment there aren't global leaderboards and the game seems sparse on options, I'm not sure if either of those will be expanded on. But as it is right now, it does everything it sets out to do without issue.

Depending on your own personnal preferences, you can choose to have a relaxing experience or a very intense one thanks to 3 difficulty settings:\nRelaxing - Each intensity movement mode requires the same button/key press for all obstacles; a relaxing way to enjoy your music.\nNormal - The type of obstacles (and associated color input) depends on the musical key of each specific beat.\nIntense - The complete gameplay experience, keeping you on your toes! :)\nMelody's Escape also has a strong focus on voices and long held notes (wether it's violin or dubstep wub-wubs), giving you the opportunity to slide alongside the voice while it is held in the song. This makes playing on beautiful songs even more enthralling!","February 28, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly, it's weird.\n\nNotes are pretty exact, but they don't quite give a feel of rhythm other than the long notes. Now this may be a jarring flaw but i'll give it a benefit of doubt. As to why, it's because the visuals really hamper the player's ability to notice and react to oncoming notes (relying on sound is good but there's different buttons).\n\nThe speed of the game ( mostly when melody's sprinting ) really drives it to become more reaction-based though, and the visuals just add fuel to the fire and makes it almost impossible for anyone starting out to get used to the game easily.\n\nFor the visuals, it's really smooth, it's so smooth i could just watch it for hours. Unfortunately, sometimes when it lags (due to weaker PCs) it becomes rather painful to see.\n\nI also expect weaker eyes to break easily, as I would rate myself rather durable when it comes to tolerating disorienting effects on the computer screen. It was close to bringing me to pain.\n\nThe music loading is fast and informational, it even warns me if my the game isn't quite compatible with the song I am loading in.\n\nUltimately, I would recommend this game, it's fun to play, it's fun to watch, and it lets you load your own music. I'm looking forward to future updates to improve the experience.\n\nIt's in Early Access and should be given some breathing space for its flaws.\nSo I'll throw out some things i noticed and think should be fixed here:\n\nAudio feedback from hitting notes ( i really hope this comes in, preferably customizable)\n\nOn non-intense mode, the directional keys don't seem to function properly... it shocked me that when i tried to play using directional when starting for the obstacles... and nothing seemed to be working... and almost thought i wasted money\n\nLarger notes for when you're not flying, probably sprinting... it's really hard to see with every thing rushing by at the moment.\n\nEnd.\n\n\n\n\n","February 27, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm sure you do. Many will like a way to actually feel what happens when certain parts of a song come up. Melody's Escape is just that.\n\nMelody's Escape is like a "runner game meets Audiosurf". You take control of a girl named Melody and you need to guide her trough your own music library. Her speed adapts to the intensity of the music, from walking on calm parts, to flying when the music reaches it's peak intensity. The only limit is how many songs are in your music library.\n\nEven while running on my low-end computer, the frame rate is amazing. Sure, you have to tweak some options, but when you do, it becomes really smooth. But not TOO smooth :P The music tracking is still not perfect but hey! It's Early Access!

It strikes a solid balance of performance efficiency, visual appeal, and solid gameplay. Even the early release builds feel like a complete game, and the music interpretation algorithm has come a long way; most reviews decrying its accuracy seem like they were for very dated versions, because I've rarely run into problems where the constructed level didn't match the rhythm of the song. This game does demand a fair amount of skill, however, and it's usually a good idea to start with Relaxing difficulty and get a feel for timing windows before jumping straight into Normal or Intense.\n\nMy only real gripe is that sometimes the generated levels can be very repetitive in that the obstacles are set on a constant beat matching the tempo of the song, which can lead to eye strain if you're focusing really intently on which buttons you need to press. That, and sometimes the cliff dives can be unfair because the camera doesn't reveal the next obstacle until just a fraction of a second before you actually need to hit it. Still, this will probably be addressed before the game comes out of its early release stages.\n\ntl;dr this game is good enough I bothered to get all the achievements and write a review. 9/10","May 4, 2015","true","101.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've enjoyed every minute spent playing it and find it very easy to lose a couple hours without noticing in it. The biggest attraction to the game personally is the fact that it is driven entirely by your own music. I love my music and games that involve your personal music, such as audiosurf and this. I've bought a few games of this kind on steam and This and the first Audiosurf are my favourite at the moment.\n\nThe game looks really nice. It's a simple design, but it works well. The game has nice colours and they are incorporated quite well into the games play, with melody's hair and speed lines corresponding the the current colour of the song (in relaxing) or the colour of the last orb/arrow hit (in normal/intense.) There are different skins for melody, different hair, different colours for the background, etc. making the game's look customisible.\n\nSpeaking of which, there are mods! And hopefully once the game is fully released it will have a workshop. There is already a subforum in the forums dedicated to user mdos and edits to the notes, melody herself, background.\n\nThe developer, epsi, is a very cool guy who listens to the community and is constantly updating the game based on community feedback and personal opinion. In the short time I've had the game He's released multiple updates the game making it into a much finer product than the already good game I bought. Since the game is still in early access quite a few more change can be expected to come along to improve the game.\n\nOverall, this game is very fun in my opinion.

I picked it up for 3$ since I had some Steam Wallet funds left and two huge thumbs up...\n\nI've been watching this game for a while as it came out on Steam and saw some gameplay videos. I wasn't sure about picking it up, but since a Steam sale rolled around this time of year I finally took the plunge.\n\nPROS:\nThe method this thing uses to map out your music to a side-scrolling platformer game is phenomenal. The movements are super smooth, and the artistic use of silhouettes and darker shades against a background makes this awesome to play at night and chill out with a big headset cranked up as high as you can stand it. I've spent several hours in it already as it's caused me to go back and re-examine nearly my entire music library (some of which I'd forgotten about) to put the algorithm through its paces. Kudos to the developer for putting this together. I find myself baffled at the system.\n\nAnd the drops.. I get chills during my favorite songs!\n\nCONS:\nMy only small gripe is a technical one, and that is that there are noticeable micro-stutters sometimes when it seems to be streaming the level as the next part of the song approaches (possible prediction problem?), and inputs can be completely lost or swallowed up here and there seemingly at random times. Maybe add an option to calibrate similar to the way rhythm games on consoles do to lessen this or scale the "buffer" depending on difficulty. Take this criticism lightly because as I write this we're on version 0.7 of early access and this may change in future patches.\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n+ Add a playlist mode where songs cumulate to a score overall (think Set Lists in Rock Band).\n+ "Hardcore" mode where you only have a limited number of respawns. Lives remaining count toward score!\n+ Flipped mode to re-explore the same songs another time with a twist.\n+ Multiplayer in this would be sick! Battle your friend on a song of your choice.\n\nSUMMARY:\nOverall HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! If you need a rhythym game on your PC to pass the time with some great artistic taste and quality audio-processing this one's for you.

Since this is my first rhythm game, I can't say what, if any, features come standard in games of its kind or what's unique about it. That said, let's take a look pro/con-wise.\n\nTL;DR VERSION: fun, simple game, rather addictive once you get the hang of it; made for a pretty good intro to rhythm games imo; using my own music is great but not all music translates well (acoustic songs or "fuzzy" mastering rate poorly on compatibility); possibly better played with a keyboard rather than controller.\n\nLONG VERSION:\nPROS\n-use your own library OR in-game tracks\n-audio/visual latency calibration (can't vouch for how well it works though, didn't seem to change much tbh)\n-slick visual design with a bit of avatar customization\n-game will rate how well it can create levels out of songs (no tempo, poor, acceptable, good, excellent)\n-customizable difficulty (allows you to use existing difficulty settings as a template, then change things like respawn time and sensitivity)\n-flexible control scheme on controller (buttons and directions can be interchangeable on some difficulties)\n-it's FUN, which is really important!\n\nCONS\n-works best with only certain kinds of music (This is most things with a strong, heavy beat. Songs with "fuzzy" sounding keyboards/snares will confuse the game even if there is a good beat. Songs with predominantly acoustic instruments also do not rate well. Sorry, jazz and swing fans.)\n-probably best played with a keyboard (or my xbox controller is lame, but moving my thumb over the directional buttons caused a lot of mistakes while playing)\n-slightly confusing menu when navgating your own libraries for music (uses only directional keys, a designated "back" button might be nice for going up folder levels)\n-minor gripe: the "B" button/right direction icons are pink, and that's kind of confusing (I get it fits with the aesthetic, this isn't even really a complaint it's just me being petty)","May 22","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Melody herself will continuously run to the right as orbs and obstacles come towards her which requires corresponding buttons to be pressed in order to pass them.\n\nThe game itself comes with a handful of tracks itself, but the main feature of the game is that it can create levels based on your own music, which can be accessed by directly finding the files via the in-game file explorer, or alternatively you can drag files onto the game window itself to play them.\n\nAs the game relies on the algorithms to create levels, your experience with the game will be based on the genres of music you listen to, where clearer melodies will create much smoother levels. However, the algorithms are quite good, I've been able to play a variety of genres without much issues, such as Pop, EDM, Power Metal, Stoner Metal and Rock. The game will also often tell you how confident it is in the level creation.\n\nThe difficulty of the game, is very dependent on the setting you choose. There are 4 premade difficulty settings available, "Relaxing" is the easiest and it only uses one button at a time, Medium is the standard 4 button control scheme (W, A, S, D on a keyboard or Y, X, B, A / Triangle, Square, Circle, X for controller), "Intense" is mentioned as the full experience where you use the standard buttons for orbs but directional buttons for obstacles and finally there is "Overload" which is the standard buttons for orbs but requires both directional and standard buttons for obstacles in the same direction.\n\nAs you increase the difficulty, the tempo of the levels increase as does the variety in buttons required among other things. Luckily, there's a custom difficulty option that allows you to tailor your experience with options such as tempo, control schemes (Including a more difficult option where obstacles require differing directions for the obstacles and more varied buttons for orbs are used), grace periods and error margins. This both allows you to play a harder game if you desire but also lets you learn the more challenging controls at an easier tempo (I used it to progress from Intense difficulty up to Overload difficulty by using the Overload control scheme but at Intense tempo. I will also likely use it to progress into the most challenging control scheme once I'm confident enough)\n\nAll in all, the game is quite fun, it has a lot of customisation over difficulty to make a good place to learn rhythm games (Though, it doesn't appear to get to the mashy levels that many other rhythm games such as Guitar Hero or Project Diva get to) and due to it using your own music files, gaining new content is a simple as downloading (Or importing from a CD if you're old fashioned like me) new songs to play.\n\nMy only nit picks with the game are that the in-game file explorer can be a bit clunky at times (It also doesn't detect everything. I have some albums that it doesn't seem to find at all, but at least there's the option to drag them into the game manually) and that the favourite list doesn't seem to have a "Shuffle" function when using the "Play All" option, meaning that playing songs in a different order would require refavouriting everything each time.","May 28","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a great game to unwind to, and it actually does pretty well with syncing up to my music library (which has pretty much every genre except kids' and acid metal).  A few of my favorite songs actually match up perfectly.  It took me a while to get the timing down, as the different speeds can sometimes switch suddenly, but that's a personal problem and actually made me like the game more--  I felt a huge sense of accomplishment once I learned that skill.\n\nMy only problem is sometimes I'll wonder where it's getting the beats, and then I listen closer and realize it's getting it from a backing track that might be hard to hear.

So if theres a large drop coming the game then changes speed to Normal, fast and Super fast. Making you have a siezure from the colors. If you're wondering, 'can i change these colors?' yes. Yes you can.\n\nI love the amount of creativity when it comes to a game that simulates music beats into a obsticle track with favourite colors and characters. The community of Melody's Escape is fresh, so more will come, and new things will be implemented. So far not many songs or in-game characters are in the game but eventually they will update it.

Melody herself will continuously run to the right as orbs and obstacles come towards her which requires corresponding buttons to be pressed in order to pass them.\n\nThe game itself comes with a handful of tracks itself, but the main feature of the game is that it can create levels based on your own music, which can be accessed by directly finding the files via the in-game file explorer, or alternatively you can drag files onto the game window itself to play them.\n\nAs the game relies on the algorithms to create levels, your experience with the game will be based on the genres of music you listen to, where clearer melodies will create much smoother levels. However, the algorithms are quite good, I've been able to play a variety of genres without much issues, such as Pop, EDM, Power Metal, Stoner Metal and Rock. The game will also often tell you how confident it is in the level creation.\n\nThe difficulty of the game, is very dependent on the setting you choose. There are 4 premade difficulty settings available, "Relaxing" is the easiest and it only uses one button at a time, Medium is the standard 4 button control scheme (W, A, S, D on a keyboard or Y, X, B, A / Triangle, Square, Circle, X for controller), "Intense" is mentioned as the full experience where you use the standard buttons for orbs but directional buttons for obstacles and finally there is "Overload" which is the standard buttons for orbs but requires both directional and standard buttons for obstacles in the same direction.\n\nAs you increase the difficulty, the tempo of the levels increase as does the variety in buttons required among other things. Luckily, there's a custom difficulty option that allows you to tailor your experience with options such as tempo, control schemes (Including a more difficult option where obstacles require differing directions for the obstacles and more varied buttons for orbs are used), grace periods and error margins. This both allows you to play a harder game if you desire but also lets you learn the more challenging controls at an easier tempo (I used it to progress from Intense difficulty up to Overload difficulty by using the Overload control scheme but at Intense tempo. I will also likely use it to progress into the most challenging control scheme once I'm confident enough)\n\nAll in all, the game is quite fun, it has a lot of customisation over difficulty to make a good place to learn rhythm games (Though, it doesn't appear to get to the mashy levels that many other rhythm games such as Guitar Hero or Project Diva get to) and due to it using your own music files, gaining new content is a simple as downloading (Or importing from a CD if you're old fashioned like me) new songs to play.\n\nMy only nit picks with the game are that the in-game file explorer can be a bit clunky at times (It also doesn't detect everything. I have some albums that it doesn't seem to find at all, but at least there's the option to drag them into the game manually) and that the favourite list doesn't seem to have a "Shuffle" function when using the "Play All" option, meaning that playing songs in a different order would require refavouriting everything each time.","May 28","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I certainly did. Though I will say it does have some shortcomings.\n\nVisuals look clean for what it is. Minimalistic and with vibrant colors. Melody's design certainly has that anime aesthetic which clearly isn't much of a problem for me. An added plus is the fact that you could mod Melody's appearance, and I plan to mess with that later on. While I do like the visuals, some representations of some hold arrow notes took me a while to figure out how long they should be held. While some are clearly distinguishable, others (slightly impressed grounds) aren't so clearly visible. I think a white motion path (or white outline along the slightly impressed ground) that changes color as you go along with it would help first time players.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, I really liked how it played. Easier difficulties from Relaxing to Medium is easy understand. It's when you start having to use Both WASD and the Arrow Keys where things start to get confusing and difficult. And I think that's fine, since all I say to that is practice! Now one of the main draws to this game is the ability to use your own music. And does it work...? Well, I think it's hit or miss. The game tries to detect a 4/4 measure. And if it doesn't, it relies on the waveforms audio peaks. While the few songs I had worked for the former, it went well, but with the later, that's where we start hitting the miss territory. Granted it still works for what it is, but sometimes I wish it did detect notes I would expect it to detect. I feel like this game would benefit from a map editor because generated maps aren't perfect, and I'd personally like to go into it and improve what the game generated for me. That personally would have sold it for me.\n\nOverall, I like this game. Definitely would recommend for Casuals, but Hardcores might wanna wait till this game is discounted (which was the case for me) before one considers this game. And if the game is still worked on for improvements, even better! I honestly do hope that's the case because I wanna see more coming from this.","May 22","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I first saw it, my expectations weren't high actually. But the gme proved to be a lot better than I expected. You dont feel like playing the insturments of the song of course, but you usually get the feeling of the song. First I tried some soundtracks. Surprisingly for me, the program was able to detect music with vocals a whole lot better than those without vocals. The energy peaks tempo arrangement is the final choice of the game when it cant find the tempo and its definetly not what the game has to offer. I mean it sometimes gets the rhyme right but thats it. However each time it finds a stable tempo, you get to experience you music in a brand new way. And I say it does a pretty good job with it.

The best way to spend a couple of minutes without any thoughts and ideas. Easy enough to relax and enjoy, hard enough to keep you focused on action. And, of course, your favourite music is here.

You have to start hitting targets early, and then the next one feels too close.\n\nNormal is difficult, and the easier difficulty leaves the game monochromatic, while not much easier.\n\nAlso I missed a tutorial on how the stuff worked so it took me several tries to figure everything out.","February 26, 2014","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And THIS fit the bill perfectly.\n\nWhile it's Early Access, I do feel that it is amongst one of the more complete Early Access titles on the Steam store nowadays. The basics of the gameplay are already well-versed: you control this rather cute* girl, perhaps the titular Melody, as she walks, runs, jumps over or ducks under obstacles, kicks apart other obstacles, even flies, while you mash the keys on your keyboard in a game not too dissimilar to Dance Dance Revolution or Guitar Hero.\n\nIt's a rather refreshing take on the genre as a 2D sidescroller rhythm game. The only downside I've seen is that since you're focusing more on the buttons you need to hit, you'll get eye strain and observe motion blur after a while, so don't play this for too long at a time.\n\nThe game also has Steam Workshop support, so you can customise your playing field anyway you like. You can customise Melody's attire, hair, and even the colour background/scheme. It's a cool way to personalise the game to however you want it to be. Here's an example of what you are capable of.\n\nFinally, the game engine is one of the best I've seen, and can certainly rival Audiosurf. Beat detection and vocal detection is superb, with well-placed sliding segments where you have to hold down the key during a vocal section.\n\nI'll end off with the following statement from their presskit[www.melodysescape.com]: "Icetesy is an indie game company from Belgium, with a passion for music generated gameplay." I hope this means more of this kind of game from them. I'm stoked.\n\n*It should be pointed out that she's but a silhouette. But still, a rather sexy and cute silhouette at that.\n\nWhen to buy: Early Access so don't expect it to get discounted too much. Lowest I've seen it go is $7.49 USD as of the Steam Holiday Sale 2014.\n\nEA+++/10 (Very highly polished and high potential.

Each level is a song in your music collection of choice. Sadly, though, the game doesn't contain any preset tunes, but that's okay as long as you've got a thick selection to choose from. The game doesn't feature any campaign or story, for that matter, but perhaps that would ruin the charm. The game, aside from it's core components (which I remind you are top notch), is rather barren to say the least. Perhaps some menu music (FOR YOUR MUSIC GAME) and some more background elements would help, but I don't know. Local Multiplayer sounds perfect for this title, with 2-4 different players fighting for that perfect score (of course, not colliding). By now, you may be thinking I've been pretty harsh on the game and wondering why I recommend this, and with my answer comes the game's saving grace: Early Access! Just because these notable features aren't included in the game DOES NOT mean they won't be included, because this isn't the final product. While quite a few people I know are always skeptical about this Steam feature after multiple particular blunders (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE), but the devs seem pretty good about it so far. And don't forget that lovely Steam Workshop.\nOn to the actual gameplay, however! In this humble little game, you control the mysterious Melody as she runs away from, uh, something probably really dangerous and stuff. Yeah, that. It must be really dangerous, though, because she'd rather not face it head-on but instead take the scenic HELL OBSTACLES OF HELL route. Yep, this game isn't as easy as it may lead on. In fact, you better start off with Relaxing mode before even touching 'Normal', or you're gonna have a bad time. Now, slide your headphones on and take a trip through Melody's musical drops, hurdles, and slides, all synced to your chosen song! I have to say that for all the frustration and guilt (Melody's animations when she fails most obstacles are hard to watch) I had starting off, when you get that perfect ranking, you feel like a god. While some songs don't work well, or in some cases, not at all, the ones that do work REALLY work. I'd be sure to have the zoom all the way out, however, or you'll get one hell of a headache. If you can manage, I'd also suggest a 360 controller.\n\nFinal Statement: It looks like you can run away from your problems after all.\n83/100","October 24, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Melody's Escape has the potential to be the best rhythm game of this generation; The concept is simple, like any game of this genre - press the right buttons with the right timing, with the hardest difficulty adding an additional directional button press in songs. It works well, my only problem is that it's EXTREMELY easy to get confused at first - you'll be pressing B instead of X instead of A instead of Y for a good long time, worsened by the exactness of the timing. This can be mitigated with practice though, and that's the name of the game for this genre.\n\n\nThe music detection is as spot on as I've ever seen, especially nice is that it changes the algorithm used depending on what kind of music you're playing. It handles almost every song I throw at with aplomb - from metal to electronic even to more downtempo, ambient stuff.\n\nThe aesthetic is minimal - the screenspace is mostly black, with a soft, dark background to add a little contrast - a good choice as you want minimal distractions from the demanding gameplay. Melody herself is generally very fluid in her animations, flowing from one maneuvre to the next easily, while her hair adds a welcome splash of colour as it changes through the song. As of right now there isn't much in the way of personalisation but that has been declared as one of the things to be added shortly.\n\nMy main beef on the graphical side is that it starts to hurt the eyes after a while because of the motion blur - if you have a 120Hz monitor the game will shine but for 60Hz plebs like me it can get a bit painful over extended periods.\n\nOn the audio front, it's quiet. Aside from the menu music and effects you don't hear much in the way of ingame effects, with your music being the absolute focus of the game.\n\nOverall, Melody's Escape is a very good rhythm game and well worth trying out for fans of the genre. It's feature set is a bit minimal but that's to the plus - it's focused on what it does and it does it well.\n\n","February 26, 2014","true","19.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The synchronization is SO AWESOME!!! I seriously can not compare the synchronization to any other music game except Audiosurf. Now know that if you do get the game, it will be a bit tricky to get the hang of, but once you continue playing it gets easier.\n\n*EDIT*\nI have played a wide range of tunes at different BPM and all of them seem so synchronized it's like Magic. That includes Rock, Classic, Pop, Electronic, Dubstep, Country, I mean I seriously tried a lot of different things and they are all awesome to play. (Yes, even listening to Classical music was awesome!)\n\nThe whole concept is incredible with Melody doing a lot of awesome things while at the same time you need to keep your eye on what button to press next because they can fly by really fast. While at the same time, you have to keep the rhythm in mind or else you will fall and not get a good score. So this music game definitely will put your skills to the test.\n\nAt the moment though there seems to be issues with ghosting, or motion blurs, to be precise. Notes almost are shown double as you come up to them. This is the only major issue with the game however it is still possible to play. You just have to hope to get use to it until the updates come in.\n\nWhy am I still typing out this review?!

While I love the way the colors change which the tempo of the game, it has nothing in comparison to Audio Surf as an example, nor anywhere near the customization. I KNOW it's in Early Access, but it's something.\n\nThat isn't my main point though. For me at the very least, THIS GAME CAUSES ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE EYESTRAIN. While fun, the game actually becomes physcially painful to play within 10 minutes of play. I don't get motion sickness (unless it's on boats) and no other games have ever caused this for me. The first 30 minutes I played gave me a pounding headache.\n\nThe last thing I have to barb at would be the aesthetics. I know I said I like them, but they're very limited. Play through two songs and you've seen everything. If you want to drop $10 on something that may give you eye strain but could be something to visit once a day for a song or two, then go for it, but i'd recommend you wait until further updates.\n\nWhile I like the game, I feel as if I got ripped off a bit here.","September 29, 2014","false","2.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Being a bad gamer myself, I like the fact you can't actually die and that the game just lets you complete the song. The levels of intensity also aren't bad and teach the player how to add in the components of the game one aspect at a time. I'm also glad the game is controller compatible because the game is 1000 times easier to play on controller than keyboard and mouse(especially on a laptop). I will state that sometimes the basic of the game may get a bit boring, for most of the levels stick to the basic beat of the song. While sometimes this hinders the game, I usually focus more on the song I'm playing before the fact that sometimes the patterns get boring.

It's a fun way to enjoy your own music in an emersive atmosphere. I truely love the fact i can use my own music, because then I can do two of the things i love at the same time: listening to music and gaming. Being a bad gamer myself, I like the fact you can't actually die and that the game just lets you complete the song. The levels of intensity also aren't bad and teach the player how to add in the components of the game one aspect at a time. I'm also glad the game is controller compatible because the game is 1000 times easier to play on controller than keyboard and mouse(especially on a laptop). I will state that sometimes the basic of the game may get a bit boring, for most of the levels stick to the basic beat of the song. While sometimes this hinders the game, I usually focus more on the song I'm playing before the fact that sometimes the patterns get boring. I have already recommended and showed off this game to multiple of my friends and am still trying to spread word of this game to anyone whos interested in a simple but pretty addictive rythm game featuring whatever music you please!","October 18, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And I must say I'd never had something so apt... Instant buy and no regrets after a bunch of these on that song- especially the chorus:\n\n"And we run, with a lonely heart\nAnd we run, for this killing love\nAnd we run, 'till the heavens above\nYeah we run, running in the dark\nAnd we run, 'till we fall apart\nAnd we run, 'till the heavens above"\n\nVery worth it.\n\nProbably better to start with less beats per minute though- I started at 126, which is a fast paced song. I found 90 to be nice and smooth. The whole reason I only have 1 hour (at current writing) on it is because I needed sleep and have homework to do for uni, I need breaks and games like these are the best for it.","February 26, 2014","true","2.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MCSMeister/recommended/270210/","MCSMeister","MCSMünster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MCSMeister/","114 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo I'm actually kind of on the verge of recommending and not recommending Melody's Escape. I'll explain, of course, but in the end I do recommend this - just to a certain crowd of gamers.\n\nNow, I have previously reviewed Audiosurf, and after finishing everything I wanted to do in Melody's Escape I moved on to Beat Hazard. All three of these games are similar in the whole "play your own music" motif, but each game has vastly different gameplay mechanics. And I have to admit, out of these three "play your own music" games, Melody's Escape did the least for me. Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible game, just not a fantastic one in my eyes.\n\nIn short, Melody's Escape is a running game set to your music. You control a female protagonist named Melody and tap certain directional keys to correspond with obstacles, such as sliding, jumping, and kicking through blocks. There are sections for each type of intensity, as well. The background changes to a slightly hotter color and the scenery moves faster as the intensity of a song builds up. On top of this, there are also slow-motion sections of long jumps for cooldown segments of songs, which I think is quite a nice touch despite being rare, as I've only encountered such sections maybe 3 or 4 times out of the hundred-ish songs I played. Finally, there are multiple difficulties you can choose from. The easiest has you press only one directional key for each section of a song, and the hardest has you use both WASD and arrow controls for certain types of obstacles, which poses a substantial challenge.\n\nHowever, besides the decent gameplay, this game has a few issues for me. First off, the visuals in this game are very basic and bland, and the game isn't nearly as visually appealing as Audiosurf or Beat Hazard. Even the menu looks rather boring. Unlike other rhythm games I've played, Melody's Escape features no music on the menu, and I think that's a nice facet that rhythm games ought to have. In Melody's Escape, the menu is just silence, save for the minimal "beep" sounds that you hear when selecting options on the menu.\n\nThere is also very little to do in this game and minimal incentives. There isn't a sort of leveling up system or anything to unlock, nor leaderboards for songs, rendering your high score on songs to not have much purpose. The only real incentive in this game is the 8 achievements, which are all relatively easy to get if you're going for them. It only took me around 8 hours to get them all. After that, it comes down to merely playing for fun. And I'm not a huge fan of games that are solely made to pass time unless there's actual incentives or things you can do afterwards.\n\nAnyways, if you want more of a "for-fun" rhythm game customized to your music to pass the time with, Melody's Escape would be a good purchase for you. If you're into games with more of an incentive and contain more for you to do, consider Audiosurf or Beat Hazard instead. However, keep in mind this game is still in Early Access as I write this and is probably awaiting a few changes, so I can hope that some of its issues will get fixed in forthcoming updates.","January 6, 2015","true","8.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Now I will elaborate why and even state some of the cons for others that are interested.\n\nPro's:\n\nGameplay:\nI actually feel the difference between the difficulty levels, though I will note I have not tried nor do I know how to play on the most difficult setting. The game makes figureing it out for yourself possible.\n\nGraphics:\nIt's fully customizable mind you, even your runner is easily customized using mods or making them! yourself.\n\nSound/Music:\nIt's your own music, Let the game suit your tast, the rest of the sounds are so unobtrusive I don't notice them.\n\nCon's\n\nGameplay:\nI really can't nit pick anything besides the score bored being to high, If it were lower down checking how you were doing would be less likely to mess you up, but honestly It's fine as is.\n\nGraphics:\nThis game will RIP your eyes out of their sockets and REM them from reality. (Unless I don't know you change the video settings?)\n\nSound/Music:\nIf you're music library doesn't exist I admit you should probably get on that because you need music to play.","February 12, 2015","true","11.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I cannot play this game for more than 15 minutes at a time, it just causes a headache. It's supposed to be better with higher refresh rate displays. Also the fact that the dark orb outlines were removed in one of the updates doesn't make things any better, now they re even more blurry.\n\n- bugs : game says you failed a move even though you timed it perfectly and the animation played, this happens quite often after respawning\n\n- the trailer on the store page is outdated, the in game orbs now look different and no longer have defined edges which is a problem, considering the blurrines of the screen. Flying was also removed and is unlikely to come back, according to the developer.\n\nFor the reasons above - I don't recommend it. I bought this game hoping for a relaxing experience that plays well with the music and ironically - it does not. What's even the point if the game doesn't follow the rhythm correctly?

If you purchase this game and DON'T like electronic music, then you will probably hate this game. If you do, however, Melody's Escape towers above it's main competition, Audiosurf. It's a beautiful game, with a lovely art style (very minimalist).

There have been few music/beat hit games that are enjoyable, such as Osu! and Stepmania. This is one to add to that list if you're a big fan of rhythm games.\n\nOverall a great game even in early access in my opinion.\n\nPros:\n-Colorful and vibrant to look at.\n-Your own music can be played.\n-You technically can't fail a song and be forced to restart.\n-Accurate rhythm transcription.\n-Female protagonists are awesome.\n\nCons:\n-Somewhat difficult.\n-Eye strain!\n-Limited customization on protagonist.\n\nSuggestions:\n-Work on the eye strain problem.\n-Sometimes notes are delayed and make the game difficult, but not much.\n-Variety is the spice of life: add more colors, protagonist customization, background, etc.\n-Online leaderboard for songs?\n-Utilize the workshop to create custom maps with songs.\n-Online mode to compete with others for highest score or best accuracy.","February 28, 2014","true","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That being said I LOVE THIS GAME. It does do a very good job with your music and putting it to a beat to press with the keys.\n\nThat being said the reason why i give it 3/5 is because there are a few issues.\n1. I the sencitivity from key press to responce is very weird and for the highh level WASD doesnt seem to work well which im a WASD man so even if i am at the skill level of the upper 2 dificulties i cant realy do them because i suck with the ariow keys XD.\n2. I wish there was a little bit more dynamic key pushing instead of up down left right...honestly all i want is a feture where you have to hold down those keys...i have seen this in the game but only on 2 songs and ony while walking/moving very slowly and even if it just happens to be my songs i do wish they could diversify some of the beats....just as long as it does not compromize the rythm set up they have because it is AMAZING atm.\n3. i have had some issues with syncing MP3 but that is probibly just my problem and not the game\n\nMelodys escape is a fantastic game well worth the 10$ it costs quire frankly i think its well worth a little more.\n\n\n\nside note i wish they would allow you to make your custome...set...track where you play ur song do your beats free style and then able to replay your free styled game mode....if that makes any snce at all lol","September 27, 2014","true","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Play perfectly until thirty seconds remain in the song.\n\n4. Think about how well you are doing, think about your finger movement, remember what the song's lyrics were (if present), look at the background and think whether or not it moves corresponding ot the song, try to remember that green is DEFINITELY down.\n\n5.

It is definitely possible to go crosseyed playing this game, so play in small doses. It technically works with every song, but in my few hours it only works with a few, as it varies the tracks depending on the song, like audiosurf, but some songs are sadistic even on the easiest difficulty which only requires 1 button push thought at a time.\n\nI do recommend this, but only to people who love very fast paced games and who also have very quick reactions, as for casual players the sense of speed is too great, or at least it is for me.","April 28, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And it will surely worth its price, IF some improvements can be made.\n\n1. The move sometime don't match up with the rhythm, maybe it's due to the music I choose , but I do hope that developers can improve the system of analyzing music.\n2. Movement/Action of the character isn't smooth enough at some point. (Sorry I'm obsessives.)\n3. I hope players will be allow to make their own levels and share them on the workshop. (Another way to solve the problem of music analyzing system)\n\nFor now, I give it 9/10 for its current state, and I don't regret for paying $9.99 for it.

You basically have to use buttons to hit a certain direction or orb in time with the beat in the song you choose. It can be relaxing on the lower difficulty if you just want a game ot chill with, or if you're looking for a challenge it certainly gives it to you on the harder settings. The animation style is very smooth, and the colours and graphics are very appealling to the eye. It manifests a level/obstacles based on whatever track you wish to use, and it does it very accurately, I was even surprised that even drawn out/slowmo parts of my song were also demonstrated as such in the gameplay.\n\nSo if you're looking for a fun addictive time filler, and love your music as I do, this would be a great game for you !","August 24, 2015","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The character and its visuals look really cool, but the motion blur and the background scrolling makes you want to literally puke.\n\nYou cannot focus on the notes at all since everything comes at you with a blur. Games like Beat Hazard with huge flashy visuals doesn't do this to you, most likely because the screen doesn't move with a huge blurriness. I couldn't play the game more than 5 minutes with default settings so I had to alter the zoom to minimum with no background scrolling, which made the game a bit more bearable. The gameplay is very minimal and gets very repetitive after awhile (a common issue with these types of games), different modes and unlocks would be good. Custom settings for the course should be used.\n\nThe game needs to get rid of the blur. Better input system and better looking "platforms".\nI recommend buying/playing the game when you get no more headaches after couple minutes or in a sale if you really want to try it out by yourself. I will keep my eye on the game and hopefully it will get better over time, for now I can't recommend this game.\n\n(Game was reviewed on Version 0.8.0.0)\n\nNew update with minor changes, nothing that would change my opinion yet.

Has potential I suppose. But if you want to play this on a keyboard, think twice before buying this. The clikcing of your keys up and down make the beats a bit hard to hit and make it really confusing and frustrating. Now this might be alot of fun on a controler, but it's certanly not on a keyboard. The modes of play are frustrating as well, I find that a lot of my music for relaxing mode just plays in one cycle of gameply ( theres like 5 different modes of running) and it just gets repettive after a while. Also on relaxing it dosent seem that there is much varience in the music, like you're bacily just hitting one key for the beat the whole song. And you may be saying "Just play it on normal mode then." There is no "normal" it bumps right up to medium and hardcore and then insaine. Its just too difficult to play it on medium with the keyboard as well.

These are my reasons.\n\n1. The motion blur is as bad as everyone is saying. Playing by sight is very hard because you can't watch everything. its almost easier to just play with your eyes closed and guess what to do.\n\n2. The beat and rhythm detection  is honestly not that great. Now this may just be me, because everyone else seems to be fine. But for me, trying to press a button when you think it would be on the song is wrong. And even doing it when the screen tells you seems to be wrong. Which admittedly could be a lag issue. still though, it seems to have issues.\n\nThe game is in early access so maybe these problems will be fixed. But if i were you, wait for the games full release. I would not say it is worth it in the current state. Lots of potential though.\n\n5/10","March 20, 2015","false","4.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Granted, it is still Early Access, so it still has a chance to improve.\n\nThe biggest issue is the framerate. Any song longer than about 2:30 min. will start to dip. Once the frames start dropping to below 50, things get jittery and the purpose of the rhythm game is rendered impossible due to mismatched timing between input and visuals. The input prompts also look blurry in motion, making the in-air prompts (circles with non-arrow directional graphics), very hard to read. Same goes for the obstacle prompts: They are arrows, but they're so small that the blurriness also makes them hard to read. If it weren't for the color coding, they'd be impossible to read in fast segments. In fact, some workshop items changes all the colors to a single one, making the game almost unplayable. My suggestion here would be to replace ALL the prompts with arrows large enough that they are clear even during fast segments.\n\nAnd the other huge issue -and really the biggest failure- is the rhythm detection program itself. Unless you're playing a very crisp clear dance number with strong steady beats, you're in for disappointment. Unlike Audiosurf, which was more of a obstacle-avoidance racing game that had difficulty based on music intensity, Melody's Escape tries to actually map out prompts to beats and rhythms. Sometimes it works (like dance music), other times it just looks like the game put a bunch of randomized prompts all over the place with little regard to the song. It's the same problem with any rhythm game that tries to read your music. When you see DDR or other AAA rhythm titles, their gameplay is always superior because each track is specially engineered; not just run through an algorithm.\n\nSo until at least the graphical issues are addressed, I can't recommend this game to anyone.","May 1, 2015","false","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

I assume this is because there is a random assortment of the WASD keys instead of a believable rythym like W-A-W-A.\n- The actual timing itself is a bit weird; the perfect rating is at the edge of the character's model, not the middle where I assumed it to be. This gets hard to control when the game moves much faster.\n- Having to hit a series of keys at X BPM for given amount of time can absolutely destroy your fingers. A 6 minute song will require about 3 minutes of relaxation to get your fingers ready for the next song.\n\nI like the concept but the fast camera and the difficulty in normal seems like it should be Intense.

How ever the difficulty for this game even on easy is hard so hard that in my opinion it'd make you say how the hell can you call this easy, and the visuals are nowhere near good enough to make up for the difficulty of this game. So if you enjoy playing hard as hell games that have you use your music as the level then this is a ok game if you're like me and prefer games that are moderately hard and when you put it on easy for difficulty it really feels easy not like you're still on 1 of the harder difficulties.\nEdit: To give the game the benefit of the doubt I did what the developer who commented on this review suggested and set the graphics quality to low to see if that would make the game more responsive, and thus easier to play while on at least on easy mode. While it did get the game to be more responsive and thus a little easier to play its still a little hard even easy mode, but that might just be because I haven't played it since I bought it which as the time I'm writing this review is now a year ago, and even then I stopped playing it after a day because it was a little hard for my taste. So as of right now I'll say the games difficulty lvls are questionable on whether or not each 1 is still really hard, because I've got to get more practice before saying whether its easy to play on easy or not, however because I think the developer/s should still put a little more effort into the artwork as in the design of say for example melody. She looks to dull she doesn't any near as visually pleasing as other music game characters like say for Hatsune Miku her design looks great however melody needs more detail just my opinion. Also the background art could also look a little better they also look a bit on the dull side and could either use a little more detail like melody or a totally new design, and if I have to pay for it as a dlc to get better over all artwork for the game then fine so long as its not the same price as the game then I'm willing and I'll even change the not recommend to recommend.","September 23, 2015","false","16.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","3"

Do something about it.\n\nFlaw the second: The music analysis isn't *great* - Don't get me wrong, it's pretty good, but it's nowhere near on par with Audiosurf's - The track doesn't get any harder in more chaotic parts of songs, and it doesn't always sync up brilliantly.\n\nEarly access, so I'm sure both of these will be fixed, but for now I just can't recommend it as much as I enjoy it.","May 4, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Its like a fast paced Mario runner with your own sound track. If it was more like guitar hero where you could see the buttons a bit more instead of flat then that might have helped. As is I couldnt recommend.\n\n--Edit Developer was kind enough to explain some things, and while the adustments to the settings did make the game playable and the eye strain is gone. Its alright and developer did a good job. I still can't recommend this game perhaps because audiosurf genre put a very high bar to meet.

However I feel this game isn't worth the money (Even if its cheap) for what seems to me a pretty terrible system of playing "To the beat" of your songs.\n\nI already want to start with a simple fact. You are buying a game that generates the levels for you. Thats all the work that they need to put into making this. The rest is you using songs other people have made and being pleased with the outcome that in my opinion masks how terrible this generator can be.\n\nThe songs I used ranged a lot in quality and I played on all the difficulties to test whether or not the reason I felt the songs I was playing felt horrible was not based on how many notes they shoved in. I played Kanye, The 1975, Deadmau5 and countless others I can't be bothered to name. I feel like this game appeals to and pleases the people who mindlessly play in full belief that they are playing "To the beat" The truth is you are not most of the time. Sure if you want to just click away pretending you are playing "To the beat" because every so often you hear a beat as you click a note then be my guest. Many of the reviews are positive saying "Feels good" or the reviews are the usual joke reviews that actually offer no real information... I don't understand these people. All you have to do is actually pay attention to the song and you will notice that half the notes are just shoved in as filler and when the song has a part with a decent beat for some reason the generator ignores this and sends the character into a long note instead of several small ones "To the beat" This sytem of the level changing as the pace gets faster (or slower) is also pretty terrible. Several songs will go into full swing and the generator keeps my character in the same speed (yellow) The yellow speed is basically Melody (The character) at full running speed. This is a decent speed however when the song is at full swing with so much going on your adrenaline should be pumping for some reason the generator doesn't boost you into the pink speed in which Melody is flying at the fastest speed she can go. Every time this happened I would actually get angry because it feels so out of place and when I get angry at the game I start to loose focus and miss notes. Something to add is several times while at full speed the song might quickly drop to a slow speed for no more than 1-2 seconds I mean this in the sense that the creator of the song may have a quick drop in speed as part of the song or in something like Kanye when he takes a breath mid way through a verse. The generator sadly ruins the whole pace and suddenely my character is walking along at the slowest speed for literally 2 seconds then boosts to full again. It feels so horrible and looks terrible.\n\nThe difficulties are another issue. I don't think they are "Hard" instead the harder you go on the list the more notes they shove in your face. Not to mention when I played the highest difficulty the notes where still out of place. They placed more notes but most of them were still not "To the beat" You might think me quoting "To the beat" is getting repetative? Well that's because this game strives of it being a rythm game. If your main selling point is playing "To the beat" then I'd hope that I didn't sit there getting mad everytime the song just does not work. Some songs work well, the best song I played so far was "Endless fantasy" by Anamanaguchi. The song picked up in the right areas and I noticed a lot of notes hitting in time. However when I put this song into the highest difficulty it was terrible again. Parts of the song where one single note was in the song the game decides because this is the highest difficulty it will shove several notes one after another at different colours etc etc. That isn't good or even decent in my eyes. It's pointless.......\n\nBasically buy this game in a sale and you can play it if have nothing else to play or maybe your internet is down and you are unable to log into Counter strike or some other game that needs internet. This game is good if you are happy with feeling like you are playing "To the beat" until you really take notice. Maybe I am just too picky but if a game is going to make me pay to use songs others made with the promise it will feel fluent and good then I am going to be very picky about this. I paid £3.99 for this and at the moment I have played less then 2 hours and don't intend to play much more unless I really am scraping the bottom of the barrel for something to do.","May 23","false","1.4"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","2"

A risky design decision to say the least.\n\nYou have the option of listening to any Celine Dion song you want from any of her many albums, so long as you already purchased the albums. If you don't have them on your hard drive yet, though, you will first have to spend several hundred dollars to buy all the Celine Dion albums.  I highly recommend running to  "I Drove all Night" if you really want to get a feel for the way the game is meant to be played.\n\nIt is one of those rare gems of a game that allows you to keep feeling like you are playing long after you quit for the night. The massive migrane and pain from the eye strain you get from tracking blurry orbs back and forth can last for hours. The background is also blurry, which helps amplify the effect and make sure you are always starring at blurred images or bright, neon colors - a great combination for eye strain.","February 27, 2014","false","8.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Objects, backgrounds and effects move way too quickly with any fast-paced song, most noticable with electronic(or EBM), industrial, techno, house or rock and similair music. I believe this causes an manifactured problem with motion blur, unique to the liquid crystals in LCD monitors that in this case cover the entire screen. It didn't take more than 2 songs before extreme headaches and eyepain forced me to give up and quit. Most parts of the game I couldn't keep track of anything on screen and i couldn't hit anything.\n\nYou should look up and read on LCD motion blur before you decide to buy this game to see if it applies to your monitor because the exact best combination of refresh rate and response time seems to be vaguely defined. Appearantly there is nothing you can do to fix this besides getting a new monitor. The developer recommends sitting far from your monitor and play with a gamepad. I can't test if this helps myself, so decide with caution if you'll buy this game with a monitor like mine.(Which is an BenQ G2420HD in case you also have one).\n\nThere is far too much running distance between each note so you run too quickly to get there. I'm not quite sure how this could be fixed, because moving the notes closer to eachother would mean you'd have to increase the amount of obstacles displaying on-screen aswell.\n\nIf you look past the blur problem then the game seems kind of fun, very reminiscent of Audiosurf/Guitar Hero in terms of matching beats/tempo to button presses and "Super Crazy Guitar Maniac Deluxe"(The browser flash game) in terms of layout and gameplay. The songs are calculated and plays neatly and the level design is fine, maybe a little boring and unforgiving. I'l warn you now, the difficulty curve is extreme beyond the first difficulty, and it often seems like there is no rhyme or reason to the directions of the orbs/arrows you time your keypresses to, or it just takes a while to get used to, which I can' t because of the blur problem.\n\nIn its current state the game wasn't worth my money. But I will recommend this title for now because it has shown great improvement and potential, of course I still wont recommend it to people with a monitor similair to mine.\n\nOBS!: Read the community forums before purchase!","February 26, 2014","true","1.7"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","7","26","0","3"

You basically tap along the beat in accordance with the color and directional ques on the screen.\n\nMelody Escape has, let me tell you this frankly, just about the best beat detection in a music game I have EVER played! It is also a "true" rhythm game, unlike stuff like Audiosurf which merely masquerade as one.\n\nGame is not easy, and it will take just a while for even seasoned rhythm gamers to get warmed up. You start off at Relaxing difficulty, move up to Normal and then all hell breaks loose (or is it your fingers go out of control?) in Intense difficulty.\n\nThe game uses your own music and doesn't have any built-in music for now. I've played across a range of BPMs, and some songs with varying tempos....and the game takes them all on its chin.\n\nControls can be edited to your liking, as can the visual effects be tuned.\n\nSo yeah, this one here is a resounding recommendation on my part if you like rhythm games. It is almost a no-brainer given its amazing and revolutionary I might say beat detection technology.","February 26, 2014","true","8.8"," 8 of 60 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","8","60","0","0"

It syncs up with your music to create a unique experience so that no two songs have the same exact obstacle layout. Syncing tends to work better with songs that have a dance/eletronic sound to them but the game still works well with all genres. I've even tried it with classical music just to see what would happen and it's surprisingly quite relaxing!\nFor those just starting out, it can be quite challenging at first. If Melody were an actual person I think she would have died just from my first time playing this game due to me missing the keys and making her crash into walls, fall on her face, and even dive off of cliffs. I'm much better at this than I used to be and I still unintentionally put her through physical abuse whenever I mess up.\nI would definitely recommend this to music lovers like myself, or to anyone in general really. It's an easy game to get hooked onto and very fun. If you're still unsure, watch some gameplays of it on YouTube. That should be enough to convince you into getting this game or not.","February 4, 2015","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s much like DDR in that you follow along with music and react based on the tone and lyrics. The game is extremely fun in its simplicity and visually pleasing. The appeal for me is that you can import any song you have and it will use an algorithm to create a new level based off of the song of your choice. While this may work better for some songs then others I have found the overall effect and performance of the system to be quite satisfactory. Since I’m not very good at these games I have trouble actually enjoying watching the character while trying to concentrate on hitting all the buttons on time. That is when auto play mode comes in. You can select this play mode to have the character automatically play threw the game for you while you sit back and watch. It may sound silly but it is actually a lot of fun. Even though this review is written in early access I feel the game already provides all that it advertises and is well worth the cost.

I've not had a single song generate a level that was simply unplayable and this is the first program to be able to map for songs with energy peaks, bpm changes etc. I listen to electronic and rock music and haven't had a problem. While I'd like to see a bit more variety in the animations for melody, the mods for characters and button mapping keeps things fresh.

More accessible than Audiosurf, more flexible than RUNNER, and much like the other two, well worth your time.\n\nOtherwise, Melody's Escape is a relatively simple yet still engaging little rhythm game.  Like other games that came before, it assembles Melody's obstacle courses from music you feed it based on auto-detecting tempo, lyrics, amplitude, etc.  It doesn't come with its own music (yet; this IS Early Access, after all), but it does a decent job with most anything I've thrown at it so far.  Of course, the track generator seems to be at its best with varieties of electronic music, though I've been surprised by what it comes up with for things like They Might Be Giants, MC Frontalot, The Aquabats, and other things I wouldn't expect a rhythm game to agree with.\n\nThat's not to say it always turns up interesting courses.  Some songs can make downright repetitive tracks.  Others turn out slightly nonsensical in terms of the actual music.  But, that's a risk you always take with auto-generating levels based on music, and Melody's Escape does a good job far more often than not.\n\nIf you like rhythm games and have a good amount of music to mess with, it's worth checking out.","December 31, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The conversion of songs to levels is better than most "Play your own music" rhythm games I've played, and the visuals are delicious!\n\nRecommendations for Development Team:\nDefine off-beat and on-beat notes seperately, to make it more a reaction-rhythm than a music-based guessing game.\nYou're likely working on something like this, but a level editor would be sublime.\nLastly, I reccomend working out some color patterns when generating a level of normal difficulty and above. It will allow people to immerse themselves in the flow of the game while still giving them the musical challenge they want, as opposed to random button-pressing. I've noticed some patterns already, but they're few and far between from what I've seen.\n\nOverall: 6/10 simply for the difficulty jump from easy to normal.

It had a nice visual style, and from what the gameplay appeared to be from screenshots and videos it was like a modern take on the game Vib-Ribbon from back in the ps1 era, so seeing it get greenlight and actually put onto Steam was really good.\n\nSo gameplay, it's a unique feel, you only really need 4 keys for 2 of the difficulties, your direction keys, and you press them as they appear on the screen to follow the path and build chains, similar to other rhythm games like Hatsune Miku's Project Diva series.  Where this differs is how the entire game operates using your own music library.  you can put literally any track you have into this and it'll compile a track for you that follows the tune's beat, rythm and lyrics pretty much spot-on at all times.  It's quite addictive and the visual effects will have you staring wide-eyed as your fingers fumble trying to keep up with some of the speedier tracks.\n\nOne thing I will say is I certainly wasn't prepared for the intensity of many of the brony dubsteps out there, and guitar solos can really screw up your chain combos, and most anime themes are so fast you barely get time to react, so best advice is to start with something nice and slow till you get used to it, 'cos dubstep and rock will have you smashing your keyboard trying to hit the right buttons at the right moment, and anime music will kick your ♥♥♥!\n\nHighly recommended! :D","February 27, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If there was an option between recommend and not recommend, I would pick that.\n\nMelody's Escape is a pretty game, with clean and simple visuals that utilise colour instead of detail to create its aesthetic. The game lets your music be the driving force and doesn't seek to fill the screen with crap and distract you. All of the rhythm games I have played, it is probably the one I like the look of the most. The style of the game, however, comes at a cost, as the visuals are horizontally based meaning that your eyes have to keep track of colours and shapes moving across the screen at often quite high speeds. This movement will cause blur and will quickly tire out your eyes and, if you are like me and are light sensitive or are prone to headaches, the may be game very unpleasant to play for anything but a short amount of time.\n\nThe audio detection is hit and miss. Sometimes it works really well and sometimes it completely fails and leaves you trying to keep up with an entirely different beat to the song you are listening too. All rhythm games that utilise the user's music are like this to a certain extent but Melody's Escape seems to keep to these extremes a lot more than other games, meaning it is likely that you will just have to keep a list of what songs you have that work and don't work. This is especially true due to the fact that the game isn't predictable at all: I've had acoustic, vocal-dominated songs work perfectly and electronic dance music with a very clear and repetitive beat fail.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and addictive and, providing the game doesn't induce a migraine, can easily be played for long sessions. Best of all, the game has a good variety of difficulty levels allowing for varied gameplay.\n\nAnother, albeit small, negative that I should mention is a lack of compatibility with non-Latin script. It recognises Hiragana/Katakana and a certain amount of Chinese characters, usually this is enough for you to be able to find the right song but it is annoying for have half the title or artist's name displayed  in blocks. I haven't got a lot of Korean music but it is possible that it doesn't recognise Korean characters at all, as all my Korean music  is displayed in blocks.","September 9, 2014","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As of today, Melody's Escape is still in Early Access, so this review might not be accurate if the game undergoes more development.\n\nMelody's Escape has heart, and its base concept is so simple that I'm surprised at how challenging it is. The problem is that a good portion of the challenge doesn't come from the gameplay, but from the interface and the bugs.\n\nIn full screen mode, the game doesn't register button/key-presses worth a damn, so I played it in windowed mode instead. It works much better in windowed mode, but the timing of key presses still feels somewhat arbitrary. This is most notable in sections that have evenly spaced single notes that, by rights, should have a regular 4/4 beat, but even tapping right along with the song yields a hit only 80% of the time at best. This includes Relaxed mode, where (supposedly) you can LITERALLY just tap one button in time with the song for most of the prompts. I get the distinct impression that this is not because the prompts aren't timed right, but rather, the game still isn't registering all of my key-presses correctly.\n\nIn sections that mix "button" prompts (orbs) with "direction" prompts (obstacles), the game tends to ignore between 30-50% of all my "direction" presses, even on difficulty modes where the directions and buttons are interchangeable (The lowest two difficulties). Additionally, when two "long-note" sections, which require you to hold the button, are back to back, the game tends to ignore my button press on the second prompt. For most of these issues, I find that if I press the key a split second early, it tends to register more often, but what is the point of a rhythm game if you have to force yourself to ignore the rhythm in order to play?\n\nOn top of this, the process of respawning after you die is not very forgiving. I find that most of my deaths come in twos, because Melody will fall down, reappear, and immediately trip over something else because the game isn't ready to register key presses yet, or something.\n\nMy last major point of contention is that the difficulty level of the game, even without the bugs, is off the charts. Personally, I can't imagine how anybody referred to this game as "relaxing". Even some of my most drifty, relaxing music was face-meltingly difficult at anything other than "Relaxed" difficulty, which just requires you to tap away at the same key for most of a song. I don't know if the devs read reviews, but I'd suggest changing, or implementing a setting to allow the player to adjust, the speed at which the stage goes by (or the speed at which Melody runs, if you prefer). A follow-on suggestion to that would be two sliding scales of difficulty. The current one changes the fundamental game mechanics so that you either have to use one button at a time, four buttons, or four buttons AND four directions. I'd like to see a second difficulty setting that simply lets me adjust how frequently the prompts appear. Only having to press the B button doesn't help me if I have to press it 16 times in one syncopated measure.\n\nFinally, and this is NOT a complaint but a suggestion, I would really like to see the "AutoPlay" mode be able to play more than one song consecutively. If you're going to play it up as a visualizer, why not let Melody just run her way through an entire folder?\n\nIf the timing/sync issues could be resolved, and if I could play it fullscreen, I'd probably give the game an 8/10 or 9/10 even with the insane difficulty level. It has style, the concept is simple and proven, and honestly, who doesn't like games that respond to your personal music library? As it stands, though, it gets one point for style, one point for letting me use my music library, one point for having polished visuals (or, if you want to be brutally honest, an aesthetic so simple that the visuals couldn't be anything other than polished), one point for the solid concept, and an extra point for the music thing (because I REALLY like games that let me use my music library), for a wobbly 5/10. I look forward to seeing where this game goes. I do recommend it, but I also recommend not expecting a perfect game. It's still in Early Access and I like it, but it definitely needs work.","October 15, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Just set it on autoplay, and look at the amazing colors. Plug in a controller too to feel that strangely soothing vibration of it.\n\nFor actually playing the game, it is very competant at what it does, though the timing can be strict. That said, failure is okay, as it does not interrupt the song, instead just a quick glance at bleached colors before jumping right back in.\n\nOverall, get this game if only for the unique design of it.","October 17, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If there was an option between recommend and not recommend, I would pick that.\n\nMelody's Escape is a pretty game, with clean and simple visuals that utilise colour instead of detail to create its aesthetic. The game lets your music be the driving force and doesn't seek to fill the screen with crap and distract you. All of the rhythm games I have played, it is probably the one I like the look of the most. The style of the game, however, comes at a cost, as the visuals are horizontally based meaning that your eyes have to keep track of colours and shapes moving across the screen at often quite high speeds. This movement will cause blur and will quickly tire out your eyes and, if you are like me and are light sensitive or are prone to headaches, the may be game very unpleasant to play for anything but a short amount of time.\n\nThe audio detection is hit and miss. Sometimes it works really well and sometimes it completely fails and leaves you trying to keep up with an entirely different beat to the song you are listening too. All rhythm games that utilise the user's music are like this to a certain extent but Melody's Escape seems to keep to these extremes a lot more than other games, meaning it is likely that you will just have to keep a list of what songs you have that work and don't work. This is especially true due to the fact that the game isn't predictable at all: I've had acoustic, vocal-dominated songs work perfectly and electronic dance music with a very clear and repetitive beat fail.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and addictive and, providing the game doesn't induce a migraine, can easily be played for long sessions. Best of all, the game has a good variety of difficulty levels allowing for varied gameplay.\n\nAnother, albeit small, negative that I should mention is a lack of compatibility with non-Latin script. It recognises Hiragana/Katakana and a certain amount of Chinese characters, usually this is enough for you to be able to find the right song but it is annoying for have half the title or artist's name displayed  in blocks.

The only complaint I have is the graphics actually have a bit of a blur, that you can't adjust and it's infront of Melody. So, unless your eyes are focused on her and you have enough intuition to predict the colors to hit and when to hit them you're going to get dizzy and possibly motion sick. I'm not someone who has a weak stomach nor do I get dizzy on occasion but after 50 minutes of playing this one, my left eye has developed a twitch and I can actually feel the strain in my eyes. Very creative game, but I'm not so sure the blur is nessasary. I'm sure it was out of an attempt to make the game more difficult, but all it did for me in the end is give me a headache. 3 out of 5 stars.\n\nCheck out my playthrough at:\nhttp://youtu.be/PxnkNYv_NpA\nBe sure to Like, Comment, and Subscribe!","February 28, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game's mechanics are impressive to say the least, and the aesthetics are so cleverly done, it's hard to beleive the game is in early release. I can't wait to see what the developer has in store for us in future updates. The game is very user friendly, and the interface is simple and clean. I could get straight into the game with no confusion whatsoever. The particle effects particularly stood out to me as looking really great.\n\nAny criticism i have, is entirely constructive, and does not lean this towards a negative view of the game from my part. This may simply be my screen, but i find that a lot of motion blur occurs, and makes it difficult to see upcoming colour instructions, and it makes the game quite hard on the eyes. I find that trying to press a key to either touch an orb, or to overcome an obstacle is really inconsistent. I don't know whether if this is really my incompetance, but it seems that if you press it directly above the arrows, it fails to work. It seems you need to actually press it before you reach it, and then when you reach the obstacle it will then perform the action. This really confuses me, and i don't know if it's just me being bad at the game, or is a feature. I personally find the intense mode kind of arbitrary, as it simply requires you to press 2 keys at once, rather than one. Perhaps including more complexity and requiring quickly fingers and reflexes into the levels would make for a more "intense" gamemode. The algorithms are just really awesome, but they tend to be the most compatible with techno. Slower songs like instrumentals and classicals feel very out of place, as if a slow song is to a very fast game. A final criticism (a constructive one, i urge) is that when Melody is performing an action, like a long drop or a long slide, the game says "Error" even if your move was "perfect" or any other.\n\nAfter looking back at this review i seem to have portrayed the game with an overwhelming area of faults, but this is really not the case. Melody's Escape is an origional and fun game, which is worth every penny, even in this early stages of that game. Especially recommended for music lovers, one of the best games of 2014 so far!","February 28, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

This has to be one of my favorite genres next to point and click and strategy comedies. I have played many rhythm games. Audio Surf, Beat Hazard, Symphony, Dance Dance Revolution and now this one. This game is fueled by your music. Not like that add thing that says that as a buying point, like Rush Brothers (which is a good game, but isn't really fueled by music that much). This game is 100% fueled by your music like Audio Surf, Beat Hazard, and Symphony. Even though it is in early access, it looks like it's coming along marvelously. This is a game that operates similar to DDR, but is a little more creative with it, but along with the arrows, in intense mode, you use w, a, s, d to hit the record notes to make a rythm. If you have played Audio Surf on double vision mode, those controls are sort of similar to that. This game can be used with any MP3 in your computer. This game, being in early access, doesn't have music that comes with it, so if you don't have your own music library, then there is no need to purchase this game. It works with all mediums of music. I have played it with movie soundtracks, rock music, dubstep, broadway music, video game music, etc. If it was really easy on audiosurf, though, then you might be pleasently surprised. I have played the soundtrack theme to the film "BeetleJuice" on both games and in this one it is fast and lively. I think it depends on the game.

It’s much like DDR in that you follow along with music and react based on the tone and lyrics. The game is extremely fun in its simplicity and visually pleasing. The appeal for me is that you can import any song you have and it will use an algorithm to create a new level based off of the song of your choice. While this may work better for some songs then others I have found the overall effect and performance of the system to be quite satisfactory. Since I’m not very good at these games I have trouble actually enjoying watching the character while trying to concentrate on hitting all the buttons on time. That is when auto play mode comes in. You can select this play mode to have the character automatically play threw the game for you while you sit back and watch. It may sound silly but it is actually a lot of fun. Even though this review is written in early access I feel the game already provides all that it advertises and is well worth the cost. While I’m really looking forward to further improvements I would not feel cheated at all if the game was made 1.0 right now.","January 23, 2015","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's hard but fun and customizable.  There's a lot of replay value.\n\nRest of review:\n\nI bought this as a kind of cheap impulse buy during the Winter sale.  I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome the game was and still is.  After playing for over an hour and getting the easiest of the achievements and messing with difficulty settings and changing skins multiple times, I must say I enjoy this game.  I'm going to keep it installed as a casual time-waster.\n\nThe game has some flaws which really did not bother me at all.  First, the difficulty levels aren't really changing the gameplay at all except for the "relaxing" mode, so in order to really get into the game, you need to find some very fast-paced songs.  I highly recommend Final Fantasy's battle music on medium difficulty as a start.  Second, the character mods are just skins, modified texture sheets.  This limits the amount of character customization you could possibly have.  That said, the game offers Steam Workshop support for character skins, so you can find some nice skin mods and install them very easily.  Finally, a lot of my button presses don't register when using the Xbox 360 controller, so I missed a lot of key presses just because they were too close to each other and I couldn't press them fast enough.\n\nThe overall feel of the game is fast-paced.  it has its slow moments, but it relies on your own music files to generate the game's obstacles and pace, so as long as you avoid slow-paced songs, you should have a very fun time with this game.","January 23, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I do not recomend it if you will have issues with the following cons.\n\nThe first one is the motion blur. Yes, the motion blur from the "markers" and obstacles is really irritating. Because of it my eyes hurt and therfore I am distracted from enjoying the music and game. And this is due to the fact my eyes perceive the objects blurry, and have issues with tracking. This is worsen by the running and faster speeds, as the obstacles are seen only as colored blurry "things". A partial fix to this is to use your peripheral vision and focus on the runner.\n\nSecond is the Sync and Track Speed. And I will compare this part to Audiosurf.\nWell, the game(Melody Escape) does scan the music quite accurately, but, the obstacles are place only on the bass or beat parts of the music. Whilist the speed, intended to be in the music is quite off.\nI used the soundtrack from UT2004 - Level 8, which has a more calm, jogging like nature, which smoothly transfers to a bit faster pace.\nFirst I tested it on Audiosurf(Ninja Mono). It went just as I expected, it started of slowly in the purple tone(slow pace), then the beats came up, making the road bounce a little, then the speed again smoothly changed to a blue tone, and this perfect sync with the temp went to the end, AND most importantly, the pace was changing in this way (purple-blue-blue/green-green/greenish yellow-blue-purple).\nNow if we take Melody Escape on Relaxing! difficulty. The beginning starts off with me ramming one button, then jogging, then running, then jogging again and these two speeds accompanied me almost the whole part with a very unsync transfer between each other, but I didn't finish, and this is where the 3rd con comes up.\n\nObstacles are either too close, or too fast, even on slow speed option. Yep, in addition to the 1st con this makes the game unplayable. No matter what, you WILL miss.\n\nSo, in the end I wish the devs could find out how Audiosurf was made, or rather how it syncs the music, and add more speed temps in addition to fixing the 1st and 3rd con.\n\nBut still, I think the game is great, and it does have potential.","January 5, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is very fun to enjoy. Not only you can play a pretty good rhythm game, but you can use your own MUSIC!!!   That's Awesome. as much fun as that is, I found some things I am not found of. The first is that you need to press your controls at the exact time as the object shows onscreen, if you don't you will miss it. When I had started, I realized that I actually hit every other note. For people who just bought this game, they would be really REALLY frusturated on this part. My suggestion is to either make the range of the area to hit the note bigger, so when you are pressing the key down and letting it go, it gives a better cance of hitting the note. Or have a calibrator. Different poeple have different accuracy. by having a calibrator, it can give the player a bigger chance of actually hitting the note on there accurate timing. I had read somewhere that you have played Guitar hero or rock band, think of there calibrator, that's what I meant. Another thing is that playing your song over and over is fun, but after awhile, it dies out. The reason it dies out is because there isn't any goal to play towards. Maybe by having you unlock 10 free song of your choice (or randomly), and each time you play a song, you unlock points. Each time you get enough points, you can unlock another song. By doing something like this, it can give the player something to accomplish. By doing so, the game can last longer. Overall, I still enjoy this game and can't wait till it comes out!!!!, I am recommending this game to my buddies!!! Keep it UP!!!!","March 2, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What they mean when they say steep is something akin to climbing mount everest or riding the Kingda Ka. Just about as steep as you can imagine. The gameplay involves alternating buttons on a xbox controller and also using the 4 directional arrows which results in 8 different buttons, four of which have the possibilty of being a long hold.\n\nNow that might not seem so bad but coming at you at anything above 120 beats per minute its downright frustrating, my personal choices of music so far being Trap, Trance, House and future.\n\nI say that to say this, its an amazing game and I never thought I would find myself so challenged by a rythm game.

But it was shortly after owning it, that this game deeply impressed me! Here's a few reasons why\n\n- It gives listening to music a whole new definition\n\n- The song created tracks are extraordinary\n\n- Sliding and grinding over obstacles by holding notes down caused by held vocals or notes.\n\n- Slow-mo jumping off a cliff when the song dramatically changes its rhythm\n\n- It gives me a beautiful neon colored visualization of my music (other then those wacky Media Player ones)\n\n- No failure state\n\nThis game almost reminds me of my days when I played Guitar Hero. I personally must recommend this game. I've had zero issues with it at all and it runs perfectly. I could compare this to Besiege by how well optimized and good quality this early access build is. It's worth the 10$s or your regional equivalent for sure! Keep up the good work Icetesy!\n\nP.S. Some of the mods are really worth looking into for this game.

I find it a  interesting change up from playing Audiosurf. Also the game supports low-end pcs which is nice since not many games will/would do that unfortunately. Takes time to start getting used to as some songs really have sudden notes, took me awhile to grasp the game because I had the game on 'High' which gave me 8-10 FPS :P I set it to Low and I have 29-60 FPS and the game plays fine.

Of course when I first started the game I found it very difficult and seemed to find myself getting frustrated quickly. Of course that quicky fades as it's a game that you can pick up on very quickly, but is still challenging enough to keep things interesting.\n\nEven in this early stage this game is fun as all hell and enjoyable to anyone who loves a good rhythm game that isn't going to make you smash your monitor but is going to keep challenging you. Plus, on another good note, you can instantly play your favorite songs and the notes actually make sense. It's always fun to watch her pick up speed and have notes come flying at you, and the vivid visuals and Melody herself are fun to watch. Also due to the simple visual style it's not hard to see the notes which is another big plus for me.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned this is one of the best rhythm games out there. Anyone who loves these types of games will love this game. Also with it still being an early title you're likely to see even more added on.

Normally i dont like rhythm games becaues i suck at them. but for some reason i love this one.\n\nPros: varying difficulties where the easiest is really good if your new to rhythm games, and the hardest will make a Rockban veteran cry. also has a custom difficulty where you can fine tune the diffrent things to make it as hard or as easy as you want. does not come with any music but instead uses the song (any sond file really even podcast or sound effects) you have on you PC. comes with a Mod making program so you can reskin Melody to anything you want, and has workshop support. controller support.\n\nCons: sometimes the track generation is a bit weird. it will have melody running in a area where she really should be jogging. tends to happen with songs that change tempo the most. Jpop was notoriously bad at this. It pushes my PC way harder than it really should. my GPU was running at 80C!

This one is actually challenging on medium and am practicing more on that level before I try to move upwards. However the game is still extremly fun on relaxing mode, and will help you get used to the controls.\n\nThe only issues I have with this game is that the timing can be extremly unforgiving if you're late at all, and not so much compaired to if you're a little early when it is a tad bit more forgiving, sometimes the spacing of notes and what button they suggest you press (there is two for each note a directional and an actual button) you'll want to go for the other button instead and that can throw more visual people off, and after you miss a note, your character stops and seemingly gets "hurt" and it skips to a couple of notes ahead to where the song went up to while you recover. Sometimes there will be a note right when you recover making it really difficult to hit and resulting in another miss animation like that.\n\nA thing I would like to see is maybe song recongistion by title, artist, and song length (give or take by a few seconds, I say song length because several songs I will play have both long and short versions to them) because I would like to see if people have played the same song as me, and how much better or worse I've done compaired to them.\n\nOther then that if you love music games, go for it, it's fairly simple but challenging. I'm not quite sure if it is challenging for the correct reasons, for example the really unforgiving timing of the notes sometimes, but you will get used to it, and get better at the game as time goes on.","December 19, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has only one game mode, it doesn't have multiplayer or online leaderboards, but it does the casual single player game thing almost flawlessly.\n\nThe generated track matches the music very well, the art style is practical and convenient, loading times are really short. There are multiple difficulty levels, and if you don't like them, you can create your own difficulty level. A failure doesn't interrupt the flow of the game, music keeps playing and you're back on track where you are expected to be within a second. Both keyboard and controller work fine, I prefer the controller, but it doesn't make much difference.\n\nAll you need is a collection of music on your disk. Music videos are fine too.\n\nThe only minor annoyance is that the game doesn't render all characters in Asian or Central European languages correctly, so if you have a collection of K-pop labelled in Korean, you're gonna have a bad time. But apart from that, everything works fine.\n\nA simple, well-done game.

I have played other "Rythm-Runners"   but they tended to pre built levels to set songs, which got boring after awhile. This game allows me to pick the songs I want to play then generates a level based on it, it feels like if AudioSurf and BitRunner had a child. Now I will explain what I like about the game.\n\n1.Choice) The ability to choose which songs I want to play is a nice feature, but then to allow me to through in my own songs makes the game more player oriented which allows for a better experience.\n2.Personalization) This games does somthing that AudioSurf didn't, customizable character. The fact that there are A good starting number of options for customization is alright, but with the addition of steam workshop you can go in and make your own charcter or find one you like that others have made.\n3.Depth) The way that the game is divided into teirs isn't a new thing, but it helps. It makes it so someone just starting to play can get used to it, and those that know it can push their skills to the limit. The addition of the visualization mode is also nice. It lets you not only listen to the song, but see how the level would look if you would play it.\n\nNow on to the not so fun bit, what I found laking or distracting from the game.\n1.Menu) While getting through the menus isn't bad, the lack of BGM in them displeases me. I get that it is about my music, but an option to allow the game to cycle through tracks I have already played in the menus could be a nice touch, or just nice looping ambient music/sounds would be better than the the silence there is now.\n2.Levels) Having the levels generated from the music is awseome, the lack of variaty with the desing of the obstacles makes the longer songs seem more repetitive and less interesting. I'm not saying to change what they are but adding different designs of/on the obstacles would help keep the screen interesting. Maybe even adding a few varying obstacles could help with this so its not as repetitive, like a skating sequence to help balance out the flying sequences.\n\nOther than those few things I find nothing else wrong with the game besides a few loading hiccups when playing a song for the first time, or key presses not regestering(could just be I'm that bad) which for an early access are forgivable. If I had to rate it I would give an 8/10 right now on the grounds that the Replayability and personalizatin are there, but the levels feel to similar with the obsticles and the menus while are visualy appealing lack ambient sound.","February 18, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's hard but fun and customizable.  There's a lot of replay value.\n\nRest of review:\n\nI bought this as a kind of cheap impulse buy during the Winter sale.  I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome the game was and still is.  After playing for over an hour and getting the easiest of the achievements and messing with difficulty settings and changing skins multiple times, I must say I enjoy this game.  I'm going to keep it installed as a casual time-waster.\n\nThe game has some flaws which really did not bother me at all.  First, the difficulty levels aren't really changing the gameplay at all except for the "relaxing" mode, so in order to really get into the game, you need to find some very fast-paced songs.  I highly recommend Final Fantasy's battle music on medium difficulty as a start.  Second, the character mods are just skins, modified texture sheets.  This limits the amount of character customization you could possibly have.  That said, the game offers Steam Workshop support for character skins, so you can find some nice skin mods and install them very easily.  Finally, a lot of my button presses don't register when using the Xbox 360 controller, so I missed a lot of key presses just because they were too close to each other and I couldn't press them fast enough.\n\nThe overall feel of the game is fast-paced.  it has its slow moments, but it relies on your own music files to generate the game's obstacles and pace, so as long as you avoid slow-paced songs, you should have a very fun time with this game.","January 23, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, this will also serve as an all inclusive review as well. For those TLDR lazy people, skip to the last few sentences of this review.\n\nAs an indie game, aesthetically, this game receives perfect scores. The graphics are simple yet sleek and still manages to have a fantasy/digital vibe to it. As a result of the simplicity behind these graphics, this indie game is able to support up to 4k resolution.\n\nConcept wise, this is as avant garde as it gets ladies and gentlemen. Its a customizable visualizer that allows you to either play your favourite song and lose yourself in the flurry of beats or sit back and watch Melody's elegance animations flow with rhythm. The fact that you can play ANY music with this game a never ending journey that can stand against the testament of time.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where the praise ends: It's greatest strength is also the chink in its armor.\n\nThe notes players must hit during the game are not optimally lined up with the rhythm of the songs, especially on higher difficulty levels and faster songs. I am not a developer myself and hardly know any coding, but I can still tell that the program is a little too simple in certain parts. Additionally, I realize that this game does not pick up vocals as parts of the bpm, I used the infamous "Disappearance of Hatsune Miku" (If you don't know this, just youtube it and you'll understand) to test and discover this problem. This ties directly to my next criticism.\n\nWhile I loved the way melody would speed up or even set flight depending on the bpm of the song, I also hated how, at higher bpms, it became a strain to even see the notes clearly and follow through with inputs consistently over even more than 1 minute. This is because the notes move with the screen and only melody is in the same idle position. This is also why some people recommend staring at melody when your eyes get tired.\n\nWhile I don't know if this would definitively solve the problem, I urge the developers to toy around a bit more with the movement of the notes as well as the screen. Could the notes briefly accelerate to Melody's speed as they gradually reach her? Enough to lessen the blur but not enough to decrease the reaction speeds by too much. And frankly, I think the screen could move slightly slower on the faster bpms (When Melody is flying) and achieve the same accelerating effects (perhaps this would also call for speed tweaks for medium/sprinting screen scrolling speed)?\n\nFinally, the last and I think easiest to implement change is that I would like there to be the option to set the amount of beats while maintaining say, medium difficulty instead of insane. This is a concept that was long introduced in such music rhythm games such as Step Mania and DJ Max. Basically, the complexity of the song (or number of obstacles) should be adjustable SEPARATELY from the amount of keys one would be required to utilize for different inputs. For example I would like the game to display all the beats and therefore much more obstacles (so far the closest I would get would be the highest difficulty) and yet still only use 4 keys (the medium difficulty). This would increase the game's immersion as the notes needed to be hit coincide with the beats of the song and yet the controls are easy enough for people to slowly adjust to harder difficulties, and essentially making it a more intuitive game at the same time.\n\nNow, this review seems TLDR tagged and full of criticism right? But in the end, I DO recommend this game. I just love the concept way too much and I believe that there is still room for this game to improve upon what I have mentioned.\n\nI would say that right now this game, in its current state, is more of a interactive visualizer than a hardcore music rhythm game with diversified difficulties such as Step Mania, JuBeat, or DJ Max.","May 22, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you choose a song to play, the game lets you know how good of a job it's done in converting the song into a stage. If a song scores a 70% or above, it will be really fun to play and you'll totally get the sense of rhythm that the game is going for. At 40-50%, it'll still be fun to play. But if a song receives a score of 30% or below, then it will feel chaotic and messy to play.\n\nAt its best, Melody's Escape feels a lot more rhythmic than Audiosurf does. But it does have some drawbacks. The visual cues are confusing at first because they're based on the Xbox controller's button layout (a yellow symbol means press your "up" button, for instance, while a green symbol means press "down"), and I was using a PS3 controller so it didn't really connect with me. There aren't many options in the game yet, and hopefully they will offer more color palettes as the game is developed. The "rosy" color palette, I noticed, was far too fuzzy-looking and it hurt my eyes to play.\n\nUltimately though, it's a fun rhythm game with a cute graphical style.","February 27, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few quirks with timing but nothing that won't / shouldn't be an easily polished in the near future. Motion blur can be a little heavy at times depending on the tempo, but with a little practice you get used to de-focusing your eyes and reflex takes over.\n\nAll-in-all a very decent game for the price.

It is like a combination of bit-trip runner and audisurf. With that said, if you have audiosurf, you're probably better off holding off for this game to get some updates before buying another itunes rhythm game unless you really want another. Its a good game, but the only selling point is having nice controller functions for music play.  If you don't have audiosurf and want a rhythm game, I'd probably suggest this one as the gameplay is more akin to DDR matching style, but audiosurf has a much larger variety of game modes and leaderboards.\nI hesitantly recommend Melody's Escape. Its only selling point over other rhythm games is the controlls are nice. That aside, it doesn't bring anything new or more to the scene.

What it dose is it creates a track of obstacles with "Guitar Hero" type prompts that feels natural to the song playing. This isn't true with all songs though. There is a mechanic when you load the song where it tells you how in sync the track is for the song. Weak tracks are not going to feel that enjoyable. They will be out of beat and come at you randomly, but they can still be played if you don't care anyways. The best mode I found to play them in is overload. This game also requires practice inorder to get good at it. Best thing to do is to keep on playing until you get perfect scores on songs, then advance to the next difficulty.\n\nI have personally found the game to be both relaxing and challaging enough to rage at. Is it a perfect game? No, not at all. But it does provide an "escape" from all the stress in life. This is why I recomend this game.

I wish there was different mods like audiosurf 2, but for the price and the amount of times you can replay without getting bored it is a good pick up and play game when you have nothing better to do. A big bonus is her animation of hitting into walls or falling, it is very funny!","March 28, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've not had a single song generate a level that was simply unplayable and this is the first program to be able to map for songs with energy peaks, bpm changes etc. I listen to electronic and rock music and haven't had a problem.

I have played other "Rythm-Runners"   but they tended to pre built levels to set songs, which got boring after awhile. This game allows me to pick the songs I want to play then generates a level based on it, it feels like if AudioSurf and BitRunner had a child. Now I will explain what I like about the game.\n\n1.Choice) The ability to choose which songs I want to play is a nice feature, but then to allow me to through in my own songs makes the game more player oriented which allows for a better experience.\n2.Personalization) This games does somthing that AudioSurf didn't, customizable character. The fact that there are A good starting number of options for customization is alright, but with the addition of steam workshop you can go in and make your own charcter or find one you like that others have made.\n3.Depth) The way that the game is divided into teirs isn't a new thing, but it helps. It makes it so someone just starting to play can get used to it, and those that know it can push their skills to the limit. The addition of the visualization mode is also nice. It lets you not only listen to the song, but see how the level would look if you would play it.\n\nNow on to the not so fun bit, what I found laking or distracting from the game.\n1.Menu) While getting through the menus isn't bad, the lack of BGM in them displeases me. I get that it is about my music, but an option to allow the game to cycle through tracks I have already played in the menus could be a nice touch, or just nice looping ambient music/sounds would be better than the the silence there is now.\n2.Levels) Having the levels generated from the music is awseome, the lack of variaty with the desing of the obstacles makes the longer songs seem more repetitive and less interesting. I'm not saying to change what they are but adding different designs of/on the obstacles would help keep the screen interesting. Maybe even adding a few varying obstacles could help with this so its not as repetitive, like a skating sequence to help balance out the flying sequences.\n\nOther than those few things I find nothing else wrong with the game besides a few loading hiccups when playing a song for the first time, or key presses not regestering(could just be I'm that bad) which for an early access are forgivable. If I had to rate it I would give an 8/10 right now on the grounds that the Replayability and personalizatin are there, but the levels feel to similar with the obsticles and the menus while are visualy appealing lack ambient sound.","February 18, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is very fun to enjoy. Not only you can play a pretty good rhythm game, but you can use your own MUSIC!!!   That's Awesome. as much fun as that is, I found some things I am not found of. The first is that you need to press your controls at the exact time as the object shows onscreen, if you don't you will miss it. When I had started, I realized that I actually hit every other note. For people who just bought this game, they would be really REALLY frusturated on this part. My suggestion is to either make the range of the area to hit the note bigger, so when you are pressing the key down and letting it go, it gives a better cance of hitting the note. Or have a calibrator. Different poeple have different accuracy. by having a calibrator, it can give the player a bigger chance of actually hitting the note on there accurate timing. I had read somewhere that you have played Guitar hero or rock band, think of there calibrator, that's what I meant. Another thing is that playing your song over and over is fun, but after awhile, it dies out. The reason it dies out is because there isn't any goal to play towards. Maybe by having you unlock 10 free song of your choice (or randomly), and each time you play a song, you unlock points. Each time you get enough points, you can unlock another song. By doing something like this, it can give the player something to accomplish. By doing so, the game can last longer. Overall, I still enjoy this game and can't wait till it comes out!!!!, I am recommending this game to my buddies!!! Keep it UP!!!!","March 2, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A playlist, alongside recently played, that the player can set would also be helpful if you want to compete with your friends locally and boast over scores. . .and maybe some sort of failure criteria (25%-35% missed of the song) so that it would give you more insentive to not screw the song up.

I can also say that's lovely the way her hair changes color when you hit the comands.\n\nOne of the cons (for me) is that you may feel a little sick by riding too many songs, or trying one that's way too fast (I wouldn't recommed playing Stand Proud to ANYONE. It feels like you're Dio getting hit by thousands of ORAORAORA. Don't do it.)\nThe other one is frame dropping during some more fast paced parts of some songs. I was running smoothly on 60 FPS when suddenly the game would drop to 25 while the music is still going on, and making it way too dificult to put the right comands in the right time.\nAt least, i think this is just a minor issue that will be corrected when the game is 100%.","November 29, 2015","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A music/rhythm game where you get your own music and play? Why would I buy this when I could just buy Geometry Dash for cheaper? Well my fine fellow! Melody's Escape is a beautifully wonderful game where taking your own music and playing it is taken to a whole new level.\n\n\nThe Positives! I hate to repeat myself, but I feel like I have to repeat to get the point across; Melody's Escape is wonderfully beautiful. Taking music and using it in levels is not a new concept, but ME (Melody's Escape) makes it FEEL like it is! The variety that you have at your fingertips is astounding! Not only do you have the ability to take your music and play unique levels with it, but you can customize your character and even make your own levels! You can even take other's workshop submissions and use it in game. The gameplay is pretty solid with a nice blend of easy controls. Not much more to say\n\nThe Negatives... For all the good things Melody's Escape does, there is always the other side of the coin; the bad. One of my main problems with ME is the difficulty. You have 4 levels of difficulty: Relaxing, Medium, Intense, and Overlord. You'll easily be inclined to choose Relaxing or Medium. And it's pretty simple. Those 2 difficulties are as easy as they get, without anything too hard. But once you have the balls to choose one of the other 2 difficulties, you quickly wish you hadn't bothered. You start the hard difficulties and suddenly it seems like someone turned it into a ROM hack level. And I don't know how much I can emphasize how hard the last two difficulties are! It's painful! Anyway moving on.\n\nI also wished there were more achievements and songs already implamented into the game, instead of forcing you to just get songs. But that's just a minor problem.\n\nFinal Verdict Yeah, it's a good game and worth the buy. But if you don't have a reliable way to get music via mp3, you'll just wind up spending a good amount of cash. But if you do and enjoy rhythm games, you'll most likely enjoy Melody's Escape!","November 2, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd gladly pay 10€ for this and it's definitely worth the money.","March 7, 2014","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is colorful and the movements with the music are on the beat almost all the time! It depends on what song you choose and what mood ur in it's pretty easy. The controls were a bit confusing for me since I didn't read the directions till later. TIP: LOOK AT THE CONTROLS FIRST. I liked the game alot, but I wish we had more customization or if we were able to earn costumes. That would be awesome! Even a change in background would be nice too or if it had levels. I would like that alot :D. Overall the game is cheap and fun. It's good to if ur fingers are kinda of antsy and u want to listen to music! I recommend this game to all music lovers! <3","March 7, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
