"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/320610/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","Questerium is an interesting HOG in that it combines live action characters with your standard hand-drawn backgrounds and hidden object gameplay, but does so with a certain amount of camp and gusto that I found quite enjoyable.  Live acting is not entirely unheard of when it comes to the genre, but it's rarely pulled of as well as it is here, usually because the games try to take themselves entirely too seriously. While the actors aren't the most "seasoned," you can tell they're having a lot of fun with it, and it's a bit nostalgic to watch, often reminding me of the older FMV PC games.\n\nSomething crazy is going on in Fortuneville; natural disasters, strange vegetation and a crazy scientist running to and fro with two young children caught in the middle. Finding out just what the heck is going on and rescuing the kids leads you through the game.  It's a little random and weird, but a welcome change from your standard dark, supernatural fare that encompasses most of the genre. While I did not find the plot too intriguing myself, it's a good enough premise to get me to the meat of the game, which is the gameplay.\n\nHidden object games are pretty formula in how they play, and Questerium is no exception.  However, the addition of 4 difficulty levels really helps stretch out the gameplay, especially if you're playing on Professional (no hints, sparkles, nothing) and looking for something that's a little more adventure-lite than casual HOG.  While there are plenty of hidden objects scenes to work through (none of which I found unfairly difficult, thankfully), it's the puzzles that I enjoyed the most.  A few of the concepts I haven't seen done before and the difficulty is about right; nothing extremely hard, but they take some thought to work through.  Too often do I play a HOG and find the puzzles almost an insult considering how absurdly easy they are once you figure out the method. That's not the case here.\n\nAlong with collectible plants that have their own journal enties detailing the species, some of which are pretty creative, you can find caches of money throughout the game that are used to purchase items for a garden in your Achievements Screen. Although it's nothing flashy, they're a nice addition for completionists who want a little something extra to go along with the gameplay.\n\nAll in all, I quite enjoyed Questerium and will certainly go back again to finish up the achievements and collectibles. The price is quite reasonable considering the value Steam Achievements and Trading Cards add to these games, and it's definitely worth a look for hidden object fans searching for something a little bit quirky and different.\n\nBottom Line: 7/10\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review.  No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received.","January 15, 2015","true","2.3"," 95 of 101 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","95","101","9","10"

While the formula is familiar -- a mystery unfolds and is solved through a combination of cut scenes, hidden object hunts, solving mini-game puzzles, and finding necessary objects to progress through the story -- the execution is good and the game is fun.\n\nThe use of live actors in the animated setting was an interesting choice that certainly sets this game apart. It's a little jarring at first, but it blends a little better once you get used to it. The acting's pretty over-the-top campy, and it made me laugh more often than not, like a cheesy B-movie performance. I'm not sure if that's quite the result that was intended, but it amused me and it worked with the game.\n\nI really like the addition of findable money in the scenes, and that you can use the money to upgrade a garden patio (though I kind of question the desire to buy plants while encountering the plants throughout the story!) I also like the collectible plants that you pick up in different locations, and the way the achievements unlock objects in a virtual trophy room.\n\nThe story is decent, and though it is somewhat predictable, the journey is still fun. The artwork is good, and very colorful. The hidden object scenes are nice, and most involve multiple objects where you have to piece things together or uncover them first, making them a bit more challenging than a simple point-and-click thing. Where Questerium shines, though, is in its mini-games. Some of the puzzles are really clever, and I had a lot of fun working them out.","January 15, 2015","true","7.5"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","51","53","4","5"

In this one you have live characters. I personally like the mad professor Gustav with his great laugh and small inch to inch walk. Funny!\n\nYou have to find objects from one area to another to help you progress within the story, as you would expect in that type of game. What I really like in Questerium is the challenging puzzles you encounter. This will get your brain going, let me tell you. If you have never tried this type of game and like puzzles, there is no better way to be initiated into this genre in my opinion. If you like hidden object games, this is a must to have in your game library.\n\nWhen you start the game you can choose your level of difficulty from casual (with hints and skip) to professional (without hints and skip).  I personally like the normal difficulty in this type of game. I rarely use the skip button but I must admit to using it from time to time in this one. Thank god!\n\nAlso, during your journey you will find some money which you can use to buy some items to develop your garden. I really like that. It is not much but it is an addition that makes this game better than others in the genre.\n\nThis game runs smoothly and has enjoyable graphics. The story is sound and the price is right. Well structure from start to finish.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n-	Good story\n-	Live Characters\n-	Challenging puzzles\n-	Achievements\n-	Trading cards\n-	Nicely executed and runs well\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~~\n-	Too challenging at times (puzzles)\n\nThis game is really good and I am sure you will enjoy it.\n\n8.2/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

To be honest I was surprised that Questerium: Sinister Trinity is at least as good as AM games. Maybe even better. Some puzzles are not so easy, whole games is polished and have everything which good game like that should have.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you're a fan of Hidden Object games, you definitely should play this one. There is nothing revolutionary, but you won't be disappointed.\nIf you're a fan of casual games, this will give you few hours of fun.\nIf you're a fan of hard-core games only, what are you doing here man?!\n\nLike this review?

Exactly one specific item can be used in every situation; you can't break a chain using an axe you already have, you have to find a katana. You can't break glass using a pickaxe, you have to get a stone. Why? Item locations are completely random. Often you have to solve a complex puzzle and get a key to open a safe just to find a simple knife inside (or something like that).\nThe game contains an insane amount of backtracking. You are constantly running back and forth around the map; a convenient map helps a lot here. However, the map hints and the whole hint system didn't work during the bonus chapter and then the backtracking got really painful.\n\nThere are some live-action cutscenes that reminded me of the "interactive movie" era of the 90's, however the actors are so incredibly bad that every cutscene feels like a parody of itself. Also, the story is so simple and stupid it's not even worth following, there was absolutely no effort put into it.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game but it's not a good game either. There are so many better games in this genre it's impossible to recommend such mediocrity. Dear developers, next time please think about the game a bit. It IS possible to make the items work in a logical and interesting way. It IS possible to tell an interesting story.","June 13, 2015","false","7.0"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

However, a man manipulating electricity kidnapped them. And besides, there is a crazy doctor trying to stop you. So, what is really happening?\n\nThe story could be resumed by a scientist being affected by a meteor and having used his own assistant as test subject and needed to be stopped before it's too late. However, the evil isn't always what may be at first sight. While the twist is welcomed, I suspected it when I got some items.\n\nThe gameplay is quite common: find items to unlock hidden objects scenes or puzzles. But you have also a nice quest to find plants, hidden money and masks. The money will be used to buy ornaments for your garden. Also, the puzzles, while being well-balanced, aren't always the common ones. Some of them are however very hard and while searching a walkthrough for them (I must say that for one at least I was close to the solution), I realised that many of those recording a video one skipped them.\n\nThe best thing is also the fact that the characters are real actors. In other words, you have them in video into drawed backgrounds. I don't know if the man manipulating electricity is the same as the sailor in Mystery Expedition: Prisonners of Ice but he was quite similar physically. The rest is also well done, though I would have preferred more darkness at least.\n\nSome bonus are also offered as it's a Collector's Edition: puzzles you can replay, wallpapers, etc..\n\nThis game is a nice game, with a perfect execution from the actors, with good puzzles and with nice features.

You either like them or you don't but as far as this genre goes I found this one to be well made and have it's own spin on things.\n\nIt uses actors in some full motion video superimposed over drawn backgrounds and it gives it a fun B-movie feel, with a plot centering around a mad scientist and overgrown carnivorous plants, as well as being reminiscent of some old 90s FMV games like 7th Guest and Tex Murphy.\n\nThere's 4 levels of difficulty here and at the hardest level you don't get hints or sparkles highlighting objects. I appreciated that as I have found some other Hidden Object games too easy in the past.\n\nThe puzzles I thought were varied, balanced difficulty neither being too hard or too easy and well done on the whole. Length is good for a hidden object game as some of them can be quite short, though perhaps I drew it out a bit by resisting hints.\n\nIt ran at full 1080p resolution on my monitor without any fiddling and there were no black bars on the sides or pixelation or any of that sort of thing you get with some older Hidden Object games. Graphics were all crisp and clean.\n\nOverall I enjoyed Questerium and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone looking for a new Hidden Object game and appreciates a quirky, campy tone.","January 15, 2015","true","6.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","1"

The graphics look really good and it seems like they actually updated them for the Steam release. There are live action actors and while the dubbing isn't very good, the overall feel of the game makes the wonky acting feel kinda fitting. The music is decent, but also quite unspectacular.\n\nThe puzzles are quite challenging with the exception of two or three that are just trial and error. The hidden object scenes are a bit overcrowded, but they fit the places they are used in quite well. Some of the adventure elements are a bit off. For example you can't use an electric saw to cut one wooden beam, just to find a handsaw later that works. Overall it's not too bad, but I'd say that the adventure elements are the weakest part of the game.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed playing the game and finding all the secrets gives the game even some replay value. It's worth the 7 bucks and a really good deal on sale.","November 4, 2015","true","6.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

There are a lot of things happening in this game that might give you the impression it's a bad game, but it's not. Some cliche elements are present and it has other draw backs but over all it's worthy of playing.\n\nFirst the elephant in the room, the graphics. The game uses motion capture for the characters and it looks very weird and out of place. The actors are running around the game and they don't fit. However, this also adds a campy charm to the game. It made me laugh, especially with the bad acting. I don't know if this was intentional or not but it amused me none the less. The game is fully voiced but I don't think it's by the mocap actors, unless they dubbed over things later because the lip flaps don't match the audio. This also leads to what is being said not always matching the text on the screen.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and the game is full of achievements to collect which adds a nice level of challenge and accomplishment. The hidden item scenes are fun and look great, the puzzles can make you scratch her head but none are impossible. I guess my only gripe would be the garden aspect, it has nothing to do with the story or really anything in the game. Just adds something to find I guess, that's about it. All of the other achievements are found through story progression or at least relate to the game's theme.\n\nKooky and campy with a story out of a 50's horror movie, this game won't leave you bored. If you enjoy this genre of game I recommend adding Questerium to your library.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","September 10, 2015","true","5.2"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

There is some achievement related weirdness - why are you collecting flowers? Why are you looting the city and searching everywhere for secret cash caches to buy yourself upgrades to your garden at home? Well, apart from there being achievements for finding them all and buying them that is, of course.\n\nOne surprisingly big plus for me is that the protagonist picks up a swiss army knife/multi tool right at the beginning of the plot and uses it for cutting things, unscrewing things, etc., for the entire rest of the game, so there is very little running around solving endless puzzles just to get yet another single use screwdriver, as so many games in this genre tend to do.\n\nStill if you find the atmosphere humourous you will probably have a good time, and even if not the game is decent enough anyway, so this seems an easy recommendation to anyone that likes playing this genre.","December 26, 2015","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Reminds me of late 90's nostalgia.\n\nAs of this review I am still completing the game and It's actually pretty decent. The puzzles are good, challenging, and for the most part unique. Very surprised with this game. The little extra things to find  is a nice touch as well.\n\nGreat job to everyone who was involved in making this. I tip my hat to y'all.","October 18, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Art is good and appealing, all puzzles are very, even suprisingly comprehensible with no random senseless decisions that you are required to make, mini-games are mostly fun, environmental sound is especially pleasant. Luckily, the game itself is not very lengthy hence certain repetitveness that puzzles has won't have enough time to get to you. All in all, great casual quest/puzzle, 7/10. Would dig the genre more should more games that relate to it be more like this one.","January 24, 2015","true","7.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The first person POV is, perhaps notably, gender-neutral.\n\nA lot of the HOG mini-games require constructing items before finding them. There's some clever, imaginative plot; definitely more than the average HOG. Great voice acting in the English version. The actual acting is pretty awesomely amusing. Compellingly zen little area to spend "money" on a water fountain and garden area. A few of the puzzles are ones I haven't encountered before and presenting me with a nice analytical challenge.","March 18, 2015","true","8.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Questerium warps the Hidden Object genre into the 21st Century - finally :-) More interactivity, more 3D, more everything. I am looking forward to a very enjoyable game.\n\nEven gamers who prefer other genres (e.g. I'm basically an FPS player) should take a look.

Extra episode appears to be broken. Get it cheap if you’re a HOG enthusiast that doesn’t care about the story. Makes me wish Steam had a “meh” rating rather than just recommend/not recommend.\n\nStoryYou play as a detective trying to locate two missing children after a series of seemingly natural disasters has forced the evacuation of a city. The story is okay, pretty standard HOG silliness (the genre is not known for good storytelling) with no real character development either for you or the people you meet. The animated backgrounds look good, while the animations are made with real life actors (ala Tex Murphy). The acting is laughable and makes the story very difficult to take seriously. Though, potentially the over-the-top acting is intentional… so if you like that sort of thing that’s maybe a plus. Personally I mostly found it silly.\n\nPuzzlesPretty standard HOGs and mini-games. Nothing really extraordinary or challenging (except perhaps the occasionally poorly written puzzle instruction). Also has hidden collectables.\n\nLengthI finished the main game in about 4-5 hours on professional (no hints, highlights etc) with all achievements. Spent about an hour on the extra episode but it appears to be broken.","February 28","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The guy playing the professor is one of the worst I ever seen in games. His character is simply ridiculous and cliche, and his "acting" is oh-my-how-exaggerated. Then goes the standard "mad scientist" plot which makes me sick - so many times I've seen it. If you're not annoyed by such things, buy this game, however I cannot recommend it with a clear conscience.","April 7","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In this game you do have to click and back track a bit and some puzzles can be challenging and a bit easier then Melissa K which had you moving objects and solving puzzles mostly. The live actors do a good job and you are kind of wondering who is good or bad and also has the dangers of radiation and interesting storyline different to other ones where your spouce or husband or child is kidnapped. I recommend getting this on sale as buying at full price may not be worth it and you can save some money in the process as well so give it a try if you can.","May 23","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
