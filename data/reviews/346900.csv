"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/346900/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Does Adventure Capitalist need a review? Sure why not; I review everything else on Steam, lets get into it. As with most games like this, there are plenty of unfunny joke reviews that will fill up the front store page for this game so I'm hoping to beat the trend and give some points about the game.\n\nFirst of all, Adventure Capitalist is a game, about, well capitalism. You are an investor setting out to make your fortune.  This game is very similar to the likes of Cookie Clicker, which first came to fame in 2010, is still a mega popular game today. You start off buying lemonade stands, each click on the lemonade stand generates money, with that money buy another stand, so on and so on. Eventually you have enough money to hire a manager for your lemonade stand. The manager acts as the clicker, so you can leave the game running (or close it down) and you will still generate money. You then work up to other investments following the same pattern, and no sooner have you started, you will soon be a millionaire.  With your millions you can also purchase upgrades to your investments, such as increasing profit by 3% or something similar.\n\nThis is where AC is different to other clicker games, you no longer actually need to spam click in order to make progress, since you have your managers working over time for you. What I really like about AC is that you can close the game down, and you will still be generating money, meaning you can let your funds mount up for a couple of days, log back in, spend it all, and watch your money roll in for a bit, then log out.\n\nThe UI is so brilliantly displayed, you can work your way around all the menus with ease, and you can find all of the information you could ever need either on the main screen or within 2 clicks.  Be warned, this game not only has highly addictive gameplay, the soundtrack is almost just as addictive. Once that song gets in your head, it just will not leave.\n\nAC is not hard at all, it just seems to be a time-sink, and one that keeps you logging back in on a daily basis. You can see just by the amount of hours I have in this game already just how easy it is to loose yourself in a really simple game. I would say I am not in the game for longer than 15 minutes on a daily basis, but it does keep bringing you back just so you can see what made up number of money you have made over night.\n\nThe developers are always adding new content to this game as well; recently there was an update which allows you to continue making your fortunes on the moon! This runs along side your regular empire back on earth, meaning twice as many investments to manage and oggle at crazy sums of money.\n\nGiven that AC is a free to play game, you have no harm in trying it out. I would say that even if you just load it up every couple of days to check it out, you will still get a lot of enjoyment out of it. There is also an iOS version of the game, but unfortunately it does not link up with your game on Steam; that would of been just too good if it did. Maybe it's a potential possibility in the future.\n\nI really strongly recommend AdVenture Capitalist; its a simple, yet horribly addictive game, that allows you to pop in and hour of the game with ease for ten minutes at a time. Play in small doses to get the full effect!\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I'll give a quick breakdown:\n\nPros:\n\n*Completely free to play incremental game. It does have store purchases that you can buy with real money, but they aren't necessary for enjoying the game. I did spend some money on the Kongregate version, to buy cash multipliers, but that was months after I started playing the game, and it was just to support Hyper Hippo.\n\n*Progression is very linear. The game is simple to learn, and once you start you'll find yourself advancing rather quickly.\n\n*Reset bonuses. This has basically become a must for all incremental games, and AdCap does it very well. You get "Angel Investors" every time you reset (after you've earned some that is), and they add bonuses to your cash income. You can also spend them like cash to unlock upgrades to further increase your cash income and multipliers. Be warned that you can spend all of your angels, and lose the bonus they provide!\n\n*Extremely long lasting gameplay. You'll be playing this game for months, even if you play every single day as I did when I started playing. You can play actively or afk, and you'll still progress rather evenly, and it's a lot of fun. I've gotten to "end-game", so I usually check in every few days, do a reset, then get back up to where I was.\n\n*Constant updates. They had a really dry period a few months ago where we didn't see any new updates, but they've gotten back to making more. They just released a complete "expansion" on the Kongregate version, which is in the early stages and will be seeing more content in the future. They're still not done updating the main version though, so there's a lot more content to come.\n\n*Offline progress. Pretty straight forward, but some incremental don't have this, so it's worth listing.\n\nCons:\n\n*The music will drive you insane, I guarantee it. Click the dude's face in the upper left corner to find the mute button.\n\n*Not much to do once you hit endgame. It'll take an extremely long time to get there, but as I listed in the pros, at the point I'm at, I just log in once every few days, or once a week, and do a reset. It takes maybe 30 seconds to buy all the buildings and get back to where I was. However, this is just being picky for cons, because they do roll out updates to add more progression to endgame.\n\nSo yea, I'm rather surprised that this game is on steam, but if you're thinking about playing it, you basically have no reason not to. It's one of the best incremental games I've ever played, and if you like these kinds of things, you'll be playing it for a very long time. Plus, you can run it in windowed, so you can do other stuff and have it running.\n\n10/10","March 30, 2015","true","488.8"," 233 of 257 people (91%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","91","233","257","19","6"

It's very simple, but time consuming. If you are wondering why so many people have a lot of "playtime"in this game its because you collect money while you have it running. It actually gives you money even when you are offline, but its nice to have it running so you can upgrade as soon as possible.\n\nThis game is actually pretty flat. It doesnt give you much cool stuff, its always just a new grind to yet another unlock. Everytime you level up something it always doubles the amount of cash gain. It's still very addictive for some strange reason. I guess its because people in general just love unlocks and progression in a game, even if it doesnt do much.\n\nThis is a free to play game, but doesnt force you to buy anything really. You can buy some things for real money if you wish, but I dont see a reason for doing so, unless you want some cosmetic things. Just let the game play itself and you will have lots of money to spend on new upgrades.\n\nThis looks like it could be a mobile game, but it does not have any microtransation problem as these kinds of games on appstore normally have. Options are good and you can play in window mode with a lot of different resolution options. This game should be possible to run on most computers, and steam cloud is available, which I always appreciate since I own more then one gaming computer.\n\nIts a good game for being free. I dont know if its actually fun, but it sure is addicting. Try it out if you have some time to waste and you wanna feel like you're accomplishing something.","May 9, 2015","true","125.9"," 181 of 197 people (92%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","92","181","197","15","16"

You've started well, and I liked the game concept. Then Moon came out. Moon was abysmal, boringly slow and pretty much ♥♥♥♥. Then Moon got fixed! Yay that's a +1 for you guys, but at the same time you broke Earth in such a way it's still not fixed by now, this was like 8 MONTHS ago.\n\nNow don't come tell me you're "working on fixing it", I can see through all the PR BS that you try to spill on your guillible fanbase. Don't say you're working on fixing Earth when you fixed the Moon in like a month and it's ok now, you just really don't care about if Earth is completable or not. Everytime there's an update, it's either a new event that people like me don't give a crap about by now, and pretty much no tweaks or even news on Earth upgrades. Most annoucements just say something like "Earth is getting fixed, so stay tuned!", yeah sure, if I was gonna believe that and you were honest about your words, this game would have been completable half a year ago.\n\nThat new 7777.77x thing that just got out? That makes it faster right? Sure, now it should only take like 10^8 years, be sure to check in the game in 28th April 20.160.00.00.000 to complete Earth. Hell, you even announced your new game without even fixing your first one. I'll bet Earth won't be fixed even after that one comes out, and to be honest, no one would play your game if people cared about your greedy attitude.\n\nThen again, you've always wrote about how you care about your fans, how you thank the community for the support and ideas. I know what you want from the community, Megabucks. Not the in-game ones though. Have fun not getting a cent from my wallet. It doesn't matter by now if Earth is completable or not, the way of dealing with the whole situation is something I won't be forgetting, neither tons of people by now, so no I won't remove this review if everything becomes fixed.

Your time will be better spent jerking off into a watermelon.\n\nThat's not an exaggeration, by the way - it will actually take millions of years to 100% this game in its current state, and melon masturbation is a much better use of your time. In fact, some of the achievements don't even work - better enlist someone to help with that wanking.\n\nHere's how the game works: you click on a lemonade stand to earn money from it, and you keep doing that until you have enough money to buy another lemonade stand. Then you keep doing it some more until you can afford the next investment, and you can buy managers to click on the investments for you so you don't have to keep the game open at all times. And that's good, because it means the game will continue earning money for you when it's not open. So basically, the game is an exercise in economical masturbation.\n\nWhen you have enough money, you can reset to gain angel investors. Each one adds (at the start) 2% to your income, so if you have 50 your income is doubled, at 100 it's tripled, and so on. The standard strategy is to do your first reset at about 150 angels, and then to reset again every time you double them. Because of how they're generated, the more of them you have, the more money it takes to get the next one.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem: you see, once you have enough angels, it takes years to double them, and then it will take more years to double them the next time. And you won't be anywhere close to earning the last achievement when that happens. Look through the game's discussion pages, someone ran the game with a robot for 7 million years and didn't get anywhere near the 20th achievement.\n\nThe developers are wilfully blind to this situation, and instead of fixing the game so that it's possible to get the achievements, they're adding more stuff that the game's not yet ready for. Like the moon, where you hit the same 5-years-to-double problem at a tiny fraction of the angels it takes on Earth, but the final investments you need cost orders of magnitude more than on Earth.\n\nOf course, you can also spend real money to get perks within the game, as is the model for free to play games, but you're only delaying the inevitable - you will eventually hit the impossible to progress stage, and your money will literally have been thrown away for nothing.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I have to go punish a watermelon.","September 6, 2015","false","237.9"," 77 of 87 people (89%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","89","77","87","35","6"

I'm leaving this review after the most recent 'significant' update, which did nothing but add more ways to sucker unsuspecting players out of their money. They even slapped past customers in the face by replacing one of the premium items with one that has the same price but is strictly better. I cannot recommend playing a game run by crooks.\n\nEDIT 6 APRIL 2016: As of April 5th's update, the developers have made a small step towards helping the game along by introducing more ways to get free Gold (the game's premium currency that's primarily obtained with real money), and additional multipliers to speed the game along. It's still not enough to allow all of the achievements to be obtained and so my review remains negative, but it's, again, a step in the right direction.","February 9","false","019.0"," 70 of 78 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","70","78","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MelbourneGMLS/recommended/346900/","MelbourneGMLS","MelbourneGMLS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MelbourneGMLS/","235 products in account","After investigating this title just for giggs, I would like to save everyone the time and hassle (even the expense of wasting real $$$ in micro transactions).\n\nThe mechanics are fairly straight forward - buy a property and create a unit to make income, while that income is used to buy more properties to in turn to make more income. Simple capitalism in action.\n\nHowever those that understand maths and compounding percentages will quickly work out that saturation point for your Return Of Investment means you can wait days and weeks to gather enough income to buy more over inflated property.\n\nThis is where the "Angels" come into play. For every one you have you are given a bonus of 2%. Sounds great huh!? Well... as with the previous paragraph, you'll find yourself waiting days or weeks to gather enough Angels to get you out of said over inflated property "hole".\n\nBut wait! I can spend my hard earned cash to buy Gold bars that will allow me to get ahead in the game. This sounds awesome albeit a complete waste of money. You could literary spend THOUSANDS of real dollars and it will only get you an extra 0.00001% towards unlocking all properties + bonuses + Angels. Don't trust me? It's about now you should cheat a little. Disable your internet connection, wind your date back to 1980, launch the game and exit immediately. Set your clock forward to 2060 and collect the cash that you "earned while away". You will have to do this procedure roughly 300 times or so (resetting everytime you hit the ROI saturation point). So if you were to play it straight I doubt you could max out the unlocks anytime soon. This of course *could* be optimised bybuying the properties with the best return / bonus as soon as possible, but what is faster than 80 real years of in-game income generated in 1 minute?\n\nThis brings me to my final point. Why bother playing this game at all? I intentionally endured it just to see what surprise I was given at the end for my achievement. Answer = NONE. All that happens is that your property progress bars are filled orange and the graphics are corrupted in the top right corner because there are no images to load so they are left blank.\n\nIn essence every aspect of playing this game is utterly futile. It will however appeal to slot machine addicts.\n\nONE STAR.\n","May 31, 2015","false","21.4"," 189 of 271 people (70%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","70","189","271","30","8"

As the game progresses, you will end up buying the Earth, setting up shop on the Moon, and even sacrifice angels by the millions, just to milk that little bit more moolah.\n\nThe Good\nIt promises simple, and delivers.  The interface amounts to a series of buttons to press on the screen - one to buy at least one of a business venture (lemonade stand, newspaper delivery, or oil company for example) or for a payment cycle from that venture.  It's exceptionally simple to follow with instructions like that, with upgrades to the businesses ("wireless donuts" or "pizza stuffed pizza" for example) both coming from buying a certain number of businesses, having a certain milestone of businesses (1000 of every venture for example), and from cash investment into research.  Nothing in the game actually escapes a simple explanation, making it immensely smooth to play.\n\nOnce you've run out of things to do because you're out of money and waiting for returns on your investments (it can happen quickly), you can close the game and trust it will run in the background - so long as you are logged in on Steam both when you close, and when you open it again later.  This means the game can be run as a casual experience, allowing you to play a little at the start or end of your day without much concern for investing your personal time.\n\nFree is always a major buzzword in any game community, and AdVenture Capitalist sits happily in that category.  A cash shop in the game encourages that you can spend some money to make the game more convenient in some fashion; avoiding a reset of your business when hiring angels for your investment, or skipping forward a week of game time instantly for example.  Seeing as AdVenture Capitalist is a free product, I move this from 'bad' to 'good', as this allows the player to actually give something back for the developer if they enjoy the game, and they manage to make it polite and unobtrusive.\n\nThe Bad\nSimple is indeed what it delivers, and outside of the buttons looking nice and occasional small points of flash or animation, there's really not much to the game in total.  It is a clicker game about clicking buttons, with little more than that.  Even once you get further in the game, this trend continues, which is disappointing.  Another lack is that both the music and sound get repetitive after a short interval, with the 'mute' button also obscured (behind the portrait at the top of the screen).\n\nSaid portrait button also reveals the 'swag' you can buy - a house, a moon base, a ship, and so forth, which would be awesome if the player could actually do that.  Instead, it just happens over time - suddenly, there's a boat in the harbor.  Now there's a house.  There's little involvement to link the player to this eye-candy, and with it hidden so often it detracts to the point of being completely ignorable.\n\nWithout any risk at all, and no decisions to be made beyond the clicking, there's no real danger, which removes an incentive to pay attention, and a big factor that could encourage play beyond a few minutes at a session.  Without any danger of business or financial loss, it amounts to less of a game, than a clicking number generator.\n\nThe Ugly\nNot really anything to speak of.\n\nSuggestions\nDespite it being such a simplistic game, a substantial amount of extra graphical interface could be worked on, such as 'swag' you can buy (say, a 'cut out' outline where a boat could be, and a price tag attached), with options to upgrade or choices between house color A and house color B or house style C.  This could even tie into the cash shop by letting you purchase a special paint (nothing says ostentatious like a gold-plated multistory mansion).\n\nDecision-making would add a whole element to the game, whether it be in response to random events, or timed events, or available once you have X money to make use of, et cetera.  Loans, disaster and public affairs responses, dealing with competitors and their business, so forth, would make for a much more inclusive game, while preserving the simple element.\n\nA risk factor (bankruptcy, legal repercussions, AI or player competitors) would make for a more engaging experience as well by making the clicking feel as though it has a purpose, as opposed to just making numbers climb.\n\nSocial involvement would assist with enticing the player to be more active, such as a leaderboard or even the much-despised Facebook 'invite your friends' or 'send XxXLegolassXxX1993 ten pizzarias' options that occur in many other free games.  More recommended options would be a small feed (say, Twitter financial trends or Forbes financial) that can bring up current fiscal news not only to make this a more immersive product, but also to bring some small merit of education or awareness for younger players.\n\nThe Summary\nA Facebook game that slipped and landed on Steam.  A bit of free casual fun that, while offering very little, demands even less.  Definitely playable, 7/10.\n\n---\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 3, 2015","true","33.8"," 62 of 77 people (81%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","81","62","77","13","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bendomino/recommended/346900/","bendomino","Mr. Domino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bendomino/","805 products in account","AdVenture Capitalist is Skinner box, a barely interactive "game" in which you click some buttons and watch the numbers get larger and larger. The player becomes satisfied watching the money escalate and in turn clicks on more buttons to ensure even larger numbers. There's precious little to do here, and if you've "played" Progress Quest -- the first of these "run-it-and-forget-it games" -- then you'll be well acquainted with AdVenture Capitalist. It's a terribly hollow experience which can barely be considered a game by any measure.\n\nThat said, there is a bit more to it than Progress Quest. You do get to pick which of the stores you want to invest into or upgrades to buy, but it's all window dressing in the end. Sure, the game gives the appearance of some light management, but all upgrades and stores are roughly the same -- you're just buying what you can afford so you can earn enough for the next set in a never-ending series of upgrades. The somewhat interesting and devious feature of the game is found in the angel investors, which accumulate as you earn money. These angel investors allow you to earn even more money -- significantly more money being a requirement for getting the super big bucks -- but at the expense of resetting all of your progress. You'll be stuck repurchasing all of your stores and upgrades again, but on the next pass, you'll be earning even more money. Millions become billions, sextrillions become septrillions, and so on exponentially until you enough time and resets have given you enough to buy the Earth.\n\nUsers of Kongregate and other Internet browser game sites will know that AdVenture Capitalist offers the option to watch advertising to multiple the funds accumulating for a period of time, hence the Ad-Venture title. This "feature" is absent from Steam, leaving the draw to earn more in the achievements. Despite it being horribly shallow and repetitive, AdVenture Capitalist is an addictive thing, and the one way you truly win is to not play it. You'll waste enough of your own valuable time jumping through the never ending series of hoops the game throws at you to keep those numbers churning. Of course, you could cheat by just advancing the clock on your computer (money tallies even when the game is closed), but that only serves to indicate how empty an experience the game offers, an inescapable pit of rolling counters.\n\nAbandon all hope, ye who enter here.","May 11, 2015","false","21.0"," 139 of 201 people (69%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","69","139","201","16","6"

That being said the game has bugs which will require you to restart the game to fix. Thankfully progress is not only saved when you quit (although I have seen users on the forums say sometimes their progress hasn't been), but you constantly make money while the game isn't open. One of the several bugs is that you actually make more money while the game is closed than when it is open.\n\nThe latest update just made this game a LOT longer. The longest achievement to get involved getting all unlocks. Well that number just increased by around 200. So those of us that only had a couple left aren't exactly thrilled being that now we have to spend a huge amount more time going for those unlocks. Those that don't care for achivements may ask why bother getting all the unlocks and the response is, that is all there is in this game. You buy "businesses" the make money and everytime you hit a land mark (eg 5000) you unlock a bonus.\n\nAlso I would highly recommend not buying gold in the game. I had an issue where I received an email stating I had purchased $20 worth of in game currency when I didn't. I emailed the developers as they don't check the game forums, and after waiting several days they responded telling me they don't have access to ingame purchases and cannot do anything about it. Terrible customer service, buggy product and the updates made have only been to prolong the game and make it harder to get 100% achievements instead of fixing bugs and issues with the game.\n\nIf you really want to waste time getting achievements then go for it. If you are looking to play an actual game, keep looking.","June 16, 2015","false","79.4"," 83 of 115 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","83","115","7","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/otter-chaos/recommended/346900/","otter-chaos","Otter Chaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/otter-chaos/","1643 products in account","AdVenture Capitalist is one of those games that shoves a somewhat uncomfortable fact in my face.  While I have played thousands of games, and love a deep story, a grand adventure, a puzzling challenge, I also love to make numbers go up.  From an RPG characters stats, to the DPS numbers of my WoW raiding days, increasingly large numbers have been a benchmark of my success and progress in games.\n\nThere have been other games that offer a tongue-in-cheek or sarcastic look at the min-max or stat ♥♥♥♥♥ approach to gaming.  Whether a wry look at the gaming culture such as Achievement Unlocked, or simple nods to number driven games such as Manugo in Rift, there is always a fine line between mocking the need to see numbers go up, and selling a product that, well, makes numbers go up.\n\nI love games that are aware of that aspect of gaming, because it is important to acknowledge, and also because I want to see numbers go up.  The problem with games like AdVenture Capitalist however, is that there is no deep story, no grand adventure, just numbers going up, and I still keep playing.  This leads me to wonder if the numbers are really the most important part for me.  If this could be the case, let us figure out why.\n\nWhen I was a young lad in the previous century, there were no video games.  That's right, they did not exist.  Once they did, however, they took off like wildfire, and arcades began springing up everywhere.  Arcades were so ubiquitous in fact, that at one point there were three of them in my bathroom.  Here's the thing though.  Every game back then was about one thing.  Numbers going up.  You could be eating ghosts  in Pac-Man, blowing rocks up in Asteroids, or flipping balls at a pinball machine, the only metric you had for success in any of those things was a number, a high score.  The bigger the better.  If your initials were at the top of the list, you had the biggest number, and that meant you were the best.\n\nToday though, games have become interactive entertainment that surpass anything else for truly immersive journeys through fantastic worlds.  Amazing stories are told, and you can be the focal point of legends, with songs sung in 5.1 surround sound about your heroic deeds, and displayed in glorious 1080p.

The new "content" isn't really content at all either, just pushes the goal post back if you wanted to just get 100% and wrap up the game.

It is clear that at the time of writing this review there are more space locations planned and I expect them to have some gimmick that tries to sell cash too.\n\nThe game is free so I guess if you wanna play go ahead, those that would be easily swayed by the pace to wanna spend cash though I'd recommend staying away.","May 23, 2015","false","373.9"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","27","33","2","0"

The topic of clicker games has been beaten to death. This is another clicker game. It adds one new mechanic, but I won't be discussing it here, since if you've played a clicker game, you already know roughly how this one will play.\n\nInstead, let me tell you about the part you don't know about: the extent to which the developer team apparently holds their player base in utter contempt.\n\nThey designed the game to literally take weeks of effort to beat while engaging in optimal gameplay (as my played time indicates). Fair enough. They added the Moon as an extra area. Seemed like a neat idea, but it ended up being an utter and complete slogfest, taking literally weeks just to get the first major unlock that was necessary, with nothing else happening in the meantime. Everyone saw it for the blatant money grab it was, hoping we would all pay to win, but it was always an optional area, so I was content to ignore it.\n\nLikewise, when they pushed out a buggy update to enable Steam Cloud syncing and ended up destroying save files containing weeks of playtime for a number of players, I was okay with forgiving them for a poorly tested update, since I had a backup file and was able to restore from it on my own. And bugs happen. I get that. Though seriously, they should have caught it in testing.\n\nThe straw that finally broke the camel's back for me was back on Earth, the main area in the game. See, they have had Steam achievements from the beginning, including one called "Unlock Everything" that would be achieved when you unlocked everything on Earth. When I started this game many weeks ago, there were 498 things to unlock on Earth. It remained that way up until the first batch of people started to get Unlock Everything, when suddenly and without any warning the goalposts were moved, an extra 128 items were added, several more weeks of playtime were now necessary to reach the achievement, and presumably there was much gnashing of teeth from people in my position as they considered whether or not it was worth it to pull out their credit card so that they could pay to win and finally make the game go away.\n\nWell, screw that. There's another way to make it go away. Delete local content and never consider anything from these devs again.\n\nAm I venting? Yes. But had I known how little regard I'd be shown as a player when I went in, I never would have downloaded it in the first place. If I can save someone else from that, I'll be happy.","June 21, 2015","false","561.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

However recent updates have unfortunately been detrimental to this game. As can be observed I have put over 65 hours into this game. I have restarted probably hundreds of times and carefully nurtured my number of angels for more than a month now. 2 main problems exist in this game.\n\n1) The moon. It's almost impossible to make any meaningful progress after the first little “burst” of gameplay. The unlock levels are very expensive and there are large gaps between upgrades (presumably this is to make you purchase 3x multipliers). The moon is simply boring and unplayable, which is a real shame because of the creativity that went into the level design.\n\n2) At 65 hours, this game has taken a large chunk of my time and I have certainly enjoyed my time with it. However with the latest update the developers added extra unlocks. This just isn’t cool. A extra 150 unlocks will take an even longer time to purchase. It’s pay to win. If you’re OK with paying money for enjoyment then thats fine but don’t expect to complete it if you don’t pay.\n\nI made a video on it if you’re interested: http://youtu.be/wdo1U37JAGc","June 17, 2015","false","65.9"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","25","31","0","0"

It's nothing but a skinner box. It doesn't even pretend to be a game. It advertises itself on the fact that you can tell it to play itself.\n\nThere has been a rise in so-called "idle games" recently. The problem is that they give your brain a tiny psychological reward for clicking the buttons. You see the numbers go up, and you can click new buttons. It addicts you until you find yourself feeling like you *have* to play. You have to get all the acheivements. You have to make the numbers go up more.\n\nBut they keep adding new achievements. They keep adding more buttons. And the worst part about a skinner box is that it works *even when you know it's a skinner box*. It would be easier to quit smoking than to stop playing this game, because at least with the smoking there are drugs and support groups to help you.\n\nThe people who made this game knew full well what they were doing. They specifically designed it to addict people and then get them to part with their hard-earned cash in microtransactions in order to get more achievements and make the numbers go up even more. They should be ashamed of themselves.\n\nThe only way to win this game is to never, ever, EVER play it.","July 31, 2015","false","74.5"," 42 of 63 people (67%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","67","42","63","10","6"

You get 7% bonus for angels (kind of currency ingame) on phone, you can watch ads and get a 2x boost.

I think it had great potential. But I can't give this a recommendation. Here is why:\n\nThe pros:\n\n1) It can be quite fun watching your empire of lemonade stands grow. The game has some nice moments like when your lemonade stands suddenly become more profitable than your oil rigs and you start shifting your investments.\n\n2) The game actually tells you when you are about to over spend on angels (the currency that stays after resetting the game) which I haven't seen in other clicker games. That means you don't have to look up guides or anything to play this game.\n\nThe cons:\n\n1) Inconsistency between mobile and PC versions. In the beginning this was my biggest gripe with the game. On mobile you get a 2x boost on all your profits for watching an ad (or rather setting the phone down for 25 seconds until the awful ad is done plaing). There is no such thing on the PC version. This makes playing on PC incredibly slower. Like by a mile slower. Like I started on pc and mobile at the same time but on PC I'm not even close to where I was weeks ago with the mobile version. Thats how much of a difference it makes. But don't even bother playing on mobile. The performance of the mobile app is abysmal. It runs so poorly that it will often not count your idle profits, leaving you with nothing after days of waiting.\n\n2) Greed. This wasn't so apparent at first but it became pretty clear after the moon was introduced. This game is not like other idle clicker games where you may have slow progress but progress none the less. Adventure Capitalist will slow to a halt if you don't decide to pay money for boosts. You will go weeks on the moon without ANY progress. There is no way of aquiring the in game gold currency needed to buy these boosts without paying money or attending events that only happen for a limited time period and after that are not open for play anymore. The developer really wants you to pay money for this.\n","January 13","false","72.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","1"

Idle games have mastered exactly what is needed to keep people hooked - and CC has far more visuals than AC's simple bars. If that game found its way onto Steam, it would be over for everyone.\n\nI saw countless of my friends' notifications popping up with "playing AdVenture Capitalist," and decided to check out what exactly the free to play game had to offer.\n\nI sincerely wish I hadn't.\n\nNow I want to 100% this stupid game.\n\nIf you like capitalism, idle games, capitalism, watching progress bars fill up, clicking, upgrading, and capitalism, then there is seriously something wrong with you (and you will most likely love this game; btw, there is a mobile version with perks that help you earn money faster).\n\nThe aesthetics of this game are simple, yet cute and charming. The artstyle can be seen on the store page previews, and the only real thing that moves is the different progress bars for each of your money-making venues (ex: lemonade stand, bank, etc). The music and sounds are very appropriate for the gameplay - annoying as hell; I muted it within minutes.\n\nControls consist of only the left-mouse click - and lots of it. If you have a macro, that will help save you from carpal tunnel syndrome. Seriously. There is a brief tutorial in the form of popups, and they appear whenever you have access (enough money) to new elements of the game like upgrading. The learning curve is non-existent - the idle genre literally translates to "the waiting game."\n\nGameplay consists of you generating money to buy businesses to generate more money, and thus the soul-sucking cycle of capitalism continues. You initially have to click constantly your money-making venue's icon (lemonade stand) to generate income. Soon, however, you will unlock enough money to afford managers, who automatically "click" their respective venue for you. This allows you to quit/idle the game and return any time later - yes, your money will continue accumulating even when the game is not running. You also unlock more venues, like banks and oil rigs, which generate massive amounts of cash - the trade off is that the better venues take longer to produce output (ex: oil rig takes 10 REAL LIFE hours initially).\n\nAs you accumulate more cash, you can buy more venues by clicking on the button underneath them. There is a ticket you can toggle that allows you to buy 1, 10, 100, or the max amount (depending on your current funds) of each venue.\n\nThere is also an upgrade page that allows you to increase the profit % of each venue.\n\nI am an upgrade ♥♥♥♥♥. This game is the bane of my existence.\n\nUpgrading and buying more venues increase the revenue that they produce. Also, at certain milestone levels (ex: 25, 50, 100, etc venues built), your venues will produce resources at a slightly faster rate - indicated by changes in the money progress bar.\n\nThe worst mechanic of this demonic game is the "angels" element. Angels act as "investors" and slowly become attracted to your increasing money. Once you reach the trillions/quadrillions, you will slowly accumulate angels. These powerful patrons give you a 2% profit bonus EACH. THAT'S FOR EACH STUPID ANGEL. The catch?\n\nWhy, you must COMPLETELY RESET your progress before the angels will become added to your team. Once they are added, you can also sacrifice them to gain massive bonuses like even more ridiculous profit levels.\n\nFor achievement hunters, stay away from this black hole. One of the achievements requires you to unlock EVERYTHING. This includes the angels, and you will need to amass a ludicrous amount of angels and money (as well as buy every single purchasable upgrade).\n\nIt is not worth it. Stay away. You have been warned.\n\nOverall, I strongly suggest you stay away from idle games. If you still insist on trying this game out because the genre interests you, then you will (most likely) not be disappointed.\n\nJust addicted.\n\nRecommend, except if you have an addictive personality. In that case, go play Cookie Clicker too. *evil grin*\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\n","April 30, 2015","true","34.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","14","17","4","2"

Clicker Heroes? Loot Clicker? A Dark Room? The Monolith? Adventure Capitalist? Or maybe none of any of these? Clicker games are almost a loophole in each human bieng's mind, while playing it, the numbers of your "atk" or "econ" grows higher and higher, and then you "unlock" areas which are typically non-game changing in terms of play style. and with each "level up" you feel accomplished, which is way so many people feel inclined to play these games. Usually with these games, the player will play quite far into the game and then end up deleting it because they finally realize how pointless it is. This game is the definition of a horrible HORRIBLE clicker game and really brings the community down. So what makes "Adventure Capitalist" one of the worst, stand alone games on steam.\n\nBeware this game is _________!\nWhats that? You think the missing letters spell addictive? You think this review will be like all the other worthless reviews on this trademarketed company's website that mostly sells games that arnt thiers and still makes gallons of money? Well you thought wrong.\n\nThis game starts out fun, I will admit it. Its like your average clicking game, where clicking is 100% what you do in the beginning but .00001% of what you do in the end. But the game takes a turn for the worst when you get to around the point I have.\n\nDevelopers hate thier players After a while, the main setting "earth" will become an unplayable battleground. Earth becomes IMPOSSIBLE, thats right, i said it, IMPOSSIBLE, one more time for the deaf, IMPOSSSSSIBLE to complete. The makers of this game are delusional, they have made it so once you reach 500 or so of the in-game unlocks(usually upwards of 55 or so hours), upgrades, and unlocks become VASTLY HUGE in currency and it is IMPOSSIBLE to complete the game without paying real life money.\n\nSo, you may be thinking to your smirk little self right now, "HA, THIS 10 YR OL KID CANT AFFORD 2 DOLLARS TO WIN!"\nyou think you got it all figured out. But you dont even know. This last update provided a way to cheat in game, a way to cheat in gold (THE PAID ONLY CURRENCY) There was a player that had cheated in around...$11,500 worth of this gold currency and used it to maximize his money intake by soooooo much, (you can check out the 3.0.0 update thread for verification :D) and he did not even come CLOSE to completing it.\n\nSo lets wrap up the game as it stands:\nPros:-Has multiple planets to "play" on, as well as events that switch up the obstacles of the game a bit\n-Offers fair time of gameplay for bieng free. If you want to waste your life away, I found you a game.\n\nCons:-Horrible soundtrack, I would rather die than listen to it for an hour, is this serious? Ummm, probably not, cause I wanna live, but trust me, its horrible and repetitive\n-The free-to-play aspect, its disgusting. I wanna vomit. This game will give you a mountain if you pay for the mole hill, you are able to complete everything except earth FAR faster than normal players, and its bad, like really bad.\n-Event rewards, event rewards are bad, WAKE UP CALL 2 gold, does not help anyone devs! thanks\n-A MISSLEADING, DISGUSTING, PLOY, OF A GAME, ha, this may seem a bit out of the blue but it is true. The game only gets hard over 50 hours of gameplay, so the devs get paid based upon how much time you spend on the game, and I believe they calculated that if the average user goes up to this time they will be in the green for years. I just feel like the devs dont really want people ENJOYING the game, they are only in it for the money, and that makes alot of sense they have not responded to any comments saying to get Earth on a road to actually completable.\n\nJudgement 2/10: -999/10 for the clicker genre:The game is your average clicker game really, no creativity, no innovations here. The devs have made the main planet unable to be completed, which I suspect is an attempt to profit off players without having to put in alot of work. The game is not very fun at all and you dont really feel accomplished after completing the other worlds (not earth of course). The game is highly "FREE2PLAY" as in, you succede faster if you pay, but even then it is not possible to accomplish earth. In my rating I say stay away, this game is the reason clicker games have so much hate, and if you want a cool clicker game you should play any other clicker game ever, because this one is horrible.","February 10","false","66.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","2"

Basicly a game you go back to once a day or every few days... Another game that with time its an easy 100% completion and another (29) achievements to add to your account... If your a badge hunter, card collector, background and emoticon hoarder this is an easy one for us... If your looking to play for just good old fun it is probably a bad find in my opionon...\n\n-My True Review-\n\nI lied to you befor and it is almost impossible to get 100% of achievements... I need the last 3 which all have to do with earth... The Dev's have been saying that they are working on a fix for earth for well over 9 months now and they have not made one but yet are talking about there new game and how its coming out soon... They have fixed bugs and made the moon easier to complete sence it was agonizingly slow at first... Earth is basicly impossible... One of the first games i have downloaded due to i was new to steam  9-10 months ago and it was free... i collect badges, cards, backgrounds, emoticons and skins... I figured clickers/idlers are easy achievements and this one gives you cards if you spend a few bucks... ***DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS GAME*** i have spent we will say 50 bucks for good measures and i only spent that a few months ago to try and complete earth... 3-4 months later i still need the 3 achievements for earth and i am no where near the last 2 i can finially see the light on 1 of the achievements... good game to idle in the background or to come back to every day or every few days... Do not play this game unless your looking for an easy 20-25 achievements in the beggining because thats what it is... The only reason they come out with new events is because they make them ridiculously hard to complete to get the in game badges for it and they want your cash... They wont fix earth ever in mo opionon because once agian they claim about how much they care about the people (You and Me) but they dont they only care about our cash... i will never take this post down even if they do fix earth because i have been waiting well over 9 months or so for them to fix it... i got 26 out of 29 achievements in like the first 2 months... 7 months later and i still dont have the last 3... Tell me there isnt something fishy here... As i said if you want to play a game where you can get a very easy 25 achievements then this game is for you but if you are about to download it for any other reason at all ***I HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME***... This is my first bad review for a game and i hate to put a bad review on any game... but the sole fact that they dont care about us players and only care about IRL (In Real Life) cash i have to post this for the people... You will become obssesed with this game and you will love it for the first few weeks then you will realise that you wasted so much of your life on this game it isnt worth it... i understand i only wasted say maybe 100 HRS or so... but agian i got 26-29 achievements in like the first 10 or so hours... Think about this download long and hard befor you even waste some of your memory space on your PC...\n\n*** Thanks for even getting back to me Dev's***\n** i wish i never spent that 50$ or so on this junk game**","May 15","false","76.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

And Mars? Doesn't have achievements at all so you don't really have an incentive to play on the easiest part. Moon is just boring.\n\nAfter playing it a bit you will notice it doesn't really have anything new and its monotous.

It's fun at first, the numbers increasing, faster and faster. You feel like you're making progress. You feel like you're doing something. BUT YOU'RE NOT. You're playing a little game. I'll get to this in a bit. Let me get back on point.\n\nSo you're making nice progress, going from the hundreds to thousands, millions, billion, trillions to octotrigintilion. Then it all disappers when you reach a point where it all slows down to a crawl. And the only way to keep playing without waiting years? You buy their pay to win stuff. Their time jumps and their dollar per second($ps) multipliers. You know the usual. They're cheat codes you buy with real cash money.\n\nYknow what? That doesn't matter relative to what I want to say next. As I'm playing this game, I have a constant feeling that I am wasting my time. Maybe it's the graphics, or maybe it's just the general simplicity of the whole game, but it's constantly nagging me as I addictedly continue to stare at the numbers and purchase upgrades, and I can't stop playing. I'm not enjoying it, I just want those numbers to go up because there's just this itch about how if I don't get an upgrade in time to increase my $ps, I'm losing that much money.\n\nIt's an addiction. I am not joking. You don't want to be addicted to this. Get addicted to some other game. There are expansive fantasy worlds to explore, intriguing mysteries, puzzles to solve, and stories to be told.

After a few weeks my motivation flared again tho once I unlocked certain things and gameplay sped up a bit. As of now I consider myself in late midgame (7000 lemon stands) and everything has slowed to a crawl. The moon which was supposed to renew my interest into the game has only helped to crush my motivation due to its slow pogression.\n\nI put in enough hours in this free to play game to say its well worth your time IF you like this kind of games. Overall placing it in the genre I d give it a 6/10.\n\nSo...lets go into details.\n\nThis game is about DECISIONS, you wont "play" this as you do other games of yours.\n\n\nYou start out with only a couple dollars and invest them into companies which can be as small as lemon stands and as big as oil companies. Each company has a "run-time" and will yield you some cash after its done. Lemon stands provide a low income but also have a low run-time so you spend some time clicking the bar in order to initate a run-time while you earn more cash which you invest into companies again. You can either buy more companies of a type you already own (increasing the efficiency of income) or invest into new ones.\n\nThe heart of the game are actually the sidebars giving you new windows with different types of options. You can recruit managers which will at first "click" the bar for you opening up more time for you to do whatever you want with (checking statistics, thinking about your strategy, play another game). Later managers reduce purchase prizes of their comany type and so on.\n\nAnother bar provides access to general bonuses which you can purchase with either money or angels (more to this later). These can be things like doubling overall income or improve a specific company type.\n\nBonuses lists all milestones which will grant you huge bonuses so its something like a "roadmap" for you to work towards.\n\nThe universal fact about AdVenture Capitalist is that everything becomes obscenly expensive very soon forcing you to wait for upgrades while youe income accumulates until you can spend it again. Progression soon will become rather slow. The game continues running even if you are offline as it simply simulates the time gone by and adds the according income onto your tab. What it doesnt do for you is spend your money or invest into upgrades. Thats the "decision" part I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe "solution" if you will is not to let the game run but to direct the flow of money you earn in order to progress in an optimal way. You will always progress, there is no way to "lose" the game or end up in a dead end but how quickly you do / how much time you spend until you hit another milestone depends on the decisions you make.\n\nSo there is a routine which becomes appearant quickly. A 2-side coin of spending money and waiting for it to generate until you can spend it again. We are not talking about mere millions here (even tho on your first run that can take a while as well) but SEPTSEXAGINTILLIONS.....dont ask me how many zeroes that are lol. Its safe to say that you ll soon move in a range of money that doesnt even exist in the whole world.\n\nSo we come to the core of the game. Percentages. How do you actually invest your money the "best possible way". Thats the actual challenge packed into a game. But the mechanics behind it can be found in everyday companies because its the wheels that turn the world. I guess any banker will have an immediate advantage at this thing :)\n\nInstead of "waiting" for years of real time until you generate enough cash (thats how long it would actually take) the game implements several factors in order to speed up the process. These are the milestones, bonuses and angels.\n\n\n\nMilestone\n\ncan be checked under bonuses and show you what happens when you reach a certain number of a specific company. Hit 100 lemon stands and your income doubles or triples or your run-time reduces. Instead of going as high as possible you rather invest enough to unlock a milestone then focus on others in order to enhance your overall gameplay. Some milestones even affect all companies so checking constantly how far away you are from a milestone is well worth it.\n\nYou could invest 100 million dollars into car wash companies which would result in a hefty profit NOW but if you wait until you hit 110 millions and put them into lemon stands (resulting in much less profit if you break it down to a profit-per-dollar base) instead you ll reach a milestone making ALL your companies 2 times as profitable.\n\nHow you do the above example doesnt matter as you will reach it anyway but how LONG you ll spend of your time to reach it does difer.\n\n\nBonuses\n\nstart out low and slow but soon become the driving force of your game. These percentages do add up over time. Everybody who paid for a house and tried to pay the bank while doing so knows what I m talking about /grin. Theres a big list of bonuses to unlock so you ll be busy for a while trying to get them all.\n\n\nAngels\n\nThese holy creatures are attracted by wealth and will accumulate over time. They dont do anything at first rather then watching you but you can always "claim" your Angels which will in effect soft-reset your game erasing all your money and deleting your companies. While before they were watching they are now "comitted" meaning they affect your work (the genre calls this "banked") throughout these soft resets. Each angel banked will increase your profit by 2%. Lets say you managed to accumulate 150 on your first runthrough that means that your NEXT run (even tho its the same in terms of gameplay) will be 3 times as fast.\n\nInstead of making your game faster Angels ensure that you make more money in less time. So if your first million on your first playthrough took you roughly 10 minutes later on you ll generate this much with a single lemon stand on your first click because you have several BILLION Angels banked.\n\n\n\nWhat follows is a combination of factors all playing together rising your income to really obscene levels. The routine is to go through the works in order to generate Angels.....soft-reset and reach your previously achieved money in LESS time. Your income rate increases this way but also do the prices of companies. Again decisions come into play. You could wait an hour for enough cash to generate in order to buy that next lemon stand or you could claim your angels NOW and be past this point in another hour.\n\nLet me assure you, you will soft-reset many many times. Its actually the core mechanic in the game.\n\n\nOnce you become rich enough you ll have the option to go to the moon where the whole game starts again just with different factors and different mechanics (if you try to play the moon as you do the earth you ll fail hard = taking so long you ll lose any fun)\n\n\n\nSo lets come to the conclusion of this game.....whats actually fun about it or makes it worth playing?\n\n\n\n\nThis game is all about progression (like any other idle game as well). Not everybody will like it of course. The fact that you can start it, let it run in the background and only occasionally check back in order to spend your income makes it perfect for a wide range of people tho. You have to make a mental leap from raising levels and getting gear to this sort of money making but at its core....its the same. Optimization and progression.","August 3, 2015","true","85.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I\'m sad to say this because I did enjoy the game for a while. But I think like many people, I played the game for a long time before realizing that eventually you get to a point in which progressing is literally impossible.\n\nI don\'t mean that progressing gets tedious and you\'re pretty much forced to choose between paying money for the game or doing something incredibly dull for a long time to feel like you didn\'t waste your effort getting to that point.\n\nI mean that the game becomes literally unwinnable. You can\'t get all the achievements or in-game collectibles/purchases. Even if you pay real money on the game. Even if you spent over $1000 of the game, you will become literally unable to progress. Many people have done the math and it takes something like 30,000,000 years to complete the game. Of real-time. So unless you are immortal and honestly think this game is going to be around that long along with Steam and achievements, you\'re not going to finish it. Ever. And it seems like the developers are really reluctant to own up to this.\n\nMany people have mental disorders or are just otherwise weak-willed and will get addicted to games like this and feel obligated to spend money. The fact that the developers make it so no matter what the game ends up impossible to progress and you can never reach your goals is just gross. They are well aware of the problem and just don\'t care. They make excuses and pretend like they\'ll eventually fix it but they never have. I can\'t express how horrible I think this is.\n\nI don\'t care that it\'s free.

Instead of leaving it on in the background to buy/ upgrade things, you'll visit it every few days (or weeks) because once you get higher, progress really starts to dwindle to an agonising crawl. The only things that keep me coming back are the events that happen every so often so good job HH.\n\nAs of now, I'm pretty much only playing for the events because each event has a different play style which is interesting but otherwise, Earth is unbeatable and Moon takes forever. Achievements are also pretty much unattainable once you're mid/ late game. A downside to Steam is not being able to take advantage of ad multipliers so perhaps it'll be better to check out the website or app.\n\nOnce the novelty of the events wear off I'm probably going to stop playing unless HH does something about the horrendously slow progress.","May 23","true","827.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The story:\n\nThe early days of Earth were quite fun. You had progress, you had to think when to restart. You could easily f*k up your whole progress if you made a wrong angel investment for example. You had quick milestones, you had slow milestones. But at the end of the day, there was progress in terms of upgrading investment buildings and/or cash/angel upgrades.\n\nThen the downfall. AdCap revealed it's true face. NO MONEY FOR US, NO PROGRESS FOR YOU. Hippo's new agenda headline.\n\nI've made about 200 buildings progress on earth since they expanded all possible investments. Without any gold. That was months ago. No progress at all. It feels like there are either crucial cash upgrades missing or the new pricing system sucks.\n\nNow for the precious, precious moon - it's funny in the beginning. Something new, somewhat different. But you soon realize that the adventure of investment progressing and stacking angels will suddenly come to an end. When hitting a certain threshold in buildings, all you do is waiting for angels - then reset to the exact same building threshold, just to reset again after a couple of days. Just a plain terrible experience compared to the original earth. It's basically angel farming while staying on the same amount of buildings for months.\n\nSo I thought I'd give gold upgrades a chance, and EVEN NOW, my moon income is terrible. Even with a 15x multiplier (around 7bucks in euro) it takes forever to gain angels. And I am not even remotely close to the next cash/angel upgrades or next building thresholds/mutliplier.\n\nI came to the conclusion that this game (since the moon patch) is intended to rip you off as you basically have no noticeable progress at all, which ruins the fun. Even the ♥♥♥♥♥iest clicker games have noticeable, steady progress rise - but AdCap doesn't (anymore).\n\nTL:DR - is fun at first with certain thresholds that take a long time, still a nice game to kill time with noticeable progress, later on becomes a pure pain in the ♥♥♥ once the extended content (new earth upgrades & the moon) is available.\n\nI don't recommend this game. Even more if you plan to thank the developers with some real $$$. These guys don't deserve it.\n\nThis is not a "pay some dollars if you want thinks a bit quicker".\nThis is "pay us dollars or you're never going to reach "the end" (in a lifetime).\n\nSTAY AWAY!","August 8, 2015","false","160.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","0"

In the current state, the game should be considered a scam and Steam should pull it until the developers fix Earth.  If you care to learn why I and so many other recent reviewers say this is a scam, please read my entire review and take some time to visit the Steam Discussions board.\n\nIt appears the developers unknowingly stumbled upon geese laying golden eggs.  But they had one problem...\n“These damn geese keep completing the game and move on to lay their golden eggs elsewhere.”\n“No more golden eggs?!?!”\n“What to do?”\n“Quick, come up with a fix, no matter how dishonest, unethical and sloppy!”\n“We’ve got it, make Earth unbeatable!”\n“Right, keep these stupid geese around a little longer by giving them useless updates to play. “\n\nFrom what the developers have posted elsewhere, they were surprised by the fast success of this game and since people were finishing Earth within weeks, they came up with additional content in the form of additional Achievements on Earth and new planets in Moon and Mars.\n\nThey designed what was a fun and addictive idle clicker game but it is obvious they don’t know anything about actual game design/game play and are learning on the fly.  They released the same version of this game on all platforms and as the developers stated on the Steam board, they quickly discovered players using phones were checking in much more frequently than they had anticipated so they had to make it more difficult (longer waits) to get to the next Achievement.  This changed the balance of time needed between Achievements for those playing on tablets and computers as they checked in less frequently.\n\nEventually the whole thing got out of control on the Steam version.  Earth became so unbalanced that even if someone is willing to spend billions of real dollars to buy in-game gold, they could not complete Earth before our real sun burns out.  Some really smart people have done the math.  Math the game developers obviously never did when they increased wait times between Achievements.\n\nBeyond the calculations, Steam players know for sure the game cannot be completed because the developers left the dev mode enable on the February update.  The same update, by the way, that wiped out many players progress.  Several fixes were immediately issued as the developers scrambled to make things right.  But a short time after shoring up those mistakes, they realized they made the February mini-game “For the Love of Money” too easy.  No problem for them, as they somehow adjusted game play, without an update and without notification, to reduce the number of Angel Investors players had earned.  Players that had earned Angel Investors on the first day the mini-game launched found their Angels reduced by half or more upon their next login.\n\nI played the iPad version before the Steam version.  An October update screwed that version up by allowing players to earn Angel Investors at a much faster rate than they were supposed to.  By the time that version was fixed, most players, myself included, would need to let their games run several months without any Achievements for their lifetime earnings to catch-up to justify the number of Angel Investors they had been incorrectly given.\nThe entire situation is a mess and the developers, in a rare moment of honesty (or a brazen attempt to keep suckers in the fold), posted on the Steam Discussions board that they would issue an update to correct the problems with Earth, stating not doing so would be “unethical”.  Their word, not mine!  Five months after their proclamation, they continue to update the game, add new content and most importantly for them, add new ways to spend real money on a game they know cannot be completed.\n\nIf selling in-game gold with the promise it will help speed up a game that you imply can be finished when it in fact cannot be finished isn’t the definition of a scam, I don’t know what is then.\n\nAnd one last comment.  Why have I and so many others wasted our time on this game?  Because the game was fun at the start and there was a set finish line.  Like a frog slowly boiling in water, unbeknownst to me the finish line was being pulled further and further away while the developers accepted my money.  Now I let the game run instead of deleting it in the hope that one day there will be an update allowing me to finish Earth.  I check-in every once in a while to see if anything has changed but do not play their monthly mini-games.  And I’m posting this review with the hope that I stop one person from wasting their time and money on Adventure Capitalist.","March 10","false","176.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

But here goes. You click and wait, click and wait. Maybe some more clicking. Then more waiting. You think you are close to finishing and then a game update adds more features and puts you further behind. You will be embarrassed explaining the game to your significant other, and often will try to minimise the window when they walk past. You will likely change your Steam profile to private, hoping no one you know sees how many hours are attributed to it. You will feel dumber for playing a game that requires just clicking on about 10 buttons, but not actually care. You will wonder whether you should leave the game running overnight or whether to close it. Game strategy keywords will suddenly appear in your browser search history. You will ignore hundreds of other Steam games you have bought in sales because this one will be quick to load. You will realise you can actually run Clicker Heroes as well at the same time to take advantage of the downtime between clicks. Game sales will come and go and you will amass even more games you don't install, since you just want to get all the achievements and finally uninstall it.\n\nOf course your mileage may vary.

This process is repeated countless times, but the system is setup in a way to elicit reward for your "investment" of playtime. This sense of reward is what makes this game worth playing. Considering it consists of one screen with just a few simple menus, its quite a feat to keep a player engaged for as long as AC does.\n\nThis game is definitely worth picking up and playing.

There is no actual end to it.  I suppose once you've completely maxed out every business it might end.  But this is not what actually even bothers me about this game.  What bothers me is that at a certain point, the game just comes to a screeching halt.\n\nSo you may be asking yourself, well, why is that?  Is she truly horrible at this game?  Perhaps.  But I will counter with a few comments on that.  First, there are many, many people who have used countless cheats and hacks trying to complete the achievements.  They still are unable to finish the game.  Second, some people better at math than I am have made some calculations and they figure that the game would take 10^18 years to complete without any cheating.  By that time, I highly doubt anything humans are doing, if they even still exist, will remotely look like what humans are doing now.  So unless some terrible B flick is to be made about some very distant ancestor finishing the quest to unlock the achievements is made, this just isn't going to happen.  Third, I have personally spent more money on premium upgrades (before I searched the internet to see where I was going wrong) than I am comfortable admitting to get over being stuck.  Even if I was terrible at the game, the amount of premium upgrades should have helped compensate for that.  I literally can load the game up, leave the computer to do dishes, use the restroom, take the trash out, and, if I'm very lucky, have seen the number change in the thousandths place by one or two digits.  Some people only check in on their game once a month and see minimal progress, if that.\n\nSo why hasn't anyone mentioned this to the developer?  Oh, they know.  They have been promising for many months to do something to help make the game playable again.  They have not done so.\n\nOn the up side, there are two unlockable planets, Mars and the Moon, that are totally completable without cheats, and a monthly event that lasts for around a week.\n\nOn the whole, I'd give this a 5/10.  The main portion of the game is truly broken at later levels that no amount of money seems to be able to fix.  But the two other planets and the monthly events are fun.  Play at your own risk.","February 18","false","339.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Cookie Clicker satirized the acheivement of power in gaming and the real world by allowing the player to do horrible things to gain more cookies, for ultimately no real purpose. This game is just happy-go-lucky, removing the entire humorous edge and point of it.

Don't feel like using the brainpower required to play a real game.

This isn't a fun game.. but.. there's unlocks. You know what they do and how it will change things, but you want to get them anyways, because they're there!\n\nI recommend this, because all must suffer my affliction.\n\n*edits to add*\nSo.. a couple hundred hours later...\n\nThere's 3 planets you can access.. OK, 2 planets and a moon. Earth, Luna, Mars.\n\nEarth is where you start, and it rewards semi-active play. Open the game a couple times a day to buy upgrades or restart to get more angels (investors who increase your profit). I find that my angels usually double within a few hours of restarting.\nLuna, the moon, is the 2nd one you're likely to unlock. It's slow. Super slow. Like don't even bother opening the game for a week kind of slow once you get to a decent amoung of investments. My angels usually double within a few days of restarting.\nMars is the 3rd planet, and it is all about active play. My angels double within minutes of restarting- of the 3 planets, Mars I've had for the least amount of time, and I've already beaten it... which happened stupidly fast compared to the other two.","September 6, 2015","true","481.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

Do you want to invest and spend the ♥♥♥♥ out of a lame joke? Have I got the thing for you, it's called Capitalist Simulator. Compared to other idle clicking games, this one is pretty straight forward, simple, and keeps you occupied when deciding what game to play next. There are a lot of witty puns to them, and you bascially just invest in enough money to go to the moon and Mars. It took me nearly 2 months to do the basics of this game, so it will take a long time, but on the bright side, it plays for you while you're doing other things. I'm currently at a point where I have so much money, I don't have enough patience for it to build up more.

There is no real substance to this game, and no skill really required, but somehow it's an awesome time and a great distraction.

As you can see I have sunk a lot of time into this game since I started playing it.  Overall I had a lot of fun playing this grinding game.  It is simple to get started in and addictive to keep resetting and move up to the next level in the Earth game.  Eventually I was hunting the Steam achievements in the end game.  The end game really slows down with improvements and progress measured in the "unlocks".\n\nPart way through you unlock the Moon.  Similar to the Earth game just very slow and trudgy.  Really feels forced to go to the Moon and do your stuff.  I would go there once a day towards the end and still not progress any further towards the next reset or the next magic speed unlock.  Completely boring and grindy.  As of the time of writing they claim they have made it better, but I did not see any improvements.  The number of angels I had on the moon has stayed the same for the last 3 days.  I am thinking it is as buggy as hell.\n\nPros:\nAddictive\nEarth is fairly fast paced with a lot of things to do in the early to mid game\nBig numbers are always fun\nFree\n\nCons:\nRepetitive\nLots of small bugs still in the game\nAngels don't update when off line sometimes\nCash doesn't update when off line sometimes\nUpgrades dissappear requiring a restart of the game or cycling between Earth and Moon (NOT fixed as of last patch)\nEnd game is a real grind\nMoon is painfully slow and not fun at all (takes over a week to double your angel investors) - may be part of bug above\nProfit numbers listed for businesses do not add up to the total number at the top of the screen. - Most notable when you are about to jump up into the next level of numbers, can have several 500+/sec businesses totalling 5 or 6 whatevers/sec yet total ticker still seems to only advance at around 1 unit/sec (can be worse than that)\n\nMy biggest complaint - The latest patch shifted the goal posts for the final achievement to make it almost unobtainable without spending lots of real cash on the game - suddenly pay to win takes over, all without any warning to Steam players. They literally doubled the number of unlocks you had to get for the achievement without adding any real incentive to keep going other than more unlocks.\n\nSummary - Fun game for a while.  Totally mindless.  Stay away from it unless you get off on waiting around for numbers to tick over on a screen.  Moon completely kills the game.","June 16, 2015","false","114.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is no actual end to it.  I suppose once you've completely maxed out every business it might end.  But this is not what actually even bothers me about this game.  What bothers me is that at a certain point, the game just comes to a screeching halt.\n\nSo you may be asking yourself, well, why is that?  Is she truly horrible at this game?  Perhaps.  But I will counter with a few comments on that.  First, there are many, many people who have used countless cheats and hacks trying to complete the achievements.  They still are unable to finish the game.  Second, some people better at math than I am have made some calculations and they figure that the game would take 10^18 years to complete without any cheating.  By that time, I highly doubt anything humans are doing, if they even still exist, will remotely look like what humans are doing now.  So unless some terrible B flick is to be made about some very distant ancestor finishing the quest to unlock the achievements is made, this just isn't going to happen.  Third, I have personally spent more money on premium upgrades (before I searched the internet to see where I was going wrong) than I am comfortable admitting to get over being stuck.  Even if I was terrible at the game, the amount of premium upgrades should have helped compensate for that.  I literally can load the game up, leave the computer to do dishes, use the restroom, take the trash out, and, if I'm very lucky, have seen the number change in the thousandths place by one or two digits.  Some people only check in on their game once a month and see minimal progress, if that.\n\nSo why hasn't anyone mentioned this to the developer?  Oh, they know.  They have been promising for many months to do something to help make the game playable again.  They have not done so.\n\nOn the up side, there are two unlockable planets, Mars and the Moon, that are totally completable without cheats, and a monthly event that lasts for around a week.\n\nOn the whole, I'd give this a 5/10.  The main portion of the game is truly broken at later levels that no amount of money seems to be able to fix.  But the two other planets and the monthly events are fun.  Play at your own risk.","February 18","false","339.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, it fails in every way. Not only does it steal that idea and get washed up in a fad, it adds in microtransactions, and entirely forgets what made Cookie Clicker great: its dark, twisted sense of humor, as you stack more and more Grandmas in slave labor fashion, creating an empire, using Eldritch artifacts and doing horrible stuff as you create a cookie empire. Cookie Clicker satirized the acheivement of power in gaming and the real world by allowing the player to do horrible things to gain more cookies, for ultimately no real purpose. This game is just happy-go-lucky, removing the entire humorous edge and point of it. Screw this game, and the other clicker games that will inevitably die off, being the fad that they are.","July 11, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I hope they continue to update and add more to this game.\n\nThe best part is its 100% Free. The game does have micro-transactions BUT it doesn't force you to buy power-ups. You can play and get really far in the game without paying any money.\n\nVery Simplistic, Addicting and Fun the best combo in a Free-to-Play Game.\n\nI give this game 100/10\n\nOne of my new favorite games :D","June 9, 2015","true","28.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's simple and yet carries layers of complexity. At the moment I'm using it as my "box-set companion game" I start it running, pop on an episode of [let's say... Dexter?] and while going through the credits/intro I rework my investments.\n\nBy the way I found a sweet bonus use for this game: Leave it running in the background while I play something more "Serious". There's nothing quite like Assassin's Creed with the music from Adventure Capitalist playing in the background.","July 1, 2015","true","141.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","6"

Well... I can't say that I don't like this game, or that I won't play it again (because I will), but this game is a big number simulator. You click a button to make your number bigger. That is LITERALLY the whole game. But there's something weirdly cathartic about having a really big number. I can't quite put my finger on it...\n\nYou click the button and think, "man, my number is so god damned big. Mmmm, look how big my number is. That is the biggest ♥♥♥♥ing number." You gotta click those buttons every couple minutes too, or your number won't get big fast enough, and nobody wants a ittle number. Chicks dig dudes with big numbers. You want your number to dwarf all other men's numbers. You want a number that's so big that it scares people a little, and they think "I don't know if I can handle all this number," but they want to try it anyway...

The calculation just caps out with the huge gaps in upgrades\n\nThe devs are the real capitalists.  The bourgeoisie to us downtrodden proletarians.  Seize the means of production and go play something else.\n\nEDIT: They announced that "We fixed it guys!"  I got the new upgrades.  A 7777x multiplier- seemed nice.  Numbers were rolling again, but my angels were still 7 orders of magnitude behind.\n\nI ran an online calculator- it would take me over 1,000 years to get 10% more angels than I have now.  I need to MULTIPLY my number of angels by more than 1,000,000x to reach the end.\n\nIf that isn't indicative of the devs' plan with this game then I don't know what is.  They're either utterly clueless about how far it is from balanced, or worse, don't intend for it to be beatable at all and cover it up with PR nonsense to make sure more players are caught in their web.","March 12","false","183.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

I'm not being snarky here, you literally can not finish this game without cheating. Eventually you're going to reach a point where you hit a wall - "that's fine," you think, "I'll just pick it back up in a couple of days. I'm sure I'll have made a little progress by then."\n\nWrong. Unless you intend to use a program like Cheat Engine to manually change the game's memory, you don't have a chance in hell of unlocking many of the game's achievements. This game actually has a exploit where it relies on your computer's memory to calculate your idle income! Neat - but the fact is this: even if you've set your clock years into the future, you won't even begin come close to the requirements you need.\n\nDon't get me wrong - if you're the kind of person who doesn't care about achievements, by all means: try this game; It's not bad. Personally, I am someone who cares about being able to complete a game, and this one doesn't play fair.\n\nIf the game weren't broken, I'd give it 2.5/5 stars - average game, could be better or worse. I'd still recommend it if that were the case, but as it stands right now, I won't.","March 2","false","66.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Basically you just need to buy some 'business', earn profit passively, buy more and earn more, get managers to automate the businesses, get more upgrades to earn profit faster. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThere's no reason to use the in-game microtransaction shop, though. Just play it casually for 10 mins, close the game and check back later. It will play itself when you're offline.\n\n6.5/10","April 6, 2015","true","0.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
