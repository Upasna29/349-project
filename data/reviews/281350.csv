You get to choose to play as either the Capitalist United States or Soviet Russia.  Your goal is to deploy special agents to the various countries around the world and, through various acts of subterfuge, sway their governments to your particular political ideology(Communism if you’re playing as Russia and Capitalism if you’re playing as the US.)  When your special agents are deployed, they can perform a wide range of nefarious acts ranging from carrying out assassinations, stealing technology, sabotaging a nation’s economy and inciting revolts.  Various historical “heroes” appear such as Che Guevara and Henry Kissinger and each have their own unique special abilities to help their respective sides.  The player has to manage their financial income, vaguely defined “resources” and technological abilities.  The game features a decent tech tree featuring tools that make your agents more effective, the space race and nuclear arms development(no, you don’t get to actually use nukes at any point.)  Grainy Cold War era propaganda videos add to the game’s atmosphere and serve as both your introduction to and reward for a game well played.  Altogether, it makes for a very intriguing concept if executed properly.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s in the execution where “US and THEM” starts to fall apart.  The game’s major problems stem from the user interface and some design choices range from questionable to downright horrible.  For starters, the world map that takes up more than half of the screen can be neither scrolled nor zoomed.  In a game where your interaction heavily relies on clicking various nations, this becomes a problem.  While larger countries like Canada, the US and Russia are easily accessible, smaller nations require pixel perfect accuracy to interact with.  Try clicking on Cuba, Ireland or Hungary and you’ll find yourself maniacally clicking shades and outlines and a handful of visible pixels in the area of these countries in vain hope that the game will acknowledge your actions.  The developers attempted to reconcile this problem by including a drop down menu with every nation listed, for quick and easy navigation.  Unfortunately, the ONLY way to place units into nations is by clicking the nation on the map.\n\nThe agents themselves pose problems as well.  When you first try to get a grasp on the agents at your employ, you begin to realize that this game desperately, desperately, desperately needs the implementation of tool tips(desperately.)  Agents are divided into 6 classes:  Spies, Assassins and Political, Resource, Financial, Military and Tech Experts.  They each perform duties that are pretty self explanatory, but for any inexperienced player it’s nearly impossible to distinguish the classes from each other.  When you view your roster of active agents, they’re sorted by class.  However, they’re not labeled by name, but rather solely by character portrait.  While you can go to the purchase units screen and see the class’s name that each portrait represents, new players will need either amazing memories or a few hours of gameplay before they’re positive which are which.\n\nOn that same roster screen, you have the ability to “train” any agents not in a foreign country.  To do this, you click an oval to the right of the agent’s name.  So what happens when you click the oval?  Does it get a check mark?  Does it display the words “in training?”  Nope.  The oval simply changes color from orange to green.  Or was it green to orange?  Either way, you better remember which means “in training” because there is no other distinguishable way to tell which agents at home are training.  This again could all be fixed with a simple tool tip, but they simply don’t exist.  Even better, the game SHOULD automatically have inactive agents at home go into training rather than just consuming a salary every turn until you remember to do something with them.\n\nThe most glaring problem with the interface happens every time you click “end turn.”  First, you’re met with individual pop-up news boxes displaying all the actions your opponent took against nations under your control.  That’s fine.  That’s important information.  You need to know what areas your opponent is targeting so you can adjust your strategy accordingly.  What ISN’T important information, however, also pops up.  Bundled in between the important information are morale updates for every agent you have deployed in a foreign nation.  These updates go one of two ways:  1)  Your agent is having a “great time” in whatever luxurious nation you sent him or 2)  Your agent protests having to be stuck in some miserable place.  As you play the game longer, you naturally end up having more and more agents in the field.  As things heat up, you can have upwards of 2-3 dozen agents working in foreign nations at any given time.  A separate window will pop up that you HAVE to click through for each.and.every.one.  Each.and.every.turn.  It’s beyond monotonous and incredibly unnecessary.  To rub salt in the wound, you have the option of adjusting your “news” settings.  Frustratingly, however, while you can turn off notifications for enemy actions, random events and the like, you can’t do anything about the morale updates.  Apparently your opponents actions are trivial and optional information, but reading the same more updates 20-30 times in a row is so absolutely vital that the option to turn them off isn’t included.\n\nThere are other gripes to be had with “US and THEM”, including but not limited to the inability to save your preferences(they reset to default upon EVERY reboot), an almost intentionally inaccurate RNG(you’ll find yourself failing tasks that display a 75% + success rate far too often), nations randomly deciding to revolt on their own and failing(and potentially killing every agent you have in that nation in the process), horribly implemented “features”(such as the ability to “name” your individual agents:  Here, the game DOESN’T turn off hotkey functions while you type, so a plethora of letters can’t be used, such as “C” and “T”) and certain “heroes” being far, far too overpowered(for example, sending Che Guevara and a Political Expert into any enemy nation guarantees a revolt in your favor in 2-3 turns.)  Even these complaints seem trivial when compared to the final stab in the eye.\n\nThe game simply lags far, far too often.  When playing other strategy games, it’s acceptable if the game hangs up momentarily from time to time.  Games like Crusader Kings are processing actions of over a hundred AI’s in real time, so it’s to be expected.  Games like Civilizations V have comparatively advanced graphics including waving flags, hammering workers and wavy oceans, so it’s ok if it doesn’t scroll as quickly as you’d hope.  However, when this game lags, it’s absolutely unforgivable.  The game occasionally lags during routine clicking during YOUR turn.  While this is going on, the software has absolutely no other processing to do.  There’s only one AI and it’s completely inactive during your turn.  There are no immediate effects of placing a unit, clicking the word “cancel” or any other user operation that warrant any type of system hang up.  The lag is reminiscent of what you see on an old computer system during a windows update and it happens often enough that I’ve found myself wondering if the program is doing something on my computer in the background that I really don’t want it doing.  It’s completely unacceptable.\n\nThe saddest part is that almost every one of these problems could be fixed with a decent patch.  Don't expect one from this developer though(look at their website, this game came out in 2010 with no updates.)  So save your money.","March 19, 2014","false","8.3"," 255 of 312 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","255","312","0","15"

Needs lots of micromanaging (unless you use the auto tools, but seriously why would you do that).\nYou need a good memory + geographical memory (otherwise youll have to click a lot between news panel and country selection).

It leaves nothing from the period and the events out. Secret Agents, Cold War heroes, Arms Race, Space Race, the need for oil, need for money, Military dictatorships…\n\nGameplay is pretty original in many parts of the game. To give an example: When you place an agent in a country is invisible to the enemy and safe. The longer he stays there he improves his operational ability (in sabotages, assassinations, starting a revolution etc), but also the longer he stays the more possible it gets to be uncovered and a target. Also if another agent is arrested in the country or in another country that is a member of his spy network (big spy networks are more powerful and more in danger to collapse the same time), he might reveal the presence of all his fellow agents in the country (better research fast a suicide tooth in order to help your agents not to break under torture).\n\nSince every agent is a person with certain skills, loyalty and morale, they don’t like to be left exposed. So after an assassination or arrest attempt or if somebody from the network is arrested or dead, they expect from you to protect them and if you don’t bad things can happen (they even might change sides to save their life).\n\nThe above is only a small part of the gameplay of a complex game about all aspects of the cold war. So you better see the tutorial and read the manual if you want to win.\n\nFor me another huge plus of the game is that it has lot of humor. All the Spy Gadgets Research part is hilarious! Also there are many random events that never happened but could have been real.\n\nFor the end I left the best part which is the Heroes. In this game you get to use Che or to assassinate Fidel Castro, the Pope and the Queen of England!","March 18, 2014","true","5.9"," 59 of 86 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","59","86","0","0"

The game is very...interesting. I think its best to do pros and cons\n\nPros:\nGood theme: The game really feels like a struggle against the enemy.\nWhat is simulated right, is simulated right: The system does a great job of simulating lots of concepts from the war, such as the domino effect, the communist sandwhich, the iron curtain, etc. Also the heroes that are simulated decently well.\n\nCons:\nHorrible UI: Probably one of the worst I can remember. Some things are so absent that you wonder if they even put any thought about it at all.\nConfusing Concepts: Why doesn't weapons seem to help arrest attempts? What does the military score really mean? Why do the chance percentages seem to be weird? How do I even stop Che? Why would I ever intervene militarily? I've read the manual, and I still don't even understand half of the game.\n...And then there's what's not simulated right at all: Or just plain absent. Why are my agents of the CIA being arrested, IN AMERICA? Why is Che an unstoppable monster? Why isn't there anyone else fighting for my block? I very much remember much of the cold war was spend secretly funding other revolutionary groups. In this one it seems like there's no element of any one else, just you and them, but it seems like you are just playing political leveraging, and less covert operations. Lots of stuff just feels wrong.\nRandom Access Memories: The random events just feel weird. The events work and make sense, but their random nature makes it really weird. Chernobyl had a meltdown in 1967. Its just weird.\nReal, Real-time simulation: As nice as it is progressing one month at a time, it makes the game drag on and on and on. Its excruciating when there's nothing to do but press end turn.\n\n\nOverall: Just wait for Twilight Struggle PC. It'll probably be better.","November 11, 2014","false","4.8"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","0"

After Patch 1.2.2 things are a lot better but there are still some interface issues.\n\nIn any case the game features a unique and original gameplay that I have never seen in any other game, also is the only serious PC strategy game about cold war.\nThe game tries to include everything that took place during the cold war era like, espionage, space race, arms race, heroes and villains, real events from the period and some fictional events that could have happened and many more.\n\nEntering the game the user has to select between CIA and KGB.\nPlaying with CIA seems easier but KGB side has a lot of good heroes and it is not so depended from oil producing countries, mainly because Soviet Union produces enough energy to cover all eastern block needs. This gives the communist player a clear target to attack the capitalists’ energy production countries.\n\nThe user has to manage a lot of things in 2 levels. There is a grand strategy level that includes Space Race, Nuclear Weapons, Tech Research, Money and Energy and a micromanagement level that involves the Agents that operate inside each country on the map.\n\nIf a political block is ahead in Nuclear Arsenal gains an intimidation advantage that pays each turn in converting more citizens into its ideology. Something similar happens with space program achievements that give prestige points.\nTech research helps your Agents to attack or defend better, to intercept information, to endure severe interrogation and many more benefits.\nFinally energy sufficiency is important to maintain economy and a high quality of life, while money pays for your units and operations.\n\nBut the real dirty job that provides resources for the grand strategy level of the game is done from the field agents on the map.\nThe user has to produce and deploy an army of secret agents on the map in order to defend, attack and collect crucial information. All agents are hidden from the enemy and this keeps them safe. The longer they stay in a country the better they get, but this also increase the possibility to reveal their existence to the enemy and the minute that this happens they are not safe anymore.\nAll agents when placed in a country of the same political block act as experts of their type and when placed in an enemy country they act as saboteurs.\nIn this level of the game there is a lot of micromanagement and a mini RPG level, since each agent harvests skill, experience and stats while on the field. His loyalty to the cause is also very important for his performance and not to accept bribes. So try not to send them to impossible missions or station them for very long in a country with low luxury level like Mongolia.\n\nThe most important unit is the Spy. Spies have the ability to uncover the enemy secret agents. They can also arrest and bribe enemy agents. The 2nd most important unit is the Assassin. Use him to kill your enemies and the enemy heroes (but they must be really good and experienced in order to do that). Political, Financial, Energy, Tech and Military agents might look equally important but they are not. Political agents are far more important than the others because they can convert citizens, make political sabotages and incite revolutions. Financial experts are also very important as they can increase your funds and sabotage the enemy’s income.\n\nAnother huge part of the game is the Heroes. Each one of them has his special ability to help you in your cause. In my opinion Communist heroes are a lot stronger but this balances the fact that Capitalists control more countries and have a lot more money. You can use your assassins in order to take them out and if you are a cold war ear fan there is for sure at least one prominent public figure  of the period that you want to kill!\n\nThe game plays turn by turn and you have to think a lot and plan ahead your moves in order to win.\nThere is a lot of micromanagement involved and since there are many countries on the map and the grand strategy level at the same time, there are some interface problems. The user interface could be a lot better designed and more user-friendly, so be warned about that.\nAnother thing that I didn’t liked is that playing with CIA is very similar like playing with KGB. There should be some different units for each side that would make the experience different.\n\nIn all I had many fan hours with this game and I recommend it for such a low price.","April 15, 2014","true","13.5"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","5"

There are events or special characters in certain countries, but in general  trying to influence or take over France as the communist feels very much the same as trying to take over Thailand.\n- Countries in europe taht were historically very firmly set in one alliance or the other are far too easily taken over by the other side. For example in 1966 the AI took over Poland from the soviet block, while i with relative ease took over West Germany from the western block. Entirely ahistorical and far too easy to do within the first turns of the game. Same with taking over Japan and Souh Korea as the communists (very easy in game, would be nigh impossible in RL 1960s).\n- As the flipside, some countries in the 3rd world are far too hard to influence after a revolution took place one way or the other. In real life Boliva for example experienced numerous coups and revolutions within a very short time.\n- Some stability issues. I experienced freezes during some of my turns.\n- The UI is very bad. The main screen is the only screen which shows a map of the wole world. You can't zoom in, so trying to click on small states like Bhutan, Guatemala or even Belgium becomes somewhat problematic.\n- One spy class (Political) is what you will be spending the vast majority of money and attention on, most other classess are much less usefull and feel more like a side show.\n- No diplomacy to speak of.\n- Moreover, there is not much interaction between which countries are part of your alliance and which are not. Israel joining your alliance should lower your relations with Arab states and vice versa. Pakistan should lower your relations with Inda - you get the picture. No such thing in the game.\n- While you can reunite germany to a single country if you control both east and west, you can't do the same with south&North Korea, South&North Vietnam.\n- There is no separatism, so you can't for example back Biafra or Katanga.\n- You can take over a country only by raising popular support for your ideolog and then launchign a revolution. You can't slowly influence the givernment to join you gradually. You can't launch a military coup. You cannot launch, sustain and then win a guerrilla war. VERY dissapointing\n- It is literlaly Us vs Them, no country is ever neutral and you can't make them gradually chage from a hostile state to a neutral one. There's also no 3rd parties to court or attack.\n- Military intervention is far too expensive and far too unlikely to suceed in comparison with rela life (Hungary 1956 etc).  In this game you will almost never launch a military intervention, as its cheaper to lose a state and then retake it once gain via covert operations and a revolution.\n- The game does not allow or simulate the effects of US or Soviet bases in some country (Warsaw pact eastern bloc countries, South Korea, Japan etc). 1990s game "Balance of Power' had this.\n\n\nOverall while the game had potential, the devs failed to provide enough chrome and enough unique historically-accurate specific issues for each country. The UI is very bad and the game feels unbalanced.\n\nI really hoped I could reccomend this one, but for said reasons I really can't.","January 9, 2015","false","8.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Especially in how you use the spy networks.\n\nIt is what a Tropico game is to SimCity: not too complicated but still challenging and very addictive. The quality was good, it never crashed during 9 hours of continous gameplay.\n\nIt has a unique approach of mainly using spy and covert tacticts to subdue your enemy states.\n\nYou get 7 types of agents to use: an assassin, a spy and five types of saboteurs.\nEach saboteur will damage one particular aspect of society: finances, resources, politics, technology and military.\n\nSpies are used to build networks, which adds bonuses to those in the network.\nYou can also use spies to make bribes and arrests, steal secrets and so on.\n\nThe stats of each agent will change over time, for example their morale might decrease.\nAn assassin with low morale who's in charge of protecting your president is weak to bribery from enemy spies.\n\nThe idea is to sabotage each country enough so that people will revolt.\nIf a country in your alliance is in danger of revolting you can use money to financially support the faction in power and hopefully prevent the revolt. This is very expensive though.\n\nEach country has different attributes that affect how easily they are turned and how important they are to winning the game. However it may stilll be worthwhile to turn a low-ranking country as it will affect neighbouring enemy states as well.\n\nYou can recruit new agents, there's no limit apart from financial as they are very expensive.\nYou also need to train your new agents as otherwise they will be useless, and training costs both money and time.\n\nYou can research the gadgets your agents use: assassination weapons, interrogation techniques, surveilance gadgets etc.\n\nEach political superpower has a set of leaders and henchmen: Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Henry Kissinger etc. Assassinating them might make it easier to turn a country, but I didn't notice any difference to be honest.\n\nThe game has some bigger flaws:\n* I can't get the game to go full-screen, some countries are so small that its easy to put your agents in the wrong country\n* the game has no easy way of locating agents who are out in the field, you have to click around and search for them\n\nAll in all a good game with unique gameplay.

The concept seems awesome, but it's a big letdown.  The game is very simple and repetitive.  You buy spies, assassins, and political advisors over and over to influence smaller countries before bigger countries to get the domino effect, and focus on countries that are rich in income and natural resources.  The tech, resource, and military advisors are situation specific.  Space race?  Forget it.  Nuke research?  Forget it.  Just zero them out and pour all your research into spy tech.  Lose a spy from an assassination or revolution gone wrong?  Buy two more to replace it.  Heck, buy four more so you can train them in advance.  Also, buy finance, tech, and resource advisors to boost your economy where it counts too.\n\nWhat really stinks is the in game spreadsheet of all your spies doesn't hone in where agents are located if you click on their row.  In other words, you have to remember where your hundreds of agents are on the board.  If any go passive from completing a mission, but you forget about them, you'll be stuck paying upkeep for nothing for the rest of the game.\n\nThe game does give you a master plan button that automatically executes missions if they're successful within a certain probability, but still, you're just doing the same thing over and over again.  The hardest part of the game is upkeep since agents cost $15k per turn in the field.  You'll buy a bunch of agents since you have so much to do, but then you won't be able to afford more towards the game's end where you're mopping countries up.  I guess the capitalist campaign was easier since you didn't have to do as much of this though, and you already start with the Middle East which gives you a boatload of resources.  As the commies, I just influenced Iran, Iraq, Saudis, then Argentina and Brazil at the same time that I mopped up the Middle East.  Then I took Japan, Pakistan, Thailand, Norway, Finland, France, Mexico, Italy, Britain, South Africa, Indonesia, Australia, and Canada.  The computer took Poland, Czechoslavkia, Hungary, Vietnam, Angola, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Laos from me, but who cares?  I even got spontaneous revolts in Greece, Turkey, Algeria, Peru, Bolivia, Burma, Malaysia, Mozambique, and Chile.\n\nI dunno... I beat the game by 1970 both as capitalists and communists.  It just wasn't that much of a challenge even if it's harder to take Belgium than Britain.  South Korea and West Germany are a pain in the butt to influence also.  China's a pain in the butt to take as Capitalists, but you just have to surround it with capitalist countries and let the domino effect work out.  The communists don't start with many lands, so it's all about picking them off one by one until the Soviet Union and China are all that's left standing.  When the computer spies on your homeland too, all you have to do is assassinate its agents one by one every game month. That kills its treasury very fast since it has to train skilled spies over and over.  Without spies, Canada stops flip flopping too since assassins can kill the Pope and Kissinger so Che can get down to business.\n\nThe computer tried to kill me with Chernobyl in 1967, but did that work?  Nope.  This would be GREAT as a multiplayer game, but there's no option.","May 13, 2014","false","7.6"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/palleonsa/recommended/281350/","palleonsa","Palleon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/palleonsa/","323 products in account","It's a game with a few major flaws, but for 2 dollars, I got more than my monies worth out of it. It plays as a board game, it's turn based, and your goal is to influence a set number of countries over to your ideology. You have a bunch of agents you can put in countries which can make it easier to spark a revolution, and some countries are more important than others, which helps you flip other countries as well. The game isn't super deep, but I think there's enough there to make it fun. I played on normal, and while I ran into some pitfalls and was on the verge of collapsing at a few points, once you know what you're doing and stabilize your initial situation, the game is not extraordinarily difficult, and the learning curve isn't too steep, if you read the manual and the tutorial, you should pick up enough to get by, the rest is trial and error.\n\nAs I said though, there are a bunch of negatives, that may be dealbreakers for some people (and for its regular price, I'd consider them to be). The biggest one is the UI, it's total garbage, and for a game made in 2010, some of these issues are inexcusable, I've played early 90's games that did a better job. The game is tied to a single resolution, that does not appear to be designed for widescreen monitors (it did not display some text correctly, the top menu bar of your resources and income is not fully visible and there's no way to fix this, and some arrow keys have "ghosts" next to time). While there is a listing of all your agents, and where they are, there is no way to click on that list and go to them, so you have to remember where you have agents in the 70+ countries of the game to have them each take actions. There is a "master plan" menu that lets you automate all tasks with a certain success rate, but sometimes this isn't good enough, so it's very easy to forget where you have people and they will just sit around doing nothing the entire game.\n\nThe other big negative for me is total lack of feedback about what is going on in the game. For example, I have an assassin, of skill 99, exp 99 (the highest possible in the game), and I'll have a 7% chance to execute an enemy of only 20 skill. The game gives you the chance of success, but there's no way to tell how it arrives at that number, and in that particular example I ran into, it seems very bizarre, especially when you'll get a 70% chance to kill with a much less qualified agent elsewhere. There's a ton of technologies in the game, there are four trees, each with a bunch of techs that give you bonuses, but again, while the game explains what each tech is (for example, dead drops, and it explains what a dead drop is if you didn't know), but there's nothing that explains how that translates to what having that tech does in the game, how much better it lets you avoid detection, or detect other agents, etc. So you have this research system that is large enough so that you'll never get everything, but there's no way of prioritizing what is the best value or use to you, because there's just no way of knowing what the practical benefit to any of these things are, other than they are (allegedly) providing a bonus.\n\nThe final negative is lack of multiplayer, this is a game where I think if you played against another human, even with the above problems, would actually be a blast to play, becasue the whole point is hiding agents around the world and trying to spark revolutions as quickly and quietly as possible, and having to go up against an actual human intelligence as opposed to an AI that does not really make the best decisions would be an entirely different ballgame.","May 20, 2014","true","19.4"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

A video which crashed my computer with no option to force quit mind you.\n\n'US and THEM' isn't inherently bad. It doesn't have to be something that I feel obligated to warn others against. The era, the concept, the skill building elements all can come together to a fantastic product. Even the mechanics of them game don't rule it out of being capable of something that could possibly resemble fun! This wouldn't be the first game in which your interaction with the game was based solely on moving numbers around. However, when that is your core mode of gameplay, it has to be a priority to make the players actions feel engaging. Audio-Visual feedback would go a tremendous way in making this game better. As well as an interactive tutorial.\n\nRuling:\nTwo Hammer & Sickles out of a possible Ten Hammer & Sickles","June 23, 2014","false","0.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

When loading it up, it is impossible to actually read some items in the interface, can't even follow the tutorial due to that.

He does a great job of explaining many things that will help lull you to sleep at night, and you get the feel that the game really WAS developed during the cold war. As a result you'll need a computer at least the size of your house to run it, and with enough computing power to do complex addition and subtraction. six thumbs up and my pants thumb way waaaaay up.","March 18, 2014","true","2.7"," 26 of 75 people (35%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","35","26","75","2","4"
