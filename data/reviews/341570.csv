Along with positive movement in the multi-player. I feel confident this game will continue to kick ♥♥♥ and take names. The team seems very receptive to feedback. The few minor bugs I have encountered, altho I should have reported, I am lazy american. LOL So instead I ingnore them. And love the game for what it is, a solid TD.\n\nEDIT2: After the first half dozen levels, the maps get LOTS better.\n\nEDIT3: Game keeps getting better and better. from balance to gameplay options. This game is heading in a very positive direction.\n\nI am torn, altho the level design is uninspired the gameplay is pretty decent. At first the mechanic of "powering" your towers was off putting. As I played a couple rounds, it grew on me and became part of the challange. This TD game has a lot of potential. The devs have mentioned multi-player as well, in the not so distant future. That was the selling point for me.\n\nIf you have not been jaded by previous EA burns, and you can go long on the game, I would recomend this game for its price. BUT if you are looking for a polished game that is awesome, wait a couple months and see how the progress unfolds.\n\nWill this be a fail like "the dead linger"?  or will this be a hit like "the forest"? only time will tell.","November 10, 2015","true","24.5"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Meet Unterrainer Informatik OG a small but experienced team of three software developers led by Psilo, the company’s lead programmer, software engineer. They have a well developed philosophy that in today’s age of sandbox games and user generated content that there is still time for old fashioned games. They believe in the fundamentals of gaming that are being thrown out of the window in favor of glitz and glamour. Those fundamentals being that a ‘game, above all other things, needs to be based on a good idea and needs an interesting story. I agree with this appraisal. This is of vital importance because if you are lacking in these things then it is impossible to create something that people want to play for an extended period of time. Even in today’s pick up and throw away world you still need these fundamental things.\n\nSo what exactly is Throbax TD? That’s an easy one to answer. It’s a tower defense game in which you, the player, have to survive waves of enemies otherwise your planet is destroyed and thus the game over. But it’s not your standard tower defense game. That would be too simple and although the production isn’t glamorous what it does offer is something fresh and challenging. As the Steam description aptly states there are two phases of gameplay involved. The first phase is an RTS where you use your strategic thinking in building your defense systems in order to avoid the incoming onslaught. The game then transitions into what would be considered a typical tower defense game. These two phases work wonderfully well together. You can clearly see where the developers draw their inspiration for the game from – which they unabashedly state is the tower-defense map in Frozen Throne, one of the most popular maps in gaming history. They have big shoes to fill if they intend on living up to their aspirations but thus far the development choices have been intelligent.\n\nArguably the most fascinating aspect of the project is that there is multiplayer. Unfortunately, in my time with the game before going to print I never got involved in that component of the game. However, people that I have discussed the game with me advise that the current status of the multiplayer is weak but there is more than sufficient grounds to believe that the multiplayer as it is developed will likely become the lifeblood of the game.\n\nThe graphics and sound are not going to blow you away. The team have concentrated on giving the best playing experience possible. The team have not offered any of the bells and whistles that you have come to expect from modern gaming. This would work against everything that the team stands for. If you’re looking for your smoke and mirrors then you’re best to look away.\n\nThrobax TD is definitely a throw back to an older age in gaming but it’s a delightful visit and one that is highly recommended. At $2.99 it’s a cheap investment into a promising title.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 27","true","27.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Gameplay is difficult, made more so by the amount of stuff that you need to know which the tutorials don't address. The single player campaign requires tremendous amounts of grinding, because your overall strength is limited by how much cash you make, and that's limited by what levels you can play on in what difficulties, so there's a fairly linear grind that has you replaying these same, circular little levels that do nothing and go nowhere (the singleplayer experience of this game), as you try desperately to keep the number of creeps below 100 (the unstated lose condition for the game, though you figure it out quick; there's also a nice visual effect that makes it clear you're boned as the creep number climbs up).\n\nBut it's a lot of fun. Seriously, give it a try. Funstrating. There are deep mechanics to this simple looking game. It's compelling to try to get further. Levels are unforgiving, even brutal, as a lot of the difficulty ends up being down to not allowing exponential increases in the enemies on screen... Balance seems to be 1. good, and 2. absent, in that 1. you'll find levels get progressively harder and you'll enjoy being challenged, but 2. there is no real effort made to ensure the player progresses at any given speed - you just slam into a brick wall of unsurpassable difficulty, or the level is easy and you can do it fine. Either you're over the hump and can do more damage than the enemies can take hit points, or you're not and you have to replay earlier levels more.\n\nThere are a number of improvements possible for this game, but it's already a quixotic, charming, maddening, enjoyable title. Hopefully the designers will continue to improve it. But I can recommend it as an enjoyable and even somewhat innovative Tower Defense title right now, as long as you're willing to lose quite a lot if you're trying to progress through the levels too quickly, and don't mind a total lack of hand-holding past a few basic tutorials.","April 27","true","8.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The pricetag isn't high at all concidering what you're getting for the money. Game itself is stable and has no issues what so ever.\n\nI'm truely so amazed by the Devs. If you find any error or what so ever or have any question, they'll answer at once and deploy a patch ASAP if there's a bug. I've never exprienced something like this. It's not mods, it's the developers! They even develop the game further at the request of the public!!!\n\nI'm used to the opposite where they blame their bugs on everything else but the game and the nobody cares to answer or your post ends up deleted due to a review on how they're just running away with the money.\n\n\nThe game is pretty stable for EA, there aren't any bugs or anything that's making it crash,\n\nNegative?\n\nYou haven't bought the game!","January 28","true","8.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
