The tutorial starts you in a hanger, shows you the controls and 10 seconds later your station is attacked. You are then led on a series of short mini-mission objectives wherein you go through a few wormholes, dodge asteroids, fight a few stray enemies, and then it's on to the next mission.\n\nIf this game had minimal voice acting it would help tone the difficulty down to match the gameplay. If the game remarketed itself as a more intense shooter and less of an RPG-esque play style, I believe it would be successful. As it is now, however, not worth the space credits.\n\n\n(If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up ❤)","December 19, 2015","false","0.8"," 36 of 57 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","36","57","3","0"

It would be neat if they each had unique abilities and weapons.\n- Kind of lackluster endings to each level, it would be nice if there was some sort of reward or upgrade system for completing each mission.","February 4","true","0.8"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"
