Randal's Monday is not a bad game, it's just a flawed gem with many questionable designs and mechanics.\n\nFirst, the story: As you already know, this game has ♥♥♥♥ton of pop-culture references about movies, video games, tv series from the 80s and 90s, combined with a Groundhog Day-esque story with Kevin Smith's dark humor style. Great writing, great voice acting (which contributes a lot to the dialogues) and a little bit of "nostalgia" factor all made Randal's Monday's story seems to be the biggest selling point of the game...\n\nHowever, after 6 hours (about chapter 4 into the game), the story starts falling apart. First, all references get old quickly and even some of them aren't "approriate" at some situations. The game suddenly gets serious (TOO serious) in chapter  6, and it leads to the disappointing ending in chapter 7. It seems like Nexus Game Studios was out of trick, the later half of the game feels rushed and it lacks of charm from the first chapters.\n\nThe main problem of this game is gameplay. Of all point-n-click adventure games that I've played, I never experience such a frustrating experience like in Randal's Monday. Think about the illogical puzzles in The Whispered World, triples them and you get puzzles in Randal's Monday. The game requires player to backtrack a lot, but Randal moves very slowly with tiresome on the screen. Many puzzles consists of small steps to be completed, yet the result isn't rewarding at all, especially when all the logics are tossed out of window,\n\nRandal's Monday has a "hint" system, but please let me call it a "walkthrough" system. Instead of giving hints, the game litterally spills out how to solve puzzles. Bravo!\n\nConclusion: I might be the only person on the planet that was hyped for Randal's Monday, but to be honest, the game didn't impress me at all. Great writing, top-notch voice acting and decent soundtracks aren't enough, but the gameplay itself suffers from too many conflicts in design.\n\nI don't recommend this game at $25 price tag (again, are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me ? all previous Daedalic's games except Blackguards were priced at $20, and they had better quality, artstyle and level of polish. Don't tell me the appearance of Jeff Anderson helped jacking up the price), but at $15 or lower then... maybe.","November 13, 2014","false","19.3"," 199 of 256 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","199","256","0","0"

It really sits on the borderline between a thumbs up/thumbs down, so I've gone with 'recommend' as I'm feeling charitable today. Make no mistake though, this game has plenty of issues. Let me explain...\n\nPros + Art style is decent enough\n+ References to just about every cult phenomenon you can think of (although the constant references get pretty grating after a while)\n+ Plenty of game for your money\n+ Runs fine/controls are decent enough\n+ Some amusing lines\n+ Adult humour/storyline, which makes a nice change for a point and click game\n+ Plenty of game for your money\n\nCons - Puzzles are ridiculously hard in places with ludicrous illogical solutions, some of the most bizarre and frustrating I've ever seen in this type of game. I used a walkthrough for more than half of this game\n- Really overstays its welcome. I mean, I usually appreciate decent length in a game, as it offers better value for money and allows you get immersed in a rich story. With this game, however, I got pretty sick of it and by the end I just wanted it to finish.\n- Way too much dialogue which means it feels incredibly slow-paced. And this is coming from someone who usually loves the dialogue in p&cs, so much so I normally make sure I exhaust all dialogue options with all characters. Here, I was skipping it more often than not.\n- Really not as funny as it thinks it is.\n\nOverall Overall, it might be worth picking up in a sale if you love point and clicks and have exhausted your Steam backlog, particularly if you fancy a more adult themed (yet still light hearted) p&c game - there aren't that many out there. Otherwise, there are better games for you to spend your money and time on.","November 1, 2015","true","41.4"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","0"

The game was actually developed by a different studio, and it shows.  There were spelling errors, a glitchy interface, and the ending narration kept repeating itself over itself, so at one point I had three narrators talking to me at once.  Yikes.\n\nThe humor in this game is crude in nature, by which I mean puking/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/gore/excessive swearing.  For some people, this is right up their alley.  Personally?  I was not amused.  Don't get me wrong: the occasional non-crude thing was funny.  I really enjoyed the four characters who show up near the end of the game to help you (I won't mention who they are, to avoid spoilers).  But for a comedy game, way too many jokes fell flat.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, the main character is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  My guess is that, after the success of Rufus in the Deponia trilogy, Daedalic wanted to make another Rufus-y character, but wanted to up the ante.  However, by increasing the main characters snark and self-centeredness, they lost a lot of the charm that made Rufus likeable.  And no one wants to get stuck playing as a main character they hate.\n\nI will give this game a hand, however, for its abundance of nerdy references.  Randal's Monday is over flowing with references to famous movies, video games, TV shows, etc: Star Wars, Back to the Future, Clerks, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Portal, Fallout, Bioshock, Resident Evil, A Clockwork Orange, Pulp Fiction, Game of Thrones, the Sopranos, just to name a few.  Seriously, it would take forever to list all of the media referenced in this game.\n\nIf you hardcore love nerdy references, and aren't bothered by the excessive vomitting, gore, and generally dumb-assery, then give this game a shot.  Maybe buy it on sale.  Otherwise, don't bother.  There are plenty of other point-and-click adventures that are more worthy of your time.","August 8, 2015","false","34.4"," 46 of 63 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","46","63","2","0"

Randal himself is a very dis-likable character, take a lazy, borderline alcoholic smart ♥♥♥. Then add some kleptomania and finally make them a sociopath and there you have Randal. Randal is certainly that drinking buddy we all had growing up that we didn't really like but was good to have at a party but a whole lot worse.\n\nThe story starts in a bar as Randal, his best friend Matt and Matt's girlfriend Sally are drinking to celebrate their engagement. While Sally is away, Matt shows Randal the engagement ring that he got for a Dorito from a homeless guy and so enters lord of the rings nods left, right and center. After too much to drink and throwing up in the alley Matt, drops his wallet with the ring of power inside, Randal being the kleptomaniac picks the wallet up and keeps it for safe keeping but strangely doesn't give it back the same night. In the morning Randal finds that a series bad things happen to him, mainly his own fault mind you and through more story which I won't spoil, you discover that the ring is cursed. Soon Randal finds himself trapped in a time loop, repeating that same Monday over and over except there's one difference. Everything he does changes the past present and future so while he repeats the same Monday over and over the things he has direct contact with can be affected by him. An example of this is the fire escape next to his apartment, early on in the game you use that to avoid your landlord and the whole thing collapses after it does every Monday from that point the fire escape remains broken.\n\nI'll be the first to admit point and clicks are not my thing unless they have a great setting and story, their repetitive nature grinds on me very fast. In terms of mechanics Randal's Monday is no different that other point and clicks, throughout each location there is an array of objects and people to interact with. Usually this takes the form of a primary interaction and secondary interaction. Primary interactions are where Randal actually physically does something like initiating a conversation or stealing something. Secondary interactions are almost always where Randal will make an observation about the object or person while this can be as simple as stating what an item is sometimes these observations will contain clues as to what to do with that item or person. If your unsure of which objects are interact-able you can hold down spacebar which will light up all interact-able objects but not all of them will be important.\n\nMovement between locations is done via the subway system. At locations you can walk between rooms or if your impatient you can double click the entrances to instantly load the location. One thing I really enjoyed about Randal's Monday was that the game self deprecating an example of this can be seen when using the subway on the load screen. When the load screen comes up you get helpful hints at the bottom of the screen and while there are some that pertain to the game often they are hints like 'upgrading your bases benefits all your troops' and other references to different video game genres. The game makes fun of being a point and click and it makes the whole game quite endearing in a way.\n\nAs with many point and clicks, Randal's Monday is filled with puzzles, these take the form of finding ways to acquire items and achieve your goals. Randal being a kleptomaniac will often have to steal items however usually someone is around watching you so you'll have to devise creative ways to distract them. This usually involves using other items you've 'acquired' sometimes you'll even need to combine items in your inventory to form new items which are often wacky and fun like the extendable duck hanger. One of my biggest dislikes of the game is the inventory. The inventory is done like a comic book which while it is aesthetically pleasing, in terms of functionality its a pain. To combine items you have to click on item on the inventory and then click the one you want to try and combine it with. However if it doesn't work both are then deselected, this means that say the item you want to experiment with is on the second page of the inventory and all your other items are on the first pages, you have to keep moving back and forth between sections to try and combine items. It makes the whole notion of trying ideas out laborious and its seriously not only a time drain but a drain on patience too.\n\nThe puzzles tended to annoy me as well. Now I understand I'm not great at point and clicks but I'm a pretty logical person. Yet there were a number of occasions where I literally had no idea what to do. The game doesn't really do a good job of giving you an idea about how to get things done which is fine most of the time but occasionally you have to do something where I thought I would never have guessed to do that with that item. Luckily there is a walk-through hint system in the game you can access which will tell you what to do step by step however it will not only make the game way too easy, it'll show up on your steam achievements that you used the help guide. In my opinion they should have had a decent hint system in the game but not the almost cheat sheet that they went for. After all it's good the game forces you to actually use your brain to think how to solve things but one thing I learned is that I myself have no ingenuity what so ever.\n\nWhere Randal's Monday shines is in it's character, humor and frequent references to video games, sci fi and general geek culture. There isn't one location or conversation in the game that isn't flooded with funny quotes and nods. The whole main story itself is a nod to several cult sci fi and fantasy films. While the game never made me laugh out loud, you cannot help but smile at the various references throughout and the characters in the game do give you cause to have a good chuckle to yourself. In conversations you have choices available to you and each often contains some funny joke that references some film or video game.\n\nSpeaking of the characters they are all pretty well thought out. Randal is a very dis-likable character however it's his very nature that requires him to be the protagonist of the game. It's because Randal is a sociopath and a kleptomaniac that its acceptable to steal the things you need and screw over people who get in your way. Narratively it not only would it not make sense for a decent guy to be doing these things but anyone with actually sanity would probably not be able to handle the events that take place. While the whole game is tongue in cheek in its humor and characters, it does have some important messages throughout.\n\nThe game looks great, its cartoon grimy appearance works really well and everything looks well drawn. Sound wise it also hits top marks, not only for the sound effects but the voice acting is surprisingly good throughout. Yes it's a little cheesy sometimes but that's usually because its supposed to be and I have to say that the writing of the game is very well done. Often Randal will break the forth wall in a funny way with one occasion telling the player that its their fault his life is getting worse and he often remarks at the player when your trying to do something that's not going to work by saying 'if you think that'll work you need to stop playing and take a rest'.\n\nThe characters, story, culture references and breaking of the fourth wall all make for a very enjoyable experience. Randal's Monday is certainly an enjoyable point and click adventure and its well written dialogue and nods to video games and movies alike make the play through well worth it. If you enjoy point and clicks or games that are packed with humor and fun then I certainly would recommend picking up Randal's Monday. It has a few frustrating problems but nothing that detracts from enjoying the experience overall\n","November 12, 2014","true","9.0"," 100 of 171 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","100","171","0","3"

The style of the drawings is identical to the style of Edna and Harvey so naturally I thought that this was a game developed by Daedalic.\n\nLaunching the game the first time I was surprised that it didn't pop up the standard Visionnaire tool that every other Daedalic adventure game had. Actually the engine used in Randal's Monday is somewhat better performance wise than the Visionnaire engine. So I thought Daedalic had finally developed a new engine, no big deal.\n\nHowever, slowly a suspicion started creeping up that Randal's Monday might have been made by some B team. The dialogue is uncharacteristically long and frankly quite boring. The inventory system is hell due to the fact that you can only use an item once before having to select it again. And the biggest telltale sign of all: the puzzle design and sequencing was seriously lacking.\n\nLet's talk about how the inventory system works for a bit. You have a standard inventory icon in the lower left side of the screen that opens up into a comic book. In this comic book you can fit around 20 objects per page and oh boy are you going to carry more than 20 pieces of stuff constantly. To combine things from different pages in your inventory you first have to select thing 1, flip the page, and select thing 2. Simple enough, right? Now try doing it 20 times. I swear it took more than an hour of my life of just doing this to complete the game. I would understand if this system was developed to discourage rubbing things against eachother mindlessly, but many of the game's puzzles are based around combining random objects.\n\nThen there are the puzzles. Half of the time the objective is quite clear and you know what you generally need to do to proceed. However, the thing you need to do is derailed by massive and logic free detours so that most of the time you're really not sure what you are doing. I found myself asking myself "Why am I doing this?" on numerous occasions. And there's weren't just picking up small objects either. The reason for entire hour long puzzles is sometimes revealed only at the end when you receive something useful without previously knowing of its existence.\n\nThen there's the story. Not worth it. Trust me.\n\nI really do feel bad about criticizing this game so heavily and I hope Nexus Game Studios goes on to develop more adventure games. There's some serious talent there if they get a decent writer and work out some of the problems Randal's Monday had.\n\n-Scoot","June 24, 2015","false","20.0"," 39 of 62 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","39","62","0","0"

I blindly bought this game based solely on the teaser trailer I saw here on Steam. The humor/art style/voice acting hooked me, but I also knew what to expect from a point and click game. If you are someone who is moderately into point and click games and is on the fence, I'd say it's an enjoyable if not overstretched experience and worth the playthrough.\n\nHowever, if you are someone who has never played a point and click game before or haven't in a long time, I'd have a really hard time suggesting the game to you. I don't feel this game services in any capacity as a gate way into the genre. To start things off, I understand the genre is pretty niche and all, there is no reason for the total exclusion of some sort of tutorial to the game. (I assume they figured with a built in walk through system, it was redundant but I dont think that is any excuse if it is the case.) Especially in a game so rooted in archaic game mechanics, such as the heavy inventory management and the illogical in name of humor item combinations.\n\nThe game is very committed to old school mechanics, like multiple over item combinations, items having more than one use, items having to be inspected once already in your inventory to activate them or find new items. There is alot of backtracking, and certain interactions that don't become available until you've gone through the correct dialogue trees. On the topic of dialogue, the game is incredibly dialogue heavy. You can go down wrong dialogue paths and have to basically restart conversations to get to what you need.\n\nI may be sounding negative here, but this isn't my intent. I am just trying to help people understand what they are getting with the game. Alot of people enjoy being challenged and thrown somewhat illogical routes toward solving puzzles but I understand that same thing can turn alot of people off.\n\nAs to the actual game though, game play mechanics aside. The voice acting and graphic styling is top notch especailly considering there is still a moderate amount of the genre still in pixel art (which I'm not saying is bad, just some people will automatically write a game off because of it) with no to mediocre voice work. I found myself actually laughing out loud at certain points in the game, but I felt it did start to over do it a bit after a while with all the pop culture references. I'd liken the pandering to somewhere around the level of the "The Big Bang Theory" , (which coincidently is even referenced) think it kind of falls into the realm of you enjoy it or hate it. The way the game progressed and how what you did every day affected how it played out the next day was really interesting as well.\n\nI would say the game started to drag on a bit towards the second half of the game, where I found myself using the walk throughs more and more just to get through the game, when I usually try my best to not to "cheat" my way through most point and click  games and thier puzzles. I think the game was just a little too long for its own good, being so dialogue heavy and pop culture reference populated, the actual plot of the game just started to drift off and fizzle out in the sea of everything that was being thrown at you.\n\nAll and all though, it was an enjoyable game and I beat it in a only a couple of sittings despite its length, so regardless of its downfalls it was still an overall fun experience and one I'd suggest, but only if you know what you are getting into.","November 15, 2014","true","19.8"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","24","35","0","0"

A point and click adventure through the melancholy and futility of existence right?\nNot so my friend, this game is a comedy!\n\nHappy Mondays\n\nIf you’re familiar with Lucas Arts adventure games of old, Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle etc. then you’ll know what to expect with regards to game play.\nYou’ll point and click your way around Randals world, combining increasingly bizarre objects at random in a desperate attempt to try and find a solution to which ever obstacle is blocking your progress in the story.\n\nMonday Madness\n\nPoint and click adventure games live and die on the quality of two things, the writing and the puzzles. The quality of the writing to be found here is a little uneven. There are lines that will genuinely make you chuckle, but not every “funny” hits home.\nI guess it’s down to personal taste.\n\nThe puzzles themselves range from the logical (Convince a down trodden sales man to make a call as a distraction) to the insane! (Attract a rat, kill it and marinate its corpse in water then use the stench to obtain some soap!)\n\nFear not though, there is a comprehensive hints system built into the game to help you navigate your way through the craziness.\n\nStory of the Day\n\nThe story itself is an interesting (and mostly funny) tale, revolving around a cursed ring, an alcoholic friends suicide, his girlfriends’ reaction and a pawnshop (amongst other places).\nEvents that you set in motion during the day will impact events when you relive that day again.\n\nSo even though you’re experiencing the same day, over and over, each iteration of it plays out differently depending on your previous actions.\n\nA good example of this is when you alter the date of an event on a poster to todays date, After you sleep and wake on that same Monday morning, that event will now be taking place.\nThis is so well implemented in the story telling that you really don’t notice the bizarreness of it all whilst playing.\n\nI should probably also mention the quality of the voice acting, which is very good throughout and complements the fittingly cartoony graphics perfectly.\n\nMondays Culture\n\nIf you like your pop culture references, then you’ll find plenty to love in Randals Monday.\nI’m not going to spoil them for you here; the fun is spotting them in the game and patting yourself on the back for your cultural cleverness.\nI will say that I particularly enjoyed the prison elements of the game, where the story pays homage to one of my favourite films of all time <cough>  <Shawshank Redemption>  <cough>\n\nSo we’ve got a contemporary, comedy, vaguely supernatural, sci-fi, parody tale here so, whatever your genre of choice, you should find something to enjoy in Randals Monday, but it’s not all genre busting, cultural reverence, There is a down side.\n\nRandals Monotony\n\nThe main character, Randall, is just so damn unlikable.\nI imagine he was intended to be a comedic anti-hero, someone who we wouldn’t mind bad things happening to but who also has elements of roughish warmth that help endear him to the player and make him relatable.\nUnfortunately, this doesn’t work for me; he just comes across as a selfish and conceited jerk.\n\nRandals Monday\n\nIf you like point and click adventure games, dark comedy and more pop culture references than should be humanly possible to squash into a game, then you’re going to enjoy Randals Monday.\n\nIt does tell an intriguing and entertaining tale which even Randal himself can’t spoil.\n\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )","February 20, 2015","true","17.0"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","18","25","7","0"

(Especially because Randal is one of the protagonists of Clerks.)\n- Fanboys\n\nThis is a very fun game, but they seem to make it sound easier than it is.

At first glance this would be fine, altough you find yourself in the situation to have to combine unorthodox items quite a lot. It would have been nice to hear multiple lines depending on what you try to combine.\n\nThe voice acting was of my liking, the protagonist sounded bored when he should and showed excited emotions if appropriate.\n\nI think the pack in a ton of references in a game thing is fine, altough it looses its novelty bonus quite fast.\n\nFurthermore i did not like the backtracking. E.g. Having to try to open a door, fail at it, gain nothing of value,\njust to be able to progress in a location completely unrelated to the doorsituation. This felt frustrating and slightly infuriating. I even experienced mild enragement after that happened.

But once you delve into the game further, you get afronted with the inherent flaws of the game that turns what should be a good decent game into a illogical mess.\n\nThe game suffers from possibly the worse placement of puzzle items I've seen in an adventure game for a long time and a whole bag of illogical nonsense that doesn't make any sense, and it be a wonder if theres anyone out there who didn't use the hint system on day 2. Sure, on day 1, it went along fine. The puzzles, while lacking, made sense for the most part and I didn't find myself needing to go into the games hint system.\n\nOn day 2, that changed drastically. This is one of those games where you'll end up picking up piles of stuff in your inventory, not having a clue what they are, and having to work out the obscure methods in achieving a certain goal with said items. There is no thought process with the games puzzles, there is no clever subtle way to guide the player along, instead you have to work out the rather mundane methods just so you can progress with the story.\n\nGemini Ru, Broken Sword, Memoria, Unwritten Tales, to name just a few, have logical well placed puzzles that don't coddle the player, but are done in such a clever way that allows the player to progress along a logical thought process to work out for themselves what they need. This game has, sadly, none of it, and its really off putting because if I find myself forced to use the hint system, then unfortuntely, the story, the narative of the game, which by the way I do enjoy, gets bogged down and it doesn't become an enjoyable experience.\n\nNow before I get the most common fanboy defense remarks such as , "O well, your too dumb to figure it out! It's not the games fault that you've got a low IQ!" I've been playing adventure games since ... since time began itself! I'm a veteran of adventure games, I love indie adventure games like these, and it is a damn shame that I have to write a negative review about an indie game like Randal's Monday because it could potentially be a great game, but it just gets clogged up in a mess that slows everything down.\n\nThe puzzles however are not the only thing that I regard as a flaw in this game. There are some dialogue in this game that I find are horrendously stretched out to the point that I'm just bored listening to something that is trying to be funny when it isn't. The writing isn't the best in Randal's Monday, but it certainly isn't the worse, and I've seen games with far worse scripts. But there are times that it drags on.\n\nThe voice acting however I have nothing but high praise for. Voice acting can make or break a game, (Hector is one example of bad voice acting) here it does a great job at portraying the characters. The art style is also pleasing on the eye and is very well done, it suits the game perfectly.\n\nBut sadly with horrendous puzzle setups and pixel hunting in some cases, although not as much as other games, I can't recommend this game.","November 25, 2014","false","3.3"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","0"

I feel abit of a love-hate kind of relationship towards this game.\nWhile I loved finding all the various game, movie and comics references throughout the game, aswell as a game focusing around the idea of a time-loop it doesn't quite work out.. playing the same monday over and over again gets abit repetitive and I guess I can perfectly relate how the main character of this game must feel. The first monday was fun, second still fairly okay and by the 3rd one I felt bored with hearing the same thing's over again, ie "blah blah blah YOU'RE FIRED!" or "Where's my rent money?" I felt that other than chapter 6 and 7 they were all far too similar to one another and running between the same places. Yes, I know it's a time loop but is it too much to ask to have abit more variety of places to be and things to do? Other than the final two chapters I felt that only the sci-fi con was a breath of fresh air.\nMy second problem with this game was the puzzles that made zero sense 90% of the time. Take burning a hole through the van door with a laser for example, instead of.. oh gee I don't know, use the magnet with Bob's pockets to pull the keys out? Most of the time I was forced to use a guide on what to do and when I saw the solution it was kind of "wtf where's the logic in doing that?" Im looking at you "exchange a piece of gum for a measuring tape..."\nOverall it's an okay game, only very repetitive and dumb puzzle solutions. It has far more negative aspects than positive ones which is why I can't recommend this for anyone.","April 23","false","23.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

You will be challenged to find a way to break out of a strange cycle you find yourself in after snatching something off your friend. Little do you know, the ramification of that action, and what turns out to be a Groundhog Day effect, as you will be forced to live the same Monday over and over and over again, but there is something odd that seems to be going on, the day is the same but things seem to be changing from Monday to Monday. Will you be able to make everything right, or will everything fall into chaos?\n\nGraphically this game reminds me of the Deponia series. It has the same depth of field as well as the cartoony look to the characters. Speaking of characters, you are going to meet all minds of characters, and just like everything else in the game, each time you see them, well each Monday, that is, there might be slight changes to them. You will get to explore a comic book store, a bar, a nerd convention, a therapist's office, your apartment, your friend's apartment, a pawn shop, and more. Each area has some very unique individuals that you will get to deal with, and of course they all look like they feel out of a nerd convention. Oh and did I mention the posters, and items that have been placed throughout the game that scream nerd-cred. I'm talking lightsabers, Watchmen posters, energy blades, Hal 2000, and of course soooo much more.\n\nThe sounds of the game basically continue with the nerdy theme. The voice acting is also something that really makes this game. It doesn't hurt to have the voice behind Randal in the movie Clerks, voicing the main character by the same name, but the dialogue and the rest of the choices for voices definitely make this game highly enjoyable.\n\nThe controls for this game are pretty straight forward. We are talking about a point click adventure game where the majority of the game will be spent pointing the mouse and clicking. Now of course you will have to be on the lookout for opportunities to combine items from your inventory together, or with objects in the world.\n\nSo I think I personally built this game up a little too much in my head. I knew it was going to be oozing nerdy, and it did just that, but there is something about this game that started to grate on my nerves, and that was the constant need to go back and forth for little items. Of course these items would then be used to advance the game, but there were plenty of times where only a person who constantly did patrols of each location opened with the current iteration of the game, and trying all items on everything would be able to not miss a thing. Saving grace of this game is the hint section. Now of course, apparently, uncovering a hint kills a kitten, but sometimes it just has to happen, otherwise you will get so lost that the frustration will be too much to take.\n\nI just feel like this game just misses the mark, not by much, but enough that this might not be the game that everyone expected. That being said it is a fun game, with lots of humor in it, and definitely deserves a look. This is a point and click adventure game, and yes I know that back in the day this  you never know what items you might need was just the norm, but I guess with the evolution of gaming, and the genre in general it just feels off. Now of course I'm not expecting everything to be handed to me, but some of the stuff is still a far stretch to connect the dots. So for this I've got to give the game an 7.8 out of 10.","December 22, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Randal's monday is an oldschool style point&click comedy adventure. It has a very large amount of voice acting. It is a long game by adventure standards. Its a fun and epic story filled with countless geek references, and the story also stands on its own. It also has a great soundtrack, and the extras include a beautiful calendar pdf.\nThe problem with this game is one area: the puzzles. The puzzles just arent reasonable most of the time and have so-so logic. It makes it very frustrating when frequently its not clear what exactly your current objective is. And you could waste many hours trying to get on the right track to eventually discover the puzzle solution really doesnt make much sense. The game includes a hint system... but it really just tells you the answer.. its more of an in-game walkthrough.. which you will almost definitely need with this game unless you've got tons of hours to kill.\nStill, despite that flaw, if you stick with this game you are rewarded with a large entertaining experience with plenty of twists and turns and laughs. The production values are high, the voice talent is good, the content is meaty, the game doesnt hold your hand.

This should be my favorite adventure game ever. It has tons of pop culture references and the hopeless drunks who make up the main characters remind me of myself and my friends at various points in my life. The jokes do try a bit too hard, but they're good for a casual smile. Unfortunately, the puzzles are completely opaque and pretty much impossible to figure out without a walkthrough. Sadly the only site with a text walkthrough is so full of popups and bugs that it doesn't even open on my phone so i can look it up while i am playing, and hell if i'm going to waste my time watching a YouTube walkthrough (what's the point of playing the game then?) So, screw it. I've been playing adventure games since they didn't have any graphics at all, and although the puzzles in those text adventures were pretty woeful, back then they were the only option you had. Nowadays spending hours randomly combining everything with everything is just poor design. Daedelic have done much better.\n\nWhere's my German review for this one?

Attempting to capitalize on nerd culture by overloading the game with every possible pop culture geek reference isn't enough to make up for poor game design, bad acting and terrible sound quality.\n.\nThe basic plot is interesting enough: jerkwad main character (named after the two main characters in Clerks, and voiced by one of the actors of those characters) steals his best friend's engagement ring during a night of drunken debauchery, then pawns it the next day to pay his rent.  That's when things take a turn for the terrible - he loses his job, his best friend commits suicide, and the prophetic bum in the alley keeps telling him how cursed he is.  Well, with a name like Randal Hicks, what'd you expect?\nLike any other point and click, most of this game is just a matter of matching the right inventory object to the scenario.  Unfortunately, some of these connections are tenuous at best, and more often completely inconceivable.  Relying on the hint system becomes practically a necessity to avoid insanity - and even THEN, the hint system misses some important steps, leading to frustration over missing one tiny item in a place you were sure you'd searched thoroughly before.\nFrom the very beginning of the game, it's obvious that the actors weren't even in the same room when recording the script:  dialogue sounds stilted and volume and tone is often mismatched.  Frequently, the responses don't even seem to follow what the original character was even saying, leading to a lot of confusion while trying to follow the story.  While it makes sense for the characters to talk and act incoherently in the first scene (the "let's get drunk at the bar" wedding shower), there's no real excuse for it after that.  Sadly, their acting never lives up to the potential of the game, and certainly doesn't match up to the semi-star-caliber cast (Jeff Anderson ("Randal Hicks" who played Randal Graves in Clerks), Jason Mewes (Jay in both this game and Clerks), two voice actors from Thomas the Tank Engine, etc,)\nSound quality also suffered - often changing volume in mid scene, making it hard to hear the characters, or making it suddenly loud.  Unacceptable in a game of this simplistic a design.  Fire that sound guy immediately!\nThe soundtrack is actually really good, and if you're just in it for the geek references, well, this is so full as to render the rest of the game irrelevant.\nI'm normally a lot more forgiving about video games, but when there's this much wrong with it, it becomes a complete disappointment.  I got it on sale for $5, but still wish I had waited.

I decided to no longer waste my time.\n\nTo make matters worse, this game reeks of this "wannabe" feel that I can't decide was intended to come off as homages to older point and click adventures or pretentious references.  Regardless of intent, the references to Monkey Island and other games are shoehorned in and incredibly unimportant and cheesy.\n\nThe funniest part is how much this game markets its main character, Randall.

Many puzzles are completely random und demand lots of try-and-error, and the clumsy interface makes this quite a pain. The developers tried to overcome this problem by offering a walkthrough option for all the people out there without internet, but well ... Putting that effort in better puzzles and a proper interface would have helped a lot.\nOr just some better ingame hints: Why in hell do you just get the generic "That does not work here"-feedback when you use a key with the chest instead with it's lock? Why do you get a "No. That's Matt's."-message if you want give Matt his very own mug back? You'll almost never get any hint if you're close to solve a puzzle, not to speak about hints about what you are supposed to do at all. I wished there were less items, but more dedicaded ingame information showing the right direction instead.\n\nSo: It's an entertaining and somewhat funny game with broken puzzle mechanics.

No absurd idea goes unrewarded with at least a good joke.\n\nRandal just slightly less despicable then Rufus, whom I miss very much, but a pretty fun character on his own.\nThe rest of the cast is not always as brilliant, but there are some very good laughs to be had.\n\nStory wise I won't spoil anything.

And to do that, you have to steal a pool cue ball. And to do that, you have to put a rotten lemon, and a battery in a priest's drink. But to do that, you have to obsessively check every single drain pipe in the city to find out which one has the rotten lemon. And the game never provides hints that you should do any of this - all you know is that you have to distract a shop clerk.\n\nEarlier in the game, you have to break a globe. To do that, you have to use the right object on the right precise spot on the globe. But that's not quite enough, as doing that perfectly will still result in the game indicating you've done the wrong thing. Before it will work - before you get even a hint that you've done the right thing, figured the puzzle out - you have to successfully find the one "Figure" in a huge mass of "Figures." The "Figure" looks no different than the "Figures" and you have no way of knowing that you have to find the "Figure," but you will not be allowed to proceed in the game, even to do the exact thing you should be doing, until you happen to accidentally run your mouse over that one "Figure" amidst the larger zone of "Figures".\n\nThat's how the game works - although all adventure games should include some fun trial and error potential, this game takes it to ludicrous levels. Randal's Monday is everything that's ever been wrong with puzzles in adventure games.\n\nGranted, the plot gets interesting as you get further into it, and the Clerks connection is very cool, but the adventure gameplay is terrible, the jokes fall flat, and the main character is too much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to possibly sympathize with. All of the geek-culture references the advertising highlights are certainly present - not particularly funny nor worked into the plot at all - they're just kind of there, like a random picture of Donkey Kong on a calendar.

Before it will work - before you get even a hint that you've done the right thing, figured the puzzle out - you have to successfully find the one "Figure" in a huge mass of "Figures." The "Figure" looks no different than the "Figures" and you have no way of knowing that you have to find the "Figure," but you will not be allowed to proceed in the game, even to do the exact thing you should be doing, until you happen to accidentally run your mouse over that one "Figure" amidst the larger zone of "Figures".\n\nThat's how the game works - although all adventure games should include some fun trial and error potential, this game takes it to ludicrous levels. Randal's Monday is everything that's ever been wrong with puzzles in adventure games.\n\nGranted, the plot gets interesting as you get further into it, and the Clerks connection is very cool, but the adventure gameplay is terrible, the jokes fall flat, and the main character is too much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to possibly sympathize with. All of the geek-culture references the advertising highlights are certainly present - not particularly funny nor worked into the plot at all - they're just kind of there, like a random picture of Donkey Kong on a calendar. Oh, look, it's Donkey Kong. Do you care? No, because you haven't yet figured out that you have to use the glue on the phone after you use the razor on the glue.\n\nLots of potential, but it's just not very fun to play.","November 3, 2015","false","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a good game with funny and  hilarious dialogue, it made me laugh so much from playing this, althrough its a bit too difficult with the puzzle from time to time. Its a great story from start to end and I would recommend this game :)","February 11","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first chapter was slow, and it took me months to come back to the game after getting bored during the start.  After the first one ends is where the game really takes off, and I wish the first day was a little more direct so the real story could start sooner.\n\nDespite how much I enjoyed the game, and the respectable play time (for a point-and-click) I still don't think it's worth $20.  Definitely get it on sale if you're a fan of the genre, won't get annoyed at an entire game made of culture references, and like a funny, sarcastic storyline.","April 26","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
