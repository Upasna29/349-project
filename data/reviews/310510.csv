The visuals look a bit clunky and indeed they are. But if you overlook the graphics and just dig a little bit deeper, you will find that there's an extremely good and especially original gameplay beneath the surface.\n\nDeathtrap basically takes the tower defense mini game from Neocore's The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing and creates a whole new game around it. And holy ****, it is so freaking good. You've got a mix of Tower defense (obviously), RPG elements like looting, leveling and skill trees and also a good amount of Hack'n'Slash. It works just so well: You use essence to build traps, which should kill the monsters that attack in waves. For every monster kill and every wave you gain more essence to build more traps. For completing levels, you gain experience, level  up and distribute skill points into a HUGE skill tree. 'cause not only you can choose from different classes, every one of those got alot of different spells which you can skill in the order YOU think is best. So good.\n\nSo you basically got Tower Defense, but with a champion equipped with a weapon and up to four spells - genious. The gameplay is near flawless, and I know that I sound like I'm exaggerating. Don't care, it's great.\n\nThere are a few flaws, though: The traps you can build differ from level to level, but the game determines which kind of trap you can put at already defined places. Yet you can vary between different skills, because the monsters have weaknesses and strengths. Deathtrap has alot more of that deep strategic stuff, and I can't enumerate all of those things. Just find out yourself, this game is a must-have for every RPG fan and I wonder why it's got so little attention until now.\n\nOh, did I mention the perfect map editor with workshop support?","February 4, 2015","true","45.0"," 163 of 181 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","163","181","9","15"

They're Grrr-reat\n\nStill here? then I'll assume that you agree with me....\n\nThey're fun and easy to drop in and out of when time permits, great for a quick level or two at the end of a busy day.\nYou fire them up, trace the path the enemy will take, find  the  choke points, plan and place your towers, hit the start button and watch wave after wave of "bad guys" get chewed up (hopefully) by your  turrets, fireballs, lighting towers etc.\nUpgrade a tower here and there, increasing its range or power, maybe place a few new turrets and then take on the next level.\nRinse and repeat until you win, or if you're skill level matches my own, until you lose and try again!\n\n\nTower Defence games are like Deathtrap\n\nAt its core, that's what you'll find with Deathtrap, a competent, polished and very enjoyable tower defence game, filled with all the varying enemy, tower and trap types you could want to keep you entertain throughout it's increasingly difficult levels.\n\n\nArchipelago of Doom\n\nThe levels in Deathtrap are divided up into islands, each island will have several waves of bad guys for you to destroy.\nShould you manage to defeat the initial wave of cannon fodder  you will then get chance to spend any points you've earned by placing new towers and traps in preparation for the inevitably tougher next wave.\nStand your ground against each wave and you'll have  to face off against an end of level boss, which will likely be one tough demonic cookie to kill.\nDefeat the big bad boss and it's level complete,  the next island will be open for you, but before you take on the next challenge you might want to go shopping first... (more on that later)\n\n\nYou know what other genre is like Frosted Flakes...\n\nRPG's!\nChoose your character, collect loot, equip yourself with the best armour and weapons, visit the obligatory adventurers store to sell your junk and buy new stuff, level up your abilities and maybe do a little crafting before heading into battle\nThat's right, they're great too!\n\n\nA Little RPG on your Frosties?\n\nSo we've got too great and very distinct genres and as I stated earlier, at its core, Deathtrap is a tower defence game, but it's also more than that...\nIt's a tower defence game with a generous sprinkling of sweet RPG goodness.\nEverything I mentioned above regarding the Tower defence and  RPG genres are available  to you in Deathtrap.\n\n\nWave to your Avatar\n\nTo be an RPG game, you need an avatar, an in game presence beyond your mouse pointer placing towers and traps and that is exactly what you'll find here.\nAt the start of the game you'll be given a choice of 3 character types, The Sorceress, The Mercenary and the Marksman, each with their own specialities and styles of play.\nWhichever character you choose, they're yours to control in the game world as you see fit.\nWander around exploring, go on the offensive and single-handedly  blast wave after wave as they emerge or you might want to hang back and help defend your towers from the onslaught.\n\n\nWave to your Friends\n\nDid I say single-handedly blast the bad guys, that's not necessarily true.\nYou can also play Deathtrap online in a co-op mode or versus modes both of which are huge amounts of fun.\n\n\nA View To A Kill\n\nDeathtrap has solid visuals, you can zoom in pretty close to the action and it still looks crisp and moody, although you'll find yourself playing through the majority of the game zoomed out as far as possible to get a bead on the bad guys as they march relentlessly onwards.\n\n\nA Matter of Prospective\n\nIf you've ever played the "Orcs Must Die" titles, you'll recall that they are tower defence games with an in game avatar too.\nHowever, "Orcs Must Die" let you experience the world from a first person perspective.\n\nWhilst Deathtrap also places you in direct control of your character, instead of taking the FPS approach, you'll find yourself viewing the action from a top down, isometric view.\n\nThis is a little less immediate than the first person view but this decision does make the direct intervention mechanic feel much more tactical.\nWhat you lose in immersion by not having a first person perspective is more than made up for by a clear isometric view of the approaching bad guys which certainly makes it easier to plan your positioning strategically and get in a few long range shots.\n\n\nIt Only Makes Me Stronger\n\nAs well as the traditional tower  defence  elements you also be taking down specific enemies located on the map (and hoping your towers can take care of the waves of monsters whilst you're wandering off the path to get to them).\nThese special enemies will drop keys which will open chests full of lovely loot.\n\nYou can find all the armour types you would expect in any RPG, including rings, hats, belts etc. each of which will improve your statistics and help you hang in a fight longer.\nThere is skill system in the game so you can not only upgrade your trap building abilities, you can also upgrade your own prowess with your weapon of choice.\n\nThere's a shop where you can buy and sell items, there are health potions, there's even a crafting system!\n\n\nWave Goodbye\n\nThe  genre mash-up works surprisingly well, there's enough RPG elements to make the game feel refreshingly different without straying too far from its tower defence heart.\n\nDeathtrap is a great game, quick to pick up and  hard to put down,  It's so addictive that I've genuinely found it difficult to stop playing long enough to write this review, and on that note, If I stop writing now I should have time for just one more wave...\n\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )","March 7, 2015","true","6.4"," 144 of 172 people (84%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","84","144","172","29","2"

After two exceptional games in the The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing I and II, I was expecting more of that to come over into this game.  The story, the characters, the world are all too shallow compared to their earlier works.  I beat this game in a day's time which is almost impossible for my schedule, and I got a great game, but I was expecting more.\n\nStill, this is one of the best tower defense games around complimented by incredibly engaging RPG elements for the both the player character and the tower defense aspects at a bargain price.

Tower defense? With RPG-elements? Sounds familiar?\nIf you remember the cute tower defense-interludium of "The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing" Part 1 and 2, and did not hate it, you'll feel right at home here.\n\nThe progress they've made since initial release are nice. Lots of added levels, lots of traps and the second of three classes.\nAlready enough content to keep you busy for a bunch of hours.\n\nBut...early access?\nThere's nearly no doubt they will deliver a fully working and polished product. And I'm a very mistrusting dude :-)\n\nThe good:\nSolid performance, many options to tweak it, and non-exclusive full-screen already added. Yay!\nNice soundtrack (so far)\nMany more or less different enemies, each with its own strength and weakness\nMore than enough traps, some to unlock, and each upgradeable in 3 different ways\nSkill-System close to that of the Van Helsings, of course a lot less skills\n"Campaign"-Mode, Endless-mode, Different tiers, "Scenarios" (campaign with different options to make it harder), so enough re-playability for a TD-game\nMost maps have some side-objectives with bonus-loot, or some special traps only valid there\nRPG Elements! You can equip your character with stuff which drops from killed creatures. Or you could buy and sell them in between maps. Love it :)\nIt even has crafting. Very basic but totally adequate. 4 resources which you either get as drops or by salvaging other drops. You can find/buy better recipes for better stuff. Yay!\nMost maps have bonus objectives to keep you busy or challenged. Like "kill these neutral", "play without dealing damage yourself", "don't upgrade any trap", "don't use this type of trap" etc.\nEven the second or third "Tier" (replaying the same maps on higher difficulty) isn't boring, each map is changed slightly and the waves/paths/monsters are different\nEven after level 30 you're still on your way of unlocking traps, always keeps you motivated!\nWorkshop! Many maps to play and whatever may come too...\nSuper easy editor! Create your own maps in minutes!\nThe bad:\nThe main-fighting music, which plays on every map continuously (yet, may change i hope) becomes annoying really fast :)\nPlacement of traps is pre-defined for each map, as is the type of that trap on the allowed spots. Kills a lot of the freedom to improve/modify a strategy. Some may like this approach, i hate it.\nIt's annoying you can't see what enemies will come in the next map (so re-skill your traps accordingly) before you're IN that map. And at that point you then don't see which traps are skilled (so you can upgrade them).\nRecommended?\nYES! Except you hated the whole concept of the TD-interludiums in the Van-Helsing-titles or you hate RPG-aspects in a TD. Else there's no reason you won't like this one if you like TD.\n\nIt's not perfect (but which TD is?), but it got charm, a unique setting and enough re-playability-value for manymanymany hours to play. And it even keeps you motivated beyond level 30 or Tier2 due to unlocking the last traps or getting new items to steadily become better.\nThis is really a great blend of action-RPG and TD. Well actually it's the only game of this kind :-)","January 25, 2015","true","37.6"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","30","36","0","1"

An insane amount of character and trap customization. Char customization comes from exp levels and loot whereas trap customization comes from gaining trap points from completing new stages, completing quests, passives from character skill points, and char gear.  There could be more than I know about because I am only lv 16/100 on Marksman. Multiple Marksman can be spec'd completely differently so it adds a lot to co-op even if players are the same class.  There is also trap synergizing going on. Lots of it! I will write a more detailed review once i have experienced more of the game.\n\nBottomline.....if you like Tower Defence games then there is a lot to love here.

Best money every spent. If you are a fan of tower defense and MMO's, you will definitely want to get behind this game as it develops. The combination of towers, traps, monsters, and your own hero make for endless ways to play. This is by far my number one TD game, and trust me, I've played them all. I am only taking a break from the game to review the game!\n\nThe graphics are great, the sounds/music are great, the UI is great, and most importantly, the gameplay is GREAT!\n\nIf you did not already know, this game offers a simplistic tower defense. By simplistic, I am only referring to towers and tower placement. Enemies come from many different entrances, and it's up to you, along with the aid of your towers and traps, to stop them before they reach the gate(s). The game heats up once you have hordes of monsters entering from five different locations! The game has persistent hero level/upgrades, meaning once you level up, you keep that level forever. You can upgrade not only your hero, but every tower, trap, and monster. You can also loot items on the battlefield to enhance your hero! So many possibilities! Honestly, they are endless.\n\nCurrently there are two class and quite a few campaign maps. That being said, it is in beta, and that is to be expected. Even so, with the map builder you are able to create custom maps and publish them to steam workshop. You can subscribe to any of these custom maps you like and play them in game. It also seems that you do get loot and experience from these custom maps.\n\nThere will also be much more included in the future, including co-op/vs. modes. This is definitely a game you will want to get behind! Help the devs. to create what I already know, will be an EPIC game!\n\nEasily a 10/10\n\nP.S. this is the first 10/10 I've ever given!\n\nGo buy it now!","October 23, 2014","true","58.0"," 42 of 59 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","42","59","4","0"

There's places where the game just ... ends. Places where it's clearly unfinished (have a look at the tooltips for the rings for a clear and damning example), and places where it feels like the game was just not quite what it could, and should have been. But before all that, what is Deathtrap?\n\nIt's a tower defence game spun off from the very successful Van Helsing series, the series so successful that they've just welded the three parts of the game, frankenstein like into one mammoth lord of the rings style ARPG that will no doubt suck you in and never let you back out again. It's the Path of Exile of offline ARPG's, huge, sprawly, and quite capable of eating thousands of hours of your life.\n\nI do recommend you check out Van Helsing (The ARPG) by the way, it's quite a creation of love by Neocore.\n\nThe somewhat smaller stepchild who gets the hand-me-downs at the developer party.\nDeathtrap was the spin off of the tower defence, an answer to a bunch of fans who wanted the tower defence part to be it's own game. Thus it went through the trevails of Early Access, got iterated on, and then got released to the public, however, the release copy was... shaky. Let's be kind and call it shaky. Post release support tidied it up some but the overall feeling was that the developers real aim was to work on the Van Helsing series (which was where the real money was), Deathtrap was in the end a side project that whilst nice to have an iron in the fire on, was never going to be the big boy of the family that was being developed. It was the little kid. It was going to get the little toys.\n\nThe game plays a lot like the Tower Defence segments in the Van Helsing game, except now you've a set of levels you work through, you've a shop for gearing your choice of class up between levels, and you've a relatively well fleshed out trap selection and talent tree to work with. The good news is that the core game loop plays decently, if a little mechanically, you set down traps, stuff explodes or gets chopped up, and you do your bit, scuttling between the traps and buffing them, and taking an active hand, casting spells or shooting the mobs as you go.\n\nThe accountants tower defence\nThat said, it genuinely feels more like a numbers game than most TD's, in say - Evil Defenders, there was a real sense of tactical placement and getting the balance of turrets right. In Deathtrap, it's purely about numeric DPS. Do you have the right mix of things that do the right DPS to these mobs? If yes, you win, if no, you lose. There's very little in the way of turrets that really change things up in that sense, they're all variations on the "Enemies die horribly" theme.\n\nThe "kink" that Van Helsing has is that the levels as they rise up in difficulty offer unique traps that you can activate and they all have their own thing, the irony is these unique traps -are- the ones that change things up and make things interesting, except you have no real way of influencing them aside from turning them on or off. That's annoying. Again, in other Tower Defence games, such as Sanctuary and Evil Defenders and so on, you had ways of actively tilting the field to your advantage, here, you genuinely are restricted in those tools.\n\nThe news however improves when you add friends.\nDeathtrap does add one -big- benefit, co-op and versus. Versus is more or less dead. My gaming buddy who I tested this with found that the community for Deathtrap has long since withered away on the vine, we were the only people in the queue, but it did allow us to test the versus mode, and for what it's worth, it's actually really fun, and a criminally underlooked concept. Versus mode Tower Defence could be a really unique take on the genre, one that should be explored more often.\n\nThe Co-op however, that's plain awesome, and a great way to kill several hours with a friend... EXCEPT... it's not finished either. It's unpatched, and Neocore have been too busy with Van Helsing to give it the attention it desperately needs.\n\nClosing thoughts...\nMy time with Deathtrap has left me humming Bittersweet Symphony, because when it comes to it, that's pretty much a good summary of the game. It's a good game marred by some terrible faults because the developers, probably in their defence rightly, had to focus on the Van Helsing series. It doesn't make this any less of a waste of potential though, which is kind of sad.

But, sadly, it's not holding me.  I think a negative review is a bit harsh, I'd rather give neutral - with the emphasis being that it's a great concept, and is exciting to start with as you see the potential - but after a while you realise the things that usually draw you to a TD/RPG style game are done very plainly.\n\nPain points:\n- Towers can only be built on specific locations in each map - and of those set locations, only certain types of towers can be built there.  This is part of the strategic element - but it feels very constrictive.  The best tower defense games allow creativity, being able to mix/match towers and put them anywhere along the route - this game doesn't allow for that.   Want to place an ice trap that makes creeps susceptible to ice damage, and put a frost tower nearby to exploit that vulnerability?  Well, only if the level designer lets you by having put the "right" tiles for you to build those types of traps/tower in that area.  Given that the traps/towers inherently complement each other, restricting the use of these combos is really annoying.\n\n- No mazing, no ability to divert waves whatsoever.  This is part of the game design and intentional, but something I don't really like, as you don't get to maximize damage tactically by funneling creeps through your carefully built deathtrap.  Creeps will stick to their set paths always, so the only strategy open to you is to build different traps on each route, and again only where the level designer allows you to do so.\n\n- Item drops - this game is mimicking a Diablo-esque / Van Helsing style, yet there are no item drops from creeps.  Only at the end of each level a chest drops, with a handful of (generally rubbish) items.  The items in the game are largely indistinguishable in their variety; there is no excitement in item drops, everything is some slight variation in resistance or damage type to the last 50 drops that you sold at the shop or melted for crafting materials.  The shop sells equally dull items; nothing ever appears 'awesome' or 'too expensive but I'd love to save up and get that'.  There is no "wow" factor in any item I've seen.  Money is not an issue, before long you have more than you'll ever need or use, yet there's rarely anything good or different to buy.\n\nThere are other small annoyances, but these are the main ones.  Again I emphasize I did get quite some enjoyment out of it, it's not a bad game, but just disappointing that the core elements of creative TD and RPG the game really skimps on.  If they improve the loot drops and flexibility in tower setup, it would be heaps better.","May 31, 2015","false","20.0"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"

We completed the first Tier of levels in about 4 Hours. That isnt much, especially for 20€. After you Finished the game the First time, you can replay each level on different terms.

Not a single one. We just play the game.\n\nAbout the game-play:\n\nI played some amount of tower-defense games, my favourites are probably sanctum 2 and orcs must die 2, so this is where I come from.\n\nDeathrap is intense. It doesn't give you much help in regards of finding out what works best. But you can play around a lot. You can improve/boost/skill you traps, skill your character in plenty of different ways to acustom your play-style. Also there's items that drop after each map. So there is another pool of customisations in regards of stats. There's just so many options. I love it. The rest is standard tower-defense stuff. Enemies spawn from point A/B/C/D and run towards what ever your nexus is called. You cant block or create paths like in some other tower defense games. so you just place floor and tower defenses along the path. Decent Standard Tower-Defense stuff, y'know.\n\nGraphics: It looks decent. Not too fancy, nor crappy and it clearly has some "diablo-chic" going on. Which I like. Not everything has to be cell-shading(sanctum)/comic-style looking (orcs must die).\n\nPerformance whise: I run this game on gtx 970 and intel i7 and plenty of ram. So it works. There is the little performance drop you get in nearly every indie game when you reach a certain amount of action on the screen. ( I am talking survival mode 3-hour long session with every tower doing magic stuff and tons of mobs), but it is faaaaaaaar from unplayable, not nearly as laggy as risk of rain sadly tended to get (I love you risk of rain, I will always do).\n\nSo yeah, thats my review. I hope it's not a complete & utter mess to read. Have fun and a nice day.... bye !\n\ntl;dr: If you like tower-defense games, skilling, customisations and a little bit of grinding this should be your game. I am having plenty of fun and look forward to future updates.","March 9","true","78.8"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

I have put over twelve hours into Deathtrap and I still am not entirely sure I've seen everything I want to see in the game, despite matches sitting around 30 minutes a piece. I played all the way through tier one and halfway through tier two. It just kept adding new traps, one-offs that were either specific to the level or reused but unable to be upgraded. There was always more. Then the traps started repeating so now I am going to attempt to write this review before I put it off any longer.\n\nI had played The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing before. I was familiar with Neocore Games' work. I found it enjoyable, even. Despite that, I was a bit skeptical of them creating a tower defense game. Would it be something closer to Dungeon Defenders than anything? Would it be grindy? What was this I was hearing about set trap locations, each one of several different types? It wasn't something that seemed to entirely appeal to me.\n\nThen I played the game. It took a few rounds. I found the controller a bit unwieldy at first, especially in the menus, which have a truly awful control scheme, but I eventually got used to it. I got the rhythm of the game down and it started to become something quite special.\n\nIt works like this. The view is isometric, like Van Helsing. The setting is taken from Van Helsing, with your character being a hired mercenary that is taking on the creatures of the Ink. The character you control, you control in a hack 'n slash manner, like Van Helsing. Unlike Van Helsing, however, it is a tower defense, as well, rather than an open world hack 'n slash.\n\nIt's not a traditional tower defense, though. You have several types of traps, ground and towers, as well as mystical, mechanical, and summons. These sort of mix and match to create a set of nodes in which you can place, for example, a “mystical ground trap” or a “mechanical tower trap.” The summons are the only exception, being an exclusively ground-based ordeal. This can sound limited at first but then you start unlocking traps and it opens up quite a bit. So much so that you eventually stop knowing what to put your points into.\n\nPut simply, there are a lot of traps. At least 30 that can be upgraded using points earned for leveling and at least half a dozen more that can't. You start to realize “hey, I have a summon trap here, maybe I should put an enthropic pillar there so that it can heal the summons.” Maybe you realize that placing a frost pillar next to a lava grill and upgrading it so that it slows and freezes enemies will result in more damage being done to those enemies with less traps. Maybe you simply realize that an upgraded lava grill with the damage-over-time upgrade active is more worth it than that spear trap you haven't put any points into. The fact of the matter is that there are options in the game's limitations and that there are legitimate ways to play a map incorrectly.\n\nEven more so if you are intent on not using your hero. With the exception of a single map, which was designed to be played without heroes doing damage to the hordes, playing each map in order from tier one to tier two, I have never been able to play a map the first time around without using my hero. Even on that map that was designed for it, I wasn't able to go without using my hero's attacks. It's a game that's designed from the ground up to be a careful balance of hero and tower damage and I think they've done a fine job with it.\n\nTowers aren't the only ones that get to have fun with freezing or burning effects, either. Heroes unlock a significant amount of “fun” attacks as they level. I played as a Mercenary and, pretty early on, I was given a dash attack that froze anything I ran through for an amount of time specified by how much I had upgraded it and then set off a small explosion at the end of the dash, damaging nearby enemies. Later, I unlocked an attack where I slam my weapon down on the ground, causing a wave of fire to damage, and attach a damage-over-time effect to, anything within its range. It is insane amounts of fun to find small hordes and either freeze or light them on fire. One of my favorite features of the game was that you could cause a monster to lose interest in moving forward and stop to attack you, sometimes leading them either off the path or even backwards, so long as they did not pick up on the fact that a significant amount of other monsters were nearby and think weren't needed there anymore. It was incredibly fun for me to freeze hordes with the dash attack and watch them swarm together and chase me down.\n\nAttacks aren't all you get, though. Should you want to specialize as support, you can get spells that buff towers, other players, or both. The amount of options for your player character are staggering to the point of confusion. I legitimately had no idea what to do with my points after so long. The max level for each skill is ten but it would take you a long time to figure that out without someone telling you, as you will probably attempt to become a jack of all trades, as I did.\nBeyond the basic gameplay, the game also has a relatively simplistic crafting system in which you can either collect or dismantle different items for a small set of resources that can then be used to craft items that you have obtained the blueprints for. The items you craft scale to your level and are generally better than what you find in chests, I found, even if completing side-quests consistently.\n\nSpeaking of which, I found side-quests fairly underwhelming. While a nice touch, after the first few levels, they are few and far between, often requiring you to kill some beast that is either a good half the map away from anywhere you might actually use or that is only accessible by Ink portal. Once you do find said beast, you will probably not beat it unless you come back to it after you've leveled a bit. This isn't too big a deal, as you obtain about a level per match, granted you continue to do the levels in order but it is fairly annoying, especially considering the simplicity of them. Some quests are to “not use mystic traps” or “complete without doing damage with your hero” but even those don't help to alleviate the concerns of being underwhelming. It's fortunate, then, that three different difficulty levels with four tiers each help to increase replay value.\n\nThere were very few other issues I encountered in Deathtrap. There was an unfortunate bug that seemed to be related to the way the game sorted which trap you were trying to place/upgrade when using controllers where you couldn't place floor traps that were near a Squash Trap and, as mentioned before, I think the menu controls are absolutely awful and unintuitive, but my concerns pretty much ended there. The game is incredibly solid and provides a high amount of graphical fidelity to match.\n\nDeathtrap is one of those games that rarely comes along. One that restores my faith in a genre that is drowning in a sea of games that stick too closely to the tried and true. It may seem limited at first but the game takes those limitations and makes more options out of them than many games with significantly more freedom give. It provides a fast-paced hack 'n slash experience with the necessity to be smart about upgrades, both on maps and on your character sheet and, to be honest, I don't think that happens often enough. The game has easily restored my faith in the tower defense genre single-handed and, with the ability to create custom maps, it will last for a long time to come.","March 16, 2015","true","13.5"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mooacnx/recommended/310510/","mooacnx","Miporin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mooacnx/","737 products in account",""One of the best co-op hybrid TD games"\n\nIf you have ever played Van Helsing series from the same dev, and loved them. You will also love this one.\n\n--- below is the generic detailed review, but not in-depth. I tried to be spoiler free as much as I can, short version is available in overall topic ----\n\nedit1: fix some typing errors\n\n::: Visual :::\nThe graphic is nice in its own genre, nothing special. There are some nice details here and there, but you won't notice them anyway when the waves come. The FX is visually served its purpose for the genre, though, it would be better to see some visual variation of the same enemy. (different headgears, weapons, horns, sizes, etc.)\n\n::: Sound :::\nThe repeated audio can be annoying at times (which is expected from this genre). however, there are several things that is missing, which I think should be included in the patches, one of them is pinging notice (Attention, Help, Back). You can see it in the minimap, but when things get messy, you won't be seeing it anymore, so the sound is need. (maybe the sound is there, but i tried them, but heard none, just ping in minimap)\n\n::: Gameplay :::\nThere are 13 official maps, each map has 4 variation (depending on number of players), 4 tiers for each map. Map designs are very good imo, you cannot just use the same setup on every map, and each can be done in several different styles. There are also some challenges maps available after complete normal maps too. Finish all maps, and all tiers ? you can continue with custom maps from others or make one (or more) yourselfs.\n\nApart from the normal difficulty, you can customized one yourself when you reach certain level, there is also an endless mode for your hardcoreness. I haven't try the custom diff and endless, still in the middle of tier 2 with these hours in.\n\n***The current downside is that players abused the custom maps to farm xp, and unlocks. you will see very high level players that can't even combo their traps and skills properly, then ruin your game***\n\nEach map can be different depending on number of players, more lanes, more cores, chaotic ai paths, different enemies in waves, more enemies. They are really nice, but just one thing ..., the wave is patterned wave, not a dynamic wave in normal mode (random enemies orders). It is not really disappointed, but it would be a blast if it is a dynamic wave.\n\nThere are 3 classes (currently), which are melee, range, and magic class. each classes has several active and passive skill, which encourage different playstyle. Skill trees design to progress nicely with your playthrough (from tier 1-4). It doesn't really encourage the abused xp farming at all, but a lot of players still doing it. There are some balancing issue, but nothing major.\n\nItems and Equipments can be purchased from store (random), or crafted in lobby. They can also be earned as rewards from completing maps and some optional objectives. They are what you can expect from general action-rpg game, so nothing special. Bonuses from equipment is what you expected, but with the right setup, it is more than enough.\n\nIn order to build traps, you need bases for them, each base is trap-type specific. (you cannot just build anything on any bases) there are some special traps (map specific traps) in some maps which can be used for your advantage (or not). You need essences to build them, which can be earned from killing hordes, and completing waves. in co-op games, the essence will be divided according to number of players, so you share your earning, but your spending is yourself.\n\nEach trap has 2 passive skills and 3 upgradable skills (3 level each). They can be ranked up with Research Points, which can be earned from complete maps, optional quests. They are not infinite, but I can say that there are enough for you to progress to each tier maps.\n\nSkills and upgrades can be reset at anytime during your journey through tiers 1-4 in lobby with some costs. This allow you to change your playstyle back and forth freely, however, this can be minimized with co-op plays.\n\n::: Overall :::\nIf you are looking for a good TD game, this is your game. Apart from traps, heroes also play the huge part in the game. You can customized your loadout (traps' upgrades, and heroes' skills and equipments). You can be a dedicated trapper, a meat wall, or balanced between the two, depending on your loadouts. CO-OP play is fairly balanced, as the difficulty scales with the players in-game.\n\nIt requires some balancing here and there, but nothing major to prevent you from enjoying a good TD.\n\nFinal word, please DO NOT CHEAT (or whatever you called) in CO-OP games, do it alone if you want to.","February 17, 2015","true","33.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

Then I've watched the trailers and read the reviews, and it started to look like the game was worth a try.\n\nI started with the Mercenary, and at first glance the game seemed rather slow-paced and easy. And the major difference compared to other TD games like "Defence Grid" and countless Flash versions was very... no, VERY limited number of spots for traps. Furthermore, every spot was restricted to certain types of traps (mechanical tower/floor, magic tower/floor, summoning). So the usual tactic of zones of death was obviously impossible. It seemed that the character was the central figure, and the traps were just a supportive feature.\n\nHowever, as I've reached higher tiers of maps, it became clear that I was mistaken. More difficult maps had more trap spots, allowing trap combos. And the game itself became harder and more pressing. Sometimes I had to teleport over the map and/or spam skills like crazy to get the perfect score. And sometimes I had to do so to complete the map at all. Maps became way more demanding on trap type and hero skill selection, some of the late Tier 4 maps were absolutely unbeatable without redistribution of skill and trap points.\n\nSo, in the end, the game is a solid, worthy and highly enjoyable as a combination of RPG and tower defence genres. Good variety of traps and their upgrades combined with trap-specific and other hero skills leave space for different playstyles, and the maps are different enough to prevent relying on same 2-3 trap types throughout the game. Although some traps do seem somewhat weak compared to other that do similar stuff.\n\nThe game is not perfect, though. It has occasional bugs, which might appear after updates and sometimes are rather serious, affecting damage output of hero/traps or simply freezing/crashing the game (haven't frozen or crashed myself, but saw threads in the tech support discussions). And they don't get fixed as soon as one would wish. Nevertheless, I still recommend this game to anyone who is into tower defences, skill/item builds and mobicides.","April 4, 2015","true","139.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

The game is so broken by bugs and glitches that it plays more like a late alpha or early beta than a finished game. And it’s not just me who is experiencing all of these issues, but all of my friends who play the game as well, and you will also see the same serious issues I will be mentioning here have been posted on Neocore’s official forum from around 9 months ago, yet not a single one of them have been positively addressed or fixed by them, and that should really tell you something about this company. Besides the random and unexplained crashes, when attempting to so much as browse the crafting screen the game crashes for many players. Also, during game-play your character will occasionally get stuck and unable to move or effect anything in the game, including being unable to use any abilities to fight enemies, rendering the game unplayable for the rest of the map, and you and your team will lose all you worked for however long you played it. Another crash occurs while attempting to transfer potions from your shared character “Stash” to your characters “Backpack”. Also, multiplayer endless mode is still broken since the begining many many months ago. broken. There are other issues with the game as well. So sadly, all in all, this game is seriously broken, and was not ready fore release to begin with and still isn’t all of these months later. Therefore, I cannot recommend this game to anyone for purchase until these serious issues are actually address and remedied. Shame on Neocore for releasing “another” not ready for launch, bug ridden, and glitchy game, and also for continuing to refuse to fix it even after selling the game to the public, and even after receiving all of this bug and glitch related information from their customers, which they known about since before release, but went ahead and sold the game anyways. I would stay clear of this company and their games.","September 17, 2015","false","296.0"," 49 of 84 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","49","84","4","0"

I was looking for another TD game after Defense Grid 2 and it seemed ideal.\n\nAt first I was disappointed. The imprecision of the point-and-click controls will be frustrating for anyone who is more concerned with strategy than repetitive button pressing. I've never been a fan of games like Diablo or DOTA, and that's what Deathtrap feels like to me. Putting that aside, I have started to enjoy the mash-up of RPG and tower defence game styles.\n\nThe character you create really does affect the gameplay, because you choose the equipment, the skills and the traps they can set. Given the variety of gameplay styles, difficulty levels, multiplayer, and community maps, It adds up to a good game with endless replay appeal. The icing on the cake is the sountrack and the artwork, which are first rate.","May 31, 2015","true","46.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Its a mix of tower defence and fantasy action/rpg game, where you can build towers and upgrade your character with skills and items to defeat waves of foes. Despite the fact that it is still in alpha - most of the core features appear to be already in the game.\n\nThe levels look amazing and the amount of details is impressive as well. Each of them can be replayed numerous times on different difficulties and with different monsters as well as side quests like killing a special monster in the woods and opening a chest for an extra reward. There are also optional challenges on higher difficulties like only using specific towers or skills.\n\nThe monsters appear to be taken from a mix of gaelic/celtic and slavic mythos as well as their previous game King Arthur which seems to have inspired an overall look and feel of this game.\n\nThe items can be obtained from boss level monsters, chests, store (uses in game currency, the are no micro transactions here) or they can be crafted by using gems obtained from salvaging items or drops. Its pretty much the same as Diablo or Van Helsing in this regard, except there are less slots for your items.\n\nSkills and traps can be upgraded and there are quite a few of them so you will have to prioritise and select upgrades that fit your play-style.\n\nOverall i was impressed with this game and wanted to play it more but i do have some concerns. Neocore is infamously bad with engine optimizations and all of their games have suffered from low FPS and stuttering even on good rigs, ridiculous amounts of bugs, typos and other issues. This game appears to have quite a few issues as well: there are noticeable slowdowns when a lot of monsters appear at the same on the screen, the sound keeps crackling for no apparent reason, there are typos even in the options menu, there is quite a lot of stuttering when you use your skills on a lot of foes simultaneously and then there are CTD's one if which managed to crash my PC for the first time in 9 or so month's... which is kinda scary. Otherwise i am running it at highest settings and changing them does not appear to have any effect on performance.\n\nI will give this game a positive review for now simply because it appears to be in a better state than most of the other early access games and it is in fact fun to play. However i might just change my mind a few month's from now if i don't see any improvement in performance. Hopefully it wont be another King Arthur 2 disaster.\n\nP.S.\n\nThere's also a co-op mode which i am reluctant to try in case it will blow up my PC.","January 18, 2015","true","8.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

Original writing is intact\n\nI've not played this game enough, and now I regret it deeply - even now, I started it again in anticipation of VH3...\n\nWhat a mistake!\n\nI'll try to be short, both for readers sake and for my playtime. Besides, I haven't reached deepest knowledge of the game - yet...\n\nSo, game is aRPG - Tower Denfense hybrid - and both traits are executed:\n\n1. there are times when you'll using your character as a main weapon, and cursing dearly the bad luck of not having items you need desperately.\n\n2. sometimes, you will almost 'please sit back and relax while windows configures your computer' - pun intended to people who installed Win95 nine billion times, as your truly did - and for those who didn't - you mostly watch your well-oiled machinery of towers doing it's thing, and tinker here and there when needed.\n\nBalance:\nThe game balances itself. I had hidden doubts. I don't have them anymore. In most cases, you WON'T be able to execute cheesiest tactic in existence in every occasion. Rightfully so!\n\nDifficulty:\n\nCasual players can have fun, no doubt. Killing things if fun, and useful, since monsters tend to breed too much, and then consume too much resources, and die. That being said, the game is not unfriendly to beginners!\n\nMore inclined players won't have an easy task - just tweak a difficulty abit, and your glorious winning character and tactics doesn't work so well anymore.\n\nDifficulty is increased NOT because the game got boring, rather because it feels different, require much better play, and gives rewards accordingly.\n\nAlso, there is a score-board - might look unimportant, but wait until you start to consider yourself a Master. Or The Master. But the score-board might not see it quite the same way...\n\nMultiplayer:\n\nErrr... I can't review this. I've played very little of it, mainly cause public servers are not as full as deserved. So, make your friend with similar off-time to buy it, once when you get addicted.\n\nWhen I get my hands on some money,\n(I'll kiss it's green skin and) buy a fourpack\n\nSeriously, as a person who played (whole truth!) ~20,000h (under the sea) of aRPGs and ~4,000 games of Tower Defense games (mainly one, to be honest, but this one captures my heart fastly), *ahem*, and having a bunch of friends whom I played that 'prime Tower Defense', I think we'll pretty much have to do it. For the Greater Good!\n\nThen I'll put a MP review, oh, what a MP review I'll put!\n\nBut if you have regulars, go for it. Based on *cough* vast experience, co-op cannot be bad, and competitive - well, it's a pinnacle of Tower Defense games, at least I see it that way, so it would take at least 2,000 games for me to give an opinion [kidding].\n\nMistakes, punishment, revenge\n\nI made a mistakes in (my life and) skills chosen. No problem, I can respec them. For a price, not too low also. But then again, I can grind money, and use it to correct my faults.\n\nI meant to say bit more, but that sentence pretty much sums it up - every mistake (sadly, just in game) you can correct, but have to work a bit for it. Greater the change, greater the amount. It's not cheesy 'just click a button', but it's not 'lemme start again, oh no, ALL of it again' - a golden standard that should be applied to other games, too (disclaimer - I haven't actually become The Master - but if you're reading this, neither did you).\n\nTemporary conclusion:\nIt's worth having. Now i have to go back playing. I've slept only few hours, and probably won't tonight. I'm thinking of taking a leave from work, and that's a rather responsible job, so - PEOPLE WILL DIE if I do it. Well, people tend to breed excessively and consume too much resources...\n\n---------------------\n[Old review follows, in all its early access glory - note that I don't disavow anything I've said earlier]\n--------------------\n\nEarly access - NO multiplayer cooperative or competitive!\n\nHaving established this, though it is stated clearly, on to the review:\n\nIt is a hero-TD, meaning you have a hero (sic!), which kills (alot) of monsters, coming in a wave. Other meaning of killing monsters are, of course, towers (here called 'traps'). For each kill, you get money, which you spend on customizing and upgrading. It looks as Diablo (hero/skills/loot/leveling) is packed in TD-game (upgrading towers/research tree/customization). Graphics are excellent and so is the sound.\n\nBoth hero and traps have extensive upgrade possibilities, and you (probably, I'm playing early preview) can't have all of them maxed out - as you very well shouldn't. This means you can develop your own, unique playstyle. Thats TON of possibilities and potential replay value. Since it's not the only one, we shall call it TON-1.\n\nMP coop *will* become available at some point (read the schedule). I expect that each additional player, with his own unique setup, will make gameplay different - I haven't seen this in work, but expect TON of variations, and we shall call it TON-2.\n\nMP competitive will have players in two team pitted two against two (attackers who manage monster waves and defenders - or so I'm told). I don't have a clue what will be attackers options and how many different strategies and possibilities they will have, so lets say that, if done right, it *can* add a POSSIBLE TON of variations, call it possible TON-3\n\nThe Editor: yes, there is one. It's in the early stage. I don't know where its limits will lie, but if done right, player-made content can produce unique, high quality maps, introduce different elements and settings - this is PROBABLE TON of variation, TON-4.\n\nConclusion:\n------------\nBased on my many years of playing various TDs, and last five years spent as coodeveloper/developer/balancer for the one of best known and long-lived TDs around (no advertisement, though it is a mod and therefore, free) and having helped on several other well and not-so-well known TDs, here's my judgement:\n\nThis game has great potential. It is early preview, so all I saw was one hero in single player campaign and lots of stuff is still locked. I believe that full game will be a TD worthy of having, and certainly fun to play - whether you are an aRPG or TD fan, you'll find something intriguing to this genre mix-up.\n\nBut since I've detected TON-1 and TON-2 (totalling 2 tons) of certain variations, and, possibly, TON-3 and TON-4, I think think this will be game worth having and that players will return to it many times. Because of those tons of variations, of course...\n\nShould I buy it?\n--------------------\n1) If you're interested in helping developers to find bugs, refine balance, propose new features (they're very open to this) and influence game development in general - YES\n2) If you're interested in playing what is on the table, few maps, campaign, one hero - YES - in just a couple of weeks/months there will be alot more.\n3) If you're going to check MP availability, although it is *clearly* stated that there is not one at the moment, and then whine about it and even write negative reviews, then NO, please don't bother\n\nThe game is in the playable state, there is no placeholders or missing graphics (in the part which I've seen, at least) - unlike many "Early previews" who are just a way to support further development.\n\nMeaning, you can play it right away, with some options disabled. Which is what I am going to do, as soon as I finish this.","November 3, 2014","true","116.9"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","21","33","0","0"

While being a decent game in its own right you can't help but think that what it really constitutes is the potential foundation for something better and more polished. Maybe a sequel that improves on the formula in the event that this debut entry is supported enough to warrant one.\nJust to get it out of the way I'll say straight up that I haven't experienced any technical issues with regards to the game not running, crashing, etc. I know that in the past others had complained about what sounded like really specific issues resulting in the game not running properly on their system. That hasn't been the case with me and at this point I've only encountered one very minor bug (twice).\nCharacters in Deathtrap control nicely, and by "nicely" I mean "exactly how you'd expected them to given that they represent the action rpg component of the game as advertised". Character specs are meaningful and interesting but not entirely pivotal which is probably as it should be.\nThe game's traps are pretty cool for the most part. Some are classics (spike floors, lava tiles, lightning towers, etc.) whereas others are a little more offbeat and serve to keep the tower defense aspect of the game fairly fresh. Traps have upgrades that must be spec'd into to utilize in combat and I think this is where Deathtrap really shines. The traps work like you'd expect them to and are devastatingly effective. Even while defending multiple chokepoints solo you won't feel like your arm is being twisted by artificial difficulty in an attempt to force you into multiplayer. The game gets harder, yes, but only as it ramps up naturally while your character and traps simultaneously gain strength. This alone makes Deathtrap worthy of attention in a development culture rife with micro-transactions fueled by nearly enforced group play. I paid a reasonable one time cover charge for the game and I'm having fun playing it. What more could an avid gamer ask for?\nIn the end I'm glad I supported this game and I hope others do too.

Aesthetically it is darker, with a grimmer, far less comedic tone. Being set in the Van Helsing (game, not movie) universe, if you played either of Neocore's excellent Van Helsing Arpg's, the monsters will be familiar to you. There are three character types you can play, representing the classic three Arpg archetypes, Melee, archery, and magic.\n\nThe game basically plays as a perfect arpg/tower defense hybrid. Characters have skills and there is loot, crafting, and enhancing runes that give your character different bonuses like damage boosts or reduced traps costs, In addition to defending the gates, there are sometimes sidequests during areas that require you to balance going off-map (in tower defense terms) to hunt for an extra objective while also maintaining and upgrading your defenses.\n\nI have only played for 4.1 hours so far, but I find this to be a lot of fun.

Usually I recommend games with conditions, like sale etc. This game just buy it, it really is superbly done.\nI would put this is my top 10 games of all time and probably my favourite defense game.\n\nSee you in the ruins, either as friends or foes.\nNow back to it!\n\n\n------------------\nBelow here is my original early access review\n\nFirstly this game does not deserve the title early access. The content that is here is absolutely outstanding, this is exactly how an 'early access' game should play. It feels more like a BETA ready for release.\n\nGraphics- One of the most beautiful TD's I've played, and I do love TD's\n\nGameplay-Hugely fun combination of traps/towers and your hero lead to a blast of a time.\n\nMap editor- Already a powerful tool allowing customisation of maps, approaching enemies(currently in different group types), pathing, enemy spawns, defense locations and exits. Full workshop integration. Very easy to edit and upload maps.\n\nHero- One class released currently. The sorceress. The levelling system is very nice gaining XP for finishing maps(including custom maps),  with the ability to improve passive and active abilities. Full inventory system with weapons/armour/trinkets that you keep. A ingame shop feature to spend your gold. The hero is an important part of your defense, you never feel like you just sit back and watch the traps do all the work.\n\nDefenses- Already a massive selection of defenses released. As you complete levels you unlock upgrade points to improve defense levels and add special abilities. Defenses can be placed in type specific locations across the map.\n\nCurrently there are 3 'campaign' levels and all the custom maps you want to create or subscribe to.\n\nSummary- The game runs smooth, no glitches, no bugs and no crashes on my windows 7 system. The content that is currently available is very polished and well developed.

There's not a whole lot more description you need for Deathtrap, but it is deeper than the description might imply\n\nThere's very little story to speak of. Demons are seeping in to our world, and you must stop them before they reach our portal. There is lore, but the way it's presented makes it feel like nothing more than flavour. It does work hard to set the tone though, the designs look the part, the levels suitably ancient and dank.\n\nThe gameplay is the important part of Deathtrap. You control a warrior in the world, with Diablo style hotkeys and cool downs, and can drop traps on set locations. You can level your character up, buy, find, and craft armour and weapons. There's stat boosts, equipment that can increase your perks etc. It's very action rpg. Enemies spawn from gates, with each new wave usually adding a new gate to occupy your thoughts.\n\nEnemies follow a set route, which can change between rounds, making placement of traps important. At the start of each round you have a set number of ‘essence’ to spend on traps, with set locations where you can place them. As you level up traps will start to cost you less and you’ll be rewarded with more essence, depending on which perks you pick. Over the course of each wave you’ll earn more essence to spend on the next wave, or, if you’re struggling, mid-fight, although this can leave you in trouble for the next onslaught.\n\nAs you might be able to tell, Deathtrap is a pretty simple game that’s a bit of a nightmare to explain when you get to the minutiae. It’s tempting to say that there’s not a lot more to it, and certainly I didn’t delve in as much as I could have, but what makes the game fun is the small stuff. Your use of powers in battle is hugely important, it obviously depends which character and which skills you pick, but playing as the fighter one of my skills was to boost the power of a trap for a period of time. My tactic became to wait for a horde of enemies to head towards a ground trap, power that trap up, then position myself in the way, aggroing them, keeping them there so they were taking extra damage from the trap. I then began to couple that with other spells, the one that gave me extra essence for killing enemies, and a continuous AOE attack that increased the damage enemies were taking. This 30 second blast of attacks was designed to help me out with the next wave, letting me buy and improve my traps.\n\nWhere Deathtrap falls down a little is in its depth. There’s actually a lot there, with around 15 levels, all with multiple scenarios, and a level cap of, I think, 100 (I was getting up to about 20 when I finished the game). You only get points to spend on upgrading your traps on the first time beating a level/difficulty/scenario, which is understandable but it causes a couple of problems. You can redistribute your skills for the price of some gold, which you'll have an awful lot of, with very little to spend it on (similarly I never got to the point where the crafting was useful), and you can scrap and rebuild traps during levels. However, I still ended up playing levels where I'd built everything I possibly could, with a wave or so left to play. Something to do with that extra essence would be nice.\n\nThere's skills in the game where spending a point on them will incrementally improve something, a nice idea, but given how limited upgrade points are even at the point where I’d finished the game, dropping 10 points to get a 3% chance of some bonus just never seemed like a worthwhile spec. If you're going to play through everything in the game then sure, but there were a few occasions in the game where I found myself falling back on the same tactics, the same skills and the same perks.\n\nFor £15 there's a ridiculous amount of content in Deathtrap. You may well use the same tactics on each map, not delving in to the minutiae of respecing, never playing the alternative scenarios, and you’ll still comfortably get your money’s worth. Deathtrap is a game that’s done no favours by a written description. Because of the price it’s hard to be too critical that it’s lacking the gloss of a proper story and a more involved campaign, but it still manages to be compulsive enough that I was squeezing games in before work, rushing things to make time between commitments, Deathtrap is a good game, and one hopefully that gets built on","February 24, 2015","true","11.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Three character with skill to improve and traps to enhance. While the first run through the campaign (actually a linear seemingly unrelated walk through levels) isn't really hard to do, the subsequent runs make things a bit more interesting strategy wise. With many twists, the same levels didn't feel stale or repeative, trying to go for perfect was mostly done by a bit of grinding getting through unlimited waves versions of the different fields.\nIt isn't world shattering but it has a charm, a 'I want to get that last bit done too' feeling. I tried out a lot of traps but as with most games it boiled down to getting the right combinations and increasing damage as much as possible. Each character has a 'favourite' type of damage but you can make good combos without looking at the preferred damage ones.\nI have tried to multiplay but it was a bit buggy, quite a few crashes to desktop and/or sudden disconnects.\n\nA truely fun game with some quirks, a lot of charm and an easy to use interface.

Don't know.\n\nFor the price that it's asking for, I'm giving it a yellow light with it approaching the green light for purchasing it. It's a good game but needs a little bit more tweaking and a little bit more content, and that's probably be done nearing the game's launch out of Early Access.

Both Orcs must die games and Defender's quest did it and kept me occupied for many fun hours, but I have not found anything I've like since.

So I spent some time trying to research how different this game was or if I should just sink my time into DD2.  I saw discussion threads where people were having a really hard time describing the differences and I couldn't understand why.  Now that I own the game, I understand why.  While the surface mechanics are the same, they play very differently and I'm not sure which I like more.\n\nPros:\nWell balanced skills and traps\nEnemy diversity to include champion variants\nARPG style loot, but not overwhelming since it's not per enemy kill\nI find the unique graphic style more appealing than DD2\nI prefer the isometric view as well\nClass skills and passives that actually differentiate the classes\nTons of upgrade combinations per trap, both passive and active\nUser made maps and easy editor\n\nCons:\nOnly three classes\nAll classes have the same trap selection\nTraps are placed in set locations (but with options of which trap to place)\nLoot only awarded upon level completion\nHuge potential grind of replaying the same maps (need 3 stars on hard to unlock next tier)\n\nOverall I really like the game.  Being able to speed up or slow down the pace means easier waves are shorter.  The interfance and experience just feels smoother and more polished than similar ARPG/Tower Defense games.  While there are limited classes I think the customization options and potential for huge number of user made maps more than make up for it.

The closest comparison that can be drawn to it from other games in the tower defense genre would be Dungeon Defenders. Although the character progression and abilities are more fleshed out and force players to make decisions that uniquely define their characters role more than DD does. There are 3 classes, the mercenary, the sorceress and the marksman, each have a different playstyle and trap base type that they favour with a multitude of abilities to choose from as they level up. The mercenary for example is good at playing the role of melee tank and favours mechanical traps (both floor and tower types).\n\nThe trap base types are Mechanical Floor, Mystical Floor, Mechanical Tower, Mystical Tower and Summoning, each with 5 traps for a total of 25 different types of traps. Unlike Dungeon Defenders you're limited to where you can place each trap type by predefined trap locations which can somewhat limit the amount of potential builds for each map. There are four main enemy archetypes as well of which, different towers will either be super effective, neutril or ineffective against which forces players to use multiple types of towers and traps to prevent enemies reaching their gate (core).\n\nOverall I find the game to be quite and enjoyable and it has a lot of depth to it with 13 campaign maps which have 4 increasing difficulty tiers which unlock as you progress to maintain the challenge as your character levels. Once the 13 campaign maps have been completed on the first tier 5 additional scenario maps unlock as well. Scenario mode which is similar to the campaign but instead has added challenges that the player can choose from to increase the difficulty as they see fit and increase the xp, loot and gold they receive at the end of the mission. Finally there is also the endless mode which is basically survival with ever increasingly stronger enemies thrown at the player until eventually they are defeated.\n\nWell worth the price of admission.","February 11, 2015","true","70.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

But this game stands out because it requires actual involvement in the defense.  To me, tower defense games have always been fairly simple, you identify the choke points and place the correct towers and every know and again you upgrade or add a tower, but if you play smart you always win.  This game requires your help,  your towers can't do this alone and on more than one occasion I've had a drip of sweat running down my brow as that monster that slipped through is pixels away from the core and has 1000 health points left as I use my speed attack and destroy it only miliseconds away from it counting as a hit.  You have to level your character and towers strategically to the point where you start to develop your own signature playstyle.  Also there's co-op and who doesn't love to murderize monsters with their best friend?\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this a 9 and not a 10 is because the game doesn't support camera rotation... which I didn't get annoyed by playing as a mercenary, but when I started a game with my friend playing as a marksman I was annoyed because the marksman is a ranged character and because of the camera angle you can see much further to the north and east of the map, but to the west and south you view range is very limited, which means you have to attempt to use the dots on the minimap and fire off screen and just hope you're hitting something until it comes into view or you get closer.  Since the mage is also a ranged unit I feel you'd have the same fustrating experience on some of the maps.","February 14, 2015","true","97.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Most of them are similar in mechanics with only a few attempting to mix it up. Sang Froid was the first that combined ARPG mechanics in my opinion. Left me wanting for something similar. DeathTrap looked interesting, but didn't buy it untill the coupon dropped in my inventory. After roughly 25 hours of play I can say it was worth the purchase. Even if I won't proceed the game has repaid the investment.\n\nPersonally I have little love for the Van Hellsing games. Not because I do not enjoy ARPG's though. A lot of issues from the VH games are present in this spin-off Tower Defense game. The graphics can look nice and atmospheric while at other times are poor quality. Which makes you often wonder why it can be such a strain on your hardware. I've also encountered a fair amount of graphical glitches. Still the models and spells look nicely done.\n\nThe background music sets a nice tone and pace for the game. However I often wonder why my mercenary sounds like a woman when swinging and hitting opponents. That doesn't mix with the male depiction of the class. Other then that the voice overs are nice for the few times it is heard at the start or ending of a map.\n\nThere are currently three classes in the game. Each has its own distinct playstyle and class tree as is common with ARPG's. On top of that you can unlock traps and level them accordingly. The VH system of character customization can be clearly seen in this regard. The maps themselves are interestingly made and offer side quests for additional challenges and rewards.\n\nLike most ARPG's you play through different tiers of difficulty. That is why you can replay each campaign map at least 4 times. This might sound boring. However each tier offers different monsters, known monsters with new attacks, different positions to place certain traps. Each map basically tells you which kind of trap or tower you can build at a specific location. At first this seems limiting at tier 1. Later on, when traps are developed further and you get a nice synergie going, the tactical element becomes more clear and fun.\n\nJust like the VH games the combat is still clunky and unresponsive at times. This becomes even more annoying if you play at x2 speed and your character won't be targeting properly. Meaning some opponents slip by and do damage to your gate. Or that your character is attacking one target. Even though you're targeting another the character won't switch or charge to the one you want. This can be frustrating at times.\n\nThere is loot, there is crafting...and overall a pretty enjoyable experience for those enjoying Tower Defence games.","April 12, 2015","true","24.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I really have enjoyed their TIAoVH series and loved the tower defense game within it.  At first I didn't think I would like it but it grew on me so when I found out about Deathtrap I was like oh cool they took one of the coolest things that made TIAoVH a unique ARPG into it's own game.  Some people seem to have taken that as laziness or a cash grab for some reason, I think it was a good idea.  I don't see it as lazy, it is a is a tried and tested idea for within the other game and they have fully fleshed it out into it's own game.\n\nCurrently I have just over an hour invested in the game and so far it is well worth the money invested even if I don't play another minute, though I am sure I will certainly play a great deal more.   Neocore is very good about spreading out achievements in their games making it one of those games that is fun to keep playing because you know that any minute you may stumble across just one more unlock.  It works.    As far as the game games if it is a fun tower defense but it doesn't get too stressful unless you play at the harder levels so if you just want to relax and plan some fun traps and sit back and have fun it is that type of game.  You can play as actively or as inactively as you want depending on the level you set the game.   I like to play actively myself.\n\nAll in all it is a great game and at the asking price of $20 it is worth every penny, I have plenty of $60 games that I haven't gotten near the enjoyment out of as I already have out of Deathtrap.","June 28, 2015","true","2.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Veterans of the Van Helsing series will recognize the darker aesthetic right away and even meet some old monster "friends." The gane at this writing is Early Access but is already feature rich. At the moment you can choose between a Sorceress and a Merc. More classes will be added soon as well as new game modes.\n\nThere is a huge amount of skills to upgrade both for your character and the traps themselves. Additionally you can upgrade world effects that do things like damage ALL baddies on the level for a short time. All skills have a cooldown period just as you would find in Diablo, Torchlight, Titan Quest and other ARPGs. Character skills are assigned as usual with left click being your primary attack, right secondary, and keys one through four as additional battle skills.\n\nBefore each wave you have the chance to look at the enemy wave information including the path as well as the monsters coming through the Chaos Gates. You must think tactically as to where to build your traps. Building them is as easy as clicking the middle mouse button and placing them. As the game progresses, more traps are unlocked and you can choose what to place.\n\nTraps are built through accumulating "essence." You can think of this as "mana" for the traps. The traps themselves are quite imaginative and fun. Acid sprays, lightning traps, ice, and even traps that have monsters that kill other monsters!\n\nIn addition to all of this and the coming excellent selection of game modes is one of the most intuitive map and monster editors I have ever seen. Making maps is a snap and what's more, they can be easily shared with your friends, enemies, and persons yet unknown on Steam.\n\nIt is quite clear that Neocore are becoming a marquee indie developer and the progression from the first Van Helsing game to Deathtrap clearly shows a developer who is maturing and willing to take risks.\n\nThe music has the same sort of Eastern European feel that fits with the visual aesthetic of the game. As for the voice acting, it is serviceable but I wish Neocore had brought back the actress who voiced the acerbic Katrina in the Van Helsing series. Some of her lines were simply classic whereas the voice acting in this game is at this point just some lines repeated at random. They are not frequent enough to be annoying but, some variety would be nice.\n\nBefore each battle there are well written descriptions of the land you are about to enter. Again, it is clear that Neocore is building a franchise and creating very interesting lore.\n\nOnce upon a time I had ONE favorite tower defense game, Defense Grid. I still love it - especially the voice acting. But, the rich fantasy setting of Deathtrap combined with strong ARPG elements and a nice map and monster editor could possibly have me split my TD itch between Deathtrap and Defense Grid.\n\nI have only 36 minutes in and the ONLY reason I stopped was to write this short impression of the game. A full review would not be fair as the game is not finished. That said, it is worth the price of admission at least for me. I bought this on the strength of the Van Helsing games and I do not regret it one bit.\n\nI am hooked on this and need to get back to work!\n\nOne word to laptop users who have both an integrated graphics card AND either an Nvidia or AMD: make sure to set Deathtrap to run with the dedicated Nvidia or AMD. It plays decently with integrated graphics but has a weird tendency to minimize itself. Running under the Nvidia has been quite stable.\n\n","December 16, 2014","true","0.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Content was added frequently, I've not seen one obvious bug in the whole time and the map creator is awesome.\n\nI'd recommend it to everyone who already loves the Van Helsing RPGs and enjoys tower defence games.

The player has to stop an assortment of demonic creatures from reaching portals. You do this by building traps along the creatures path, and you also control a character that can move around the map and attack the creatures directly. Its similar to Orcs Must Die, but with a more elevated camera angle.\n\nThe player character can be either a warrior, rogue or mage depending on if you want to focus on melee or ranged attacks. You move with arrows/wasd, have a basic attack on LMB and upto 5 other abilities on hotkeys. These abilities cost rage/mana which is generated by using the basic attack, and there are more than 5 abilities to choose from, plus several passives, so you can build a character that suits your playing style.\n\nAfter completing a map you gain points to increase the strength of abilities and traps. You also earn loot that can be equipped - weapons that do more damage, armour, helmets and rings that give more protection from physical or elemental damage - and you earn gold to buy better items from the shop. Some maps have secondary objectives that reward you with bonus items or XP.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that you're very restricted with the placement of traps. Each trap belongs to one of five categories, for example the lava trap is "mystical" and the spear trap is "mechanical". They're both placed on the ground and damage enemies that run over them. However, if a floor tile is designated as mystical, you can't build a mechanical trap there, and vice versa. Many floor tiles can't be built on at all, and there is no possibility of shaping the creatures path to make a long maze.\n\nEach category has five traps to unlock, so there is some player choice, but I still felt like I was prevented from designing my own tactics, which is part of the fun of tower defence. Each creature is strong and weak against specific types of traps, but the restrictions make it difficult to find a way to take advantage. Every map has multiple paths, and some maps have multiple portals to defend, so the main tactical choice I had was to figure out which areas to defend with my character and which areas my traps could defend without my help.\n\nThere are 13 campaign maps and it took me 7 hours to beat them all once. But each map has 3 difficulties (creatures have more health) and 4 tiers (changes spawn locations, trap placements and routes to the portals), plus scenarios (buffs creatures or weakens your traps/character) and an endless mode, so there is a large potential for replayability.\n\nThe story is non existent. I don't think this is essential in tower defence, but a bit more effort would have made a good game even better. Graphics are on par with most tower defence games, there are some nice details in the creature animations and spell effects and I'm getting a constant 55-56 FPS with all the settings enabled or at highest level.\n\nDeathtrap is a really fun game, and I definitely give it a very strong recommendation. While the RPG mechanics are stronger than the tower defence mechanics, I think fans of either genre should find alot of enjoyment here.","April 15, 2015","true","24.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Many play but more could be playing for sure.\n\nMy many pros are as follow;\n\nIf you have played Sanctum, Sanctum 2, Tower Wars, Toy Soldiers, Dungeon Masters, Dungeon Masters II, Sol or Defense Grid 1 or 2, and appreciated any part of them... then this game will Top them All and add a variation of each with a fantastic tutorial!\n\nWell polished, runs smooth, and the shop  and crafting to add an additional twist of genious when it was not needed is really terrific too.\n\nThis game however has had complaints/reviews from the lazy players, who want to path, and sit back and let the towers do all the work. Those are the same persons who probablly write a bad review because they manipulated x, y, or z and beat the game. For those lazy trolls, suck it! You actually have to play, help your towers, earn the win with teamwork in coop of other players or coop of your towers in solo. You get rewarded for the hard work in loot, items, and map advancement but it is not easy.\n\nThe other complaint I have read is that you can not place towers where you please, again, troll babies that cant make all the attackers run up the middle of the map into a line of carnage while they sit back and gripe about the game. Well again, whaaaaaa.... you have to work with your towers or fellow players to achieve a win! Brilliant!\n\nTowers are of plenty and the types you unlock as you play better and master, and the choice is what tower where assits your goal.  Wrong tower, wrong placement, level the wrong one, you may be getting loot and exp all to try again.\n\nNow since the troll babies didnt get a lame game to pick on, here is a third gametype for all you VS(versus) enthusiasts. YES indeed in a very well done VS(versus) in a tower defense game.\nOne attacker, several defenders and outwit and outplay each other. May the best brain and coordination win! A simple and tactical blast! Kind of like Evolve but in tower defense. Just brilliant and so well produced.\n\nThis game is marvelous in how it was done on all aspects. Even the servers are fantastic without a hiccup. I had no idea who the heck these guys were, never played a NeocoreGames title before and I am so glad I reviewed and doubted the reviews to this point of the same crybabies.\n\nIf you do not have this game, it is a solid buy, plain and simple!!\n\nI would rate this tower defense game in my top 3 of all time. Would buy a game produced by NeocoreGames anytime. They released a perfected, enjoyable, challenging masterpiece without any bugs or flaws or lag.\n\n\n\n\nDiscalimer; The Review Crew's evaluations are based on paying close attention to forum response and activity, system demand, fun of the game genre, position of originality in respective genre, growth of the project in its current state at time of review, graphics as a whole for end user, presentation of the game and display, replayability, patch/tweak progress, beginner friendliness & gameplay direcction, content & depth, attention to detail on small things(polish), lag and multiplayer application if applicable, badge card availability, with a minimum 8 hours of gameplay and interaction with customer base after release.

This game is brought to us by Neocore Games, the developers behind the excellent Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, and this just might be the best game that they've made so far.\n\nAt first I thought Deathtrap was just another Van Helsing game with a different name, but as soon as I started the game I saw how wrong I was. This is a true tower defense game that allows us to control our own character too. Before each wave you can run around the map placing all sorts of different traps down to fight off each wave. At first I only had access to a turret and a poison trap that shoots up acid at any enemy that steps on it.\n\nThey didn't do much damage at first, but after I upgraded them I didn't go a match without them. Even when I got to higher tier maps I still found myself going back to my good ole acid trap because it did a ton of damage on my enemies.\n\nIn addition to laying down traps you can also fight alongside them with your character. The three character classes are your basic warrior, mage, and rogue, but they come with vastly different abilities. My personal favorite character is the rogue while the warrior is my least favorite.\n\nOnce you've gotten enough experience points you can level up both your character, and your traps. As you level up new traps will become available for you to try out. Once I got access to a trap that let me make archer units I immediately focused on upgrading them to maximum.\n\nThe gameplay in Deathtrap is nothing short of great. It plays like Van Helsing, but the tower defense elements really stand out and make this game different enough to stand out on it's own.\n\nThe soundtrack is the best I've heard this year; I really love the opening song at the main menu and stage selection screens. I wish there was more though. There are only a few tracks in the game, but they're all easy on the ears.\n\nGraphically this game looks as good as The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing games. Everything is rich with detail. The character animations are solid, but it's nothing spectacular and the voice acting is a bit on the weak side, but who plays a tower defense game for the voice acting.\n\nIf you don't want to play this game alone you don't have to. You can go through the entire game with a friend in cooperative mode or even go head to head in some great pvp action.\n\nIf you're looking for some great gameplay set in the Van Helsing world than look no further than Deathtrap.\n\n\n\nThe Verdict: 8/10\n\n","February 13, 2015","true","27.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Like a Diablo clone / 'Orcs must Die" mashup.\n\nThere are 3 character classes to choose from, each with their own unique skill tree which unlocks as you gain XP. The classes share the same upgradable traps though, which also unlock as you progress.\n\nWhere I found the characters and traps interesting and varied enough, it was a big let down that there is absolutely NO path shaping element in the Tower Defense department. This meant the tactical depth was disappointingly shallow.\n\nThere's no noteworthy story, and the voice acting is fairly mediocre, but the graphics and sound effects are good.\n\nFinishing all the campaign maps on tier 1 can be done fairly quickly, but there are 4 tiers and a "Scenario" and "Endless" gamemode, which give the maps replayability.\n\nBottom line: it's a fairly generic genre mix that works really well, but doesn't bring anything new to the table in either category.\n\n75%","October 19, 2015","true","48.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

You not only build towers and traps to defend your gate, but you also have a hero which you control which makes a tower defense game even more interesting. Deathtrap is playable with friends, but more players are in the party - harder it gets. Basically, there will be more gates releasing more monsters, the starting essence (which you build your towers and traps with) will be split among the players. This game also involves in-game side quests and missions, like if you complete the level without building a certain types of traps and such. You also level up your hero, learn new abilities, traps, skills... get better gear... At the moment the community is small, but we need more players, this game is really grate and deserves more attention.

The game does indeed have a lot to offer, what with sharing your own tower defense maps via the Steam Workshop, multiplayer, endless/scenario modes, multiple classes, upgrading your character's skills, stats, & equipment, and more.  Not all of the above-mentioned features are in place yet, but the game has the potential to be fantastic once it officially launches.  The first three campaign maps are available now (as of 10/22/14) with more to follow down the line.  The combat and overall feel is a bit "Van Helsing-esque", which doesn't surprise me considering Neocore released that particular series.

However there are a few bugs I want fixed Imidiatly.  I wan't to enjoy this game but i want it to work properly before i give it a rating. 1. There is a glitch where if you transfer potions from the in game storage to a charachter's inventory it will crash the game.   2. There is a bug for the mutant worm's where if they knock you down you can get stuck and unable to move at all.   The Crafting system is also bugged 2 of my friends can't get it to work without the game crashing. These Items must be a first Priority on the bug fix list. If These things are fixed quickly i will continue to play. At this time i can't say if i would or would not recomend this game. I Had been Keeping an eye on the patchnotes for deathtrap Since Neocore Games Is not Good about Keeping There games Updated it's Final Verdict time.  My Final Verdict Is That Neocore can't Be trusted. They Make Games that have amazing potential in regards to being a mix between a chalenge and looking fairly odd in general.(This is the Positive note)  Sadly based on my own observations and information from other reviews on other games created by Neocore The Truth is Neocore's ability TO maintain any of there games is the dull edge of a double edged sword. The Sharp Edge Is That there games have amazing potential. I Just Wish that we could see Neocore Make use of that potential or sell The Deathtrap IP to a company that will treat it with more respect then Neocore has. Neocore to me is just anouther wanabe Giant that fell on it's ♥♥♥. Took Some Time But i found Images of the Crash Culprits.1.  http://deathtrap.gamepedia.com/White_Wobbler.   2. http://deathtrap.gamepedia.com/White_Wobbler_(champion). Don't Let them Knock you down. That's when we got stuck in the environment. The Knockdown bug was finaly fixed though it would have been more profesional had Neocore done something about it early on. The Potion Transfer Glitch wich they say is fixed can't be Verified as being fixed at this time. If  Neocore someday Does much better job at making sure there games work properly neer or at release then i might recomend them but not today. I sadly can't objectivly recomend anything made by this company.  To bad to i realy do like there games but Neocore is just varry unprofesional in regards to maitinance and handling inquaries in regards to there games. Sadly both Megapull who is the Neocore Comunity rep outright evades questions and datguy13 although sometimes helpfull is someone who does not seem to be a varry infestigative beta tester.","September 17, 2015","false","241.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

Already runs great in Early Access!\n\n\nI read about this game in a german news-magazine for video games. It sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try. This is my short resumee after playing for roughly 8 hours, so this review is subject to change, just like the game aswell!\n\nGameplay:\nImagine a mixture between classic tower defense games and Diablo. Now imagine only 5% of the loot drops and a lighter character menu. Additionally imagine upgradeable towers, where you first have to unlock these upgrades by spending skill points on them, then you have to buy the upgrades on each map again when placing the tower. There're set places where to build the traps. The gameplay is really well working, insanely fluently and feels great, charging by it this game wouldn't need to call itself "Early Access".\n\nMaps:\nThe maps all look different and you need certain tactics if playing on hard in order to beat them. The variety is not that big at the moment (like 10 maps or so), but there're more to come. Additionally, there's modding!\n\nItems:\nWorks like Diablo, with smaller drop chances. Also, mainly bosses and giant enemies will drop items.\n\nCharacters:\nThere are three different classes, a melee-fighter, a sorceress and an unreleased one. You can only customise them by finding different looking gear.\n\nWhat I didn't check out by now:\n-Modded maps\n-Coop-mode\n-Versus-mode\n\nI hope this short review will help you decide wether to buy Deathtrap or not.","February 3, 2015","true","26.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being a fan of tower defence games, and Games like Sanctum/Sanctum 2, i have to say that this game is right up there with the other games.\n\nGamplay\n8-10\nThe gameply is fun, and addicting, each match can last from 10 minutes to half an hour and probably even longer in the harder levels. the gamplay is quite simple. just defend a portal that leads to the real world. waves of enemy are trying to invade the real world using portals and the only way to stop them is by setting up traps and towers, along with firghting yourself. there are currently 3 classes the sorceress who is able to use magic to defend all incoming lanes at once or is able to quickly take down/defend one lane really quickly, the ranger who uses guns and distance weapons * havn't played much of him yet) and a heavily armoured character(can't remember what class he is and again havn't played him much) Each of these classes have differeent skills that you level as you progress. Deathtrap alos has an rpg element as you can roam around the levels as the defending stage is going on and defeat map bosses and gain keys to chest littered throuout the stage.\n\nGraphics\n7/10\ntruthfully, i enjoy the graphics at first glance i did not, and thought they were not that good, but in game the look decent. it complements the game completely. The blood and effects are all quite nice and allow for the gamplay to look better.\n\nStory\n2/10\nSo far from what i know the story is simplistic in nature. the gist is that you are in these ancient ruins ( or something like that, again i havn't played through the begining cinematic/information more then once) to which the humans defended agains monsters centuries beforehand. and as you are in these ruins the monsters apear again and it is up to you to stop them from reaching the portals. ( again i will probably update this review the more i play)\n\nOverall\n7/10\nSo far it is a brilliant game, i am yet to try the co op experiance but i am sure it will make it even better.","February 5, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've now changed it to thumbs down and not-recommended for one reason only: the devs appear to have a habbit of abandoning their games and leave them buggy. This game is currently unplayable in co-op endless mode, which is the main end-game content. After reaching roughly wave 30, monsters will turn invisible for anyone but the host, making it impossible to continue. Apparently their Van Helsing games suffer from a similar issue as well, proving that they use the same bugged network code for their games.\n\nOther than that, there were also mentioning of additional future content, which I expect we will never see.\n\nI will leave my original review below, but do note that it was written when the game was new and full of promise and before the bug was yet to be discovered. While I do still stand for those words, they don't mean that much when the main end-game content is unplayable in co-op.\n\nINITIAL REVIEW:\n"Diablo meets Orcs Must Die! If you like these games, or if you like action-RPGs and tower defense games, then this game is for you. It offers wide character progression through skill development, trap choices and upgrades. Add to this that you get to gear up your character in true Diablo style along with the possibility of leveling all the way up to level 100. There are lots of scenarios, quests and challenges. For you tower defense-lovers there's also endless modes to be had. Play solo, co-op or versus mode. There's a lot of content offered here! This is literally one of the best games released in years!"","February 9, 2015","false","85.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It gets very repetative, and as you become better at the game, the enemies stay true to themselves and do exactly what they did the first time around (just with more health....) and so it doesn't get anymore challenging. If anything, it gets easier..\n\nWhilst the game has a fairly large quantity of bugs and glitches and errors that cause crashes, I'm VERY surprised the game came out of early access.. I mean, I didn't even know it was out for ages as there was no mention of it from what I remember. Oh well, doesn't change the fact that their own roadmap seems to stop December 2014 and whilst they say in every single post 'more to come, it's early days, work work work', there hasn't been a single update and the game is massively lacking by this point imo.\n\nI loved this game from the second I started playing, but sadly it didn't keep my attention for all too long and it's a shame, as it had everything it needed to go VERY far.. But the devs seem to have not cared and let it die very quickly. 6/10\n\nOriginal review:\n\nGreat game - Lot of fun - Nice graphics and (for me) a perfect mix between Diablo and TD games. Ignore my low hours I have been busy lately most evenings but trust me I cannot wait for the weekend for this game ;)\n\nVisuals - Very smooth! Graphics aren't the best in the world, but it is still very nice regardless and it is early days - Maybe updates/DLC's might provide a little bit more in the future. 9/10 for me.\n\nHUD - Some of the layout of skill tree / trap tree could be a little less 'cluttered'.. Sometimes I'll not know which text box is for which, but that isn't involved in a game so it is hardly noticeable since you spend 1/30th your time there..\n\nSkills and traps look awesome - And there are plenty of them too. Its a great blend of an RPG with TD - You get the character and customisation feel for you plus the TD asspects with all those traps (18 I think) but who knows as I said it is early and more may come :D\n\nOverall for this (quick andm essy review - Sorry) 9/10 for me!","February 19, 2015","false","50.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is more like a mix between Defence Grid and Diablo.\n\nWhereas Orcs Must Die 1 & 2 are fast, colourful games that give you a lot of freedom and choice in traps and placement,  this is not the case in Deathtrap.   This game lacks flexibility in both where you can place traps and what kind of traps can be placed, which makes this game even more restricted than Defence Grid.    The text is very small, so those playing on their TVs, watch out for that.   In one map, there is some kind of  temple, and the text is so small that even though I stood right in front of my HDTV, I still couldn't read the text so as to figure out what the temple was for.   Probably better to play this sitting at a monitor.   I wish game makers would always provide an option to increase text size.   The game is also quite slow and you can't run around fast, but they do provide portlals to help you get around.\n\nThe game does have depth to it - it's kind of like Diablo, with a screen where you equip armor, rings, amulets, weapons, upgrade skills - that part is interesting.\n\nBut if you are expecting the pace and feel of Orcs Must Die - look elsewhere.  Big BIG difference between the two games.   Watch youtube videos of this game first to get an idea of what you are getting.\n\nThe levels are also static, in that you can't rotate or move the level around.  Finally, the  graphics are not sharp, rather dark and lack-lustre - this is not a bright, colourful and vivid game like Orcs Must Die at all.\n\nThis is not necessarily a bad game, it is just really not my type of Tower Defence game.   Still, some people may really enjoy the game for the Diablo-like aspect of it.","August 15, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm suprised i haven't heard from this game before. Been playing for almost 3 hours and i like it. Runs smooth on stable 60 FPS (you can cap it to 30 if you want).\n\nYou can select three different classes :\n\n*Warrior: A tank-type hero class, tailored for fighting in close quarters.\n*Sorceress: The anti-thesis of the Warrior, designed for long range fighting using a variety of spells and debuffs.\n*Marksman: A ranged fighter, designed for direct damage dealing and amplifying trap effects.\n\nI went Sorceress for my first runthrough cause i like to attack from far since i'm a coward :). Needed to get used to the controls a bit and had to remap some keys (changed moving to WSAD, orginal were the arrow keys, also build is middle mousebutton, changed to mouse 4).\n\nGameplay feels nice, just like Diablo,Torchlight, etc.There are alot of upgrade options and you can find new items.\n\n+Good idea to combine hack and slash with towerdefence. You can decide to lay back so the towers can do their work or kill enemies yourself\n+Has co-op with a max of 4 players and PVP mode (haven't tried this yet because it seems multiplayer is dead?)\n+Traps that have spikes (maybe even better then tesla towers, wich are also in this game......)\n+When enemies get to into the gate you see a nice skull, so you know you f* up :)\n+leveling system, items and equiping your char.\n+Satisfying chopping action and the evil laugh it brings (yes i know i have issues :) )\n\n-Stats, if you are a stat lover you spend to much time comparing and analyzing. If multiplayer works  i will probably get kicked for idle to long.\n-Crosshair?/cursor is maybe a bit to small when your screen is filled with demons. For me i noticed that i misclicked and instead of action i just walk into the enemy.\n-Spike trap maybe better the teslatower from ARM, resulting in a new fetish.\n\nTL:DR : If you like hack and slash and towerdefence then buy this game.\n\n8.5/10\n","May 7","true","60.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The invented new traps, but they made it "serious". While giving the traps in VH ironic names like Flame-O-Thrower, they just named them Gun Sentry etc. Kinda miss that.

If you liked those you probably played them both until you were completely sick of them, and seeing as how this is just those two put together and nothing else, I was completely sick of it 40 minutes in.\nAs either an A-RPG or a Tower Defense alone, it might be kind of weak in terms of content. It passes for an average game, just with a bunch of gameplay that I've already done, and don't need to do again. I'd probably still be playing Torchlight or a better TD if I still wanted to play those. Not quite feeling like the whole is even the sum of its parts.\n\nTD shortcomings:\nNo mazing/path control, preset tower locations, preset tower types at those locations. Game camera is focused on your hero so you don't know what's happening, minimap displays enemies but not their health, and only zooms out so far. You can only build/upgrade towers if they're in view. Hero doesn't attack automatically. The same boring between-stages tower upgrading you'd find in any flash tower defense game, getting a few upgrade points per stage completed depending on difficulty selection and how many guys touched the goal.\nThe same old TD formula, have your AoE, your DoT, slow, freeze, long range, rapid fire, etc etc\nSame old TD enemies, small quick packs, beefy large single enemies, armored ones, guys that warp, fight back against your hero...\n\nA-RPG shortcomings:\nCharacter classes are too similar. Gear variety is utterly tiny. Skill tree, gear comparison, joke of a crafting system, all just feels like added chores. Merchant is mostly useless and just there as a formality of RPGs, gold is mainly to limit your available number of skill resets. Picking up loot by clicking on it, when it only drops once at the end of a stage, feels like it's just there to mimic A-RPGs, not be an A-RPG. A plot I don't care about, art and characters with no charm, annoying voice acting making weak attempts at humor. Generic "fantasy setting" music.\n\nOf the two the TD side of it is stronger, but there are games that do either genre far better.\n\nAbout gamepad support:\nHave a logitech gamepad, button layout for menus is awkward but navigable. In gameplay, there's a clear fault - you can only build a tower at a location your character is standing next to, with no button to cycle through available locations. With a mouse the building restriction is anything you can put in the game's isometric camera view, and even if I take a hand off the controller and grab the mouse, I discover the game disabled the cursor for me. This is an issue because normally, a tower can be built at a remote location during combat, that you can see but can't easily reach, giving gamepad play a significant strategic disadvantage. Also, because the cursor is turned off, all menus MUST be navigated with controller. This includes things like equipping gear that become a multi-step process for a simple drag and drop. The only way to switch between cursor and keyboard/mouse is with a checkbox in options and relaunching the game.","May 9, 2015","false","17.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Overall game-play is very enjoyable in single player. The campaign fits with what backstory there is and the overall atmosphere does have an appeal. The primary downside is the network/matchmaking code.\n\nThere are several instances with failures to route and failures to resolve (the match making server). Thus far I have experienced a 100% failure rate either as host or joining a game--where in at least one, if not more parties, could not sync and get in game.\n\nThis is not a UDP porting issue (although it could be for some individuals). I, and others, have tried various firewall settings and permission changes without success. While several people do seem to be able to enjoy CO-OP (I've not tried vs mode yet) there are far too many people experiencing issues in multiplayer for "everyone" to have UDP issues locally.\n\nAs it stands:\nDeathtrap is very enjoyable as a single player game.\nMultiplayer is not viable/stable and thus unplayable.\n\nRecommended for single-player only--otherwise this is "coasterware".","May 7","true","16.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Deathtrap is becoming a beautiful little TD game, however some of my gripes still exist, most notably of which is the clunky and slow combat. tooltips and trap/skill explanations are missleading at times and lacking real detail. Crafting....seems pretty pointless well see at higher levels, my complaints are just that, mine. Deathtrap is a solid game at its core, and while I believe it still needs work I can say that it is now worth your time and money.\n\n-Leaving my old opnion here-\n\n*Got the game and I enjoy it, however pretty much every feature listed on the store page is non existant, and the videos clearly show content that isnt in the build we have. Game shows promise but I dont currently recomend it.\n\nTo ELABORATE:\n\nNo i dont recomend the game in its current state for the price they are asking. Yes I did buy it. Why? Because I have faith that the devs will make it worth it, and i love TD games in general. I'll endorse the game once you can craft, progress past lvl 11, play more official maps, get all your traps/skills, play multiplayer without hassle, make combat less clunky, fix passive traits, clarify tooltips, add tooltips, open up the 3rd class, add quests, fix the currently broken traps, I could go on but theres no point. The devs know what they need to do. But till then, in my opnion its not worth the price tag.*","October 27, 2014","true","91.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","8"

It has everything you would expect from a tower defence game, but the inclusion of action and role-playing elements make this game a truly exciting piece of work. Despite it still being in Early Access, it is surprising how polished the game is so far. Admittedly, the graphics are not too flash, but this is easily overlooked as you dive in to the gameplay. Each level provides you with a new challenge, which you can take on by yourself or with a friend. The Map Editor is really the cherry on top for this game, allowing players to design their own levels in entirety. There is still some work to be done for Neocore Games, but every gamer has something to look forward to when this game is fully developed.\n\nSee the full preview at Noobfeed.com: http://www.noobfeed.com/previews/309/deathtrap","November 28, 2014","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, if you like TD games like Dungeon Defender, GemCraft and ARPGs like Diablo/TorchLight/Path of Exile/Din's Curse kinda games.\n\nThe Good\n\nI am writing this review after 8 hours of play time. While it only took me this long to beat the base game with a single character; I can already see the game lasting quite a few more hours. I'm only level 22 and scenarios, endless and tier 2 only just opened up.\n\nI have played all kind of Tower Defense games before and I put this one among the better ones. The ARPG side of it is not something to ignore either, but don't expect a POE/Diablo/Torchlight/etc quality/quantity in that section. Looting so far hasn't really changed my gaming much, but from what I understand that comes into play later on (lvl 55).\n\nAnd To balance the review a bit: The Bad\n\nI have to admit that few of the trap placement in the map did not really make much sense to me. I found myself only building there because I had nothing better to do. Initially I wanted to go only mechanical traps - because I was playing the mercenary and found it matching -, I quickly found it it is not a viable option.\n","June 18, 2015","true","50.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magusx777/recommended/310510/","magusx777","[KoS]DarkProphet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magusx777/","568 products in account","I was about to name this game the greatest tower defense game of all time, until I hit the Tier 3 version of the fourth level, Bottomless Pit. That means I've played through all the main maps twice and was on my third run through when I hit this shame of a level. This game was an enjoyable and often challenging experience. Losing was irritating but there was something I could tweak just a little in my tower layout or even my character's skills to make it all work out.\n\nThen came the aforementioned level. In it, you start with virtually no building resources, and they put large enemies with tons of HP close to small enemies. Any time you hit the big enemies, they put a shield on the small enemies. The best part? The SHIELD STACKS. When you have damage resistant small lizard enemies you have something like 80% damage reduction and already take a while to kill, having multiple shields on top of these enemies makes them virtually impossible to kill before they get to your core and you lose lives. This is on the first of four waves.\n\nI've watched a Youtube video and read a lengthy Steam forum debate about this level. It appears that you cannot beat it with the Sorceress unless you use a specific skill and trap (Essence Trap and some essence-boosting time-based spell you cast on a single gun tower). This goes against the principles of the game before this level, which is the 60-something hours I put into it before then, completing every main level on the highest difficulty and all the side quests up to this point, so I have a pretty good understanding of what this game was all about until this level ruined the game for me. I even grinded myself up from level 39 to level 44 by playing endless for several hours then tried using the setup the Youtube video used by wasting a lot of my hard-earned gold to respec, but did even worse than before. The Youtube video doesn't show the player's level, though he claims to be level 50 or so in the description. I doubt his level was that low, as he never actually showed his character screen in the video and did tons of damage without traps most of the time.\n\nAlso, this is not something the developer is likely going to patch because one of their representatives dismissively replied to someone's forum post 3.5 months before I'm posting this review, stating their tester had played through all the levels on all the tiers and difficulties with all the classes. So obviously, because -someone- can beat it, there's nothing wrong with it. There are people who can do a lot of things you cannot and never will be able to. The difficulty spiked up astronomically, people pointed it out, and because some folks are able to beat it as a Sorceress, it's allegedly fine as is. This level is not fun and it has blocked my progress. There is no legitimate reason for me to be giving it all I've got for several hours, brainstorming about the level, using an overpowered character, trying to mimic someone on Youtube doing it, and still failing on an epic scale despite having aced every main level before it.\n\nI have gone from loving this game to obsessively angered at the thought of it. I suspect preventing the stacking of shields on the armored enemies would turn this level into a challenge rather than a brutal beating of the player, but with the developer's disinterest in making the game fun and well-balanced on this level, I am left disgusted with their attitude.  All the TLC that went into the many levels before it ceases to exist on this level. Of course, why should the developer care? Players who got this far will say they had "enough fun" earlier in the game and give it a positive review, while those who only played it a little and reviewed it, will be giving a false impression of the game based on their lack of knowledge of this travesty of a level. They have their money and they've indicated the level is fine since their tester beat it. Nothing else matters to them but profits and positive reviews which perpetuate further profits.\n\nThe developer could insult my intelligence or (lack of) skills in primitive or eloquent fashion, or offer "advice" as they did on the forum which I used and which did not help at all, or they could even go the good PR route and apologize for me not enjoying the level, but none of these are a solution to rectifying the legitimate problems with the level itself. This was almost a great game, but this level has made me wish I never played it at all.","May 24, 2015","false","198.7"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

Annoying because I love RPG's, and I love Tower Defense games, but it's just too unpolished still which makes playing it (especially with a gamepad) a frustrating experience. Some of the issues that need to be addressed:     The controller experience is absolutely terrible, especially when navigating various UI screens. The icon that tells you what to press is too small, doesn't stand out enough, and is never in a consistent location which means you end up hunting to find the button that you're meant to press.\nThe UI in general is pretty bad, with dialogs and detail popups frequently covering other controls or even in some instances important things like tower range rings.\nThere's no way to exit back to the map, so you have to force quit the game if you accidentally select the wrong level.Seriously, it's so bad that it should basically be redesigned from the ground up... if any UI design conventions were followed, they were all the wrong ones. Neocore, do yourselves a favour and hire a User Experience Designer (or if you've already got one, a new one that actually knows what they're doing / doesn't drink heavily on the job).","February 6, 2015","false","2.0"," 13 of 47 people (28%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","28","13","47","6","7"

The problem, however, is that its leveling goals are so lofty that each individual powerup you place doesn't feel all  that useful.  The biggest issue, though, by far is the controls.  The keyboard controls involve, what I suspect, is having 3 hands.  While you can rebind the keys it doesn't feel much better.  By default movement is the arrow keys and skills are the number keys, and, strange enough, some are bound to the mouse as well.  The controler buttons are not spelled out in the tutorials at all, so it took me a hell of a long time to figure out which gamepad control did what when navigating the menus, not everything is selectable via the joystick, but rather a combination of left and right bumpers and triggers both, a very odd setup to be sure.  Now, when you get all of that down, the targeting is even still much worse.  The melee fighter isn't so bad, but the mage has a hell of a time facing the way you want her to, and her lightning spell, which eminates out towards her facing and hits multiple targets, tends to be ever so slightly off center and instead of getting a whole group, you wind up hitting just a couple monsters.  Her tower buff spell, as well, seems to activate on nothing at all, and feels wasted, or it will activate on a tower i didn't think I had selected (selection happening by running near the towers).","February 5, 2015","false","3.0"," 7 of 37 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","7","37","0","3"

Lots of fun and replayability. Easy multiplayer options if you want to play with your friends. Not much of a story here, but gameplay makes up for it. 8/10\n\nI'm not going to lie, I never heard of this game until I got a coupon for it. Let me tell you though, as a fan of Dungeon Defenders and Diablo, this game surprised me with how addictingly fun it can be.\n\nYou start out being able to pick between 3 different classes, each with their own unique set of skills that you can spend skill points into and build in whatever way you want, although there are some skills that are shared between the classes or some that are similar with slightly different tweaks. You unlock tier 2 and 3 skill trees at levels 10 and 20 to further your customization as well. You earn 3 skill points per level and each skill caps at 10.\n\nThen you also of course get your traps that you get to setup throughout the level (Although my only complaint is that you can't build them anywhere, each map gives you certain points that you must build from). There are 4 different categories of traps and 4 tiers of each category that you have to hit certain benchmarks in your games to unlock (For example: Kill 500 enemies with nontraps). The only way to get more "Research points" to level up your traps is to get high star ratings in each level or completing side-quests.\n\nThe "Campaign" doesn't really have a story, although they do give you a little something to work with as to why your characters are building defenses and protecting their base. Once you get through all the levels, the game does unlock some additional maps that you can play on as well, I think even 1 or 2 of them are community creations that made it into the game. You also can go back through each level and play the "Tier 2" version of the map, kind of like a "New Game +" but you can still play the easy version of the maps. You can do this until you get to "Tier 4", which is nice because the monsters in the campaign mode don't scale with your level.\n\nOnce you hit level 20 though, the game unlocks "Scenario mode" and "Endless mode" for each map. "Scenario mode" is really cool, the mobs scale with your level so you will always get loot for your level at the end. What makes this mode cool though is you get 3 categories to increase Either your Gold Find, Magic Find, or EXP gain by making the level slightly harder. Then of course "Endless mode" is exactly what you would think it is, endless waves of increasingly difficult enemies. Easy way to power level if you do well, but since you only get Research Points for your traps by doing campaign, its not something thats just OP. Although having a level 60 character in maps with level 20-30 monsters makes it to where you can rely on your character alot more than your traps.","April 11, 2015","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I said the buy was worth it to me but may not be worth it to other people yet. In short, it's now worth it. This is the updated review.\n\nIf you played Van Helsing, you're probably aware of the base defense quests. They felt forced in, and broke up the flow of the game. Here, that kind of thing is the whole game, and it stands pretty well on its own. They kept the gear and skill systems from VH, but made the skills focus on traps and towers rather than making the player character into a death machine them self.\n\nYou can still be a death machine though. You probably won't get far completely ignoring towers, but a few well placed skill points will make you more powerful than any tower you can build. You can lock down one path on a map with towers, then go murder everything on another path yourself, if you wish.\n\nThe game itself has personality. The voiceovers have emotion, the music is catchy and really presents a feeling of urgency to the battle ahead, and the battlefields feel like blighted woods, ancient ruins, and hidden machinations of lost technology. It all blends very well together to create a world you can just dive into.\n\nThere's a ton of replay value, as you'd expect in a game combining RPG and TD elements. There's 13 "Campaign" maps that form the core storyline, with three difficulty levels, most of them also containing a side-quest to go for during the chaos, then four "Tiers" that unlock as you complete the story. Tier IV Hard on these maps will require a fully geared character and a ton of skill.\n\nOn top of the Campaign, there's several maps that unlock after you beat the game that are designed for Scenario mode. Scenario mode allows you to take on certain debuffs in exchange for more rewards. You can play Scenario Mode on the Campaign maps too. And finaly there's Endless Mode, which is what it says on the tin.\n\nOn top of all of that, you get the Workship/map-editor, coop mode, a PvP versus mode... the game is quite huge. My one complaint of it all is the gameplay can get kind of samey and grinding once you've finished the Campaign, but I'm the kind of person who enjoys building up a character and getting to ridiculously high waves in endless TD games, so this one is right up my alley.","December 30, 2014","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The growth of the character is comfortable and fun, allowing one to upgrade character skills/abilities and towers (unlocking new towers, improving passively, unlocking tiers, etc.) My favorite thing about Deathtrap's gameplay is the improvement noticed in the maps after applying skill points - the whole process is very rewarding\n\nCo-op is good and regardless of the mode played in the items dropped/found encourage one to keep progressing.\n\nI sincerly hope the developers continue to improve and expand because I love RPGs and I love tower defenses; but we are blessed to have what we have with Deathtrap.\n\nThank you.","February 14, 2015","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And so far I have only played one of the three character classes...\nEach Trap (=towers) has 5 different attributes that can be leveld up, so you have to specialize on something. Theres probably a lot of replayability, especially with the co-op multiplayer part, I havent even tried yet.\nThe only initial disappointment for me was, that you cannot freely place any trap anywhere. There are fixed positions on which you can place a certain class of trap, and you cannot block paths of the monsters. However, it turned out to be a very good design choice, it makes the game more fluid than this endless boring maze building that you have in almost every tower defense game.\nI rarely review a game so early, but even though I've seen only a fraction of the content yet, it was already worth every cent.\n\nEDIT after >50 h gametime:  Still hooked by this game. Probably the best co-op mode of any tower defense out there!  A few things still need to be balanced, but overall the game is huuge.

I was lead to believe that this was going to be more like the dungen maps where you fight the waves for 3-6 rounds of that series and is some what? You do not get to choose casual in all of the tiers to complete the game on that level of play. If you like demanding challenges, serious thinking and planning this may be the game for you,  You do not gain XP per kill just when you finish the map and the maps are farmable after they have been completed. So if you like seriously hard games this is probably for you.\n\nUpdate to this review:\nI have made it past level 33 and progressed to level 89 by doing the Never Ending mode. It is getting better as I learn more about the skills and trap setups and plan how to implement both together on the maps. This does require going into the map and seeing what the layout is and then exiting to reset some options on my trap and skill trees. I do recomend this game, but if your not a tower defense person and do not have any clues as to how they work, "Get some help before you buy and are disapointed".","February 21, 2015","true","300.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Variations include different spawn points for mobs, different routes, different tower spots, different neutral towers etc. As of this review I'm on the 2nd "wave" of replaying it, and apart from the level look, everything is different, including the way needed to beat it.\n\nRegarding towers, there's 25 of them, and the final 5 are quite hard to unlock, you will get a good challenge.\n\nThe RPG element is also very nice, you got 2 different kinds of points, one for your traps (aka towers) and one for your character. Every battle won awards you with both kinds. You get item drops with a (seemingly) random item generator, rare items, a shop available, and even crafting!\n\nOn a side note, I actually enjoyed playing the game with my XBOne gamepad. Classic keyboard and mouse is also fine as well, but the fact that you control a character makes it good fun with the gamepad as well.\n\nOh, and absolutely ZERO microtransactions. Nothing, nada.\n\nGJ devs, count me in for the next one too.\n\n","May 10, 2015","true","44.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a tower defense addict and this game is on the top for me.\n\nThe plus :\n- The game doesn't hold your hand too much, yet mechanics are very clear.\n- A lot of freedom how to approach the game, especially after the initial levels. You can spend skill point and trap points to suit your style of play.\n- You won't finish the game fast, the game has 3 classes, the 13 levels have 4 tiers, customisable scenario modes and endless mode and there are some additional separate scenarios as well when you finish the game on tier 1. And if you still can't get enough you can make your own levels or download some from the steam workshop.\n- The loot and craft system add another layer on top of everything.\n- You can play the game at three speeds (50%, 100% and 200%) to save time or get through harder parts easier.\n- The battle music is awesome and intense.\n- Level design is really good, the levels feels very balanced.\n\nThe minus :\n- Although the music is awesome there is only one track for menu and one for battle.\n- There are three difficulties but you actually need to play on hard if you want 3 stars, that renders the difficulty levels and stars system kind of redundant. The game feels like it needs to be played on hard. Normal is pretty easy, especially if you are used playing ARPG's.\n- 'Sidequests' are pretty mandatory because you get a lot of trap points from them which you will need, and in many cases they feel like a waste of time. This is a pretty minor complaint though, some of the sidequests are a good learning experience.\n\nConclusion :\nThis game is very well put together, both tower defense and APRG fans will find very big value for money in this game. It's the best Neocore game in my humble opinion.","June 10, 2015","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are fixed positions on which you can place a certain class of trap, and you cannot block paths of the monsters.

The gaming looks promising though.\n\n------ EDIT -----\nI got the game working thanks to the helpful comments, even a guy from their team helped out, thanks guys. So I got to play the game, and I must admit it's absolutely amazing! I would categorise it as a Tower Defense game with a Diablo twist - and I really enjoy it. The campaign is cool, I love the way you level up like a RPG and also the skill system is cool. I haven't played the original game, where TD was a mini-game as I understand, so I have nothing to compare with, but I really like it. I'm not much off a reader, as I work as a dev, and would like my brain to rest when I'm playing games. Some voices could be added to read the long texts or some TL;DR for the sake of laziness. I've played 16 hours in 2 days. Almost got addicted, so I can easily recommend this if you are a tower defense lover.","February 4, 2015","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","7"

It is easy to learn and you really only have to use 4-5 buttons/keys.\n\n+ easy to learn\n+ replayable across the tiers\n+ loot is always fun\n+ plenty of gibs\n+ game speed variables\n+ crafting (but is boring after a while)\n+ Neocore are responding to feedback via the forums\n\n- bugs, still early in its release but a few bugs make you stop enjoying the game\n- used a controller and also keyboard/mouse, controller is pretty buggy i found so stick with keyboard/mouse\n- most loot is useless\n- Merc is OP but easy to use, marksman is weak until Lv35+\n\nNotes on traps\n- there are plenty to pick from and tweak, so that is good, but you tend to stick with a key few traps/mods\n- some levels have special traps that only availalbe on a specific map, they are often pretty funny and enjoable, but not available always :(\n\nOVERALL\nDeathtrap is a good game but still has bugs that prevent it from being reliable and very enjoyable\nScore: 7/10 - fix  a few bugs then i think 8-8.5/10\n\nPW","February 18, 2015","true","143.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is as if someone made diablo into a tower defense and did it well.\nThree classes to choose from but with the unlockable abilities it can make many unique playstyles. The merc will probably be the easiest to start off with as you can jump into any fight. Otherwise for the marksman and sorceress, the shift key will be your friend. I do not know what the multiplayer is like, but the two current types look very interesting. The traps are very unique so finding the right combination for the right round may be a challenge, but you can see where things will spawn. It is not usually too difficult as trial and error or too grinding for better gear. The unlocking of new abilities and traps is actually interesting especially testing them out and getting a feel for them. The trap tier unlocks feel a little strange though, but it is not that big of an issue.\n\nThis game could use some work. Not saying it is bad, but it could be better. Especially the higher tiers and levels where the game just starts getting ridiculous with trying to find new ways to become harder. Not always, but sometimes it feels quite cheap when an enemy decides to change its behavior and slowly walk to the goal ignoring you despite having taken out three or four before it and all of them before it. Tier 1 on hard for the last level is a pain especially with the possibility of crashing once the boss does a time distort when you nearly defeat it. For me having started going hard only since halfway through tier 1 makes it a fair challenge. The side quests are interesting and challenging especially with a tank character on a quest to not do any damage at all with your character. Those are fine. This game is really worth it, but another thing that can make your game crash are those flashing red pathways and those annoying overhead objects. The overhead objects also feel like a bit much because no one wants an archway to flash on your screen.\nSo three things that could make this game better are:\nMake it so the game does not crash as easily,\nan option to turn off those overhead objects and flashing pathways (or at least a more optimal alternative),\nand keeping the enemy behavior consistent based on what it is. Otherwise the player will be confused why the fourth slicer decided to just keep walking through the player. Unless this is super-next-gen and he saw what happened to his friends and tried something new.\n","September 16, 2015","true","71.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not bad you say? It is not bad at all, but it could have been so much better with a single little feature. More later.\n\nThe optic of the game is nothing new to you if you know a Van Helsing game. It's the same engine and is absolutely enough for a Tower Defense game.\n\nAs is the sound. Played Van Helsing? Most likely you've heard it all.\n\nThe gameplay? An improved version of the Tower Defense in VH1+VH2. You place your traps, you start the waves, and if you're good you win and get gold, items and two kinds of experience points. One to upgrade your trap designs, and one  to upgrade your character. The character is similar to a hack&slay character of other games including VH1+2, but a bit dumped down. There is not that much customization: a Merchant will always be a melee fighter and a Sorceress will always hurl spells from far away.\n\nWhen you win, you get a chest with items. Here is where the games starts to get a bit boring: I expected that every enemy has a chance to drop loot, but they don't.

No items, no experience points, no gold, no trap upgrade points. Zero, nothing.\n\nThe explanation of the devs: there is a ranked ladder, and with custom maps one could make a farming map, getting stronger and with better items and so climb the ladder without afford. Oooook. And that's from the same Devs that did not even wipe the ladder since Alpha phase when custom maps still gave full loot. And when several other cheats were still possible. It would have been sooooo easy: you could have marked your character as "non-ranked" and have fun with full loot custom maps together with your buddys. If you want to cheat and wade in tons of loot, just do so. You only cheat yourself with making your own game boring.\n\nI have bought this game especially because of the custom maps, and with no word the devs said that these custom maps would just be a major time sink without reward. There would have been a huge community, sharing via Steam Workshop and giving hundreds of new maps each month. As it is now, I can sink huge times into a custom map and my character does not improve the slighest little bit. That's if I played Diablo 3 with disabled loot and experience gain.\n\nSo would I recommend this game? Yes I would. But the word "failed opportunity" would always be inside this recommendation.","August 16, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now it sounds like i may be slamming this game but i actually really enjoyed it, its more like a Diablo Defense Game, the RPG side is heavily diablo based (or its derivatives) but it works, its not bloated, its smooth, and while its not the most amazing graphics its pleasing to the eye and doesnt drop framerate (at least not on my rig).\n\nEssentially, its Diablo Defense with elements of strategy, I havent tried it CO-OP yet but the custom map builder and scenarios add quite a bit of time to this game.\n\nI picked it up on sale for 8 quid (GBP for you non brits). And to be honest i would of been happy paying the full 15. If you liked diablo and fancy something that isnt too taxing but a fair bit of fun definitely give this a look.","August 15, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a shame there isn't a larger player base because surprisingly the multiplayer ACTUALLY WORKS.  It's sad this is a surprise these days, but many multiplayer systems, especially those that attempt to integrate with steam seem to be very clunky and operate spotty at best.  Here you have a great example of a simple, effective group system.  Nothing super innovative in the actual gameplay just a good combination of static pathed tower defense with third person wave killing.  Feels very similar to playing Smite.  The fact that the mobs will move out of path and chase you down for a period is an interesting addition.
