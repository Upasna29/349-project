I'm not even sure how to review this without being impolite.  Please, if you're going to drop an obviously rpg-maker-esque game, SPELL CHECK YOUR DIALOGUE.\n\nI can move past the low-quality copy-paste images for "monsters", even the forced story without any real build-up, but obvious grammar mistakes and forgetting to end a sentence... That is too far.\n\nYou have to make me want to love the main character, or even hate him.  I don't care, just make me feel something instead of spacing through long dialogues.  I'm sorry, but after 30 minutes of gameplay I did not enjoy it for a moment, and I will be requesting a refund.  I'll happily give more critiques, and I really don't mean to come off like a troll, but this game really needs to be reviewed.  It's hardly playable.  I'll even re-purchase it again if I hear about updates.\n\nSorry.\nFuzzyPanda","July 30, 2015","false","0.7"," 161 of 190 people (85%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","85","161","190","17","8"

Unfortunately I bought it without seeing the reviews, and I was in for one hell of a disappointment. After about 30 minutes of playing it I could not bring myself to continue, the whole game is just... ugly. The art is shoddy, almost Deviantart levels of bad. Battles take forever to finish, the battle sprites are animated poorly, and enemy sprites look like they are just straight up ripped from other sources. The story is not well written, I do not feel any sense of attachment to these characters and the numerous amounts of typos does not help. Although it is a minor gripe, the control scheme is very counterintuitive. (X is cancel/menu and C is confirm) When walking around your character travels at an insanely fast pace, making it hard to travel through narrow areas. When you're trying to progress to the next area or travel through a dungeon the area transitions are very specific and can even completely hide from view, in the case of the first dungeon. I'm so done with this game, I'm definitely getting my refund on this garbage game, good riddance.","October 15, 2015","false","0.6"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","0"

He still gets hired for jobs though, and this one should be simple, or so you would think. A simple escort mission for the church soon turns into something bigger - something that affects the whole world.\n\nFated Souls suffers from numerous issues. There's a lot of slow backtracking in the game, which isn't made much better by the fact you get initially teased with fantastic movement speed. This backtracking involves a lot of not knowing where you actually need to go, so what you're really doing is playing "where in the world is the right NPC to talk to". This is made even worse by the fact battles progress incredibly slowly. Learn to use and abuse magic - it's a major saviour.\n\nIt's incredibly hard for me to recommend this game unless you're ready for a lot of headaches.","August 22, 2015","false","18.2"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","23","33","2","0"

This game is NOT worth that much by any means. There is simply not enough good qualities here to make this game worth that price.\nI've also discovered that some Steam Achievements do NOT work in this game for those who care.\n\nPros:\n-Good battle system\n-Player characters are animated (I don't see this in RPG Maker games very often)\n-Decent music and sound effects\n\nThere is simply not enough here to make me want to keep spending my time playing. Everything about this game is just so generic, and there are too many spelling and grammarical errors to take the attempt at good writing here seriously. I found the story very unusual, and the characters were very strange. The main character was a very moody childish person. I found it unappealing.\nTravelling from town to town through maze-like forests got very boring eventually, especially once I realized that this was the main path of progression in this game. It just felt so boring and generic.\nThe interface is very bland. The artwork is terrible. The portraits of the characters don't match the in game sprites and one of the characters portrait is zoomed in way more that the rest of them and it just looks bad.\nFor some reason, your main character walks around at lighting speed during the first hour or so of the game. No, there is no Walk/Run button or game setting. The walking speed than changes later in the game automatically to something more tolerable.\nI found this made no sense and was a very memorable negative about the game design.\nNo attempt was made here to make this game stand out as exciting or impressive.\nI think the issue here is that this is the first game this developer made, and Vagrant Hearts is proof he got better at this, but this game has no buisness being priced the way it is.\nI guess I just expect a lot more out of a game released within the last couple years, since everyone else is doing much better things with the engine.\nThere is no excuse for the bad spelling and grammer, and broken achievements. It's 2016, let's act like it.\n\nMAYBE, get this game if you have nothing else better to play, and you can get it for a low price, otherwise don't waste your time.There are plenty of better RPGs on Steam with lower or equal prices tags than this.\n\nSkip this game, you're not missing anything.","March 12","false","9.8"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

The main protagonist of the game is "Gauly" a unlikely hero (more an typical antihero) who is hunted, abused and... well you'll see when you play the game. Though the game doesn't look like much, it's a lot of gametime involved - the story will develop during the game and will take twists and turns. Some things have to be taken with care, though, there are some inconsistencies around.\n\nLeveling: Ø Standardized RPGMaker Routines, nothing special, nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nImmersion: + The game has surprised me, once I started it, I couldn't put it aside. Yes I know, it's a cheap RPGMaker game. But well, try it yourself, and play it through... the story has it's flaws as I stated. Positive is, that the game actually draws you into it's plot.\n\nOverall Rating: 2+ The game isn't too bad, but it isn't special too. The story works fine for this game, so it might be worth a try. Spellchecking would also be a nice addition, before it got released.\n\nValue for Money: Low at 9,99 Bucks The game has some more hours of playtime! But that isn't sufficient enough because most of it is grinding experience Levels with the most officious monsters possible at given level. The Balancing though is ok, and the game had no crashes, or gamebreaking bugs during play.\n\nRecommended for JRPG, RPGMaker and storyline afficionados\nThe game is a bit expensive to give it a full recommendation, plus it's quite standard RPG-Maker stuff. If you get it on a cheap sale, or somewhere else give it a try...\n\nIf you are not a fan of RPG (especially JRPG's) or long grinding hours, don't buy this game.","April 26","true","37.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Simple enough, but, of course, obstacles of all sorts present themselves in this quick moving and absorbing story of a man (Gauly) who is tormented by his inner conflicts and past history as a mercenary.\nAs the trio move across the world, there are many characters, situations, monsters, and "anomalies" ---- boss fights ---- that have to be dealt with along with a lot of exploration and things to discover that will keep you alert and interested in this nicely told story.\n\nCharacter development gets high marks in this game ---- each of the main protagonists slowly reveal their true selves and their motivations as you get further into the tale. Gauly especially is believable and interesting.\n\nHigh marks go to the music in the game, which sometimes adds to the suspenseful atmosphere, and sometimes offers relief in the form of light and catchy tunes ---- but is never overpowering.\n\nArtwork is very good, particularly in the battle scenes. And the world itself is bright and colorful while caves, gloomy forests, etc. are presented in good detail.\n\nThe game offers a bit higher challenge in the beginning than most, but once you get the feel of how to battle and use magic the balance is just fine for moving along easily.\n\nIt's a classic 16-bit style rpg that is exciting and smoothly paced, and I'm glad it has arrived on Steam. I hope the sequel comes along soon.\n","August 3, 2015","true","6.4"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","15","32","0","1"

They're not the typical heroes.\n+ Smooth gameplay. The fast movement also adds to this.\n+ I liked the story.\n+ Fairly big dungeons with lot of optional stuff.\n\ncons:\n- Battles are quite repetitive and don't require much strategy.\n- I missed a quest log. Sometimes it's a bit confusing remembering what to do.\n\nFated Souls is not perfect, but I liked the story and the characters. And the game plays easily, I rarely got stuck. Somehow it felt smooth and enjoyable. Since the dialogues have been fixed, I can recommend it.
