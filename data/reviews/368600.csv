In many ways, considering its age and amount of depth it offers, Terra Nova is a surprisingly accessible game.\n\nWhile player is quite limited during the early mission, later on you'll have a choice between multiple power armors and a large array of weapons and equipment. Depending on mission, you'll either go in solo, or command varying number of squadmates. Tactical component offers sufficient amount of depth, with great array of commands that can be issued to your squadmates.\n\nWhere Terra Nova relly shines is design and variety of missions themselves. Mission objectives are extremely varied (not to mention that player will often be presented with optional secondary objectives), as are locations they're set in. You'll fight on multiple planets, in environments ranging from hills & forests, trough deserts and mountains, to barren and ominous wastelands.\nMissions are all set in sprawling open areas. That, combined with solid amount of customisation, means there is a great amount of freedom and flexibility when approaching mission's objectives.\nThis is a Looking Glass Studios game, trough and trough.\n\nStory is fun and pulpy, with great amound of background lore. While 'tis nowadays fashionable to mock directing and acting in FMVs from this game's era, in Terra Nova's case they are actually pretty solid and enjoyable.","August 29, 2015","true","15.2"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","2"

Success requires good use of terrain, planning your approach, strafing and your jump jets. Background and story are interesting and there are a lot of FMV cutscenes (reminiscent of Wing Commander 3/4) although the writing and acting are pretty cheesy.\n\nFortunately its aged well and doesn't have issues like a lot of other DOS era games, the interface and controls are OK and there are two training missions at the start that function as a tutorial. Hard to believe this came out around the time of Doom - the rolling hills of the terrain, water reflections and other engine features are amazing for a DOS game.\n\nMake sure you read the quick reference card PDF that is in the game directory - lots of useful controls and shortcuts in there!\n\nPros:\n- Fun squad-based Mech game with more agility than most\n- Good variety of missions, terrains and planets (varied gravity, weather etc)\n- Detailed but sensible order system for your squadmates (e.g. order a cautious approach or all-out attack)\n- Difficulty can be changed before the mission if you're finding missions too hard or too easy\n- Random one-off scenario generator for quick action\n- Optional tutorial missions to get you started\n- Interesting storyline and background with lots of FMV cutscenes\n- Bonus Features in the game directory includes scans of the Manual, official Strategy Guide, game art and music\n- Controls are not perfect, but reasonable and easy to pick up\n\nCons:\n- Lots of very useful controls buried in the manual (e.g. shift to bound in game which uses jump jets to boost your movement speed, tab in the base menus to see where to click, keys to crouch and look sideways) and especially 'o' to bring up the options menu which includes the difficulty settings.\n- Video resolution limited to 320x400 at most (wierd as it seems to be using a modified version of the System Shock 1 engine which supported much higher resolutions)\n- Might require some mucking around to configure sound when you first start, the Gravis Ultrasound emulations seems flaky","August 5, 2015","true","15.1"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

This was made after System Shock 1 by the same people, although the gameplay is completely different. You play as a guy in a suit of futuristic power-armor, equipped with lasers and other cool gadgets. While in the suit, you go on missions with various objectives, such as killing pirates, performing recon, search and rescue, etc. The combat is fast-paced and excellent. The graphics are rather good for the time period and are still "good enough" by  my standards. In addition, the story is superb. This game contains FMV scenes which are suprisingly well acted, and there is a level of lore that very few other games can match. I spent at least an hour reading the in-game descriptions of the the planets in the Centauri system, the clans that inhabit the planets, and the current state of earth. The controls are a bit odd, but not nearly as bad as System Shock 1's controls. With all this in mind, I can wholeheartly reccomend it.","September 8, 2015","true","3.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

I dumped over 1000 hours into this game as a young boy, and it holds my heart - even to this day - as my favorite game of all time. Memorable characters, devestating weapons, amazing story and very cutting-edge graphics for the time are but a portion of why I love this game. The amount of lore put into the story - even if you have to look for it for a bit - puts this game on the list of many games that were far ahead of it's time.\n\nSadly, the choice not to incorporate Windows Support in the initial release, and make it a DOS-only game inevitably lead to Terra Nova's downfall, it has held up so beautifully over the years. Many games I played as I child, I play today and ask myself 'Why did I like this?'. This is a stigma that Terra Nova has yet to give me. Even almost twenty years later, I still play this game every year (I have perserved the disc copy and suffer through the round-a-bout installation process yearly) I go back, reinstall this absolute GEM of a game, and play it again. And each time I finish the last mission, I'm always left feeling happy. I bought this for myself, and every single person I consider a friend.\n\nTHIS is a game that MUST be played to understand. I loved System Shock and System Shock 2, but I still, to this day, herald Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri as Lookin Glass Technology's premeir child. This will be the first game my children ever play. Not Call of Duty, not Fallout 4, not League of Legends. I will sit them down and say 'Kids... this is a game from a time before publishers and developers did it for money. This game came from a time when people made games for the love of the game... not awards or money.'.\n\nThis is the single best six dollars I have ever spent on Steam. This beats out Fallout 4, Phantom Pain and all the other wonderful games I've purchased here. Steam, if I didn't before, know that now... now I officially love you.","December 4, 2015","true","6.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

From the creators of System Shock, we have a full-scale, totally immersive combat game experience with an extensive array of weapons and gadgets, cheesy full-motion videos, and large, pretty levels. The story would take too long to explain, but in short, you command a 4 person squad (yourself included) in Strike Force Centauri, a special forces group made out of the best soldiers from each smaller special forces group in the Centauri system. Your squad wears heavy Powered Battle Armor (PBAs), which basically means you're wearing a ton of things that can get broken in firefights (including jump jets!). Each mission has a video and text briefing, after which you can set up your team members and their loadouts, based on what you think they should need for what you were just briefed on. The levels themselves are very large, so that you may plan ahead and set waypoints on the map to make a route for a safe sniping distance from enemy camps, tanks, etc.\nIf you've ever played the classic Rainbow Six games, the squad members work like that in-mission. There are a ton of commands to give them, and you can tell each individual member what to do or where to go. This is NOT for beginners.\n\nMy only complaint is that the game desperately needed a sequel. ("Needed" because today's devs would screw it up)\n\n...Gameplay-wise, this game is like Rainbow Six and Battlefield mixed with jump jets, or something. It's a very fun game, and it's well worth the price. I paid about five times more for the boxed version, and I proudly display it on my shelf.\n\n\nLet me remind you that Terra Nova  is NOT a game for beginners. Thank you. Have a nice day.","November 27, 2015","true","10.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","0"

It's made by Looking Glass after all! (sounds a whole lot like me ;)\n\nAnd then you play it. Holy crap, this game is amazing. Complexity unlike ever seen before, one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard (albeit kind of biased), a story that keeps punching you in the face with plot-twists and the gameplay is nothing short of excellent either.\n\nSounds awesome right, a game with absolutely no flaws! ...Well, even though i would love to say this, there are some tiny nitpicky things i have to mention. The videos sometimes don't play, but a simple reboot of the game fixes this 4 out of 5 times.\nAfterwards, you start a mission, but i screwed up and i want to retry. Maybe i still need to get used to the clunky controls yet (which feel surprisingly natural if you're willing to learn them). But this game has no pause-menu. Aaaaand, i ran out of explosives to kill myself. So i shoot my teammates excessively, and they call me a traitor and kill me.\n...Wait a minute, i can do that? How much attention for detail does this game actually have? I am supposed to talk about the negatives now but i can't even stop myself from noticing even more good points of this game!

Terra Nova also pioneered and perfected squad commanding in an fps environment, with competent, realistic bots. The squad members performed the player’s exact commands, ranging from movement options, tactics, engagement techniques, and special abilities. Terra Nova even pioneered exosuit simulators, inspiring the Tribe series of fps’s. It is a very technical simulation, with the missions requiring strategic planning, in outfitting the squad with weapons, suits, pilots, and, “alternative suit functions.” Alternate Suit Functions, or A.S.F.’s, permitted an operator to perform an ability, including deploying sentry turrets, additional suit shields, demolition explosives, power plants, repair modules, cloaking, and other abilities. On most missions, the player had to rely on the bots to perform tasks for the player, either defending a structure, destroying enemy fortifications, and scouting. The player managed all of these tasks via three multi-function displays, similarly to an aerospace fighter jet. The player had access to a powerful and immersive mapping program, drones, damage outputs, and A.S.F. controls. The player also had access to jump jets. Jump jets were integral to gameplay, allowing for mountains to be scaled with ease and impossible maneuvers to be performed.\n\nDue to Terra Nova having been released on the Microsoft Disk Operating System in 1996, months before ID Games released Quake, technical limitations exist. Terra Nova runs off of a modified version of the System Shock engine, based off of the Ultima UnderWorld engine. To accommodate the long render distances, only a limited area around the player is texture mapped. For extreme distances, voxel rendering was utilized. Because of this conglomerate of rendering techniques, the resolution is limited to 320 by 400 pixels. Based off of the System Shock engine, Terra Nova also inherits System Shock’s controls, lacking mouse look. Due to poor popularity, few mods exist for this game. Joerg Fischer, now a German neuroscientist, wrote a famous mod for Terra Nova known as Operation Stonehenge, available at Rich Nagel’s website. Upon inspecting Steam’s Terra Nova game files, it was observed that Night Dive Studios hadn’t even bothered to extract the game files from the ISO copy of the disc. If anyone intends to modify Terra Nova, the disc’s contents must be extracted. Also notable is the use of DOS4GW instead of DOS32A in the Disk Operating System Emulator, limiting the maximum performance and speed of Terra Nova.\n\nTerra Nova was and is an extremely accurate and enjoyable exosuit simulator. The game had the reputed Seamus Blackley as the lead physics programmer, responsible for dozens of flight simulators, including Flight Unlimited, and was originally planned to be part of the Starship Troopers franchise, hence why the player and his or her squad began each mission by falling from the sky. The character models were based off of a dynamically animated skeleton with bipedal physics simulations that outclass current fps’ movement systems. Similarly to System Shock, Greg LoPiccolo composed and programmed the soundtrack to dynamically react to the player’s status. It was Paul Neurath’s dream, the director of Looking Glass, the team of programmers, artists, and designers responsible for Deus Ex, System Shock 2, Terra Nova, System Shock, Thief, and Ultima UnderWorld. Unfortunately, like their previous titles, Terra Nova received critical acclaim and no popularity. The company went bankrupt and was summarily purchased by Ion Storm. The highly experienced team proceeded to develop the highly regarded Deus Ex and System Shock 2 games. After Ion Storm’s breakup, the Looking Glass team was divided amongst many current developers, with some now returning under Paul Neurath’s new company, OtherSide Entertainment. With the rights to System Shock finally having been purchased by Night Dive Studios, work on remaking System Shock and developing System Shock 3 has finally commenced. If anyone recalls the final scene from System Shock involving TetraCorp, a new Terra Nova might be coming out within the next few years.\n\nCitations:\nA PC Gamer article on Terra Nova:\nhttp://www.pixsoriginadventures.co.uk/terra-nova-review-pc-gamer/\nAn EDGE preview on Terra Nova:\nhttp://www.pixsoriginadventures.co.uk/terra-nova-flight-unlimited-preview-edge/\nRich Nagel’s Terra Nova Downloads:\nhttp://jasonwilliams400com.startlogic.com/snor/weeds/Terra_Nova/\nOtherSide Entertainment:\nhttps://www.othersideentertainment.com/\n\nDon't forget to salt the fries!","February 24","true","79.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

As far as stories go, it's a bit on the weak/cliche side but the style of storytelling was so neat, how sudden events in missions shaped what happened narratively (at least it seemed to).  If there were any game to reboot as a franchise with modern mechanics and graphics, this one is the one.  It even features a build-your own battle scenario mode and some limited multiplayer functionality, but it's clear the entire thing was so ahead of its time with great design philosophies other games would _slightly_ improve upon and then use as a singular selling point.\n\nRIP, Terra Nova... until the day some cash-hungry necromancer comes along and brings you back from your ancient tomb.

I thoroughly enjoyed the game and was very happy to finally get to play it. However I don't think this game would have a very wide appeal these days. If you like System Shock 1 and other early Looking Glass titles, definitely give it a try.\n\nIt's a tactical first person shooter with quite a bit of depth to the squad commands and the equipment loadouts. I personally enjoy cheesy FMV cutscenes, and in this game along with the briefings they really tie the missions together. Do note that it plays very similarly to System Shock 1. No mouselook, (and no mouselook mod at this time either) and there are 12 movement keys as opposed to the typical WASD. Also like System Shock 1, the UI is completely over the top, but it kind of grows on you.","December 28, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing it now is pure nostalgia for me. It has aged very well overall. I am surprised of how cool the game still feel and good work the game designers have made to ensure to make you feel like a mech-suit pilot/operator.\n\nAt its core it is a tactical mech game. One of the earliest tactical 3d-games I can think of . You will be ordering companions about, sending away drones for scouting, monitor your mech-suits status and of course shoot assorted bad guys with a varied weaponry. The  system is well thought with all gear and weapons having their place on the battlefield.\n\nThe cinematics (including filmed ones with real actors!), pre-mission briefings, personal messages etc makes the world very believable, although with a cheesy story, which I don't mind at all.\n\nThe graphics while obviously old  still work and are not ugly or distracting. The main view is nicely claustrophic (you are i a suit after all) but a view with more breathing room is available if you  so desire. The enviroment is reasonably pretty and actually impressive for a game being released in the mid 90s.\n\nThe controls sadly haven't aged as well as the rest of the game and are wonky and clumsy but they do work and will not be a hindrance once you have gotten used to them.\n\nI strongly recommend this game. It is a very impressive game for its time. It is still one of the best mech games out there.","April 27","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm running it on a standard 2014 macbook pro running OS X 10.9.5. That's pretty much it. Graphics are fine, controls are fine. CMD+F transitions from windowed to full screen mode easily, even if the game freezes. The only time I have a consistent error is when exiting game from the save screen, this returns you to the start up menu but, on my computer at least, the windows of this screen get all wonky and the best way to exit is just to hit CMD+F and close the game from outside.\n\nHaving mentioned all that, the game runs very well. It's fun. The story and acting are interesting and well done for the era. If you grew up playing games like this, but never tried this one, I can recommend it with a clear conscience. I personally really enjoyed games like Wing Commander, Descent, Terminal Velocity, and Mech Warrior, and this game seems like a bit of a forgotten gem from the era of real 3D action on CD-ROM featuring an amazing 255 color palette. Maybe you didn't even play these games using a mouse.\n\nAnyway, its a bit wonky but very playable.","May 1","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
