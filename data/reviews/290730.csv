"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/290730/","gog-protoss","Protoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/","4010 products in account","Typical browsergame style city building game. This means: Everything takes ages. And then more ages. And then a lot of ages. And then you decide to quit before everything takes even longer. DLC is far too expensive. But for that price you get some bonuses that make the game a bit less unplayable... timed bonuses, of course! Yes, you can invest roughly 500 Euro (without the initial 75p discount) to get bonuses that last for up to a year. For that price you get over 40 times the Skyrim Legendary Edition on sale, or still 16 times without a sale of which each one lasts for up to a year also if you play for several hours every day. With the difference that Skyrim actually is good.\n\nAn example: You build your building in a minute. Then you upgrade it in an hour. Then you upgrade it in I think three or six hours. Then in 24 hours. And that is only if you have enough people.\nWait, what? Yes, you need free people to upgrade buildings. Which you get - surprise - by building and upgrading certain buildings. If you have partial people, the upgrade takes longer.\n\nThen there is science, which works pretty well so far, except everything takes ages. The first science thing is done in an hour. Then if you upgrade your buildings science goes faster, but you can't upgrade enough in a reasonable time to make it worthwhile.\n\nThe "innovative" system that makes you not grinding is - you guess it - resources trickle at a ridiculous small rate (since you'd need to upgrade buildings to get more resources) while you're offline. You can use them then to upgrade buildings and build armies. At which point you probably rather want to play through Ride to Hell: Retribution, Secret of the Magic Crystals, Rambo, Kane & Lynch 2 or even E.T. 2600 because you have more fun there.\n\n\nEDIT: Just found an official screenshot that demonstrates how long this game takes. You need ONE YEAR real time for a research later:\nhttp://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/290730/ss_7fd489353b52c1ff006af97340b652cbca85c70f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1410965823\n\n\nEDIT 2: I received a developer reply in the comments on 8 October 2014 which is reproduced here:\nArbash  [developer] Just now\nAs proceeding in the game you will be able to accelerate science not only by building and upgrading more alchemist labs, but by applying various magic items. And keep in mind - the objective of the game is not to build and to study everything there is, but to fight and/or ally other players.\n\n\nEDIT 3: I just found you can't even get all achievements without paying a lot of real money or completely ignoring quests. Things like completing 150 quests in a row extort you by adding timed quests where you need to buy stuff with the real money currency. So you either farm that ingame, completely ignoring quests until then, or you pay with real money. The instant you click on the quest menu, the timed quest is started. Very annoying!","September 17, 2014","false","9.3"," 442 of 501 people (88%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","88","442","501","13","12"

You acquire basic resources over time, use them to make buildings and troops that allow you to get and store more resources, build more buildings, and continue the cycle. It has the typical limits to building construction, and a research system that is required to unlock everything from adding other users to your contacts list to building defenses to hiring troops.\n\nBlack gems are purchased for real money. This is where things get ugly. You can technically acquire black gems through playing, but if you're really lucky you might earn 1 or 2 per day. Research and building upgrades typically require black gems for the higher tiers. Hero equipment and general buffs can only be purchased with black gems. The cheapest thing you can buy for black gems costs 10 of them, and prices quickly escalate to the hundreds, thousands, and even hundreds of thousands of black gems. This means that you're required to spend thousands of real dollars if you want to do well. Many, if not most, of the quests are simply to buy a buff for black gems, and have a time limit that will cause you to fail the quest (and some of the achievements) if you don't pay real money immediately.\n\nQuests and other actions are not explained well, so players have to guess what most actions do, and what different values mean.\n\nThere isn't any action in the game. There are attacks, but they're simply calculations and RNG that happens behind the scenes. You never see a battle.\n\nThere aren't many bugs, but there are some game-breaking bugs. For example, my hero was killed on a mission, and didn't become available to respawn in the place where he was supposed to. I tried hiring a new hero to replace him, but couldn't because the game said I already had a hero, so I became permanently stuck without a hero.\n\nIf a player who is stronger than you decides to attack you, they can destroy almost everything you have, and leave you unable to retaliate. You can normally only attack players who are the same level as you, but paid buffs can allow you to attack any other player. This means that days or even months of effort will be destroyed any time a P2W player decides that it would be amusing to destroy a non-P2W player. This can also undo any progress you've made with the help of the extremely overpriced DLCs.\n\nThe graphics are very plain. They're not great, but not bad either.\n\nThere isn't much audio, and what little there is gets repetitive very quickly. Luckily, you can mute it.\n\nIf you leave don't play for 4 days, your resource production and research will stop, and your units will begin leaving. If you go for too long without playing (they don't state how long) then your account is deleted. You can pay to prevent your account from being deleted for some time, but that means that you're paying to not play this game.\n\nOn a positive note, there is an official wiki, which is linked to in-game. Unfortunately, the English version is very lacking.","December 10, 2015","false","64.5"," 59 of 62 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","59","62","0","0"

The thing I like most about this one though is you control how long or fast the building will be produced, higher population equals more workers/builders which means faster time to produce resources or a building. The only thing that seems to take forever in real time is research which again the more you have buildings that produce research and people to run those buildings the faster it will be. I don't know about it being a pay to win game there are gems which is RL money but people have been saying you'll be able to find them in game however not that far yet. Only thing I can truely say is if you want something to pass the time and like fantasy time games try it out.

It doesn't even meet the standards of Facebook, or most mobile games. It rips off many games of the genre and therefore it is, objectively, garbage and shouldn't exist. It's soulless trash that was not made by anyone with a love for games. I cannot stress how much higher quality Facebook games are than this. I think this might be the worst 'game' I've ever played.\n\nSome of the screens look like it may get more interesting later, but the introduction is absolutely abysmal and unfun (Edit: 7 hours in, still not interesting). This game consists mostly of waiting and loading. Once you're actually in the game there's about 5-15 seconds worth of activity and then you're waiting hours again. At least with most waiting games there is some stuff to do after you log in.\n\nPros:\n-Excellent torture device\n-Showcases how garbage can get through the Greenlight system\n-Showcases how the Review system cannot be trusted. This game has went from listing mostly negative reviews to suddenly being highly rated due to an influx of positive Russian ratings. I wonder if the developer offered some reward for posting good reviews. (Edit: They did)\n\nCons:\n\n- #1 issue: Not fun. I don't see how anyone could enjoy this. It's like some social experiment to see if people will play utter garbage. I can't tell if this is some magnificent trolling.\n- Mostly derivative garbage. This follows the exact route of every other 'pay to not wait' game, but somehow is so much worse than what you expect from Facebook and mobile. I've played games similar to this, such as the web-based Might and Magic. I didn't like that, but it was much better than this.\n- Extremely poor translation\n- Long load times. Takes like 5 minutes to open on a mid-high range computer.\n- Extremely poor graphics. Worse than most Facebook games. 1995/99 era graphics.\n- No Audio\n- Much lower production quality than most Facebook games.\n- No Steam Overlay\n- Poor pacing.

Why on earth would I want to when I can spend my time doing something fun instead.\n\nEdit: 7 hours (Played) in and it's still the same boring thing.","September 17, 2014","false","7.6"," 83 of 108 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","83","108","0","7"

No Sound, Microtransactions. Quite fun to play as a break. 7/10\n\nFULL REVIEW.\n\nThis game is interesting to say the least, but somewhat lacking in it's delivery.\n\nLet's start with me turning the game on, quick download, quick start up, Simple graphics, but not terrible. However, no sound.\nI first thought it was a bug or something but after checking a few times, this game dosent have sound files. At all.\n\nThis game looks and sort of plays like a Facebook game, but it is more easily compared to Travian, in which you create homes, on a hexagonal area, build up resources and expand to different areas. At time of writing i have only played about an hour.\n\nThe game is ported from a mobile game (as clear in some text documents) but they have changed the interface to make it more PC gamer friendly, and I commend them for that. A nice simple tutorial quest system that goes on for about 20 minutes before you were considered to be in charge of what you were doing, which is nice.\n\nThe combat system is good at a glance, simple RTS but on a longer timescale. Creating troops and having them fight on a different area. It reminds me of the Total War series, but backwards. You manage a city and what buildings appear, but then have a larger map view to move armies around a hexagonal area. These hexagons have different boosts to different units and make an intresting combat system.\n\nLike all facebook games it seems plagued with micro-transactions. Which in my opinion are not an issue. They are not predominant on the screen and you have to go through several clicking to speed up a process. It's there, but not directly advertised. Besides, a free to play game has to make money somehow.\n\nAs I sit here waiting for my population to rise so I can build more buildings to gather more resources, I am pulled in by a strange charm to this game. It feels a bit like alot of other games, but has a much better combat and fighting system. I can only reccommend you at least try this game, just to see if it intrests you.\n\nTo see more Free-To-Play reviews visit my profile and check out my other reviews.\n\nwww.twitter.com/Xelforce","September 17, 2014","true","4.7"," 92 of 146 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","92","146","0","1"

There is no endless clicking of buildings to collect resources like other games; resources automatically collect in your warehouses.  I prefer that much more than other RTS games where you have to log in exactly when buildings are full to manually collect resources.  While the game is light on the micromanaging, it is not light on strategy.  You need to think and plan in advance to outsmart other players that want what you've got and are scheming how to take it.   You might find yourself staying up scouring the internet for strategies and guides, and each one leaves you with multitudes of ways to achieve your goals, but not all of the ways will be best for your race, hero, and play style.  The best thing I enjoy though is the hero system.  Each hero class is unique and customizable at higher levels.  The NPC monster ruins that pop up provide an addicting hunt and kill component, and if you are good enough, eventually you will find and conquer ruins with monster bosses which can reward you with hoards of loot.","October 9, 2014","true","854.2"," 96 of 154 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","96","154","0","9"

Of course dedicated people who played this game for years and invested a lot of money didn't want to start again with new empty accounts. Also, (hilarious but true!!) Steam servers and browser servers run different version of the game, with Steam being several patches behind!!! It even lacks some important content as I've heard. So obviously, Steam version, as some smart guy said, is literally 'playing with itself', while browser version (if to trust developers) still keeps several thousands active accounts. Yeah, the game was popular when just released. Too bad I didn't play it back then, people say it wasn't P2W yet, and was pretty damn fun.\nAbusive monetization starts with the very first quest and keeps getting harder and harder, you see this 'Black Gems required' everywhere. Yeah you can actually mine those in mystical 'Saline Lakes' in very very lategame, but from what I heard they are extremely hard to keep control of. Or you can buy BG on auction for tons of gold.\nCan't tell anything about strategic (military) depth as I didn't play it that long. What I have seen is pretty big amount of various buildings (as for browser game), 6 resources, 8 units (again, same for all races, with different pictures) and sheet-ton of artifacts and sets for heroes to purchase.\nTell you a story. I spent good time once (not so long ago) searching for a good quality BBMMORTS. Most of that time went into filtering these countless 'facebook strategy' clones for 10 y.o kids, reetardedly simple and bright and with same awful money-sucking monetization. And my guess is, these genre just outlived itself. NOTHING of OGame-quality (or at least close to) was found. Just Travian, which I won't play because I hate its comical-style. And this one, My Lands.\nNot sure what this game was before, as it was pretty popular (and not only in Russia). But right now it's just a money-sucking machine. And not captivating at all. Perhaps focused at draining funds from existing playerbase. Just don't play it. Play OGame (or don't, if you care about your nerves and lifetime).\nClass: II - Crap\nVerdict: No\nReviewed: 1.20.2016\nDLC: Age of Prosperity - Premium DLC Pack, Hero Courage - Starter DLC Pack, Miner’s Luck - Starter DLC Pack\nServer: Arhon (Economic) - Steam\nApproach: Steam - PC\nTime: Several Dozen Hours\nDeeds:\n1 Achievement\n90% Researches\n35 Alchemist Labs Level 5 In 1 City\n1 City Full Of Max Level Buildings Without Opening Gate Once","January 20","false","336.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

I don't mean the tutorial is available at all times, I mean it literally takes that long to build and research what you need to complete the tutorial, assuming you check in at the appropriate times (queueing research items is for premium players only). The only reason this could be considered a Real Time Strategy game is because there are no turns. The only obvious Steam integration is the achievements; there is no overlay and I imagine it uses the same servers as its browser counterpart. There is no fullscreen, graphics and animations are minimal, and the music manages to be forgettable and annoying at the same time. The game's entire plot revolves around fighting over the in-game currency, which is also mentioned in the title (black gems). The developers have only put in the bare minimum amount of effort needed to keep this scam afloat; the mountain of fake user reviews have better spelling than the game itself.\n\nLiterally the only positive things about this "game" are that it does everything in its power to keep you from actually playing it, and that it serves as a vile example of how not to make a game.","March 26, 2015","false","12.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

As you can see, I barely have any playtime on it as I went in, "played" a little, and closed it and came to write this.\n\nMy Lands is a browser-based game that made its way onto Steam, but it seems like it started out as a mobile game before hitting the browsers. It's a city-builder with some strategy, as you can play against other players as well. However, everything requires time. You have to wait however long for every building to be built, for every technology to research, and unlike other strategy games the wait times were intentionally increased to make you pay real money to make everything faster.\n\nIn essence, this is Clash of Clans or Age of Empires: Castle Siege but on Steam and without the interesting graphics those games have as their only positive. Basically, stay away.

Unfortunately the downsides of the game go above the its initial quality feeling. The gameplay is turn based like in most Facebook Games but here its prolonged to waiting days and days to make a next move wich makes the achivments rather unobtainable since you have to waste like literary years to do some basic ones. Story wise the story is poorly constructed in means of effort -since when were elves befriended with demons? :) Usually the motive is that they fight them. -And another major flaw story wise is the implementation of slavery as a cathegory like "it aint no thing" its just there- which i find very distasteful to say the least. The graphics are naturaly horible and the buildings are generic. And the quest system is based on luring you into microtransactions and it has even sugestive roads sings on how you should behave to get into the consumerism of it deeper and deeper. It can be apealing to most people becouse the goodsides i mentioned. But as a friend of mine commented about this game "not even the people that made this game play it"-I agree with that, and i do not recomend this game.\n\n;-}","March 7","false","2.7"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

If you really want to make progress in the game, you have to buy black gems, otherwise it is impossible to even try.\n\nOn average I had to close the game 10 times before I could play, because it gets frozen and unresponsive.\n\nAlso, I noticed about many reviews made by users with a single game in the account, and even users without games; all them created a Steam account just to say beautiful things about this game.\n\nDo not bother, there are many better games, even paying for them you would spend much less money than playing this terrible scam that devs called "game"\n\nNot recommended. My score: 0/10\n\nUpdate 1: I can't connect to the server from 2 days ago. The game freezes on loading screen.\n\nUpdate 2: Servers works only on certain times, 2 am Buenos Aires time to be precise. Also, game achievements are broken.

Jediné co se mi z počátku nelíbilo, že je hra strašně pomalá, byl jsem spíše zvyklý z jiných strategických her stoupat nahoru rychleji a snadněji a tudíž pro netrpělivce tato hra moc nebude a brzy ji opustí, jak to dělá spousta hráčů, co nemají potuchy do čeho jdou. Jakmile ale člověk u hry vydrží a přečká to, pak myslím, že je to dobrá hra pro zaplnění nadbytečného času, kterého ovšem v současné době může mít člověk málo. Dalším záporem pro občasnějšího hráče může být, že pokud se po určité době nepřihlásíte, hra Vám skončí a prodloužit dobu nepřítomností můžete jen za černé perly. Na druhou stranu je to též pochopitelné, protože někdo už hru opravdu nechce hrát a tím by neumožnil hrát zase jinému zájemci... přeplnila by se akorát tímto mapa...

A large part of this is simply because My Lands doesn't belong on steam where its effectively tied to a single computer. You need the ability to connect from a browser and your mobile devices, but according to a post from the Devs in the google play store the steam version is on a different server so it cannot be accessed vie the web or mobile devices.\n\nThis could have been mitigated if it had a better queuing system, but you need to pay Black Gems to get any sort of queues, and there is no building queue. You start with a small number of Black Gems and they can be earned within the game by destroying ruins and harvesting the proper locations, but unless you are really patient there simply aren't enough of them without paying money. Since the game is already free on the web, I would preferred to have the steam version cost money but include the premium benefits and share the same servers as the browser version.\n\nMy other complaints are that everything takes longer in My Lands than in similar games and the interface could use some improvements. This type of game relies on an active player base but the build time ramps up so quickly that new players don't have time to get hooked. As for the interface there is no sound, scouting is instant but the information isn't saved anywhere, and you can't see at a glance where you explored or attacked or even who is a legal target.\n\nThe game DOES have potential and I may continue playing the browser version. The different races are interesting, you have a high level of control over your city, the tutorial quests are helpful and most importantly it is entirely up to you when you open yourself to PVP. These are all strong benefits but are outweighed by the flaws. This is not a bad game, its just a bad _steam_ game. While you can successfully take a browser game and put it on steam, you need to make sizable changes for it to succeed.","October 24, 2014","false","9.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ledeir/recommended/290730/","ledeir","ledeir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ledeir/","522 products in account","Though I am a fan of this genre I was disappointed with My Lands. A large part of this is simply because My Lands doesn't belong on steam where its effectively tied to a single computer. You need the ability to connect from a browser and your mobile devices, but according to a post from the Devs in the google play store the steam version is on a different server so it cannot be accessed vie the web or mobile devices.\n\nThis could have been mitigated if it had a better queuing system, but you need to pay Black Gems to get any sort of queues, and there is no building queue. You start with a small number of Black Gems and they can be earned within the game by destroying ruins and harvesting the proper locations, but unless you are really patient there simply aren't enough of them without paying money. Since the game is already free on the web, I would preferred to have the steam version cost money but include the premium benefits and share the same servers as the browser version.\n\nMy other complaints are that everything takes longer in My Lands than in similar games and the interface could use some improvements. This type of game relies on an active player base but the build time ramps up so quickly that new players don't have time to get hooked. As for the interface there is no sound, scouting is instant but the information isn't saved anywhere, and you can't see at a glance where you explored or attacked or even who is a legal target.\n\nThe game DOES have potential and I may continue playing the browser version. The different races are interesting, you have a high level of control over your city, the tutorial quests are helpful and most importantly it is entirely up to you when you open yourself to PVP. These are all strong benefits but are outweighed by the flaws. This is not a bad game, its just a bad _steam_ game. While you can successfully take a browser game and put it on steam, you need to make sizable changes for it to succeed.","October 24, 2014","false","9.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

That probably makes me a bit biased, but I still think that this is a great game. It's the best FTPMMORTS I've ever played, but I have a few issues with this port:\n\n-There are too many Russians. We need location based servers like before.\n\n-External links (encyclopaedia, forum) don't open\n\n-Can't add any BG to anywhere; I click on the amount and nothing happens\n\n-The Steam acheivements require money input, which is not right. Steam acheivements should always be possible to complete with the base game with something like this.\n\n-The game only appears fullscreen windowed rather than full screen. I cannot change the resolution or make it fullscreen.\n\nOther than that, this is just as good as the flash port! I would definitely recommend it. If anyone wants to start an English clan, then my username is O99o99 in-game! Please send me a message so I can avoid the Russians!","September 26, 2014","true","2.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

I can't do more than one click a day. I am surrounded by super mighty and all powerful players who I can't attack. I don't find any mine or ruin or whatever. No clan let's me join them (it's hard enough to find a non russian clan... I simply don't speak Russian).\n\nA lot of quests require you to buy Black Gems. Of course, you can find them ingame, BUT I found like 20 Black Gems in total and there is nothing you can buy with this amount, plus it took me like forever to get them. You can ignore those Black Gem quests but then you can't accomplish the 'Complete 150 quests in a row' quest which will grant you an achievement and a super mighty item.\n\nSo I would say, this game is definitely p2progress as with Black Gems you can get ruins and mines uncovered, you can accelerate your science study rates, every production rate and so on...","November 18, 2014","false","64.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The quests guide you through the very basics and then you basically take your own route.\n\nBlack Gems are the "special" resource in the game. They allow you to buy buffs and get the best things. They can be bought for real money, or you can earn them in the game. At first, you won't earn many in the game unless you're very lucky. But by the time you've built up to attack ruins, which takes about a week or so, you can bring in several a day and eventually working up to thousands a day. They can also be bought with gold in the game which is a standard resource.\n\nThe ranking system stops the top players attacking the smallest ones, so you're safe to start with. There are 5 ranks and you can only attack people of the same rank or above what you are.\n\nThe battles are just a calculation, but the beauty of this game is calculating all the buffs you have vs your enemy to be successful. Finding ways to outsmart people is the joy of this game.\n\nYou have to pay a salary to your army, so there's a balance between having a big army and being able to manage the salary.\n\nAll in all, I've played lots of online games and never found anything that I enjoy as much as this game. Yes, it is slow to start with and takes a lot of time to build up. You can substitute that for money, but I know many people who have succeded in this game without paying a penny","December 11, 2015","true","753.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I spent many hours on this game so I could tell you just about everything about it but I will shorten it to how I feel about the game overall.\n\nFirst off, I do not like RTS games at all. I had played a few online browser and app RTS games in the past such as Travian, Combat Grounds, and Game of War (btw do not ever play GoW). They were fun sometimes but got old after awhile and once you start to become powerful you always get shot down by higher ranked people in clans/guilds who paid thousands of real world money to get to their level. I have also played the Stronghold series and do not enjoy those games. My Lands was sort of an exception to my experience with RTS games.\n\nI started playing this game because I got a free 6 month premium account and figured, why not give it a try? Plus I read you can make money playing the game. Sweet! In the beginning, I really did not know what I was doing but I thought it was kinda fun. The more I started to play and learn about the game, I realised just how much strategy and meticulous, critical planning the game requires. This discovery made the game more intriguing and enjoyable. Once I found an English speaking clan (lots of Russians play, i.e. the majority) I was set. I was a free to play player for a long time and I had NO issues with being F2P. I  was mostly PvE on the Age of Abundance server but I was PvP on occasion, and more so on the other server. Of course if I was super rich the game would be easier, but I learned through reading the My Lands encyclopedia, forums, and from my clan members how to gain power and defend myself from all attacks.\n\nThe only con I can say about this game is that it requires you to be on every single day. I would say no less than 2-3 separate times EACH day. It is an RTS after all.\nIf you miss a day several things can happen:\n1. You get attacked\n2. You miss a monster ruin (which are crucial to gaining resources and power)\n3. You lose an auction\n4. Your clan needed your help but you were afk\n5. Your mine gets stolen\n6. If it's your 7th or 14th consecutive missed day (can't remember which) your city gates open, people leave your villages (no resources gathered), then they leave your cities.\n7. If you are gone a month your account(s) is/are deleted.\n\nI was loyal to this game and determined to make money playing it. I was on everyday for months having fun every time I played. That is why my hours are so high. Most of it was not idling. Unfortunately, the place where I was staying had terrible internet which would not allow me to access Steam 90% of the time. I missed some weeks and got attacked but I was still strong in the game and my clan supported me. Basically, it could have been worse... Now I've quit My Lands indefinitely because I just logged on and both of my accounts are gone.\n\nIf you like RTS games, My Lands is fun. The graphics are nice. The UI is not hard to figure out. The devs added some fitting music after a few months. You can make money playing it by turning black gems collected into money. I believe it's 100 gems = $1.00. Apparently players have made over $2.5million playing the game. It takes a lot of time if you are F2P though. I earned $0.00 in my 650+ hours...\n\nI recommend it if you have the time.","January 8","true","653.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

And here some reasons I don't like, and i noticed while playing:\n- It's confusing because they allways put many new things and they don't even told you what new things are there and it's getting expecive much more because of that\n- they take you so much money and much more after\n- they have a team that they prevent you to be better than them, so you couldn't get any money from mylands or you must be a lot better than them (or/and in one clan one player from that team usualy have up to 5 accounts and plays them all by one player)\n- they cheat and are organised with admins\n- In their rules it says that in the forums and in game must admin write in that language as the server is meant for, but noooo not in my language we have an English writer,, and then we  must translate to other players who can't speak english, and they refuse to get us our native language writer or even if we volunteer they don't mind, I mean WTF??\n\n\nSO don't you start play this game because it's waste of time and money, and money=time, so you spend much more, if you start playing for money(and you hope to get something from that) and you are first time here to play rather go get a second job. (you must play at least 4-6 month to get the gameplay, and even then if you're not smart you will get nothing)","January 10, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the mission that gives you a helm for completing 150 missions seems impossible unless you pay. You can get 25 or 30 done but then eventually missions come up that require black gems (those useless quests IMO) and obviously  if you don't have the load of bg's =fail. and they will come one after the other. Until you failed 5 and then you fail that 150 mission quest because of p2w. I'ts fun exploring and finding ruins, pits etc. But the hard part is keeping the pits you find. And with 6 hours to close a gate (yes, really, in the middle ages it seems they did not know how to close a gate) you can sometimes lose that which you found because some greedy ♥♥♥ has a bigger army than yours.

But do I need to?  I've spent 99% of my time waiting for things to happen.  It says, "Here's a quest: click that thing and build it."  I do so.  I wait several minutes to hours.  Then it says, "Here's another quest: click that other thing and build it."  I do so.  I wait several minutes to hours.  Rinse.  Repeat.  Realize that progress in this game is P2W, and incredibly tedious.  Quit and write negative review.\n\nI don't know how this game currently has 88% positive reviews, because it definitely isn't that good.  Somebody may have rigged the reviews.  My guess is that with time, that'll get down below 50%.\n\nThe mentorship system seems to be a broken one.  Mentors gain rewards when their apprentices accomplish quests, but there is no motivation for the mentor to actually do anything to help the apprentice.  You can request resources from the mentor, but they don't have to give them to you.  I'm not sure, but it seems like you can't fire your mentor, either.  Once you've accepted them, they own you, and leech off of you.\n\nYou should also be aware that no matter how much progress you've made in the game (even if you've been playing for years), they'll delete your kingdom if it's inactive for between 7-30 days.  So... basically, what's the point of playing this?\n\nHow many more terrible design decisions are there that I'm not aware of, yet?\n\nIt's just too bad, because there's something very tempting about the slow-growth style of this game.  But why waste any time on it if you'll just lose it all when real life happens?","May 11","false","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
