"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/57000/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","Basically NyxQuest is a nice but quite short puzzle-platformer. In this game you take control of Nyx, a winged girl from the realm of gods in mythological Greece. The world is ending and you have to find your lover, a mortal named Icarus.\n\nA slight detour: In the Greek mythology Icarus was a guy whose dad built him wings out of feathers and wax and warned him not to fly too close to the Sun; then he basically died.\n\nNyx can fly and soar for short distances. She has to avoid environmental hazards like hot sand, pylons, fire balls and falling to pits, and also monsters like harpies and giant fire-breathing snakes. The ultimate goal of each level is to simply reach the end. Fortunately there are several check points each level.\n\nThere are two bonus goals: you can try to find all the hidden relics (holy artefacts) within each level and also speed run the levels. There are 12 levels (+ secret level that unlocks after the main quest), along which Nyx learns new skills. These include the ability to move objects and hold them still, control winds and finally shoot lightning. All abilities add new challenges to the game.\n\nIt's a nice platformer with a atmosphere that grasps the feeling of "the end of times". The levels are full of ruins and statues and, of course, sand. For me the completion took some 3 hours, the rest of the 6,6 h experience being taken by trying speed runs and finding the relics I had missed.","September 24, 2013","true","6.6"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

Sure, there are better looking games out there, but I like the style and the setting. I do admit they could've used more detailed textures, but it's a Wii port, so I can't really complain. Other than that, I can't really tell you much more about it. You have the ability to fly to get to higher places and during the game you earn extra powers so that you're able to move big statues and blocks for example.\nThere's a bug that prevents the game from saving, so you need to do a little bit of work to be able to save at all (or you have to restart from the beginning every time you play it).\nDespite that I say: thumbs up. Definitely worth it.\n\n[Rating: 74/100]","July 23, 2011","true","1.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

(except for maybe the last couple of 'puzzles' but i wont go into that since its spoilers for the storyline)\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, you can optimize it according to your PC and it has options for anti-aliased and non, so it can either be more pixelated looking, or super smooth (both of which look rather good imo) It runs well, and the background music is calming- it isn't overbearing or nonexistent, it does it's job and does it well.\n\nThe story is alright, it isn't bad, but I definitely wish they had dedicated a little more to the game overall, as the storyline can be finished rather quickly.\nA character round mid-game says something that seemed to imply a much more exciting final puzzle, but when it came time to solve it, it fell a bit short. I wasn't hoping for anything grandiose, considering the games age and original platform, but something a little better than what was there definitely wouldn't have hurt. Don't get me wrong here, the overall story is pretty interesting and definitely enjoyable, I just wish there was a bit more playtime involved in reaching the end of it.\n\nThe only real thing I can think of that was a for-sure negative in this game is that there are a few spelling/grammar mistakes here and there, but they aren't overly noticeable, or terribly commonplace, so I can forgive it.\n\nOverall, a very good game, easy controls, not too difficult and thus very enjoyable for people looking for a more relaxed/casual platformer (though it can get intense at times, it's nothing too bad). Wish it had more gameplay between start and finish, but a good and fairly inexpensive game nonetheless","July 11, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is pretty cliché but which one isn't? I Love seeing the main character going aganst the gods to get her beloved. This game is a clear example of how to make progression in a game and avoid making you too powerful.\n\nBUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!","April 9, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have extra steam copies if you want to trade. It is short, but for an indie game it is really good. A large part of the hours I logged on this game is from leaving it on all night and resuming in the morning. Also I forgot to save and exited half way through the game, and I had to start over. The exit menu is a little tricky stating "Do you really want to abandon Icuras/Quest" (i forget which Ic or Qu). But if you choose yes it actually does save.","December 2, 2010","true","30.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got stuck on one area for 40minutes and could not get past it because of that ledge  needing to jump on and was done with the game.I do not have the patience to repeat areas 20x + over.To bad I do not would of liked to see the end. If you like action puzzle games this a good one, simple yet sweet.","September 15, 2013","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the Greecian theme and the story itself but found it a bit difficult to keep going back to and finihshing. I'm a bit on the fence because it was good and fun but nothing wow worthy.","March 19","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
