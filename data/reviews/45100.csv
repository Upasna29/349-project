I've been riding hunt-seat for quite a few years now, and consider myself fairly well-versed in equine knowledge. But you don't need a lick of knowledge to play this game.\n\nYou got this game from a friend, didn't you? Probably during the Winter or Summer sale. Because no one in their right mind would buy this game for themself, unless it was to occupy a seven year-old for a while.\nBut whatever. It's in your library now. And if you want to 100% it, you have to beat it. And to beat it you need five level 5 horses of each different breed.\nThe objective of the game is straightforward. Get the magic crystals. It took me about 20 hours to accomplish this, but I bet it could be done faster.\nThe game is simple. Buy a horse, wait for it to be an adult, train it to max, breed it, sell it, rinse and repeat. It just takes a very, very long time since you can't breed a level 5 horse with another horse.\nEach level 5 horse requires sixteen level 2 horses, eight level 3s, and four level 4s. All of which need to be trained fully. Each training segment is a simple DDR-ish sequence that takes maybe a minute and a half each time. You have to train a horse six times for it to be fully trained.\nAnd you have to do this with every. Single. Horse.\nObviously, this is a good game to play while watching Netflix or YouTube on a second monitor or something. There's quite a bit of waiting involved, so if you want to catch up on a series while you play, this is the best game to do so in.\n\nSome things you should know about the game:\n- save files don't transfer from computer to computer\n- there's a crap ton of Engrish in this game\n- the game will pause if you click out of the window\n\nBut, I suppose it all comes down to this: Did I have fun playing it?\nAnd to that I say: Yeah, I guess. Give this to your young siblings and let them have fun with it.","November 25, 2013","true","40.2"," 383 of 418 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","383","418","2","8"

This is something more; this is the quintessence of artistry in a digital medium. There are little words to express the absolute majesty of this game, from the cutting edge graphical quality to the intricate character detail with every well-purposed polygon to shape a beautiful beast on the screen.\n\nThis video game will no doubt continue on for generations to be remembered as one of the art masterpieces of the 21st century, much like the works of William Shakespeare, Vincent Van Gogh, Michelangelo, Stephanie Meyer, and J. K. Rowling.\n\nTruly the capability to own such a game for the price of $4.99 is a steal, but if you manage to acquire it at its sale price of $0.99, you should be reported for theft for even attempting to get away with such a heinous crime.\n\nTruly, in short, this game is no doubt underappreciated, as it is ahead of its time. Aptly said, this game is like Batman: it's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. Perhaps in a world where chauvinist bigotry is not the societal norm, we can all learn to appreciate this game for its truly artistic nature.","January 3, 2014","true","64.0"," 132 of 159 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","132","159","0","4"

The first is included in the base game. You send your horse out, and it comes back a minute later with prize money. Minimal involvement on your end. The PLAYABLE horse racing requires you to shell out $4 for the DLC.\n\nEach horse can only mate once, which makes no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. Have a cooldown on breeding? Some kind of inbreeding penalty mechanic? Nope. Once your horses have a baby, neither horse can mate ever again.\n\nThen there's the sale mechanic. The sale price is based on level, and there's no way to adjust it. When you sell your horse, all the items you bought for its stall are taken along with it. You get the same amount of money for horse + default items as you do for horse + fancy items. You get the same amout of money for a maxed out first-class race horse as you do for a horse that isn't.\n\nFor horse selection on most screens, you have to click the little arrow buttons to cycle through your roster. You can't click them until the walk-on/off animation is finished. Not too bad if you have 1-2 horses, but when you have 4+, it's a pain in the ♥♥♥. There's no way to skip this animation. The only screen where the animation is missing is the stable, but you still have to cycle through ALL the stalls(including empty ones) to get to the horse you want.\n\nThe graphics are pretty meh. Except for the $3 dress-up items, which are just atrocious. The english is passable, but it's clear that english is not the devs' first language.\n\nAll the achievements are pretty easy to get, if rather tedious. Get it in a bundle, or 90% off.","September 16, 2015","false","40.2"," 59 of 61 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","59","61","4","3"

The feeling, indescribable. There is absolutely no better game in the whole of human history. I had sought the best game for years but could not find it; this was gifted to me by a friend. I put on my Fedora in anticipation as I booted up the game and when the title appeared I came buckets. The Graphics are real-life-tier and the story is better written than Shakespeare's Hamlet and Homer's Odyssey combined. The gameplay mirrors exactly what being a horse-breeder is all about. I wept pure hot tears. This game made me abandon Atheism, for when I played it for the first time, I was convinced that there was a god. Pure Euphoria rushed through my veins as I made Horses breed. I quit my job, left my wife, and abandoned my kids to play this game non-stop. Empires rose and fell, miracles happened, dreams came true, JFK was assassinated and reborn in Nigeria, but nothing could convince me to stop playing.\nEvery once in a while you get the chance to play a game that sets the bar for everything else. This game will forever be the one by which all others are measured. I've considered on several occasions cryogenically freezing myself, because absolutely nothing else in this world could possibly top the experience I had while playing what will come to be known as the ultimate masterpiece of human intelligence. I am 100% fully convinced that I can say with absolute certainty that this is the peak of everything in human history and that everything else you will ever do will only be a complete and utter disappointment in comparison.","February 13, 2014","true","0.2"," 145 of 199 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","145","199","9","6"

But the gameplay is terrible.\n\nUpgrading your farm and buying more horses sounds like a ton of fun. But earning money is just sending your horse of on quests and waiting for it to come back. Oh, and if the weather turns bad while it is away, there is a chance of your horse getting sick. Which means you have to spend even more money to cure it. What a pain.\n\nYou can increase your horses stats by either training it, mixing potions, or making horseshoes. To do this you must tap arrow keys as they lazily cross the screen. It's like DDR for snails.\n\nIf you decided to buy the DLC, you can also earn money in a Mario Kart-esque racing game. It's pretty bad too, but at least more fun than sitting doing nothing. The Dress Up is cool too, it gave me a few laughs, but you have to repurchase costumes for new horses. Which means you must go back to the painful process of earning cash. I wouldn't recommend the Soundtrack / Coloring Book, as the book only has 10 pages and you'll be tired of the soundtrack after an hour of gameplay.\n\nSo that about covers it.

Tough decission.\nOn the plus side, the game has, well, ponies. You can scrub them, clean their hooves or brush their cheeks - great!\nYou can even breed them.. don't need to tell you that I'm all in for mating horses.\nDid I mention you can give your horses names? Oh, and they come as Unicorns and Pegasi, too.\nGreat right?\nNow the game is basically a mobile game, and you would expect it on like a cell phone. It's repetitive.. You need 2 level 1 horses to breed a level 2 horse, 2 level 2 horses for a level 3 and so on. Every horse can breed only once, and you need 5 level 5 horses to win .. you can do the math yourself and find out how many horses you need to buy and train all in all.\n(it's 80 level 1, 40 level 2, 20 level 3, 10 level 4 and finally 5 level 5 horses, so 155 horses to train in the same few training grounds over and over again)\nThose horses can then go to work and earn their living, which is just (as you may be used to from mobile games) waiting time for you. Now, that's the game mechanics, and it's a great time sink...\n\nBut.. what really ruins the game are the bugs. Horses just disappear, upgrades you bought disappear and so on..\nFor example, you buy a new box in your stable, let's say it's the first new box you ever bought and cost you 300bits.. now, if the box magically disappears (which happened to me in two playthrough attempts) the only way to get a new box will be to buy the next level upgrade for 900bits.. and so on..\nGave it two shots, both times a level 3 pony just 'disappeared' nowhere to find, even reloading and old save file didn't bring it back for some reason.\n\nBut the worst thing is:\nOnce you're emotionally attached to your horse, brushed its mane, hand fed it with only the best oats, bonded on al those tricky parcours, searched the perfect breeding mate for it... you have to sell it for profit cause you'll need the box.. broke my heart!","October 7, 2014","false","21.5"," 61 of 77 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","61","77","4","0"

It is a collection of four minigames with a bit of nonsensical storyline about you having to breed five magical horses. You get magical horses in the fifth generation and for each generation beyond the first you need to raise two horses of the previous generation. Luckily after your stable is fully upgraded, you can buy second generation horses.\n\nThis means that, unless I made a mistake, in total you need to fully train 1+2+4+8+16 = 31 horses for your first fifth-generation horse and then 1+2+4+8 = 15 horses for each fifth-generation horse (provided you fully upgraded your stables), for a total of 91 horses.\n\nHow do you train horses? Well, you do the same four minigames over and over. Luckily once you got the catch, which is after a few minutes, the minigames are not at all difficult, and you also have to do each one only once per horse. The game just remains repetitive until the end. that you can see after a total of around 17-20 hours of playtime if you force yourself through the repetitive minigames again and again. The whole money management aspect really does not matter much, it seems only tacked on to hide there is no substantial gameplay. Which it fails to do.\n\n\nBecause of its fantasy horse setting the game is seen as a troll game by a certain number of people and therefor often at sales gifted to other people. This trend has taken a somewhat recession after the introduction of the Steam Trade system allowing you to store games in your backpack. Yes, for those newcomers, there was a time where you could only activate a game or reject it, and that was the high time of this game as a troll gift, together with Bad Rats! This also will be the most likely reason why negative reviews will be rated down, unfortunately countering the whole intent of the review system.\n\n- The graphics are nicely done, although not top-notch. They very much fit into the fantasy setting, and I really don't see where to complain other than them looking a bit old (but still good enough).\n- The sound also fits nicely, it is not disturbing but also fits into the setting.\n- Atmosphere and Story are for all real intents and purposes nonexistant.\n\nMy sincere apologies, at the end of this review, go to the developers who after almost three years still do a good job of at least community info and free patching. For example, when achievements stopped working this year (2013), they fixed it. Not liking the game mechanics doesn't mean I don't appreciate that bit of work! In fact, I was surprised to see it fixed when I recently checked the forums, since I simply stopped expecting developers to give anything about their game after a certain period of time which lies between one and two years.\n\n\nRecommended: No, unless you want the achievements, as they are easily obtainable by grinding","November 27, 2013","false","17.3"," 83 of 124 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","83","124","0","8"

It's not gonna win any awards, or anything, but the horses are pretty, and the foals are cute, even if the player characters look like they walked straight out of Halloween Town.\n-Mildly entertaining.  What little gameplay there is manages to keep the brain kind of stimulated.\n\nCons:\n-Tedious.  Getting money is a grind, especially given how expensive everything is.  A lot of upgrades are purely aesthetic.  Breeding a level three horse took three hours.  Questing only yields so much money, and upgrading your well so you can keep more horses and earn money faster is surprisingly expensive.\n-Adding to the well bit, expect to sell a lot of your horses to make room.  If you have a child, make sure they don't get too attached to their first pony, because your little unicorn is gonna have to go to the glue factory if you want the space to breed some level twos.\n-There's not a whole lot to do while all of your horses are out working.  If the wait times were longer, and the yield was higher, at least I could do something in the background, but they manage to be just long enough to be annoying while simultaneously being just short enough to force you to remain on standby.\n-Quests are pretty much all the same, save for the length of time they take to complete and the amount of money they earn you.  You'd think that, given how little effort it must have taken to code each one - seeing as your horse does nothing but disappear for a bit and return - that at least they could give more variety to the descriptions, but there are only about four or five to choose from.  Selling your horse counts as a quest, so don't be surprised if you accidentally give away your painstakingly-bred demon steed for a fraction of its actual value.\n-Racing is only marginally more entertaining than quests.  At least it gives you something to look at, though what it gives you isn't much.  It doesn't help that it's faster to skip the dialogue box than watch for the millionth time as lil' Pegacornelius IV takes the 1 place.\n-All three training games play and look exactly the same save for a few minor aesthetic differences, and one of them you'll never even have to use.  The obstacle course one raises your strength and dexterity, and the forest one raises literally everything else.  There's no skill specialization, here; you have to max them all in order to breed, so playing the third is just an inefficient waste of time.  Given the slow, SLOW pace of the game, time-wasting is the last thing you want to do.\n\nConclusion: Children might find it marginally entertaining, but they probably won't have the patience to finish the game.  I'm not sure that I even have the patience to finish the game.  With that said, I hear that this makes a great joke purchase for friends, especially given the low price.","November 28, 2014","false","3.5"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","30","38","5","0"

While this game was very difficult and non intuitive, a memorable journey shortly followed that heightened my perspectives forever. This isn't just a game, it's an experience. The only thing that rivals the impeccable gameplay is the fact that there are several inaccuracies that were brought to my attention over the course of the game.\n\nThe game revolves around Equus ferus caballus, otherwise known as the domestic horse. Despite the fact that members of this genus have elevated sympathetic nervous system responses, the horses depicted in the game did not fight or flight when I posed an immediate threat to them.\n\nAdditionally, the physics engine in this game is terrible and the horses are shown to defy some law that governs physical matter at any given point in time.\n\nOverall, I do not recommend this game unless you are a horse girl or enjoy brushing horses with amorphous objects.

You get a birds eye view of the town, It just puts you in, ♥♥♥♥ you if you want to actually know how to play the game, After a minute of random clicking I clicked on what appears to be a stable, I see my horse, Did I say horse? Nope, you get a ♥♥♥♥ing unicorn to start out with. I named my unicorn "Slurmpf" The name that describes my feelings for this game, wet and sloppy.\nAfter more random clicking I managed to get a quest, as it says, I accepted and my horse walked away, And a wait time showed up, Wait times for money is the last thing I expected in this game, or so I thought, My horse came back, got gold for it, Clicked randomly more and found the race thing, "Finally, I can ride my Horse Unicorn!" I clicked singleplayer race, got thrown into the worse mario kart ripoff Ive ever seen.\nI stopped after this, maybe I will pick it up again, most likely not, Its nothing special, you can play it for 10 minutes than stop becuase thats most likely all a normal person is willing to deal with.\n3/10, It has potential, But its not worth even a buck.","March 19","false","1.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kripparian/recommended/45100/","kripparian","Suttles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kripparian/","438 products in account","If you've ever wanted a pony but never did, this game is a must have.\n\nI can honestly say this game is as close as it comes to a pony raising simulator. The most amazing part is how accurate taking care of each pony is. Even, though this game is dated the graphics never cease to amaze me when I start up the game and visit my beloved children. I have raised over ten horses from foal to mare and stallion and every time it felt so real. I am excited every time a horse gets pregnant because then it means my family is growing. It has been years since I've started this game and I can not still comprehend how this game does not sell more than Skyrim, Farcry 3, and Bad Rats COMBINED. That's just how flawless this game is. Horses are absolutely great but when you add in the secret of magic crystals, the game gets infinitly better. The story is also very emotionally compelling with each horse that is born into the world. It is by far one of the greatest stories I have ever heard. I won't give it away but I'll tell you now that the ending will have in tears and conflict. The characters are really what makes the story believable. Every horse has a unique personailty and the dialogue is just so well written, that you can't help but know these horses are real. But what is a game without it's gameplay? Good thing, this simulator has gameplay down to perfection. It is so flawless that I literally wished every game in existance had this gameplay. The controls are tight, the rewards and progress rate are gratifying, and the general feel of the game is just absolutely stellar. This is by far the best game Steam or possibly even the world has to offer. I give this game a hundred ponies out of a hundred ponies. Here are some fun facts from wikipedia for you horse lovers: The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus, or the wild horse. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior. Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. If you're still reading this, you're a champ. Leave this comment on my profile: "I love horses." Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years. Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses. Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond. The oldest verifiable record was "Old Billy", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62.[6] In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age one million.","July 25, 2013","true","1.4"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","7"

The point-and-click aspects of the game are in a 2-D first-Person perspective; however, the cut-scenes and mini-games are in a third-person perspective. Although being of unfinished nature and thus in "Beta" development, the creator has dubbed the current playable version as "Alpha 1.4" (released on December 31, 2012). For all intents and purposes, it is a sex game. According to the title screen, a few ponies will be added in the next update.\n\nDuring any of the sex mini-games, the player must sit through a certain amount of time as a bar fills in the top right-hand corner of the screen. During this time, there will be four buttons labelled 1-4 in the top left-hand corner of the screen. Clicking on any of these buttons will change what is happening between the player's character and said other pony; this varies greatly depending on who the other pony is. Depending on which one of the four "modes" you select, the speed the bar in the right-hand corner of the screen fills will vary. Once the Bar is filled, a new button labelled with an exclamation mark will appear to the right of the fourth option. Once this button is pressed, a cut-scene will play out and finally a button labelled end will appear on the right of the exclamation mark.","January 29, 2014","true","9.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It features whimsical ponies in a not-all-that-great storyline with grinding being the focus of gameplay. But, I've actually come to enjoy this game's charm. This is the definition of a side game, a game you work through whilst doing something else, such as watching Netflix or a Twitch stream. Furthermore, props to the developers, Artery Studios. Here we are, 4 years later, and they are still releasing patches and very recently have released their first DLC for this game, which adds multiplayer.\n\nBasically, I reccomend this game. It is not by definition a "good game". It is absolutely a running joke to many buyers. But despite all this, this game has managed to leave a mark that I won't forget, and I suggest purchasing this if only to support developers that show they care about their game as opposed to treating it solely as a source of income.","November 11, 2013","true","80.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You can upgrade them\nfrom here in exchange for cash.You can also find pickups here.All you\nneed to do is click on them...\n\n-----Info Board-----\nThis gives you a list of all your ponies. It tells you their level,\ncurrent amount of training, amount of time until they become available,\nif they qualifyfor breeding, and tells weather or not they are sick.\nIt's really only useful if you keep several ponies around at one time\nand can't keep track of them.\n\n-----Clovers-----\n-Increases your horse's performance in the next race (used automatically)\n-appears sometimes (i think when the ground is not covered in snow) and\nwhen you don't already have one\n\n-----Rainbows-----\n-Gives 100 Gold\n-Appears every time the weather indicator (top right of the screen)\nshows a rainbow as the current weather (the leftmost one of the three)\n-It may be a problem in the game itself, or just my copy, but i've never\nactually seen this, just clicking in random locations for me got the reward.\n\n\nTHE STABLE AND WELL\n\n-----Basic Info-----\nThis is where you can restore a horse's condition and spirit (Condition\nrefills automatically, Spirit requires brushing or feeding to refill)\nYou can also buy new items and horses, as well as breed them.\n\n-----Upgrading-----\nUpgrading the Stable will allow you to buy new, more effective items for\nthe ponies (more on them in a moment) FULLY UPGRADING THE STABLE\nALLOWS YOU TO BUY LEVEL 2 HORSES!THIS CAN SAVE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF\nTIME! Upgrading the well simply allows you to have more ponies at once.\n\n-----Breeding-----\nOnce you have 2 fully trained ponies (see corral for training) whose\ncondition and spirit are full or nearly full, and you have an open room\nin the stable, you can breed them.Two level one ponies breed a level 2.\nTwo level two's breed a level 3 and so on. But each pony can only breed\nonce. So to breed a levelfive pony, you'll need to raise a totalof 31\nof them minus however many level 2's you bought since fully upgrading\nthe stable. Any two ponies can breed, even when their names imply that\nthey are the same gender.\n\n-thanks to Steam user Grumblecakes for gender information.\n\nUnfortunately, level 5 ponies cannot breed, making the whole game about\nfive times longer. If you want to get all of the crystals, you will need to\nbreed up 5 separate level 5 ponies (one of each type) I am currently looking\ninto breeding combinations, but nothing seems to be reliable enough to\ncommit to besides only buying foals of the same type to ensure their\noffspring is what you need it to be.\n\n-----The Store-----\nClicking on the store awning lets you buy items for your current pony, or\nin an empty stable, allows you to buy a new pony. WARNING: ANY ITEMS YOU\nBUY FOR YOUR PONY WILL DISSAPEAR WHEN YOU SELL SED HORSE!\n\n\n-Stat-Based Items-\nThe Lamp, bucket, food and water dishes all effect the stats of your\npony. All of the starting equipment gives zero stats by default, but\nI only reccommend buying these forponies that you plan on having\ncompete in races. Higher leves typically increase stats more, but\npay attention to the items before you can buy because the most\nexpensive itemisn't always the best one. I also don't reccommend\nbuying anything until your pony is fully trained. Doing so can make\nit difficult to tell if you've finished training\n\n-Condition/Spirit-Based Items-\nThe three brushes do not offer stats, but using them on your pony can\nrestore their condition and Spirit. Higher levels typically restore\nfaster, but have no other benefits.If you are the patient type, or\nhave other things to do while the ponies are resting, I suggest not\nwasting the money. But be warned, when windoed, the game pauses if\nit is notthe active window on your computer.\n\n--Foals--\nYou can buy level 1 baby ponies for 300 gold each, and later, level 2's\nfor 1,000 gold. They of course, require an empty room in the stable. The\nDescription on the buy menuis a clue as to what the pony will grow\nup to be.\n\n-Unicorn: The grace and beauty of this horse is one of a kind.\n-Pegasus: The Ancestors of this Colt were unique racehorses.\n-Fire Steed: This colts ancestors were fearless and wild by nature.\n-Ice Steed: Mountain People Bred this kind of muscular horse.\n-Demon Steed: People of forgotten civilizations passed on the secrets\nof breeding this type of horse.\n\n\nTHE CORRAL\n\n-----Basic Info-----\nHere is where the training happens. you'll have to fully\ntrain your pony before breeding, doing missions and racing at the gate.\n\n-----Improving Stats-----\n\nStrength......Sledge Pulling, Obstacle\nSpeed.........Dressage, Forest\nStamina.......Sledge pulling, Forest\nDexterity.....Forest\nReflex........Dressage, Obstacle\nIntelligence canno\nOverall......what am I doing with my life","July 21, 2014","true","301.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Then came the day a friend gifted me "Secret of the Magic Crystals" and it changed my life completely. The fast paced action/adventure gameplay was a mixture of Call of Duty and Euro Horse Simulator 2014, leaving you entranced with each passing minute of gameplay.\n\nThe Graphics are to die for. Adding a new visual style never seen before in modern gaming, comes a whole new dimension of realistic graphics that will make you think the reality you live in is false and leave you hypnotised.\n\nThe Music consisted of a vast array of classical composers adding so much to the experience. When I heard my Platinum Mare trot along the French Countryside to "Eine kleine Nachtmusik by Mozart" I couldn't contain my exitement . (For new players the Platinum Mare is worth over $150 in Steamland Fun Money so it's quite Rare.)\n\nIt's possible that the replay value of this game is an about 1200 hours, each NG+ or regular New Game will have you sitting on the edge of your seat in awe as you watch your treasured Horse grow. Starting as an innocent Foal you can live a carefree life and grow into a very beautiful and majestic Mare or a handsome and charismatic Colt.\n\nAnyone considering investing their time and money into "Secret of the Magic Crystals" is a saint and a friend in my books.

It helps to give the illusion of the vast magical world the game has to offer. The musical score is quite spectatcular, always helping to convey and generate different emotions.

The most amazing part is how accurate taking care of each pony is. Even, though this game is dated the graphics never cease to amaze me when I start up the game and visit my beloved children. I have raised over ten horses from foal to mare and stallion and every time it felt so real. I am excited every time a horse gets pregnant because then it means my family is growing. It has been years since I've started this game and I can not still comprehend how this game does not sell more than Skyrim, Farcry 3, and Bad Rats COMBINED. That's just how flawless this game is. Horses are absolutely great but when you add in the secret of magic crystals, the game gets infinitly better. The story is also very emotionally compelling with each horse that is born into the world. It is by far one of the greatest stories I have ever heard. I won't give it away but I'll tell you now that the ending will have in tears and conflict. The characters are really what makes the story believable. Every horse has a unique personailty and the dialogue is just so well written, that you can't help but know these horses are real. But what is a game without it's gameplay? Good thing, this simulator has gameplay down to perfection. It is so flawless that I literally wished every game in existance had this gameplay. The controls are tight, the rewards and progress rate are gratifying, and the general feel of the game is just absolutely stellar. This is by far the best game Steam or possibly even the world has to offer. I give this game a hundred ponies out of a hundred ponies. Here are some fun facts from wikipedia for you horse lovers: The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus, or the wild horse. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior. Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. If you're still reading this, you're a champ. Leave this comment on my profile: "I love horses."  Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years. Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses. Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond. The oldest verifiable record was "Old Billy", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62.[6] In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age one million.","July 24, 2013","true","68.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","4"

Using patented Barn Technology™, Secret of the Magic Crystals takes you on a journey through the joys of owning a magical horse.\n\nThe plot is amazing, the main horse character is incredibly realistic and I thought I was looking at an actual movie of a horse until I looked at the pixels really really hard and saw that I was actually playing a videogame. Some parts are a little unrealistic though and can break the immersion. For example, one part of the game had me making shoes for my horse.

Once in a blue moon a company is able to produce a product that doesn't only peak my interest, but indulges the mind into a playground of endless creativity and induce a multitude of good tidings; This, too, is a legend. The artstyle satisfies the soul while the mechanics tickle the brain. Coming across this game was like coming across a sparkling, bright emerald in a dark cavern; I couldn't resist myself from immediately placing it in my cart and downloading it, giggling like a giddy schoolgirl the entire time. Dissapointed, I was not; To my suprise, what had appeared quintesential had surpassed even my own assumption of it's pristineness. My congregation of horses began to form from the earth, and I was unable to step away from the computer, not even to spend time with my family or continue my schooling. Thus, I was forced to drop out and be violently disowned from my family. It all was worthwhile, as I continue to have my flock to turn to. Every aching second of being out of Secret of the Magic Crystals is agony, as my ponies are the only true friends I now have. I look forward to grooming and training them. Soon, I will join them.

After only a few hours of sleep, I was back for more and I couldn't stop until I finished the game. Then, I started over again to find all the secrets.\nRarely is there such a perfect mixture of graphics, sound, and gameplay that even the most cynical players will admit that Secret of the Magic Crystals is poised to shape the action RPG genre for years to come.\n\n"Bunch of d♥ck ripping fun" -- 10/10","June 23, 2014","true","3.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

I own plenty. However, this is not good nor really a game. I've played facebook games with more entertainment. After you upgrade the buildings all the way you are usually done with your first level 5 horse. Thats almost 4-5 hours. After that just a repeat with a different horse texture and maybe some variation of how fast you build up skills of different breeds.\n\nNo inbetween achievements from the first level five horse to the last achievement. Even cycling through the horses becomes unrelentlessy boring... But I will press on for the sake of completion.\n\nOne thing could've given this game a positive recomendation and that would be the ability to breed level 5 horses or breed a previously bred horse again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FamedKarma/recommended/45100/","FamedKarma","FamedKarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FamedKarma/","431 products in account","Secret of the Magic Crystals is a horse breeding simulation game which is based around the gripping tale of a meteor which has crashed into the earth. You, the player, are the grandson/daughter of the man who discovered the magical properties of the crystal inside this meteor; it has a profound effect on horses, eventually turning them from lowly ponies and small colts to majestic unicorns and Pegasus’.\nBut hold your horses! We’re getting way ahead of ourselves. Before fusing these magical crystals with your horses and quickly creating a nobler beast with which to race and compete, you must first train your horse and force it to compete in various menial events to raise money. With the money raised, you will be allowed to improve your farm, house more horses and fix up the gate (an excellent addition). Whilst this creates variation in the game, it is hard to see where it fits in with the “crashed meteor” plot line, a flaw which many enthusiasts have concerns with.\nTo level up, you must breed your horse with horses which complement its level and type, and in consequence, the horse will rise in level. However, it is rather tedious training your horse to be certain levels and making sure to consistently breed properly to ensure the correct leveling pattern whilst also concentrating on the economic circumstances of your farm and your social status as a horse racer and breeder among the general horse-enthusiast community. This consistent multitasking sounds extremely demanding, but in reality is reduced to a set of mini-games, most of which are the same rhythm game with a different animation in the background.\n\n\nThe graphics and art style for Secret of the Magic Crystals are of a higher quality than what you would expect from a game like this. Although the training animations and movements of your horses appear to be of the quality of glorified QuickTime events, the lens flare of lanterns and the decent anti-aliasing on the horses tail show a quality of graphical value which I was pleasantly surprised by as a player. However, the art style is where the true beauty lies; with warm, sharp colours and flowing environments, Secret of the Magic Crystals showcases an art style which utilizes a colour palette similar to Team Fortress 2 in a brand new context. I was extremely pleased with this.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game is also surprisingly entrancing. With menu music that brings memories of ABBA’s famous Dancing Queen combined with other tracks which feature solo acoustic guitar and ambient percussion, I found myself bobbing my head with the rhythms on various occasions. Furthermore, the sounds of chirping birds, waterfalls and pleasant gusts of wind create variation which is definitely appreciated.\nTo conclude on Secret of the Magic Crystals, it is a game which will take a little getting used to at first, but for any unicorn breeding enthusiast/horse trainer; it is a game that will perfectly suit your needs. The main issue with Secret of the Magic Crystals is that more time needed to be spent on magic crystals. However, for the price of $4.99USD, the game is extremely impressive.\nFINAL SCORE: 8 UNICORNS OUT OF 10.","November 30, 2013","true","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

With a story to rival the works of Shakespeare, backed by the level of lore only seen in the timeless epics of the Greeks, combined together with a soundtrack that would leave Beethoven feeling amateurish.    This action-packed, story-driven experience will have you at the edge of your seat.\n\nI played this game non-stop for fifteen exciting minutes.  I crafted horseshoes made of exotic ores, pulled wooden sleds full of stone bricks, tried my hand at alchemy, grinding the finest herbs horse-kind can conjure, and watched my horse consume only the quality of hay suited to such a majestic and beautiful beast.  I learned that I could race my horse in multiplayer against other lucky purchasers for the bargain price of $4.49.  Still not convinced? Customize your horse by equipping it with a saddle worthy of the gods.  Upgrade your trough: have your horse drink in style.  Equip your horse with Elton John sunglasses.  Play watered-down DDR to the beat of her hooves and glide majestically over all obstacles in her path.\n\nThis is the equestrian simulator we have all been waiting for.  Truly, this is the masterpiece of our generation.\n\nDo you think you have what it takes to discover the secret of the magic crystals?

I am still crying from that beautiful, tearjerker ending. It will haunt me for the rest of my life. Her last words were poetry. But I won't spoil it for you, this game's plot is too brilliant for that.\n\n\nSTORY:\n\n\nThis game's story has everything. Comedy, tragedy, action, adventure, romance, drama... the lot. Yet somehow, it never trips over itself. You play as a young child fighting for the honour of their father. You do this by raising horses of different breeds to aid you in your quest for the titular magic crystals. Your journey will take you through seasons as you train, breed, race and sell your horses. Come rain or shine, there is no rest. You're fighting for your father's honour.\n\nThe characters are all deep and vivid, with brilliant backstories complimenting their individual quirks and mannerisms. While I won't go into depth for fear of treading into spoiler territory, I will say this: not everyone is who they say, so be careful.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\n\nThis game may appear simple, but trust me, it's deceptively complex. It will take you hours, days even, to even scratch the surface of what this game has to offer content-wise. There are a few tricks you learn along the way, like that clicking on a rainbow nets you 100 gold pieces, or that clicking a clover brings you luck at the races, or that you actually can lead a horse to water AND make it drink by rapidly clicking on the water until the ungrateful brat takes the hint.\n\nThe racing sequences are especially intense; you can't actually see your beloved horse, you see.

This is a game where you raise magical horses. You train them, treat them, send them on quests/races and breed them. It's similar in some respects to the Chocobo raising from Final Fantasy VII only you can't breed a particular horse more than once. You breed two horses of one level and you get a foal of a higher level. In some ways this title feels like a children's game, but with so much that is unexplained and demanded of the player to "complete" the game (namely you have to breed four 5th level horses), it makes you wonder who this game was intended for.\n\nIf you like magical horses or My Little Pony you might get a kick out of this game. It's not GotY material, but it can be a relaxing distraction and it has some rather soothing music. It also makes a good gift to give that certain someone on your friends list who only plays military shooters.","February 17, 2014","true","23.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, I would be suprised if Half Life 3 blatantly rips off the brilliance of SotMC. Moving on, it is a graphical powerhouse. Your can hear my impressive rig hum in anguish when SotMC is booted up. I've destroyed 3 different 3.5 Ghz hexcore processors due to not having sufficient cooling to handle this masterpiece. In fact, the devs require you to run the game in a MIINIMUM resolution of 1024x768, so that their true artistic vision can be realized. Do yourself a favor, play this game.\n\n","November 29, 2013","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gregsgay/recommended/45100/","gregsgay","qt asian girl (Huy at Alex's)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gregsgay/","237 products in account","Quite possibly the greatest game of all time, The story was incredible, while playing it I seriously thought I was watching a Scorsese film. I never thought I'd be able to fully enjoy another equestrian experience since, the greatest movie of the 2000's by far, Racing Stripes. This game blew Racing stripes out of the water, something I felt may have been impossible. I do not want to spoil how; you'll have to play the game to experience the tale. With all that being said I should jump into the actual game. The graphics were completely out of this world, look out Crysis. Naturally the game ran as smooth as life itself do to the fact that it is running off of Cryengine 5. In the beginning you are given a little Col that you can rub, and in minutes MINUTES your Colt does not grow into a horse, but instead into a majestic unicorn. At that point I had completely lost my wits, I started screaming and flailing my arms around banging my desk and stomping on the ground, and ended up breaking my monitor, and striking my sister. After I had calmed down I could not play the game anymore because I had destroyed my room, but the lust for horses was still there. I immediately found the closest stable I could and began rubbing all of the colt's heads, but something was wrong, I was rubbing for hours but no unicorns NO UNICORNS. I started flipping out and let out a rage that burned as bright as our sun I was blinded by it. All I could remember was that I saw ambulances carting off a ton of people, had I done this? I think I did. I write this review from my padded cell in prison, it's not too bad though I can hear my unicorn's whinny as clear as ever. I think the game released me from this dull world only I can see the unicorns. You all should join me in my pure bliss. This game changed my life for the better and I am sure it will change yours as well, we will ride unicorns together soon.\n\n10/10 Fantastic\n","February 14, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boggztf/recommended/45100/","boggztf","rrn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boggztf/","85 products in account","When I first got introduced to the concept of "Secret of the Magic Crystals" back in January 2010, I got so excited just from thought of actually growing my own virtual horses that I couldn’t wait to get my very own alpha version of the game.\n\nThen the day finally arrived, I got my very own copy of this masterpiece of a videogame. I installed it, booted it for the first time, and just from the main menu and the absolutely gorgeous soundtrack that started caressing my ears, I could instantly tell that I was going to have an absolute blast with this bundle of entertainment.\n\nAnd what a good time I’ve had. I usually get a bit teary when I look back to all the moments I’ve had with this video game. It has taught me so much… about life. It cured my alcoholism. It also taught me how to treat a lady right. I feel like before this game my eyes were closed. But now I see. I must have spent well over 1100 hours on this work of art (I’ve lost count long time ago and this is my second steam account I play it on) there just really is no horse game alike. I don’t even know where to start with the gameplay in this game. I think I’ve broken my arrow keys three or four times while replaying all the different exciting quick time event based activities. And then there’s the graphics. If your computer is beefy enough and you dare to set the graphics level to “Fantastic” you will get a thrilling gameplay experience like no other. I do admit I have gone as far touched myself while looking at the new and enhanced Pegasus of this gorgeous piece of work. But I don’t think anyone can blame me for that considering how life like and beautiful the game makes the creatures look. There are also a lot of different potions and magical horse shoes to pimp your horse with. Also a nice assortment of different brushes is included to make your very own horse feel just as special as he/she is.\n\nFinal verdict:\nOverall it’s still hard for me to grasp my mind around how amazing this game is in its full magnitude. I would give it a solid 10/10 any day. With the price being only 5 coins I can confidently recommend this game to anyone and everyone. No gamer should have their library without this magnum opus of all games.","January 2, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This game is like the most basic building block of the gaming community. With special PhysX features you can watch the dust fly up from the magnificent Demon-Steed's hooves and TressFX let you see the full flowing locks of his ghostly mane. The intense gripping storyline of the worlds greatest game really just sucks you in and makes you feel like you're there riding the horse. Manipulating the Unity Engine to it's fullest potential this game has the great advantage of being able to select your resolution before playing, (not in-game though, let's not get too far ahead of ourselves here.) Secret of the Magic Crystals really taught me some important lessons for every day life, such as, what to do if a meteor comes crashing to the earth. You do not run, or hide, you simple get on your horse and run straight for the meteor. Overall this game has been a wonderful experience for me and I would definitely play it again if they had bothered to make more than one ♥♥♥♥ing storyline. 11/10","January 11, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The scenery and horse AI are great, and the characters are very believable and well-written. The plot is very unique. I would give this game a 11/10 if there were a numerical rating on Steam, but alas there is not.\n\nHowever, I have only played for 2 hours.

The games are kind of like Summer Games for the C-64 or Apple II in the 1980s, where you can do the equestrian event (horse racing), except Summer games was more fun and had a better framerate and sound/music.\n\nThere's a magic cauldron that you can use, where you mix magic ingredients into it and try to come up with items that your unicorn can wear (like better magic horseshoes to increase speed). You can get more ingredients by doing "quests" that show up in a mailbox that you need to click on at the gate area.\n\nI haven't actually done any quests because I was so discouraged by the slow pace of the horse races that I couldn't bear the idea of another minigame.  The races go at an extremely slow pace, and last several minutes. On the bright side, I think my unicorn's stats increased substancially after the race, so the monotony of the experience did at least reward me with something.\n\nGrooming the unicorn is the most entertaining part of the game - you can brush your unicorn's hair and clean its hooves and polish its horn. The unicorn will sparkle quite a bit after being cleaned, and grooming my unicorn did make me feel some sense of accomplishment when it was done. This was ultimately the highlight of the entire game for me.\n\nIt's also worth nothing that the framerate for this game seems stuck at around 20 fps, even though a modern machine should tear these graphics apart at a million FPS.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel Secret of the Magic Crystals is far too complex with its ingredient mixing and unintuitive UI for a kid to play, yet the mini-games themselves are far too simple and slow for an adult to play. This leaves the game with no real target playerbase, making it a game that I can't really recommend to anyone, even if it was free.","March 14, 2013","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I never thought I'd be able to fully enjoy another equestrian experience since, the greatest movie of the 2000's by far, Racing Stripes. This game blew Racing stripes out of the water, something I felt may have been impossible. I do not want to spoil how; you'll have to play the game to experience the tale. With all that being said I should jump into the actual game. The graphics were completely out of this world, look out Crysis. Naturally the game ran as smooth as life itself do to the fact that it is running off of Cryengine 5. In the beginning you are given a little Col that you can rub, and in minutes MINUTES your Colt does not grow into a horse, but instead into a majestic unicorn. At that point I had completely lost my wits, I started screaming and flailing my arms around banging my desk and stomping on the ground, and ended up breaking my monitor, and striking my sister. After I had calmed down I could not play the game anymore because I had destroyed my room, but the lust for horses was still there. I immediately found the closest stable I could and began rubbing all of the colt's heads, but something was wrong, I was rubbing for hours but no unicorns NO UNICORNS. I started flipping out and let out a rage that burned as bright as our sun I was blinded by it. All I could remember was that I saw ambulances carting off a ton of people, had I done this? I think I did. I write this review from my padded cell in prison, it's not too bad though I can hear my unicorn's whinny as clear as ever. I think the game released me from this dull world only I can see the unicorns. You all should join me in my pure bliss.

As I take in the magnificence of the scene, I suddenly spot the figure of a woman with her head covered in a red scarf leaving through the front doors. Her form captures my gaze and all else fades from existance. A thought sears into my mind in a sudden moment of clarity: "I must know her name!" My feet start to carry me down the stairs, soon skipping two or even three steps.\n\nNow in a full sprint, I stumble out the front doors to find myself absorbed into the crowd of a busy sidewalk. My eyes dart furiously across the chaos and I catch a glimpse of red in the backseat of a taxi pulling away. I quickly hail a cab and soon we nearly catch up. Without warning, traffic surrounds us and I am separated from my mysterious stranger. Lost and hopless, I look up and see that I have arrived at a harbor. The gray of the sea envelopes me and I sink into an all-consuming despair.\n\nBut wait! My eyes fix on to a swaying speck of red gliding down the pier. As I race down the squeaky planks, I find my stranger looking out to the vast ocean. Pleading, I shout: "Please! I must know your name!"

The game has few QTEs also when making medicine for the horses and when making horseshoes.\nThe game also has a mating system where they need to be happy and healthy. To make them happy you just need to clean any part of their body it doesnt matter which you pick.\n\nOverall the graphics isnt great and the game is lacking in many gameplay aspects so I really cant recomend this game.","October 2, 2015","false","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This masterpiece has one of the greatest, most detailed and deepest stories ever written. The philosophical implications have shattered all of my previous worldly concepts and the emotional trauma I endured left me feeling more depressed and emotionally distraught than I have ever felt. I’ve cried at the end of games before. Never have I had to call the Suicide Hotline to help me deal with my mental exodus.\n\n\nMost influential game of all time. 10/10.

LEG WINGS. WHY. and you can't even name your horses, they get some generated (female) names and it gets repetitive easily. soon you realize that all your horses are named like ''Blondie''. and even though every horse is a mare, they can breed with each others. :) and instead of trotting, the horses pace.\n\nthe only good part in this game is when your horse gets sick you can still force it to train and compete. it's fun to see those horses suffering, it serves them right for being in this awful game.\n\ni am so mad since this game clearly shows that the makers of this game don't know anything about horses and they are just making fun of us who love equines. fug this shi t, would not play again/10","March 11, 2014","false","8.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","1"

If it was just simplistic and held your hand, then I could at least say "okay I didn't enjoy it but it's not my demographic and I'm not supposed to like it". I think this is a bad game because it's bad by any standard, on any merit. I don't even think my 5-year-old self would enjoy this, and I enjoyed some pretty bad games when I was a kid. Kids may have bad taste but they still need something to engage them, hold their attention. Swinging your mouse over a horse as you "brush" it is not going to spark any nostalgia 20 years from now.\n\nWhat offends me the most is that this is hardly even a game, and this is coming from a guy who reads visual novels. I thought  the "Go on a quest" option would have me do some paltry, simplistic minigame, but you just watch your horse walk off the screen and come back 40-80 seconds later. That is not a game, that is waiting. Maybe if you count the minigame to heal your tired and sickly horse by playing a six-step DDR to brew a potion, but I don't count that.

Things start off pretty well for Homecoming though – if you can forgive an opening which doesn't so much slyly tip its hat to Jacob's Ladder as lob its helmet at it – as eminently likeable protagonist Alex Shepherd returns home from war. His brother is missing and the town of Shepherd's Glen – a lake's throw away from you know where – is in eerie disarray. It's an intriguing – if familiar – premise and Homecoming does a reasonable job at pacing its reveals, maintaining an air of mystery that carries much of the game.\n\nIt might seem strange to jump straight onto a game's story but survival horror – with its contrived game mechanics – has always been a genre where narrative counts. Despite its best efforts though, Homecoming can't deliver, and what starts off well ultimately descends into confusion and predictability –eventually, the only real reason left to follow the story is the nagging hope that it can't possibly be as stupid as it thinks you are. It's disappointing for a series that set the precedent for narrative delivery across the medium, albeit one that's failed to live up to its own standards over the years. Charged, presumably, with the impossible task of juggling the franchise's persistently impenetrable cult mythology alongside the more intimate psychological horrors of series darling Silent Hill 2, it's hard not to feel sorry for developer Double Helix.Unfortunately, Homecoming misses the mark on other occasions too and, while Double Helix has does a respectable job of bringing the aging franchise roughly in line with modern day expectations, the end result is a competent, if hollow, facsimile of its predecessors that fails to capture the series' melancholy soul. Homecoming's successes lie in the careful aping of Silent Hill's conventions and, in terms of sheer iconography, there's little to match the series with its fog-shrouded streets, industrial Otherworld and the constant oppressive drone of Akira Yamaoka's unmistakable score. Certainly, Homecoming ticks its checklist with gusto but it's nostalgia rather than innovation that is likely to keep long-time fans engaged.\n\nAdmittedly, tweaks to combat, control and camera make for a far less torturous affair compared to previous Silent Hill offerings – and there's no arguing that a kick up the ♥♥♥♥ for the series was long-overdue. Combat-wise, Homecoming eschews Silent Hill: Origins' fussy obsession with melee combat, focussing on a limited number of – upgradable - melee weapons and firearms, all with unique attributes that come into play when certain obstacles or particular enemies appear. In truth, Homecoming's implementation of hand-to-hand combat, first-person shooting and dodging is still awkward and unrefined though, made all the more apparent by the game's incredibly aggressive enemy AI. Too often Shepherd's abilities simply can't contend with the feral attacks of your opponents and the best course of action is to leg it away. Six franchise entries where a well-timed pout is as good as any amount of prescribed ineffectual flailing and you start to wonder if combat is really necessary at all…","July 20, 2013","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It's a genre-defining masterpiece, and all other games crumble against the majesty that is Secret of the Magic Crystals.\n\nYou'll live this unique experience through the eyes of two younglings and their epic adventure as they search for the Magic Crystals, struggling to help their grandfather. They'll get help from their equine friends throughout this magnificent tale, and to be honest, it left me in tears. I never guessed friendship between equines and humans could be this beautiful and magical.\n\nIt has been eye-opening for me.

It takes years of hard work and training of a real horse to win a race and trophy and lots of patience aswell. But with this game you can 100% it in around 20 to 30 hours and get all acheviements and trophys and it has trading cards aswell. ; )\n\nAt least this game is a lot  cheaper than the real deal, and the horse cant step on your toe also you dont have to clean out stables. So yes you do have game grinding at its best, but to me it was really worth the effort. You dont have to finish the game in a day, take your time and have a break. And if you have a love for horses, you will probably like this game. Also no boss fights nor guns and violence. This game is very good for people of all ages and gender.\n\nThis in my opinion is a very nice relaxing  game to play and i have totally enjoyed playing it.

Super Mario defined the platforming genre, FFVII redefined characters, Half-life made fps about more than shooting hoards of enemies. These games changed the way players experienced games and what they expected to get from a game. These games forced developers to scrap their old concepts of what makes a game great and rebuild from the ground up. The Secret of the Magic Crystals cannot be called a “game changer” for it destroyed the concept of a game. Merely stating that it changed gaming is not enough for this masterpiece. Nothing anyone can say or do will ever be enough for this game and what it has brought to gaming. While people will remember Half-Life as a great game, they will remember SotMC as a great life changing and enlightening experience.","July 3, 2011","true","887.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

It takes years of hard work and training of a real horse to win a race and trophy and lots of patience aswell. But with this game you can 100% it in around 20 to 30 hours and get all acheviements and trophys and it has trading cards aswell. ; )\n\nAt least this game is a lot  cheaper than the real deal, and the horse cant step on your toe also you dont have to clean out stables. So yes you do have game grinding at its best, but to me it was really worth the effort. You dont have to finish the game in a day, take your time and have a break. And if you have a love for horses, you will probably like this game. Also no boss fights nor guns and violence. This game is very good for people of all ages and gender.\n\nThis in my opinion is a very nice relaxing  game to play and i have totally enjoyed playing it.

Upon the 9 minutes of playtime, I felt that I had enough experience to share my opinion on this game. As I am an elite horse groomer and stable cleaner, I feel that this game is honestly lacking core mechanics that would make it into something so much better. The gunplay is very off, and a lot of the animations feel as if the developers did not put a lot of time into them. The reload animations especially are very off-putting. The matchmaking can be tedious at times, whereas it can take up to 30 minutes to find a simple Search and Destroy match. Prestiging does not give you as many benefits as it did in this game's predecessor.\n\nAll in all, I can not recommend this game, but hopefully the devs learn from their mistake when making the sequel.","February 15, 2015","false","0.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","47","7","15","11","0"

I guess saying this is the most boring game I have ever played would be a good point.\n\nThe storyline can be described in detail in only a few words but at least it doesn't get in the way. The graphics are functional and not barebones but not otherwise remarkable. The single music track that exists is actually very good but the game takes some 40 hours to complete and you will grow tired of it long before that. There are a few minor bugs but nothing serious. What this game is really bad at is gameplay; or to be more exact its almost complete absence. The game is extremely repetitive and the only remotely challenging parts are akin to a rhythm game, except there is no rhythm. As you advance they may get a little bit more challenging but they always remain quite easy and almost never fun.\n\nAdmittedly, I'm probably not the game's target audience which I assume are children, maybe even a few adults, with a love for animals, especially horses, who simply want to spend some frustration free time with their virtual pets. This game would meet those requirements and perhaps even be enjoyable for them but there are better pet games available, though I'm not sure if any of them focus on horses. And then there are people who will get and complete this to show that they have what it takes...","December 4, 2013","false","43.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kittycatgirl2k/recommended/45100/","kittycatgirl2k","kittycatgirl2k","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kittycatgirl2k/","337 products in account","This is a REAL review for this game, for those who are curious to what the game is actually like.  If you can really call it a "game".\n\nA unicorn raising pet sim game for 99 cents is a simple purchase for a 9 year old girl that loves unicorns.  Unfortunately there is not enough "game" here to even waste a buck on.  This is as close to a freebie, bare bones pet sim as possible.\n\nPros:\nGame is simple to learn and simple to play\nThe graphics are fairly pretty, even if everything is static other than a few horse animations\nCan easily be "played" windowed while doing other things, it's not demanding\nFour years after release and the developers are still "updating" it.\n\nCons:\nEverything else?\nThe game leaves you little to do.\nThe animation is sparse\nOnly 5 different horses can be obtained in the "game"\nThe music is  loopy and repetitive\nThe only real "gameplay" portion is an add on DLC that lets you participate in the races.  It's DLC!  What the heck!\nYou can't rename your horse.\n\nWHY CAN'T YOU RENAME YOUR HORSE?\nThe game just won't let you.  It won't let you do much of anything.  There are a few different areas on your magic horse ranch, all which have just one or two functions.  There's a stable where you can feed and groom your horse.  You click on the feed for it to eat, and pick up a brush and scrub it over the horse to groom it.  That's it.  There's a place to get horseshoes that up the stats slightly.  The horse stands there while you click static pictures to make the shoe and then drag it on the horse.  Done.  Boring.  The corrals!!!  Maybe we can actually train our horse?  And yes, you can!  There are a handful of mini games but they are all the same... forest background, horse walking down the road, hit the appropriate arrow when it lights up to green and spins.  And it's verrry verrrrrrry slow.  You'd have to be in a coma not to have fast enough reaction times to hit these arrows.  They are spaced out by seconds.  Very slow, trotting seconds.  All the training games are like that, with the exception of the animation.  Horse pulls a cart, horse jumps over obstacles... it's all done with arrow hitting.  There's the barn, where if your horse becomes ill (apparently questing gives horses the sniffles), then you can check it with a stethoscope, and click a syringe that buys a potion to cure it.  That's it.\n\nThen there's the most promising feature.  The gate.  Surely the races will be fun or the quests.  The game has quests!  We have to find some magic crystals and keep our grandpa's dreams of unicorns ALIVE!  We can't let his legacy remain the laughing stock of the scientific community.  They WILL SEE that these crystals will change these horses like a Pikachu being exposed to a Thunderstone.  Click on that gate, start that race, let's see how this horse FLIES.  Your horse trots off the screen with purpose and some text appears while your screen sits on the empty gate graphic.  That's right, you can't even watch the race.  It updates you on how your horse is doing with text only.  It's not even very accurate.  Our horse/unicorn thing Tina was apparently passing Moriande right up at the end.  Did Tina win?  Nope... Moriande came in first, and Tina was fourth.  If the last thing was Tina passing Moriande, how the heck did that happen?  And do we even care?  What is this?  1983?  Early 80s text adventure games had more animation and things to do than this waste of time.  But wait... there's quests.\n\nYou start out with five, which you can do as many times as you like, until your horse is too tired or sick to continue.  You click "yes" to accept the quest, your horse leaves with purpose... and... that's it.  It comes back with some money and it's two gauges lessened.  There's nothing else to the game... that's it.  Sure, you can spend some of that sweet quest money on upgrading your facilities which make for more efficent training, illness curing, horseshoes, etc. but there's nothing else.  The game is mostly made up of static screens and long stretches of sitting there staring at an empty horse yard while your steed is out on some grand fetching adventure.\n\nHonestly the idea of the game is cool, and would appeal to young girls if there was more to do, but there just isn't.  The game is as hollow as a unicorn's horn.  There are many more pet sims on the market than a person could play in their lifetime and all of them offer more options than this game does.  I could see it diverting the attention of a fairly young child for 30 minutes, but even they will get bored of having nothing magical or secret to do with the unicorns.  If you want pet sims, try just about anything else, there's Kinectimals, Nintendogs, all the PetZ games, and too many to mention across computer and mobile platforms.  Anything is better than this.","June 27, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

There aren't any aesthetic options beyond going upward in price for ranch and horse-related purposes.\n\nOVERALL: There aren't enough interactive/bonding options for a pet-simulator like Nintendogs. There isn't enough customizable about the ranch to be a rewarding management game like Harvest Moon. Competition isn't in-depth enough to compete with a magical monster genre like Pokemon.

Well, here's a game for you.\n\nSeriously though, my friend got me this game as a joke, and to be honest, I thought it was hilarious for about ten minutes. You buy things to use on your horses and increase their stats, train them for the same reason in DDR style directional key sessions, and that's it. That's all you can really do, because what should be the best parts of this game--the parts where you take your magical horse to win horse races against all those other presumably loser horses, or take your mystic steed out to accomplish various quests like saving Timmy from the well or moving boulders for old man Henderson--are done FOR YOU. You send your horse away while a clock ticks down the time until they return. Then I guess you're all like "Hey magic horse, did you win that cool race?" or "Hey best buddy, did you fix that road block that was keeping the medicine wagon from reaching the orphanage?", to which they just whinny enthusiastically, staring at you with those big whimsical horse eyes like "DID I EVER! Man, you should've been there, it was TOTALLY cool, and look," they'll continue "I leveled up from it and everything, you really should have been there best human friend. Where were you anyways?".\n\nGood question, game: where was I? Probably improving my stable, or buying super horse medicine, or some other equally boring waste of time so I can upgrade and care for an amazing magestic super stallion that I can't do anything remotely interesting with except look at, improve some more, then send out to do quests by itself.\n\nThat's really my overall impression of this game: a waste of time. I suppose asking this game to have an exciting story is a bit too much, but by cutting you (the player) out of the quests and racing events as it does, it really feels like a hollow and incomplete venture, and I can safely say that I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it.","April 30, 2014","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It’s over-the-top and at times unnecessarily complex, but serves both current and next-generation consoles with ambitious new ideas and tremendous replay value\n\nMuch like its predecessors, Secret of the Magic Crystals appeals to a wide audience, from veteran fans to timid newcomers by challenging them to become knowledgeable trainers or fill the up the encyclopedic Pokedex. Thanks to an impressive amount of depth from elemental-based combat, it manages to pull off this difficult task right from the start.\n\nYou're a courier in these troubled times with no defined background. Just a seemingly regular guy or gal, you're tasked with delivering a package to the New Vegas strip, but let's just say complications arise. Though the story provides pops of color and a few necessary minor twists to keep things interesting, it's predictable just the same. There are three possible endings to the main quest, and similar to Fallout 3 at launch, once you complete it you won't be able to continue your journey through the wastelands unless you re-load an old save. This is a bummer, especially since that was a major complaint with Fallout 3 and Bethesda later fixed it with downloadable content.\n\nFinally, one subtle, but important improvement that has been made in Secret of the Magic Crystals is its brilliant considerations for two- and three-player games. You can now turn off the computer-controlled opponents entirely, and the mini-games all adjust to your group size in clever ways.

"Worst case, I'll play around with it a bit, then pass it off to my daughters."\n\nI was wrong.\n\nEven though the 'skill' sections are undemanding, and strategy is negligible, Secret of the Magic Crystals demands endless grinding that simply cannot be accelerated.

This game redefines the way you play games and the way games are meant to be played!\n\nYou play as an horse breeder, and here is the first discontinuity from other games: you are REALLY working on horse breeding. Next day I received mails (real mails) from horse sellers, then from fodder sellers. At the end of the first month I received, together with the electric company bill, the résumé of a jockey (too bad in this game you can't do races, so I had to decline) and the phone calling (but who gave him my number?) of a farmer apprentice... Then serious work began!\n\nIn 3 months I had a fully working farmhouse, in 5 months I tried to impregnate my finest looking female horse with a raging demonsteed of a fellow horse breeder... and just few months ago she gave my first baby firesteed - I cried for the emotion!\n\nNow I am proudly a 24/24 father of a beautiful stallion! Let me know if you want him to impregnate your fillies! This is the magic of life!\n\nThis game is a classic and I foresee the sons of my sons playing it in the future, at least as much as I did!\n\nAddendum: now there is tthe "race" expansion! I hope to find the mail of that jockey again! (I already gave the game full score, but this expansion would easily give it an extra point...)\n\nBest played with Logitech Horsewhip\nRecommended Buy Price < Real Farmyard\nScore 10/10","November 21, 2014","true","503.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Not once every ten years do we witness such a beautiful and fine-tuned work of classic art such as this. The character creation aspect of the game extends beyond that on any next-gen console and within minutes i was enveloped in the unique and riveting storyline.\n\nThe soundtrack was and continues to be one of the finest orchestral pieces i have encountered in all of my years of orchestral-music-listening. I am led to believe that the original overture was a lesser-known Jimi Hendrix piece before his untimely demise in September 18th, 1970. I can, as the children say these days, "Jam out to this all night, baby". The musical components of this game reach out to players of any age range and deliver the true message behind the Secrets of the magic crystal.\n\nThe very common trend within each level of SOTMC is the themes of equality and friendship, which are tremendously achieved through unique dialogue and intriguing character designs and actions. Towards the end of my 5th playthrough i had an epiphony as my unicorn companion sacrificed himself for his wife and children. I thought to myself: Why are we here? What is the meaning of life? Are we all unicorns?\n\nWhilst questions such as these are frequently pondered over by many scholars and philosophers around the globe, I feel that my understanding of the universe exceeds that of theirs due to the intense emotions i have experieced through the playing of this magnificent masterpiece.\n\n11/10, would rate again.","July 1, 2014","true","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Not once every ten years do we witness such a beautiful and fine-tuned work of classic art such as this. The character creation aspect of the game extends beyond that on any next-gen console and within minutes i was enveloped in the unique and riveting storyline.\n\nThe soundtrack was and continues to be one of the finest orchestral pieces i have encountered in all of my years of orchestral-music-listening. I am led to believe that the original overture was a lesser-known Jimi Hendrix piece before his untimely demise in September 18th, 1970. I can, as the children say these days, "Jam out to this all night, baby". The musical components of this game reach out to players of any age range and deliver the true message behind the Secrets of the magic crystal.\n\nThe very common trend within each level of SOTMC is the themes of equality and friendship, which are tremendously achieved through unique dialogue and intriguing character designs and actions. Towards the end of my 5th playthrough i had an epiphony as my unicorn companion sacrificed himself for his wife and children. I thought to myself: Why are we here? What is the meaning of life? Are we all unicorns?\n\nWhilst questions such as these are frequently pondered over by many scholars and philosophers around the globe, I feel that my understanding of the universe exceeds that of theirs due to the intense emotions i have experieced through the playing of this magnificent masterpiece.\n\n11/10, would rate again.","July 1, 2014","true","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

However, it's going to get tedious after about 30-60 minutes. The breeding system makes it so horses can only breed once making it very hard to get your horses to higher levels. The fact that you have to break your bonds with your horses because you can't get better horses due to having limited stable capacity is also a bit annoying (RIP Amoomoo and Shinki). It drags the game out for WAY longer than it should be. I've spent about 3 hours on this game and i only have a level 2 horse (to beat the game you need each horse breed at level 5).\n\nThe only reason I could recommend this game is because of the sale making the game cost $1. The regular price of $5 is too steep for the amount of entertainment you'll get from the game.","December 23, 2014","false","4.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But then it all changed when I started this gem of our gaming generation that will be the pinacle of gaming perfection for years to come.\n\nNow let me get to the Gameplay,Graphics. and Story for this game I would have done something for bugs but this masterpiece has none.\n\nThe Story\n10/10\nI felt really immersed into the universe of this game every little detail is handcrafted and its just so fresh from the other AAA games. I could go on for hours about the story for this game but i dont want to spoil anything to any newcomers to this game.\n\nGameplay\n10/10\nThis game really hit it on the nail for all the things that i expected out of this game. Every time i took my horse to gallop i was sucked in no matter how many times ive done it before i got straight into the action and thats just for one part of this masterpiece.\n\nGraphics\n10/10\nThis really looks like the most realistic game i have ever seen in my life i feel like i am apart of the world and let me tell you it is a world to be apart of. The grass looks so crisp and fresh with morning dew, the wind blows the branches of the trees in only a way that brings tears to my eyes, and the mane on my beautiful unicorns/horses/demons really look so authentic and it just a beacon for good gaming to gamers anywhere and will give the big AAA games a run for their money.\n\nConclusion\n10/10\nThis game is perfect in any angle you try to look at it. It dominates the competition and they also bring more action to you in amazing, creative, groundbreaking DLC that brings hours apon hours of gameplay in a new way that changes the formula of the base game but its still as amazing as it is.\n\n","June 15, 2015","true","35.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","33","3","9","4","0"

But why should we think the use of animals stops at the dinner table?\n\nIt doesn’t, of course. Leather (see “Slaughtered and Skinned”) goes into shoes, pelts become furs, and much of what is worn comes from animals. But it doesn’t stop there.\n\nWith the rendering process, every bit of farmed animals (and sometimes even our dog and cat companions) is used in an astonishing variety of items — lubricants, polish, soap, cement, ink, lipstick, pharmaceuticals, Jell-O, gummy candies, pet foods and agricultural feed, to name just a few. The rendering industry utilizes a “witch’s brew” of animal parts: spinal cords, brains, eyeballs, and intestines, turning whatever’s not wanted by the food and clothing industries into the components of a thousand useful products.\n\nAny farmed animal has a short, pitiful life. After a life of subjugation at the hands of humans, it’s off to slaughter, to be used in the products we see all around us — in our homes, our medicine cabinets, our furniture, even in our children’s toys. Misery and pain exist behind every child’s stroke of a Crayola crayon, which, just like many of the glues and adhesives found among a kid’s art supplies, is derived from rendered animal parts. While the child takes pains to draw their favorite farm animal, it’s the real life farmed animals who endure the real pain.\n\n100 Million Pounds a Day\n\nIn the United States, roughly 250 rendering plants located around the country process approximately 100 million pounds of “waste” or inedible parts of slaughtered animals such as bones, blood, hides, offal, feathers, as well as road kill, spoiled grocery meat, restaurant grease, and euthanized dogs, cats, and horses, every day. The end results of the process are a variety of products including tallow, lard, animal feed, protein meal, cosmetics, and mechanical lubricants. According to the industry rhetoric, rendering provides an essential service to the public by “recycling” unwanted animal remains and restaurant waste. (The renderers even call themselves the Original Recyclers in a 1996 self-published book about the industry.) Indeed, in 1994 the rendering industry processed a staggering 50 billion pounds of poultry and animal remains into commodities such as protein meals, grease, and tallow.\n\nThe National Renderer’s Association classifies the use of rendered products into four primary categories:\n\nas an ingredient in animal (livestock and pet) rations;\nas ingredients in industrial processes;\nin the manufacture of soaps and personal care products; and\nas edible products for use in the food industry.\n\nWhile the thought of a rendering plant might conjure horrific images of plant workers accidentally falling into boiling vast of muck (boiling is known as wet rendering), those are images out of the past. Modern rendering facilities use dry rendering, which releases fat by dehydrating the raw animal materials in large, mostly enclosed, steel cookers.\n\nRegardless of the method, the fact remains that animals are subjected to cruel and degrading treatment even after the slaughter.","February 11, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Misery and pain exist behind every child’s stroke of a Crayola crayon, which, just like many of the glues and adhesives found among a kid’s art supplies, is derived from rendered animal parts. While the child takes pains to draw their favorite farm animal, it’s the real life farmed animals who endure the real pain.\n\n100 Million Pounds a Day\n\nIn the United States, roughly 250 rendering plants located around the country process approximately 100 million pounds of “waste” or inedible parts of slaughtered animals such as bones, blood, hides, offal, feathers, as well as road kill, spoiled grocery meat, restaurant grease, and euthanized dogs, cats, and horses, every day. The end results of the process are a variety of products including tallow, lard, animal feed, protein meal, cosmetics, and mechanical lubricants. According to the industry rhetoric, rendering provides an essential service to the public by “recycling” unwanted animal remains and restaurant waste. (The renderers even call themselves the Original Recyclers in a 1996 self-published book about the industry.) Indeed, in 1994 the rendering industry processed a staggering 50 billion pounds of poultry and animal remains into commodities such as protein meals, grease, and tallow.\n\nThe National Renderer’s Association classifies the use of rendered products into four primary categories:\n\nas an ingredient in animal (livestock and pet) rations;\nas ingredients in industrial processes;\nin the manufacture of soaps and personal care products; and\nas edible products for use in the food industry.\n\nWhile the thought of a rendering plant might conjure horrific images of plant workers accidentally falling into boiling vast of muck (boiling is known as wet rendering), those are images out of the past. Modern rendering facilities use dry rendering, which releases fat by dehydrating the raw animal materials in large, mostly enclosed, steel cookers.\n\nRegardless of the method, the fact remains that animals are subjected to cruel and degrading treatment even after the slaughter.","February 11, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It has ponies and magic - what else could it possibly need?  What could go wrong?\n\nPros:\n1) Graphics.  It's a decent looking game.  Horses are well fleshed out, and the animimations for them are smooth.\n2) Designs.  Each breed has its own look, naturally, and they pull them off fairly well.\n\nNeutral:\n1) Story.  The idea behind the game is...interesting.  Though for the amount of time you'd have to play to see it through, it really isn't quite deep enough.\n\nCons:\n\n1) Gameplay.  It is repetitive.  Incredibly repetitive.  To breed your horses, you need to maximize ALL of their skills.  That requires playing two of the courses mulitple times per horse.  That would be fine, if not for the fact that not only can you breed each horse only once, the number you need keep going up.  To get your first LvL 2 horse, you need 2 LVL 1s.  Which is fine, until you realize that means you need four LVL 1s to create 2 LVL 2s to breed a LVL 3, and it just gets worse from there as you need more and more to get up to your LVL 5 horses.  I played for two hours and only just got my first LVL 2 horse.  Yeah.  No.\n\nThe courses are all basically the same concept - when the icon turns green, push the relevent arrow key, and your horse will do whatever its supposed to if you time it right.  The races don't use this mechanic, but even then you only use the left and right arrow, and CTLR for items.  Quests you push a button and your horse disappears for however long the quest takes.\n\nAll in all, the game looks like it had promise, but they went the mobile game route of button hitting=gameplay + waiting times to make a PC game.  There are much better horse-related games out there - nix this one, pretty as it is, for something more interesting to play rather then look at.","December 31, 2014","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought this game might be a decent animal-training-sim because of it's generally good ratings, but I could not even think of recommending this game to anybody I like. You've got a dysfunctional UI, giving you little to no information about what you need to know. The training mini-games are all the same timing-based arrow puzzle, which requires very little skill to complete. To top it all off, the game teases you with a DLC expansion every time you visit the gate or exit the game. I'm sure there are some people who can work around all of that and can find enjoyment in "Secret of the Magic Crystals", but in my opinion, do yourself a favor and go play Monster Rancher for GBA or PS1.

It has ponies and magic - what else could it possibly need?  What could go wrong?\n\nPros:\n1) Graphics.  It's a decent looking game.  Horses are well fleshed out, and the animimations for them are smooth.\n2) Designs.  Each breed has its own look, naturally, and they pull them off fairly well.\n\nNeutral:\n1) Story.  The idea behind the game is...interesting.  Though for the amount of time you'd have to play to see it through, it really isn't quite deep enough.\n\nCons:\n\n1) Gameplay.  It is repetitive.  Incredibly repetitive.  To breed your horses, you need to maximize ALL of their skills.  That requires playing two of the courses mulitple times per horse.  That would be fine, if not for the fact that not only can you breed each horse only once, the number you need keep going up.  To get your first LvL 2 horse, you need 2 LVL 1s.  Which is fine, until you realize that means you need four LVL 1s to create 2 LVL 2s to breed a LVL 3, and it just gets worse from there as you need more and more to get up to your LVL 5 horses.  I played for two hours and only just got my first LVL 2 horse.  Yeah.  No.\n\nThe courses are all basically the same concept - when the icon turns green, push the relevent arrow key, and your horse will do whatever its supposed to if you time it right.  The races don't use this mechanic, but even then you only use the left and right arrow, and CTLR for items.  Quests you push a button and your horse disappears for however long the quest takes.\n\nAll in all, the game looks like it had promise, but they went the mobile game route of button hitting=gameplay + waiting times to make a PC game.  There are much better horse-related games out there - nix this one, pretty as it is, for something more interesting to play rather then look at.","December 31, 2014","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As I started the game, boom this ♥♥♥♥♥ up to "Fantastic" quality, which was indeed fabulous, and I love that the game developers actually bothered to add a 8-bit feel to the bushes, where you are actually able to see every pixel from a ♥♥♥♥ing mile away.\n\nAnd I thought that Dora the explorer had amazing game play, well the ♥♥♥♥ has just hit the fan, which makes me put this game #1 on my list.\n\nSee a ♥♥♥♥ing rainbow in the sky? ♥♥♥♥ it!

At first I was mad, but then Teague, my unicorn, reassured me, that this is not the end, but just the start, and trained my unicorn even more, and came in 7th place, I was so happy with my victory, that I told my mum, and showed her the blue ribbon which was given to me to prove my victory, where she then proceeded to tell me to ♥♥♥♥ off, and stop playing ♥♥♥♥ games like this, and ♥♥♥♥ing do something with my life, but what does she know...\n\nI suggest that you just surrender all your money, right here right now, and buy an infinite number of copies of this game.\n\nBut now...the only question left unanswered, that I bet has left millions of scientists baffled is...will it blend?\n\nIn conclusion, cover my nipples in nitro-glycerin, but this is just ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.\n","July 20, 2013","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You can also do quests such as killing zombies, burning enemy faction houses down and sparring. When your horse is powerful enough you can send them to fight to the death in the arena. If you win you get money to upgrade your farm.

It fills me with sadness when I realise that I will never be able to play training games involving tapping the arrow keys in time with the horse's movements with any of these other equines, care for them when they're sick, craft horseshoes from a variety of different metal types, create potions to improve their abilities, or send them to races and quests. And worst of all, they will never know the sheer joy I experience when I find any of the magic crystals scattered across the land.\n\n'Secret of the magic crystals' provides you with countless hours of entertainment and uncontrollable joy, however that will be replaced with deepest sadness once you realise you can't live these wonderful adventures in real life.\n\n10/10 would buy again, for me and all of my friends","July 22, 2013","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

A total sleeper.  Nonstop action, gripping plot, thought-provoking moral dilemmas it has it all!  I can't believe games like Skyrim and Diablo 3 get more publicity than this one.  I mean there is really nothing like it!  Yet if I had to compare it to another game I'd say it's more like a GTA4-Left 4 Dead-Toki Tori-Leisure Suit Larry-Silent Hill-Club Penguin action rpg strategy dating sim.  That said, Secret of the Magic Crystals is strictly for mature players.  The graphic violence, explicit language, full equine nudity, drug an alcohol use, and gritty depictions of gang culture may turn off some of the more sensitive.  But players not in that category or who can suppress their gag reflex will be rewarded handsomely with 1,000,000's of hours of game play in the single player campaign alone!
