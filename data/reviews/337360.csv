The fake CRT effect is not enjoyable, it can be turned off to see the true nature of this thing.\n\nIf you ignore the zombies and tries to continue in an empty lane you'll get teleported in front of the zombie and get hit.\n\nWhy the heck is it locked at 24hz in 1920x1080? also, don't tab out. Your game may crash/freeze.","June 1","false","0.2"," 109 of 130 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","109","130","7","7"

Predator, Cadillacs & Dinosaurs, etc. Hell, even the attract screens are similar, what with the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" and all (followed by brawling through streets lined with headshops and bongs in the windows, pot leaf posters, etc.). So, being the old-fashioned thirtysomething gamer that I am, I pulled out my arcade stick, plugged it in, and dropped it in my lap, ready to lay the smack down on some zombie ♥♥♥.\n\nHOWEVER... what the trailers and screenshots don't really tell you is that this isn't the '90s brawler it's framed up to be. Instead, it's like a mash-up of a mobile phone auto-runner and a rhythm game. Put Guitar Hero on its side, turn the falling skittles into zombies with crosshair hitboxes, turn your star power into lightning bolts and weed whackers, and you've got this game.\n\nThat's not to say it's bad. After getting over the "this isn't what I expected" factor, I started to enjoy the game. I think I got my $5 worth from it, I just feel that other people should be made aware of what the game really is before they buy it, as I'm seeing a lot of disappointed reviewers saying they expected the same as I did.","June 1","true","0.6"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","16","28","0","2"

Plus, as a huge character action nut, i'm too used to fast and stylish combat.\nSo, i wasn't really dissapointed with this game not being a classic beat-em-up.\nIt's more like... a rhythm game. Without music base.\nLet me explain.\nThe story is as simple as John Wick - some guys stole your pet (a very grumpy cat), it's time to get it back and kick ♥♥♥.\nGameplay consists of you endlesly running to the right, while zombies and other guys run towards you.\nYour dude (who looks totally awesome imho) has 4 attacks according to 4 face buttons - upper attack, forward attack, down attack and backward attack. Though, your main ones are first three, because backward one only used to punch zombies running from the left. They can also be chained in combo.\nBut you don't just punch them as you want, you need to attack them right in time, you want to aim for a perfect strike. Not only because it gives you more points and multiplier, but also because its needed for more effective killing, like some of zombies can be killed in one perfect instead of two normal strikes and so one.\nAlso, some enemies require using specific attacks in order to defeat them or to dismember them in order two acquiring projectile that can be used to kill more zombies.\nYou see, this game has so much killing and styling potential, you just need to understand how everything works, which is not hard considering that this game has a nice "How to Play" that tells you everything you need.\nAnd even if it IS repetetive, it's a fun game nonetheless, perfect in small doses.\np.s.\nBut, there's one But...\nWhat the hell this game has in common with Dead Island?\nNo, seriously, there's not much of Dead Island except zombies and tropics.","June 2","true","1.1"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","1"

The game feels soild and even keyboard controls feel good. You feel OP but the number of zombies on screen, will a good few times send you back to the menu screen. Clearly hints to old 10p arcade cabinets with "winners don't use drugs" and even a faded "A + Enter" button burnt on to the montior during play :).","June 2","true","0.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

The video options have choices for metaphysical shading and mfaa x100100  so its to be taken tongue in cheek fashion.

You rip tear and electrocute your way through a series of stages against everything from Zombie yuppy joggers to zombie dogs. including one type that looks suspsiciously like a Boomer from Left4Dead.
