Everything, including bullets and enemy death animations, are made of neon lines/dots. This is the game's biggest flaw and makes it extremely difficult to evade bullets since you can barely see them. It's troublesome to even find your cursor with so much happening on the screen.\n\nThere is almost no death penalty. Upon death, you restart at the same wave you were on when you died with all your powerups still active.\n\nCamera is also really weird. You have to be at the very edge of your field of view for it to start moving.\n\nI'd really only reccomend this game as a time waster. It's actually a really good time waster at that, albeit not the most polished one.","June 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

Every 10 waves there comes a boss spaceship. The enemy ships are outlined and illuminated. They have different shapes like snowflakes, butterflies, rockets, triangles or squares. Squares are the most dangerous. Beware of their bullets! After a screenwipe with a bomb suddenly many squares can appear around you and shoot you down. The whole time you have to dodge or at least escape them off the screen. I think it is easier to ram enemy ships instead to use your boardcannon (controlled over second joystick on XBox Controller). But in the end you will need all the powerups they drop (boost, bombs, health, lives).","November 25, 2015","true","1.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

The music (at the start) also sounds pretty okay and the visuals have a pleasant neon look. The game itself though is as basic as it gets. You shoot things. The same things in every level. Every 10 level there's a boss that is bigger and shoots more bullets at you at once. That's it. There's only an increase in difficulty (if you want to call it that) by increasing the number of things you need to shoot. There are a few upgrades like rapid fire or homing, but they are by far not enough to make the game any more interesting.\n\nThe idea of the game is very bland and the execution is even blander. It might pass as an homage to very early arcade titles, but even Tempest or Pac-Man make this look outdated. Not really worth your time.","December 25, 2015","false","3.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

That being said, I give this game a 8/10, and here's why:\n\nPros:\n- Great music\n- Challenging\n- Visuals are nice\n- Some good powerups\n- Radar is helpful\n\nCons:\n- Needs more enemies\n- Music for boss fights could change\n- Gameplay is nice, just like Asteroids\n\nAlso, it'd be even better if you could upload your own soundtrack(s) into the game, this way you can feel 'at home' while playing this.","June 30, 2015","true","1.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Its a fun shooter for 2 bucks. However, it feels unfinished. Getting hit should flash the screen or make a noise, but it doesnt. Dying just silently resets the wave instead of exploding your ship. Also, the screen is wierd. I had to minimize the resolution to get it to center. It might just be me, but its weird. Overall, a good game that needs  a bit of work. 7/10","June 30, 2015","true","0.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I don't know it just sound like a fun idea for a future update to me.\n\nOther than that for the price of the game and for what it really is,I would recommend this to a friend most likely. Mainly to a friend that loves oldschool styled games.","June 30, 2015","true","3.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The game control could have been a little more precise, I played the game with a PS3 controller. The camera feels like it is zoomed in to close and it takes a little to long to reposition itself. Your ship has health and takes damage when you run into enemies or are hit by enemy fire and you are given a few bombs that destroy the enemies around you. A map on the top right of your screen shows the location of your ship and enemies, but when you start fighting enemies from all sides it seems to get in the way more than anything else, it is useful to show the locations of dropped powerups though. Powerups can give you bombs, health, speed boosts, rapid fire, triple shots, and homing shots. The poweups will wear out over time but if your ship is destroyed you respawn at the start of the wave still keeping the active powerups that you had. There is not much regular enemy variety, they include a ship that shoots at you, one that attempts to dodge your shots, a group of ships that spawn in a row along one side of the map and travel back and forth trying to run into you, two unarmed enemies, and a very annoying type that appears in random spots in the map and shoots you. A large boss spawns every 10 waves as well as regular enemies, the bosses aren't too difficult to dodge and are easy to hit with their side. It is difficult to avoid the fire of the enemy type that appears near you and they are easy to crash into due to a combination of the camera, how close they appear to you, and because of the boost powerup. The game is not that good and there are better things to spend your money on, but it can be entertaining for a short time.","October 31, 2015","false","4.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

In that case my appologies for the following, but to me this game was not worth the (little) money I paid.\nUnfortunatley, Incandescent is an uninspired shoot 'em up. The graphics are simple copies of other "neon style" shooters. The enemies are repetitive and just disturbing, but not challenging. In several situations there is no visual/ acustic feedback, including when dying or when hitting  bosses. It is not really difficult, I had a hard time when getting bored after a few minutes (100000 score) to finally loose all ships, while still doing a bit of resistance, until I gave up at 200000 score.\nAfterwards I was hard thinking about anything new, special, well implemented, fun of this shooter, but I was not able to find anything.\nNot recommendable. There are others worth the money and fun.","July 3, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The game is well made and works great for a retro style twin stick shooter.  The graphics are done in nice classic arcade feel.  Where this game fails is the fact there is no leader board for Steam.  If the leaderboard was online this game would be something worth coming back to and playing but without that theres really nothing here.\n\nNice try in making something retro, but maybe next time they will put some more thinking into it and add online leaderboards, with multiple stats to give players something to do other than just mindless shooting.","August 10, 2015","false","2.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"
