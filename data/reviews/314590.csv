And there’s a distressingly large selection of games in exactly that genre, so that is high praise indeed.\n\nIn “room 13” you are given a minimal amount of instruction, with the exception of making it clear that playing with a mouse and/or keyboard is tantamount to near instant death. The player starts in a room with a weapon, and very quickly you are assailed by many varieties of what can best be grouped into “the undead”. And not 1980s undead, but 21st century “darn near fast as you” undead! (And just SO cute!) You have a limited amount of life and ammo, but there’s generally enough of both health and ammo to be found and collected. And you can find melee weapons such as pipe wrenches, hammers or crowbars (or you may pull one out of the head of some of your victims.) Melee make quite excellent weapons, in no way secondary to projectile weapons, but they wear out quickly. Killing in “room 13” is just about as fast and bloody as any I’ve seen. And just as quickly you will need to collect the gobs of flesh and brains before they dissipate.\n\nIn addition you occasionally notice a sort of breathing lung machine to be collected, and when you have enough of them you have won the round. At that point the player gets a brief respite from attack…..and choices to make.\n\nCertainly, as a beginner the choices are simple. The immediate goal is to gain the ability to advance. As such, all you’ll want to do at first is survive. As you do, and cumulatively kill more undead (“kill more undead”. Hmmm…), you gain “faces” and weapon parts. Faces and weapon parts are awarded for rounds won (but not likely as a beginner) and the number of dead. Each face has a set amount of life and perhaps a specific unique skill. Having more life and further skills is the key to the choices I mentioned earlier.\n\nOnce you clear a level, a door will open to the next room. The choice you have is “do I go through that door, or continue fighting in this room?” The reason to stay is you will be given the option, for a few seconds, to open boxes in a rapid search for weapon parts to build the most powerful weapon possible, from parts awarded as mentioned above. Then and only then will it be feasible to move on to the next room…IF you manage to stay alive for the entire next round, so you can take that more powerful weapon with you. This is not an easy game, but not stupid, crazy hard either. And SO MUCH fun!\n\nThere is far more to this game than in this brief description, but if this doesn’t get you interested, I suspect nothing will, since perhaps you think this just isn’t your type of game. But, in full disclosure, I would have said the same before I began playing. (I was swayed by the stellar graphics and the low sale price.) For five minutes or five hours, an excellent game (even at full price.)","November 17, 2015","true","2.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","1"

I haven't mastered the game but there is a lot to keep it fun and the developer has a lot of realistic plans for the future.\n\nCurrent game flow: Pick a mask, fight off a wave of monsters and collect their guts to make a red potion thingy. Get three and you finished the round! You can collect from packages that will appear or move to another room, or try a bit of both. You don't have a lot of time. If it sounds boring, I found it definitely a fun experience.\n\nThe art is just too good for words. You don't need to pay to see that. Or just judge for yourself.\n\nThe controls are great, I have trouble when trying to jump on the stairs in some rooms, while in other rooms it's easy. It might be my controller though since it sometimes sticks to move left now and then. There is no story mode yet but it's planned, and the game is most definitely a complete experience. Though I'm sure it will be much further improved even before full release out of Early Access.\n\nThe masks. There are quiet a few each with their own abilities. Most increase your health but all do health upgrading and/or an ability. The developer has stated that the final count will be around 33. Off the top of my head, there are around 9 now. One example is a gas mask that after enough shots or kills [forgot which if not both], will spew a gas when activated. I find it useful to say the least.\n\nThe music goes with the gameplay. I find music necessary but not a big thing for me so you might want to read other reviews regarding it. For me it's enough to keep the gameplay flowing.. but again I'm not big on music unless it's a game where music is part of gameplay or just super super great. Though it's absolutely not bad at all IMO.\n\nI almost forgot, the enemies aren't super varied but the individual enemies aren't your only concern. You have to deal with more and more of them, some different as you go each round. But also, there are unique traps for each room. I won't spoil them, but each is different and I think at least one room has two. I can't really remember in detail. I just know they aren't only against you.. if you are smart you can use them to kill enemies.\n\nMost importantly aside from me really enjoying the game at an early stage of development.. I have to vouch that the developer is on the best end of Early Access and after seeing them keep up with their work I found enough interest to give it an in-depth try.\n\nI am definitely looking forward to more of the masks and game design. I'll try to update this review again at least when out of E Access. MIGHT update now and then as it develops.\n\nAbsolutely recommended and despite having a review copy I put my money where my mouth is, and paid for a copy.","October 12, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/314590/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2359 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe mix of whimsical hand drawn style and gore is easy on the eyes and helps distract from the hand cramps of constant restarts.\n\nRoom 13 is a fast paced arcade experience filled with giblets, gun mods, and face collecting. With little direction given to players outside the tutorial, they are tasked with tearing apart waves of the undead in an arena style setting with guns that are limited by ammo, and melee weapons limited by durability. This means that avoiding and dealing damage is tricky and puts players constantly on the move up and down stairs. After each wave some piles of boxes and supplies pop up that can offer players gun mods, pickups like medkits, or a surprise zombie that could ruin a good run.\n\nThe mods can alter gun stats as well as how they behave, like the chaser gun part that makes bullets track down enemies, or the motorized arrow launcher which allows you to pick up the arrows after use. Surviving waves and obtaining mods unlocks mods that later have a chance to appear in boxes between waves.  After surviving a few rounds players will be able to carry secondary weapon that is also customizable. There are lots of mods to unlock, and while some are flat upgrades (like stocks that increase rate of fire), the finer parts of customizing are fun and keep runs fresh due to the random nature.\n\nAnother reward that keeps the game moving are the faces. The mask unlocks come in the form of 2 types of unlocks: a more forgiving tally of cumulative rounds survived, and the other masks are unlocked by surviving a certain number of rounds in a single life. These masks all come with a certain health amount attached as well as an ability such as eating enemies, releasing toxic gas, or charging across the screen. They are fun to collect and allow players to try out new strategies and push themselves to earn the next reward. The one small complaint here is that the masks seem a bit imbalanced: the earlier masks mostly have lower health and less potent abilities than later masks that have more health and powerful abilities.\n\nIn its current state there is only the arcade mode to get new masks and unlock mods, and it is a fun experience worth picking up. With only 2 recorded hours I have unlocked a fair bit, but the later mods and masks are still very far my reach and I am having fun hitting quick restart. The levels, each housing a different trap that hurts the player and enemies, are fun if not a little bit too much alike. The early access page states that there will be more levels, a story mode, and bosses, among other bits of content which should make this a stellar title. The developer also interacts quite a bit with community and is transparent and constantly bouncing ideas with everyone, which is always nice to see in an early access title\n\n*Will update with major updates or full release","May 7","true","2.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Love the difficulty of it as it adds a want to get better to dive deeper into the story and learn why you are there. Love the upgrade system for weapons and the way the game is styled makes it so beautiful. Wishing there was a multiplayer and also a way to dodge zombies a bit easier. Like being able to jump onto the staircases rather than having to walk up from the bottom.

At the begining the game is very hard but through playing you can unlock the tools to beat the game. The mechanics of the game are really awesome and new, and once you have adapted to move in the map you feel really good playing the game. The screenshaking and other VU are really good and contribute to immerse yourself in the game. Is really adictive and is good for a quick round before going to work :p. And the dev seems to be very focussed in the game and he is delivering a great product.\n\nNow the not so good things (Most of this things can change with time):\nSome of the rooms have weird movement stuff (Gallery and the Kitchen) that does not proves your ability, instead it becomes a luck thing and the AI also have struggle in those levels.\nThe achievements are really simple at the moment, through playing you can get all those an there is not a big challenge when you have some of the characters.\nSome of the weapons are unbalanced, this means that most of the time you will choose the same set up for your weapon.\nThere are some thing that bothers a lot because caught you of guard and you can not do anything to avoid that. For example: sometimes when you go to other room you get damage from deads that are already there and the screen is black for a little time, so you can do nothing.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a great game with a lot of potential, it has some issues but most of them can be corrected through time, and the dev seems to be able to achieve something great.","December 30, 2015","true","12.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Shoulder-charging over ammo/health/batteries collects them, but not the gibs.\nThis review was negative (2 of 5 people found it helpful), but since it seems that most of my qualms with the game have already been addressed, *Thumbs Up*\n\nHowever, I still wish we could shoot vertically somehow. Not straight up, as it might be reduced to some sort of twisted version of Space Invaders (why I only mentioned "diagonally" in the original review), but to have to either wait under a staircase or a ledge for the enemies to get into range (watching your back in the meantime, no doubt having to retreat into a throng anyway) or to try and jump so as to have them in-sight of your horizontally-inclined KillMachine (no doubt landing in a throng)... still am "jezt teh sux." Along with that precarious platform suggestion, 's'just my input on the Early Access.\n\nI did not intend for the original tone to be harsh, though it may have come across as such. I appreciated the game before and can actually recommend it now; I couldn't then, not for lack of want, but because my conclusions and conscience prevented.\n\nApologies and gratitude to DTownTony\n\n==\n\n\nOriginal Revie:\n\n\nI was actually very excited to play this.\nThis will probably be downvoted because I'm "jezt teh sux."\n\n\nFacts that detract:\n* You can't shoot diagonally.\n* You can't shoulder-charge up stairs (if you actually manage it (as I THINK I have), you'll probably just end up charging off that level).\n\nPersonal qualms:\n* KillMachine upgrades are random drops in crates.\nThere are lots of duplicates. Before starting the game, you can visit the Arsenal - "These are what spawn between rounds." Might as well not even show us that if we can do nothing with it, or have each component able to be viewed only when we collect them.\n* The sizes of the characters (er you and the grunt zombies) are such that the standard three-tiered stages could easily be six-tiered... if jumping was sacrificed... unless we could jump up through the levels. Jumping is hard enough to do as it is; trying to leap over enemies almost always fails, and trying to bound onto the higher level while on the stairs hardly ever works either. So it'd be no big loss.\n\nContradictory as ever, I feel like the levels are too cramped (as in "There's (")never(") a way out,") but suggest that cramming each stage with more levels would fix this... Precarious platforms that would collapse over time might work; I can appreciate how "hardcore" the swarms are, but when the only "defense" (as there's never enough ammo) is the unpredictable shoulder-charge...\n-(could have those platforms be as unpredictable; they might give way at random times - either after you jump off (thus smashing enemies below you) or while you're on it (decimating your health); have the chains holding them up be vulnerable to enemies' attacks)-\nThat, coupled with the inability to shoot diagonally, it takes no time for to have bodies falling and glomping onto you. The very sudden spawning of enemies (above, below and at the edges) - other than reinforcing "There's no safe place," - often results in half health disappearing before action can be taken.\n\n\nThe game is basically:\nFind an exploitable spot in the map, sit on it while you defend yourself. Only move when you get swarmed or need health/ammo. Struggle to get to that aid because (using a controller, even) either a few outliers will be out of range of your shoulder-charge (so you actually rush into those enemies' attacks) or you miss the stairs because you didn't have the stick angled just-so. It doesn't seem feasible to constantly be on the move, what with (y)our tendency to miss the stairs - because it's rare for there to ever actually be a more advantageous position, reflexes notwithstanding (ammo withstanding).\n\n\nI mean... you're paying for the art. The gameplay is par, nothing more (if not less)(at this time).\nI won't request a refund in the hope the game will actually become worth the money; because I appreciate the art enough; because maybe I'll be able to better reckon the game ("git gud").\nI can't recommend others to get the game, because I doubt many others would be as appreciative of the drawings; to own a game that (though, perhaps, "fun" to play (at times)) is so basic that it could easily be replicated in a Flash game.","June 29, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","3"

In order to proceed, you have to collect the blood and guts that the zombies eject, to then grab a vial of blood: after getting three vials of blood, the doors of the room open up and some crates appear. The crates either contain weapon improvements, weapon receivers, a secondary weapon, health or nothing.\nThe keyboard controls are rather awkward, so I recommend using a controller (if you own it, of course). The shooting feels really good, and the controls are responsive enough. Like with many horde games, it does tend to get repetitive after some time, and there currently isn't much variety in enemies and weapons, but the different rooms have various environmental hazards and the zombies are satisfying to kill.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game tends to be more frustrating than challenging: you will finish your clip too fast, and you are armless against the horde of zombies that's trying to eat you. It is also really easy to don't notice the vial of blood spawning, and if you don't take it, it will explode and damage you.\n\nSOUNDThe noises of the zombies and the gunshots are really good and effective, and the music gives you enough adrenaline and hurry to fight the zombies.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe game does get really addictive, and you will want to unlock all the different masks to get perks and gameplay variety. Plus, more features will be added in future updates.\n\nOverall, the game is well developed, but it does tend to get incredibly frustrating rather than enjoyable.

The base difficulty is a little high because enemies can come on-screen from pretty much anywhere, leading to some moments of taking damage that feel cheap.  If you're not careful, they can drop on your head very quickly as well.  It's a little hard to tell where the platforms allow for that.  Visibility is also a recurring concern - platforms are hard to make out, and the screen shaking from various events is overdone.\n\nBeing able to pick up a diverse number of melee weapons is pretty fun, though using them is so much more riskier than simply firing your gun - you get a lot of ammo and it's very easy to miss or take damage after you swing.  It's troubling because it's a lot of fun to melee, while firing your gun feels pretty mindless.  Nerfing ammo drops should help with this balance.\n\nFinally, the subtly different enemy types are also a nice feature.

It's challenging, requiring a pretty good awareness of ammunition, timing, and health amidst some pretty frantic action.

There are leaderboards tracking several categories, and that helps with a sense of reward as it finds its legs. There are already numerous unlocks in place, and what I'm digging most is the variety of means to play, even on a limited stage. Staying on one floor longer has its own rewards, and changes occur in the environment if you decide to push your luck (death trap activated!). Pushing on to the next floor is too tempting, usually, as I'm eager to see the next layout.\n\nGood job devs. Don't hate me for this, but it really does have a Binding of Isaac meets platformer feel.

The controls are not tight enough for what it requires you to do... This game is difficult! and if your not dieing because of the annoying stair navigation, your dieing because the game is cheap! Zombies can spawn  anywhere at any time and when you do manage to survive they put one in your reward chest to kill you!\n\n+ Nice graphics\n+ Nice gun feel\n\n- Too difficult!\n- Stairs...","July 28, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","1"

Start with the standard one screen, shoot enemies, grab upgrade style, then add in multiple rooms, death traps and more. Really fresh and inovative change to the standard. I really love it,\nNow, a video of me playing the game and being generally Worst Player NA. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQLdHaaNlGc","November 15, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
