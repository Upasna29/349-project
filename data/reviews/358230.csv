Guess i can't hate on it TOO much though since it's from 91 but i mean still, ive had text based games that were more thrilling. Just know that this game is exactly what it looks like with no challenge.","March 10","false","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

And its not a bad game but it has no background music. What you get instead is a beeping sound for each move... Yeah, its really annoying.\n\nAlso, some things dont make sense. Apparently, killing a spider with two boulders, turns the bolders into gems.","March 11","false","0.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Otherwise play Chips Challenge (it is a better game).  Also the sound sucks (even for it's age). The text sequences at the end of each episode go very slowly which is annoying. A few of the rooms have strange solutions.","April 8","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Can get frustrating at times, but if you keep your wits about you, you'll eventually figure out the more difficult levels.","May 28","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
