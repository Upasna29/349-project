Anomaly Korea is a Tower Offense game, instead of the traditional Tower Defence games. This makes the Anomaly Franchise stand out of other games.\n\nWith that said, the original intention of creating Anomaly Korea is to be played on mobile devices, rather than on a PC. As this is a game meant for mobile devices, it is pretty much the same as the gameplay style of the original Anomaly: Warzone Earth, just that you would realise that there are no keyboard shortcuts, making it unfriendly for PC gaming.\n\nFor PC gaming, my recommendation would be to get Anomaly: Warzone Earth or Anomaly 2, instead of Anomaly Korea as I find those meant for PC gaming more enjoyable and with keyboard shortcuts, making the overall gameplay more convenient rather than having to use the mouse all the time. Unless you are a hard-core fan of the Anomaly Series, don’t get this game and save up the money for Anomaly: Warzone Earth or Anomaly 2 for a better gameplay experience.","January 1, 2015","false","0.3"," 36 of 51 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","36","51","2","1"

It's a full package, with HD graphics and the exact same gameplay as the previous ones. It's also fairly lenghty, with 12 missions, ranging from easy to moderately difficult and there are a couple of new towers to keep you occupied as well. It's still a refreshing take on the tower defense genre.\n\nUnlike the other Anomaly games there's no commander to control this time, though. You'll only control the vehicles. It actually works better and keeps you focused on taking the correct route. Things can get pretty hectic after all and it's good to be able to see what's happening without having to worry about your commander all the time.\n\nKorea is another solid entry in the Anomaly franchise. If you liked the previous ones you'll like this one for sure.\n\n[Rating: 76/100]","January 16, 2014","true","5.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

It's a great franchise that reinvents an established formula in a very engaging way. I love the strategy and accuracy of keeping your convoy going, and the visuals are top notch. If I have any complaint it would be that the 12 story missions aren't enough. You could blow through this game in a day if you really try.\n\nWhat's Hot:\nBuilds off the successful formula while adding a fresh perspective to tower defense, planning routes ahead of time with the tactical map, plenty of explosions and pretty scenery, Art of War bonus stages.\n\nWhat's Not:\nPlays exactly like its predecessor, only 12 missions.","May 17, 2015","true","5.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

It bares no real differences besides the fact that this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile port where alt-tabbing will lead to certain doom. If you've never played the original Anomaly I'd suggest skipping this, but if you're adamant, let me tell you what you have in store for you.\n\nThis is a "tower-offense" game, the inverse of the usual tower defense. It's a short game, but there is a splendid variety of units for you to bring into battle, and towers for the enemy to set up. You will take on several story-based missions that serve as kind of a sequel to the original Anomaly (So if you've never played that, you'll have no idea what's going on here). The game challenges you in different ways such as preventing you from calling in more units, stopping you from acquiring more powerups (Very important tools you can use to give your units the edge in battle.), giving you a time limit, and etc.\n\nThe story isn't as in-depth (Nor is it necessary to experience before moving on to Anomaly 2), about every unit is recycled from the original, there are NO graphics options to speak of, nor any audio quality options.\n\nIt's a very unique concept but also much better done in the original Anomaly game rather than this crappy mobile port. It's ok, but really not a must-play unless you're head over heels in love with this series. I'll give this a 6/10. It's ok, it's not bad, but doesn't really live up to the name the original Anomaly made for itself. This PC port was clearly just made as a grab for money as the port itself has no effort put into it, and because of that, I cannot recommend you picking this up on PC.","May 15, 2015","false","1.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

It is a reverse-tower defense game (Anti-tower defense? Tower attack? Is there a good term for these?), where you control a series of up to 6 units which are moving through a hostile field of towers, attempting to take out the towers and make it to your destination. To assist in this, you have a number of abilities (heal, cloak, etc) which can give your units a bit more of an advantage. Through each mission you're graded on a number of different variables (destruction, speed, losses), allowing you to "medal" in a number of different ways.\n\nIt's a fun game, if kinda short. It's literally just more Anomaly: Warzone Earth, so if you enjoyed that, odds are you'll enjoy this. Achievements have been bugged on it and won't unlock correctly for MONTHS, but it sounds like they finally got fixed a few days ago, so there shouldn't be any problems. So yeah - good little fun, but only in the 3-4 hour range.","June 11, 2014","true","4.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Upgrades are fun, and you have to look at your game and follow closely to win, unlike a lot of others which you can just sit back and drink your coffee. Or beer. Or whatever it is you drink.\n\nPros\n\nMusic\nGameplay as a reverse tower defense is interesting\nGraphics for this kind of game is good\nActually has a small storyline you can follow\n\nCons\n\nOnly 12missions\n\nGameplay\nI've not played any other Anomaly games before this, so bear that info in mind.\nA strategy reverse tower defense game, you set our your troop's directions on a map based on the mission purpose and the enemies  dotted around it. Once you've worked/planned out your route, you then watch the results of your choice with the option to add boosts, repairs,  and abilities to improve your troop's chance of succeeding their mission.  You have to be careful about where and when you use your boosts and upgrades to increase your success in a mission. You can get extra vehicles and boosts added during the level as well.\n\nIt's a simple game limited in what you can do as you follow a predetermined path that you set up at the start. The birds eye angle makes it visually easier to see how your units progress and what's coming up.\n\nThe graphics are quite good for this type of game, and the effects are pleasing. Its basicly a war tower offense game and that is what you can see on the graphics. The shooting- the towers- everything looks just really nice. And not to forget... EXPLOSIONS\n\nIt's like a reverse tower defense game. Instead of you building the towers, you're the mobs running through the defenses, trying to survive. The different POV here to this type of game is something I like.\n\nYou complete missions for cash and bonuses, increased by the score you gained. Completing gives gold and a score, which can be used for upgrading and purchasing/unlocking new vehicles. Your missions are timed as well, making you choose the shortest path with the least resistance, though it seems quite a lot of the time the shortest path is the hardest and riskiest for your units.  It depends as well on the enemies you have to face as some are a lot more lethal than others. I find it gets challenging quite fast which leaves you needing to use your boosts and gold to make it through the missions, which can limit the chance to upgrade. It's also tactical to be able to rearrange the order your vehicles move in, especially when they're taking a lot of damage to save them.\n\nThe running dialogue from the characters/units at the start of each mission and during help to give it a more urgent feel to the missions.  You don't really get personal info about them, just their reactions in the war zone, and a brief statement of the mission at hand. Though the story isn't amazingly detailed, there is one there and you do know what you're doing the missions for.\n\nThe music for this game is actually really interesting during the selection menus - easily the kind you would expect in a movie.You can hear the influence of Korea in it and a driving rhythm makes the game a lot more atmosphere and tense. However, it doesn't take over the game and distracts the player, so it leaves you room to be able to focus on what is happening, so big plus there.\n\nIt's surprisingly engaging for a game where you design the outcome at the start then follow through. These kind of games have the potential to get boring really fast because of the limited interaction /direct control  you have, as in you don't personally drive the vehicles through the map – they follow the path that is set out. As a reverse tower defense game, I actually really like this.There is the option for more game modes so there's more to do after you complete the main missions, which is nice.\n\nSeems quite a short game, only 12 missions. I'm aware it's an expansion, though I still think they could have done a little bit more. Though having said that there is some extra gamemodes as well\n\nWant moar?\nClick here to join my steam group and Click here to follow my curator page!","December 17, 2015","true","2.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

As I said in previous Anomaly: Warzone Earth review, the idea is quite enticing, however in the end it's too repetitive. Piotr Musial does a fine work in the music department. It is also worth mentioning that Anomaly Korea is more suited to tablet computers and smartphones with touch controls.\n\nThe game has also only one video setting to adjust and it will run fullscreen. I would not recommend purchasing Anomaly Korea for your PC. However, if the game looks interesting and the idea of tower attacking entices you - you might like Anomaly: Warzone Earth on steam or Anomaly: Mobile Campaign on smartphones - and I think the game series is better suited on-the-go so Mobile Campaign would be my choice.\n\nOverall the series has potential but I find it very average and not motivating to play. It has some good ideas but I'd say most people would find the game dull in short time. In small doses it's not that bad - however with world full of games, there are probably better ones to spend your time with.","December 2, 2013","false","4.5"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

(I have played this game a LOT more than 13 minutes)\n\nAnomaly Korea is a top-view reverse tower defense game, when you are in control of a task force whose goal is either destroy all towers or get to a certain point on the map. The game starts off after the events of the original Anomaly. You play as a commander fighting a war against a race of sentient alien machines (that is literally what they are called). They have now targeted korea, and you are the only thing in the way of the machines at the moment. So, lets get to the review.\n\nPros:\n- Good graphics, great visual effects.\n- A variety of vehicles at your disposal. From mechs to tanks to mobile shield generators.\n- You can change the formation of your convoy. (protip: keep your most powerful unit at the front to soak up damage)\n- There are special tactics you can use in the battle. You can use anything from healing to smokescreen.\n- Campaign is really good. Got me hooked in the first 10 minutes.\n- (I think this is the best part) you can change the course of your units mid-battle, which allows you to make split decisions when something new shows up.\n- Runs smoothly even on weak computers with decent graphics.\n\nCons:\n- The game gets a little repetetive later on.\n- You have to play the first game in order to understand what actually happened beforehand. (for instance: where did these machines come from? What is their goal other than destroy everything?)\n- No multiplayer. :(\n\nOverall, this game is a great game to get if you are into reverse tower defense games. It mixes strategic path making and fast reaction skills to make an excellent strategy game. It's graphics are pretty good for being a port from a mobile game. There are actually uses and purposes for having certain units in your convoy.\n\nI give this game a 7/10 (Definitely worth a look). This game is awesome if you are a fan of strategy and tower defense. If you are new to the franchise, I highly recommend this game to start off with. The storyline is gripping, and it actually feels like you are fighting a war against giant robots.","November 23, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a reverse tower defense game(where you actually have to FIGHT the turrents, and YOU are the "invader"). This game takes place a bit into the future, when aliens suddenly invade near the troop deployments in Korea. Your job is to navigate through the city and get out in one piece.\n\nI. Gameplay:\nTo be honest, it isn't too much of a blast. You simply click on certain things to power them up, or every once in a while change the path of your military so they do not get wrecked by the alien turrents. You can use money you earn by killing alien turrents to purchase new vehicles. That is pretty much it. I got pretty bored after the 1st level. I did some research and found out this is a port of a game on the Appstore. Ports of mobile games are not good, and this is an example.\n\nII. Graphics\nThis game in my opinion has good graphics. Nothing near a AAA Title, but definitly doesn't look like a pile of garbage. This game is around 700MB, and has appropriate graphics for that size. It has a unique graphics style which looks good for a game, too bad the gameplay can't match the pretty good graphics.\n\nIII.Logic\nThis game has good logic. Nothing seems too out of place, and your character does not do wildly stupid things. Your character acts and feels human, which feels good. The idea of aliens invading does not have any things out of place.\n\nIV.Replayability/Multiplayer\nI do not see why you would play this again, and no, there isn't multiplayer.\n\nFinal Score: 4/10. There are not any bugs/glitches that I could find , the game just lost a ton of points for its boring gameplay.

It’s more casual too so if you didn’t like the intensity of dodging alien weapons fire with your little commander unit, you might find Anomaly Korea more relaxed. 6.5/10\n\nDon’t worry if you haven’t played Anomaly Warzone Earth or Anomaly 2 since the stories aren’t tied together very tightly. All three stories take place in different parts of the world and while the gameplay is very similar in all the games, there’s only a high level overarching story to them. In fact, since Anomaly Korea is a simplified version, you might want to start with this game first and move on to the other 2 if you enjoy the concept.\n\nJust like in the other Anomaly games, the story of Anomaly Korea follows a military commander (you) trying to survive after an invasion by alien gun towers that sprout up out of the ground all over the world. As the name suggests, this time the action is in Korea (not that it really matters) and your job is to guide convoys of military vehicles out of harm’s way while blasting as many of the towers as you can.\n\nAnomaly Korea is a “reverse tower defense” game where the map is filled with various enemy towers, and it’s your just to survive getting through to the end. You see the action in a top down map overview perspective and can modify the path that your units travel through the city streets (to avoid or seek out confrontation). Just as there are a bunch of different types of towers, you have a bunch of different units that you can pick and choose from to build your small convoy. Build a decent force and upgrade them with money you find on the map to make it through each level. Your biggest advantage is the ability to use special “skills” such as repair and smoke screen to power up or defend your vehicles as they pass through hostile territory. You pick up the skills which are often dropped by destroyed enemy towers. The maps are pretty linear with very little room for creativity, but as I said before the game is pretty casual on the lower difficulties.\n\nPros:\n+Gameplay is very similar to Anomaly Warzone Earth and Anomaly 2, except this time you don’t control a little man running alongside your vehicles, you just guide the vehicles in your convoy and “cast” your skills on map areas.  If you’ve played the previous games you can just dive right into Anomaly Korea and kind of breeze through the tutorial. In other words, the game is a lot simpler.\n+The game has easy Steam achievements and it drops trading cards. That’s reason enough to spend 3 hours of your time playing right? Additionally, for its small download size (about 600 mb) the game has decent graphics.\n\nCons:\n-This is a mobile port, and it shows. There are very few (if any) game options and everything is controlled with your mouse. There are no keyboard shortcuts or game graphics options. It’s a shame because keyboard shortcuts would really make some of the fast paced levels easier.\n-The game is really short. 3 hours start to finish for the campaign.\n\nOverall, if you liked the other 2 Anomaly games, you can give this one a try. The download is about 600 megabytes and you can chill as your cars themselves drive around blasting aliens under your excellent tactical supervision.\n","May 19, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a result you never use the keyboard and everything is done with the mouse. Which is annoying because it means there are no hotkeys.

The mechanic  of the hacker tower has changed and you no longer have to exit its area of effect. Instead you have to use your mouse to click three buttons. Everything else is the same. One of the cons of this game is that there are only 12 missions that are relatively easier than the first game.

In my opinion, Anomaly Korea is way easier than main game or Mobile Campaing. Really, the only levels I had some trouble was the last one in campaing and first one in trials - the campaing one is really complex and the one in trials... well, let's say it was hard only because my lack of creativity. Graphics, music and almost everything is same, like in previous Anomaly games but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. The only problem is, like with Mobile Campaing, Anomaly Korea is a game which I can recommend only for fans of series. Even TD games fans have sometimes liking it since you are the one making attacks, so if you are not familiar with Anomaly games it's better to check out main game first and if you will enjoy it, then you will love everything from this series.","January 23","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, what you can expect from it? 12 levels and few "Art of War" trials. Not so much but you can spend a few hours playing it and even more if you are trying to unlock every achievement. In my opinion, Anomaly Korea is way easier than main game or Mobile Campaing. Really, the only levels I had some trouble was the last one in campaing and first one in trials - the campaing one is really complex and the one in trials... well, let's say it was hard only because my lack of creativity. Graphics, music and almost everything is same, like in previous Anomaly games but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. The only problem is, like with Mobile Campaing, Anomaly Korea is a game which I can recommend only for fans of series. Even TD games fans have sometimes liking it since you are the one making attacks, so if you are not familiar with Anomaly games it's better to check out main game first and if you will enjoy it, then you will love everything from this series.","January 23","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
