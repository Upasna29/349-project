This one still brings in something new, though. Let's assume you know the premise, last tank defending Earth from invading Titans, etc.\nThe aliens are varied, both in their looks, toughness and attack patterns, and the end bosses are screen-filling, multi-target monsters. This gives an old-school arcade feel for "Learning the level" Meanwhile you will be trying to earn money to upgrade your weapons, shields, etc in the hope that you will gain an edge over the enemy.\nThe looks are divisive. Very retro graphically, with screen warps (that can be turned off) to really evoke the 8-bit days. The price is very reasonable, especially when I consider what I would have paid coin by coin playing this in the arcades.","November 30, 2013","true","8.4"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","1"

Innovative, advanced, and scores of fun to be had.\n\nWhen aliens living on Titan, Saturn's moon, decide to attack, they lay waste to Earth's military forces. Well most of it. You are the last remaining Tank Commander on Earth, and you are one bad mofo. Battle your way across Earth to stop the invasion, and then you take it to the skies as you hit the Titans' outpost on the Moon, and obliterate it. Next stop, the Titans' Martian colony. They wiped out all the little green men also and need to pay. After Mars, you find yourself on Saturn, and the enemy forces are strong. But not as strong as when you reach Titan itself, taking on the nest of the alien scourge to nearly end our way of life... and the poor Martians.\n\n5 levels, 5 mothership bosses, an entire armada of Titan forces, some rogue and oddly light blue asteroids, and 1 lone tank to destroy them all. Fight your way across the Solar System as you upgrade your tank; outfitting it with extra weapons, additional bullets, faster recharge time, more powerful attacks, Shields, and deadly Smart Bombs. You start out small, but by the time you reach Titan, the force of your tank is ridiculous. But that doesn't mean it's easy. Each world you come to is upping the difficulty, more enemies, more styles of fighting, and a tougher Boss.\n\nNot to mention fun bonus Challenge stages after every 7 waves you defeat, where harmless yet swift yellow flying saucers shoot across the sky. Destroy them all with perfect aim and you get bonus prices.\n\nThis game is complete with Highscore boards showing the scores of other players across Steam. Compare your best with others and strive to be the best. All the while this game's gloriously beautiful soundtrack playing in the background as you squash Titan scum.\n\nThe tank comander from the original Space Invaders would be jealous to see the rig you are in control of now.","May 20, 2014","true","15.6"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","2"

Zone progression occurs when its boss is defeated. There are a total of five zones, each containing twenty levels, with their own unique design. Once all five have been defeated, it loops back to Earth, albeit with a slightly higher difficulty.\n\nThe game mechanics are fairly straightforward; aim & kill. Fortunately, that doesn’t do Titan Attacks! the justice it deserves. The mechanics conspire in such a way to exude a simple & fun experience. There are a number of boosts & improvements that can be purchased between levels to mitigate your success. For example, there are powerful area-of-effect bombs, weapon add-ons, additional shielding & more. Currency is derived from killing enemies & also capturing them. Capturing enemies adds a unique dimension to some situations, as doing so can be lethally dangerous, but extremely profitable. The Titans have a wide arsenal of ships & weapons that change in function & attitude from zone to zone, which can easily lead to your undoing if not cautious. There are bonus rounds that gauge your accuracy & reward you accordingly so keep nimble. These rounds occur between levels, after every seventh level.\n\nThere isn’t really any story, beyond what’s presented visually but that’s really to be expected with an arcade shooter. The sound is also quite typical of the genre, with generally the same music repeated throughout. The graphics while pixelated, are visually appealing, with colors & art that mesh together nicely.\n\nFor high score hunters, your high score is saved onto online leaderboards. So you can show off your skills or lack of them to your friends.","January 20, 2015","true","19.3"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","22","28","0","1"

Ok, that's two words, but you get my point. If you like these types of games, Titan Attacks will surely quench your thirst.\n\nThe basic formula is the same, you're on the ground - you shoot at alien scum coming from the air, sometimes the alien scum are smart enough to eject from the ship and parachute down to the ground - shoot them for extra points. All really simple. The game is strengthened by an upgrade system. Between each level, one can buy; shields (which deteriorate for each hit) and smartbombs, upgrade; gun power, add mode guns, recharge speed and more bullets. It's an alright system that does make you feel like you've grown and become more powerful throughout the levels.\n\nThere are extra bonus levels which put some tension to the game as if you pass them successfully, you will be able to upgrade quicker.

Your quest is to destroy incoming race by moving the cannon to the left-right while shooting. Easy? Not really. The enemies want to destroy your cannon by shooting and getting closer to you. You need to be really fast and precise to finish every wave without a scratch. The game brings a lot of fun and give you the possibility to work on some abilities like reflex, focus and patience.\n\nSo who wins? You and your cannon or the whole Titan race?\n\nBesides the main goal to destroy incoming enemies you also have many things to do in the game.

Its polished visuals and basic core gameplay are well executed. However, control and pacing issues outweigh these positives.\n\nTo achieve fast movement, you must play with a mouse. And yet, the game does not lock your cursor to its window, nor does it lock in fullscreen mode with multiple monitors. If your mouse leaves the game, your movement is dropped. Players with multi-monitor setups have to disable all but one monitor to reliably play Titan Attacks, which is absurd.\n\nSo the mouse controls want you to play in fullscreen, which is cumbersome but manageable. But at least on Linux (haven't tested on Windows), minimizing while in fullscreen mode effectively crashes the game. I lost a couple hour-long sessions to this minimization crash, which is the biggest reason for my non-recommendation.\n\nAfter each level, you are placed in a shop menu for purchasing tank upgrades. Given the brevity of levels, this menu seriously disrupts the flow. You can max out your ship quite quickly, rendering the shop nothing more than a health/bomb restore option, or more frequently, a "continue" button you must click before proceeding. I like the shop system, but wish it were integrated in a non-invasive manner.\n\nTitan Attacks has clean, basic, and enjoyable gameplay.

Suddenly, it seems the universe has colluded to tease you all along as a few stray shots catch you off-guard and end your fantastic run.\n\nBut, fear not!  Titan Attacks has your back!  Every twenty levels creates a permanent snapshot of the best ship you've built up to that point, allowing you to begin from that milestone again and again!  At last!  We never had anything like that when slogging through toward Galaga's kill screen back in the day.  (Though, as of the time I write this review, a patch has been introduced because some dedicated players found a way to do just that and cause interger overflows in the score.)\n\nTLDR:  It's beautiful, classic shooting with enough upgrades and polish to keep you entertained for hours.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PerfectVictim/recommended/203210/","PerfectVictim","Super Fight Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PerfectVictim/","1016 products in account","A textbook example of why arcade games need a win condition or some sort of end point, even when the point is just surviving for as long as possible and beating your last high score. Because without this, one of two things will inevitably happen:\n\nA: If the difficulty of the game is constantly becoming higher through an algorithm rather than for example a large number of hand-crafted enemy waves cycling through harder and harder variants then it will eventually lead to the game becoming literally unsurvivable. For example, imagine a version of Tetris where the downward speed of the tetrominoes eventually reaches a point where it is impossible to reach the edges of the screen before the tetrominoes reach the bottom of the screen.\n\nB: If the game DOES use hand-crafted enemy waves or, say, maybe the algorithm just stops working after a while then we're gonna find ourselves in a game where the difficulty just stops going up after a while. This is what most older versions of Tetris do, meaning the score can easily be counterstopped when then player has reached a certain skill level. (but any later iteration of tetris except TGM is going to be significantly worse for other reasons, even if that got fixed.)\n\nNow, I can SORT OF live with outcome A here. Inevitably dying does become a climax of sorts, even if it means all players of a high enough skill level have almost identical scores. It's obviously not elegant and more often than not reaching this point will take a really long time and that's probably gonna get really boring, but eh.\n\nOutcome B, however? Yeah, we're gonna have a problem, you and I.\n\nNext to "Every Extend Extra Extreme", "Titan Attacks!" is the most extreme example of this problem in, like, any videogame  that is sold for money. That I know of, obviously.\n\nThat playtime of around 3 hours? The vast majority of it is my second and final game. The difficulty plateaus almost IMMEDIATELY, leaving only extreme boredom and the existential dread of slowly realizing that the only way out of this madness is deliberately killing yourself just to end it all. Seriously guys, this is NOT fun and i'm almost convinced that people who have reached the kill screen of Donkey Kong or Pac-Man have actual mental illnesses. At that point those games have long ago been squeezed of all challenge and enjoyement. Congratulations, you have completely and utterly mastered the game. Now for the love of god, stop playing!\n\nWhat's special about "Titan Attacks!" is that this special realm of suffering usually reserved for people who cannot let go of their favourite games long after they have completely demolished them becomes instantly accessible to basically everyone. In a way, it made me understand those people far more than "King of Kong" could ever hope to. This is not a recommendation of any kind, by the way. Explaining it with words is sufficient and doesn't make you feel like a part of you has died, so that's what i'm gonna do now. It's kind of a miniature version of the psychological process MMORPG developers exploit to make their players keep playing and paying their monthly subscription. It was actually kind of hard to stop playing, knowing that my score and progress would vanish the second I stopped playing. It was that same sense of "Hey, i've spent all this time on this already, so it must have been worth it, right?" with a second, suppressed voice crying "Oh god i'm wasting my life away, aren't I?"\n\nSo there I found myself, spending three freaking hours mindlessly making the numbers go up in a game that makes you feel actual suffering. I got this game for free but it feels more accurate to say that I was subjected to it. Moral of the story? Don't play this game and more importantly, don't make a game that can be likened to it.\n\nSeriously.

That's the long n' short of it, minus the long.\n\n\nSo what is the long of it? Well...\n\n\nFirstly, presentation! The game takes on an 8-bit styled aesthetic; The game's rather high res, but all graphics are styled in a blocky fashion with thick black outlines. Alongside this, particle effects are large pixels, and there's a bunch of filters and shaders on the game that make it look, um, arcade-y? Like, you've got scan lines, and a lot of things glow in this weird way as if you're, er, looking at a screen. It's hard to explain without just showing pictures of the game itself. There's also these more abstract effects where the game screen distorts or wraps around the the edges of the monitor; It was kinda cool the first few times it happened, but it did get on my nerves after a while. Thankfully, it only happens on menus, not during heated space battles, and you can toggle the various distortions off in the options menu (Options are Stroboscopics, Shader FX and Distortion FX).\n\n\nThere isn't a ton of music, but what's there is pretty jammin'. It's all techno, ranging from softer tracks, like during the main menu and shop, to more intense pieces during the actual stages. Stages are over pretty quick too, so it's never like you're listening to any one piece for an lengthy period of time, making them harder to get tired of. Still, there are audio sliders in the options menu for both sound effects and music in case you don't care for either. Might not wanna turn off sound effects though, as each hazard has it's own very distinct sound effect that'll keep you notified as to what's going on around you when things get more chaotic in the later stages; whether it's mines being laid, saucers flying across the top of the screen, or a charging laser beam, you'll more than likely need to keep an ear open for telltale signs of doom.\n\n\nBut enough of that, what about the actual game? Well, you control a tank going left and right across the ground and shoot aliens, most of which fire back at you and descend in some way or another. Occasionally you'll see a saucer flying at the top of the screen behind everything; it'll drop bonus-points, cash, shields, health, screen clearing bombs, or super cannons when you shoot it down, making the game a little easier on you if you can shoot it down. Alongside that, enemies have a chance to fall to the ground instead of exploding when you blast them, and you can shoot them again for a "skill-shot" for extra points and money (Though they'll damage you if they crash into you). Alongside THAT, there's a chance that a martian will parachute out of the ship. These guys are a little trickier, 'cause you can pick them up for cash bonuses, but you can also accidentally kill them for no point/cash bonus, and if you don't pick them up, they escape and result in a cash deduction equal to the cash bonus you could've gotten otherwise.\n\n\nWith all these basic factors in play, alongside all of the hazards, battles become about good spacial awareness and quick decisions about what course of action should be taken: "I could try and get that saucer for it's bonus, or I could catch that alien to keep me from losing money and get some bonus cash... The alien's floating over an area of heavy fire though... It might be more trouble than it's worth, and I won't get the saucer in time if I go to it. I don't want the cash penalty though... I think I'll kill it, then real quickly get the saucer." Of course, if you don't make that rambling monologue of a decision quick, you'll be space dust. You'll have a lot to think about, and not a lot of time to think about it. Gotta be fast! All of this is helped by the fact that you move around by shifting the mouse left and right, so your speed is bound to how fast you can move it, and thus, is more or less infinite. This allows you to go mach 5 underneath low hanging projectiles and ships, making it possible to make those quick choices under the pressure and chaos of a full on martian assault.\n\n\nIn between stages is a shop to spend the money ya get, obviously, on health and weapons. There are repairs, which get more expensive the less damaged your tank is, screen clearing bombs, which get more expensive as you buy them through the game, cannon damage, cannon fire rate, add-ons (Other weapons), and add-on fire rate. It's pretty straight forward, and it's not like you have a whole lot of options, especially since you can't choose what add-ons you get (You purchase them in a specific order). Even then, the add-ons don't really change the gameplay too much; You've got left-side laser, right-side bigger-laser, left-side rocket launcher, and right-side laser beam. It all just kind of adds up to a large flurry of projectiles that don't add much of a tactical edge, but they're useful nonetheless.\n\n\nThe design of the different worlds were also very nice. Every twenty stages, after a boss fight with the mother ship of that world (Which, while fun, were never all that noteworthy), you go to the next planet: Earth, The Moon, Mars, Saturn, and finally, the alien home world of Titan. The changes of scenery were nice, but the new hazards were what really differentiated them. You see, this game, while being a Space Invaders homage, incorporates elements from other really old space games/shooters. Earth is simply Space Invaders, nothing more. Starting with the Moon stages, you'll be showered with neon blue asteroid outlines that split when you shoot them, which is a homage to... Well Asteroids. The Mars stages have their ships spin around in lines before taking formation for a short period of time, the dive bombing your tank, which is a homage to Galaga. I don't actually know what the Saturn stages homage; The idea behind those stages is that massive hordes of ships will descend from the top of the screen and try to collide with you before warping back to the top. Finally, Titan introduces these trains of enemies that go back and forth and split/drop stationary ships when you shoot them, which is how the Millipede in the game of the same name behaved. Every planet provided something new to keep the shooting more varied and interesting, and did so by providing tribute to some similar titles of gaming's history; I'd say it worked!\n\n\nAnd for you score-junkies out there, the game doesn't have to end by the time you beat the 100th stage! After laying waste to Titan's flagship, you're instantly placed back at the first stage of the game with all of your upgrades, the same score, and more durable enemies. I think this goes on endlessly until you die, but I wouldn't know since I never made it to the end boss on the second run. Anyway, this allows you keep building that hi-score and show off on the global leaderboards; y'know, if you're into that.\n\n\nI do have a few minor complaints, such as how there's no invincibility period when being hit, and how some stages have layouts that'll corner you very easily. Mix both factors together, and you've got a recipe for a near insta-death. It doesn't happen TOO often though, so whatever.\n\n\nAnyway, I gotta wrap this up. It's a very nice looking and fun Score Attack/Space Invaders & Friends inspired game. It's a bit on the pricey side for what it is though... I'd only really get it if it's in a bundle, on sale, or you know someone who's into the Score-Attack genre/Looking for a late 70's gaming nostalgia trip. In those cases, I'd really recommend it!\n\n\nBut in the end, it's all just my humble opinion. Cross-reference mine with others and see if it's a game for you.\n\nBottom Line: Titan Attacks is a game you get to shoot aliens and beat Admiral Nyaruko's 10 DIGIT SCORE. Jesus Christ, At least I'm in the top 10... For now...\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","May 19, 2015","true","11.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Is it Galaga? How about both! Titan Attacks is straight up old school gaming with a fresh coat of paint. It begins innocently enough as a Space Invaders clone with an upgrade system. As the game progresses, it suddenly turns into Galaga (while keeping the same gameplay!), and then finally a strange fusion of the two.\n\nOne problem I have with this game, similar to Ultratron, is that there's just too much stuff to keep track of, and too many blinky lights that make it difficult to see what you should actively be avoiding. You can turn off some of the strobe effects, but that doesn't help with the bombs exploding left and right, bullets flying from every direction, enemies flying right in front of you, power ups and cash you need to grab, aliens you need to not-shoot and grab, and so on.\n\nAnother problem with the game is that it is on the stingy side when it comes to money. Money is basically your lifeline. It is imperative that you keep your ship up-to-date in weapons or you will find that enemies take far too many hit before you're swamped in swarms. Unfortunately you do not automatically repair between levels and even trying to maintain a modest 3 health per level can become cost prohibitive. The solution, of course, is not to get hit in the first place, but that's kind of difficult with all the nonsense that comes flying at you.\n\nIt's a tough, yet fun diversion, and doable to boot. It's a game you can probably beat in a day, and may possibly cause much frustration in doing so. There's no plot or anything, it's just pure arcade action, and to its credit it does it well.\n\nOne concept I often talk about is "quarters". Pretend this is an arcade cabinet and you have to pop in quarters to play. How would this game measure up, relative to its price? For the amount of time invested, cost of a few quarters, and return value in entertainment, I'd say this ranks up there. If you need some way to kill time waiting for something, this is a nice, mindless way to do it. I think this game would be a lot of fun with simultaneous multiplayer capability.","April 25, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't write reviews. I write opinion and impressions pieces, meaning the detalization may vary from just general feelings about a game to indepth critique of particular game mechanics. Read if you're interested to know if I like a game or not (and for what reasons), which parts intrigue me and which parts push me away, but don't expect in-depth description of all gameplay and systems. Thank you.\n\nTitan Attacks is a remake of the classic Space Invaders. On steroids. With upgrades and a big enemy variety, and by the end it gets so intense that it transforms into a bullet hell game. The distortion effects on the screen are very annoying though, but, luckily, you can turn them off. So, all in all, it’s pretty cool. If you were into these classic games, or want to try out a modern (though still fairly faithful) take on said classic games, then you should try it out.\n\nIn fact, I think more classic games should get a modern take like Titan Attacks (which seems like what PuppyGames is doing anyway). … Hm. I think I just got inspiration for what kind of game my next side project should be. Thanks, PuppyGames!\n\nAlthough, on a side-note, I have to say that due to all the upgrades you can get, and how many enemies there can be, the strategic value of having to time your shots well (which was present in Space Invaders and the beginning stages of Titan Attacks) gets diminished, which is somewhat saddening. On the other hand, the curve of starting with the more slow-paced and strategic Space Invaders and then transforming into a hectic bullet hell provides a nice flow and pace to keep you interested throughout all 100 waves (at least on the first playthrough before you start over with all your upgrades intact).\n\nSo, yeah.

Mouse control is far superior because it gives you more control over the ship's position.  Firing with the mouse will make your finger hurt, though.  The cursor doesn't lock to the window, so you will take damage and ruin your multiplier when you accidentally click outside it on your second monitor or just outside the window.\n\nI also have complaints about design aspects.  The gun feels clunky and random. It isn't fun to use, which is kind of important in a game like this.  The addons feel similarly random.  The game is too focused on score rewards instead of money rewards that would allow you to buy more items and get stronger faster by playing well.  The only way skill can improve your power increase speed is by killing saucers, which sometimes drop money (usually it's a score bonus, though) or by catching the falling alien pilots.\n\nKilling the pilots results in no bonus, but allowing them to fall makes you lose money you already have.  This is really stupid.  Sometimes the falling ship is right on top of the pilot, making it impossible to hit it without killing the pilot or to catch the pilot without getting hit.  Sometimes, there's just too much ♥♥♥♥ going on to catch or shoot the pilot, meaning you lose all that money.  I don't understand this choice and think it's far too punishing.\n\nBetween the technical problems and the weird design choices,  I don't recommend this game. It's fun maybe fifteen minutes at a time, though, if you like centipede-style shooters.  I would save and quit about that often if I continued to play to rest my finger.","August 3, 2014","false","1.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Frequently suffers from "How do you expect me to dodge THIS?!" syndrome, and long-term victory is completely determined by how much money you happen to get in the first 30 levels or so (which is mostly a random factor), and whether you can beat the bonus challenges to save money. Expect to restart the game a lot until you can get a run where you beat the first three bonus challenges, and get enough random money drops from hitting saucers, to earn enough upgrades to make progess through the ridiculous levels later.\n\nBut I'm still giving this a thumbs-up for looking, sounding, and handling smoothly.

It's purely an arcade-style experience: start a game and continue until you die, going for the high score. Your score will mostly be determined by how long you can go without taking a single hit; one hit won't kill you, but it will reset your multiplier that increases when you beat a level. You also buy upgrades between levels, which are vital to surviving later in the game.\n\nIf this sounds interesting to you, then it's probably worth picking up. The gameplay is solid, the art and sound is pretty cool, it controls pretty well once you get a few powerups, and the replay value is great.

BUT, this is good. Because of you missed any of the challenge mode achievements; you can go right back into achieving them.\n\nTons of fun. The ability to upgrade your ship is brilliant. The idea of especially the cash system overall is brilliant, and the saucer drops are brilliant.\n\nThis game was a brilliant creation, and is definitely worth the money if you are looking for an enjoyable game to let your mind get into.","February 13, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riffer/recommended/203210/","riffer","Jeff The Riffer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/riffer/","249 products in account","I kind of wish Steam allows us to give games ratings rather than a yes/no recommendation, but at least we get to make reviews now! So first off, I like all of Puppy Games products. They've got a consistent look-and-feel across the board, the visuals are a pleasant retro homage but not overly simplistic.\n\nFor Titan Attacks, I have to say it's not my favorite. I REALLY love Ultratron, which is a Robotron homage. Titan Attacks is a Space Invaders/Galaga/Galaxian arcade shooter homage. It does its job well, but I feel it has some imbalances:\n\n1) You earn money (shooting enemies, capturing escaping aliens) to buy upgrades. However, as the game progresses it gets harder to capture escaping aliens. When they escape, you lose money. Eventually, you're caught in a cycle where you can only earn enough to keep yourself even and never progress to the higher upgrades. This isn't just that "Oh hey it's harder because things are faster". Often times you literally can not reach the escaping alien because there's barrier that will kill you if you do. I feel it'd be more balanced with some sort of change to that penalty. Either a lesser loss of money or losing points or reseting the bonus multiplier. Perhaps only losing money every other escape? But honestly, I found by the time I got to Saturn that 9 times out of 10, attempting to grab or even shoot the escaping alien was guaranteed to kill me and so I just had to sit and take the money penalty.\n\n2) Unlike traditional Space Invaders, this is an arcade shooter where the collision detection isn't absolute. You're ship can actually brush up against enemy ships, bullets, etc. But it seems incosnsitent with how close you can get and varies depending on if its a bullet, an enemy, an enemy explosion, etc. I'd like to see some sort of indicator to show you're too close or something.\n\n3) The bonuses dropped by a saucer when you shoot it are usually points or money, which is great. Sometimes it'll be a super shield or a super gun. In my experience, all too often this ends up being right at the ever end of the level when you least need it. Instead of those bonuses reseting at the end of the level, they should just run for a fixed period of time (5-10 seconds I suppose).\n\n4) I hate the asteroids. And I hate you don't get any points or anything for shooting them. Not even a single $1 of money. :P\n\nDespite these things, Titan Attacks is certainly not a bad game. It runs flawlessly for me. The visuals are great, the music keeps up pace with the action and it's got a huuuuge range of different kinds of enemies with unique appearances, behavior and attacks. It definitely keeps you surprised and alert as you progress. I feel the game would be even better with some tweaks to game play.\n","January 18, 2014","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, I wouldn't recommend this game (or the bundle) at normal price.\n\nTitan Attacks is quite enjoyable. I played through the first 2 worlds a few times, learning the game and practicing, usually getting destroyed on a few key levels. However, by a few hours in, I broke free. See, the difficulty curve is ramped in the early waves, while you are still building upgrades and gaining power. The game seems to break a bit once you hit Mars, when you usually get maxed add-ons and bullets. After that, what was once a strategic shooter with 1 bullet on screen becomes a spammy hellzone. Waves last a few seconds, cash becomes trivial, even bosses and damage cease to inspire tension. By my 5th new game or so, I could beat the game almost twice. There is no ending, just immediate New Game+ and scaling enemies.\n\nIt didn't make me feel like a pro, it made me feel like the game was incomplete. 100 simple levels, menu music that loops after 5 seconds, and so much potential.\nIt's not all bad. The gameplay and shooting is pretty solid, sounds and music are good, and the visuals are solid if a bit murky in some dark red areas. For $3 or so, a solid experience.\n\nCompared to Revenge (even though I HATED that game) this game feels very simple and short, beatable in an hour or less. Once I finish all the achievements, I probably won't mess with the game much. I'd prefer if the game had more strategy developed in the later levels, nothing really changes. The only real source of difficulty is avoiding a screen full of tiny bullets while enemies just gain HP as the waves go on, slowing the game down without adding any challenge beyond "Fire more". It started great, became decent, and ended with a bigger version of the same boss. I guess it's fair, sometimes it's nice to be able to beat a game and move onto something else. Just watch for a great sale. Now to work on Ultratron and Droid Assault...","July 6, 2014","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Expect to restart the game a lot until you can get a run where you beat the first three bonus challenges, and get enough random money drops from hitting saucers, to earn enough upgrades to make progess through the ridiculous levels later.\n\nBut I'm still giving this a thumbs-up for looking, sounding, and handling smoothly.

You can even kill the pilots ejecting of their vessels, or let them escape, or to capture them.\n\nThe more you're cleaning planets, the more difficult you'll have to pass level after level.\n\nAs I've said, a thumb cramp can happen if you play too much the game, it's kinda addictive on the moment but after a while where you're not really advancing because you're too slow or because your choices didn't suit you.\n\nWhat is great with Titan Attacks is the retro graphics mixed with very bright colors. It's flashy, it's enjoyable, it's really smooth with the eye. The soundtrack is also correct.\n\nTitan Attacks is a real little joy and a good Space Invaders-like. Do yourself a favor and buy it.","October 3, 2013","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you’re looking for something super revolutionary here, you’re not looking in the right place. This game is simply bringing the classics in to the 21st century, it’s an upgraded space invaders. Some new features include upgrade/repair menus in between each level completion, saves, and boss fights. While the boss fights is a welcoming edition, the fights are nothing short of boring as hell. The bosses are actually just oversized ships with the same firepower as the regular mission ships. The game has no difficulty options, but it does loop and get increasingly difficult the longer you survive. Sadly if you die once, you will have to redo everything over again. The musical score is quite ♥♥♥♥, that might act as deterrent for further play-through. Overall not bad for a remake, but something about it really makes me hate playing it again after dying.","April 15, 2012","true","23.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This wouldn’t be an issue if it weren’t for...\n\n- ...The fact that Smart Bombs are hard to come by in the rounds, and a good deal of rounds are along the lines of “burn smart bombs or die” kind, making this worse!\n\n- Carpel tunnel is going to be an issue. Weapons do not fire rapidly unless you continue to tap the button, and secondary weapons do not proc unless you tap. It gets annoy fast.\n\n- Capturing Titans...this is annoying, especially with the first point. If you shot them, nothing happens. If you capture them you get money. Fail to do so, and you lose cash equal to what you would have earned. You could easily find yourself in a bind where you’ll end up debating if losing the cash is worth it, or if you should risk having lives eaten into trying to save a bit more cash for smart bombs.\n\n- Barely any mercy invincibility is the worse offender. All too easily you can lose a full stock of shields in under five seconds, ESPECIALLY in later levels.\n\nOverall, I’d say skip it unless its in a bundle or on sale for no less than 50%. Otherwise keep away. Keep FAR away.\n\nAlso I bet it in 115 minutes, a bit under two hours. So if that’s too short for 100 waves, that’s another reason to wait for a sale.","March 21, 2015","false","2.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

In consistent Puppy Games fashion Titan Attacks flaunts its retro styling mixed with modern shader effects indicative of an old meets new formula which seeks to be more than the sum of its parts. However like their other titles the decidedly more modern features of Titan Attacks are severely undermined by the cartoonishly exaggerated retro grade difficulty . Upgrades to the player controlled tank which are admittedly cool on paper are immediately rendered underwhelming as the game rapidly devolves into near bullet-hell nonsense. For those who fondly recollect their quarters being crunched as though it were one of the finer aspects of the golden era of arcade gaming maybe you should dig a little deeper and remember that there was more to retro gaming than punishment and frustration. It was the game mechanics that really shined. Some gamers prefer to no-life every game they play until satisfied that they are superior to said games in every conceivable way possible and take an arguably dubious pride in astronomically high scores, full achievements, difficulty levels mastered, etc. Some of us value our time and money just a touch more than that. Therein lies the biggest problem with Titan attacks: With crushing difficulty scaling and no special features conveying any sort of replay value the average player is likely to get little more than a couple hours worth of game play out of this title. So if the hippsterific  devs over at Puppy Games are so excruciatingly retro why is this the case? I seem to recall getting loads more play time out of my Intellivision and NES cartridges back in the day. Let's make a 'retro' comparison shall we? Used to be that you'd rent a game for about 3 bucks at your local video rental outlet and proceed to play that game all weekend. Go a bit further back and you may recal spending less than $3 worth of quarters to get several hours of game play from your favorite cabinet at the local arcade. Puppy Games has carved out a comfy little niche for themselves charging around 11 bucks for a few measly hours of so-so game play per title. I'm not one to shout down rehashes and remakes or blindly endorse retro games in their purest original form just to remind people that I played them. I believe that many new games are better simply because they benefit directly from being new and all that it entails. In this case however players really would be better served by dusting off their old games and playing those instead. I can honestly say without any pretensions that you will play them longer and have more fun. In the end (which I promise will come rather quickly if you decide to pick it up anyway) Titan Attacks is a soulless experience that leaves you feeling like your cash has been grabbed. If you absolutely must see for yourself than try to grab it while it's on sale.","March 7, 2015","false","3.0"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","1"

While Titan Attacks! shares various similarities with Space Invaders and Galaga, It's more than that. As you progress through the different stages (Earth, Moon, Mars, Saturn, etc.), You fight a plethora of enemies with different mannerisms whilst building up your funds to upgrade your ship for even more alien-shooting. Pretty addicting if you ask me. Although, there are a few drawbacks. One is that [on keyboard and mouse], Not only does the mouse move your ship, the WASD keys do too. This can make it difficult for players who move their mouse quite a bit when playing games that require it, as just a slight nudge of the mouse will send your ship into a flurry of death and despair.I have lost many a-shield trying to deal with htis problem. It might just be incredibly easy to fix in an options menu that i'm too lazy to check, but as most gamers do, I just went straight to the gameplay. I did see the notice, but didn't expect how highly sensitive the mouse was.\n\nWell, i should stop ranting now. 9/10 Would play again and again.

ME!! But this is basicly Space Invaders on steriods and power-up elements. Once you get through the first couple of levels and powering up your tank, then you really start ripping up them a new one. The graphics are a nice touch, unique but doesn't go over the top. What really pulls you in with this little jewel is you start wanting to see if you can completely power up your tank before you reach the ending. This game goes crazy without  driving you crazy. A blast to play. It might be a little short but you'll aways come back every once in a while to play it again.","November 9, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's style, graphics, score, and small more modern gameplay mechanic additions (upgrades! I am a sucker for upgrades...), plus a difficulty curve that feels just right made this game an obsession.\nNow, it (and the other games that came with the bundle I originally bought from PuppyGames - Droid Assault and Ultratron) has been updated and, thankfully, put on Steam (obviously).
