The city/empire building management isn't the stand out portion of the game. In that respect the magical spells that you can research and cast don't really stand out to me much either.\n\nIf you are looking for a fantasy version of Civ with decent combat options for units and don't really care about the building and management of your empire then this game might be right up your alley. If you are looking for an in-depth strategy game with far reaching diplomacy options and deep empire management and combat isn't your primary concern then maybe this isn't the game for you.","November 25, 2013","true","2.6"," 124 of 137 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","124","137","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/203630/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","NOTE: Since people will see this game and say: "this looks like Civilization 5." I will say it right now that the only similarity between this game and Civilization 5 are the Hexagon Based Grid Map, Leadership Choice and User Interface (UI). Everything else is completely different.\n\nINTRODUCTION:\nWarlock: Master of the Arcane, despite sharing the same look as the more popular Civilization series, is definitely NOT the same game. Warlock: Master of the Arcane plays differently with its own mechanic that delivers a lot of fun to strategy and fantasy world players alike.\n\nIt is an X4 Strategy game originally released in 2012. It lets the player take the role of one of several 'Great Mages' who vie for control of the world of Ardania (from the Majesty Series of games) using vast armies and mighty spells to aid them in their struggle.\n\nPROS:\n+ Fantasy Theme: -This game places you in a fantasy world populated by different mystic and magical creatures. Raise an empire of the Undead, Monsters, Humans or Elves and utilize a wide variety of magical spells to buff your forces or smite your foes.\n\n+ Combat Focused Gameplay: -The Empire building on this game is based primarily on combat, fighting with the other factions and the different monsters that constantly threaten your borders. It delivers a very satisfying gameplay since most Magical Spells will make for some very interesting strategy. (Ex. Having problem crossing that lake? = Waterwalk.)\n\n+ Extensive Upgrades: - Each military unit has so many upgrade choices each time they level-up that once they reach max level, they can be called Hero units in their own right. Add to this your Tech upgrades and Spell buffs, then you will have beast of an army.\n\n+ Epic World: -The game offers your standard Small, Medium, Large and Huge map sizes but it also allows you to add more 'Worlds' that you can invade. Just look for the portal that goes there and fight extremely dangerous monsters inside before reaping the rewards.\n\nCONS:\n- No Vsync: -This is inexcusable. The game suffers greatly from Screen Tearing and yet the options menu offers no Vertical Synchronization option to mitigate this. The player will be forced to use manual Vsync provided by the Nvidia Control Panel (or its AMD equivalent).\n\n- Brain-Dead AI: -The AI really needs some more work to be done. I have seen the AI countless of times mobilize for an invasion, only to cancel it the last moment and just have its army run around in circles rather than coordinate a proper attack. The monsters roaming the country side poses more of a threat than the Faction AI. (It might be different on Hard or Impossible)\n\n- Lack of Variety: -There are 16 different Great Mages you can play OR your own Custom Mage, but the bonuses or faction specialty is so negligible that it almost makes no difference. Add to this, there are only THREE, playable starting races in the game.\n\n- Poor Research Tree: -Instead of Tech, you research Spells, which is good, but there is no Research Tree available. as far as I know, the game randomly generates 5 spells and will require the player to choose one of those spells to research.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIn its own rights, Warlock: Master of the Arcane is a very refreshing take on the 4X Turn-based Strategy Genre. I definitely feel this game deserve your attention if you are a 4X or Strategy fan in general. It provides a fun and enjoyable experience.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

While you get the feel of Civ 5 with the grid layout, the comparison ends there. The focus of the game is combat and everything you do is related to this. I love how the city management is focused. You can't build every single building in every city you build. You have to focus on which resource your city with produce. And this can change depend on which resource tiles you have in your city limits. This game has hooked me better than both Civ 4 and 5 did.

In a nutshell, it is the fantasy version of Civilization but a bit simpler and easier. The player plays the role of a mighty mage, ordering your people to build cities, construct facilities and recruit army to expand your territory. Just like Civilization series, there are many different routes to achieve victory. The player can occupy a specified portion of the world, cast an ultimate unity spell, or conquer all of the other mages to win this game.\nBut There still are some fine features makes it pretty different from Civilization. Firstly, the player study powerful spells in this game instead of technology in Civilization. And differing from other magical games, the player can not only cast combat and healing spells, but also many powerful auxiliary spells to raise the land up beyond the sea level or fertilize the land. Besides, the combat unit the player can recruit needs a upkeep expense, thus limiting the number of army to smaller scale. This mechanism save me much time in mid to latter stage of gameplay. Also from time to time some legendary heroes with special ability might come to seek the opportunity of servicing you, though the expense of hire and upkeep is amazingly huge. They might also turn to service other mages and become your nightmare if you decide not to hire them. And don't forget that you are a mighty mage. You can cast powerful spells to interfere the war when your troop are engaging your rivals on the frontline.\nAnyhow, if you don't have much time to play a whole campaign in other grand strategy games like Civilization and don't want the gameplay to be as complicated as Civilization series, Warlock might be a good choice then.","February 17, 2014","true","24.2"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","53","57","0","0"

The AI doesn`t send 781 drones into every corner of the map and is building expansions until you give up because the game would take 2 weeks to finish. They try to handle the threats on their own continents, isles and barely explore other continents with ships.\n\n- The diplomacy system sometimes doesnt make any sense, they declare you war for no reason or want incredibly stupid high tributes from you to stay in peace.\n\n- The graphic looks beautiful and is definetly to enjoy.\n\n\nAll those impressions were made on normal mode difficulty 3/5.\n\nA few weeks ago I bought Fallen Enchantress...Even if I like the graphics from Fallen Enchantress more, the game couldn`t catch me. I can enjoy Warlock way more, thats why I am going to buy the dlc pack when its on sale.\n\n\nPeace, Hexor.","September 9, 2014","true","6.0"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","36","42","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/203630/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","I got this game when it was being offered by the Humble Bundle store for free, and it has easily been one of the best free games I've received in the year 2014. A lot of reviews mention this game to be "Sid M's Civilization, but with the fantasy theme," and they are actually pretty accurate.\n\nIf you like the Civilization series (especially military victories), 4x games, turn-based strategy, fantasy themes, and disregarding diplomacy, then you should enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are great, and there are a lot of different unit types and character models. The detail put into the "world board" is very good. The music and sounds are great, and the feedback is always helpful in showing stats like how much damage is done and taken by units.\n\nWarlock offers a helpful tutorial for people new to this type of game, however, if you are familiar at all with the Civilization series (or other games in this genre), then this part is easily skippable. Compared to Civilization V, Warlock is much simpler, and also heavily combat-based (as there are no cultural or economic victory routes). The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with turn-based strategies.\n\nThe gameplay is very fun - you start off by building something in your home city, and the game does a good job (like in Civ) of prompting/reminding you when you still have tasks to do (like building when your queue is empty, or moving idle units). After you building completes, you must wait x number of turns before you can build again, and this is indicated by a number next to your city name, which fills up each turn. I do not believe there is a "pay gold to rush build (instant-finish)" option.\n\nThe diplomacy is actually quite comical, as there is no negotiation ability - if the AI sends you a demand, you have to either accept or immediately go to war. You will probably notice that the AI enjoys making demands then randomly offering peace after a few turns, only to repeat this again and again.\n\nSince the game is heavily combat-oriented, you will be focusing on building an army to destroy your opponents. There are also random creeps that will periodically spawn around the map, so it is essential that you invest in home armies in case one pops up close to your cities. The leveling up system for units is similar to Civ V, where you can choose different stats to increase (or perks) every time a unit reaches a new level (from battling). There is a large variety in the units you can create and the buildings you can construct, When you take over a city, you will have access to that particular race's build tree (ex: goblins, humans, etc).\n\nIn the pre-game screen, you can select from existing races, or create your own (you can pick from a pool of magic skills and perks like extra gold per turn).\n\nPeriodically, hero mercenaries will come, offering their service. They are very important, and boost your army strength considerably. Also, traders will come, offerring items that can be equipped by mercenary heroes. Consider investing in both of these whenever you have sufficient gold reserves.\n\nMagic spells are helpful for winning the game, but not essential if you strengthen your stats in other things, like having a massive army, or a very high-level one. Spells include things like offensive attacks, heals (one merc hero has long range attacks AND heal spells; my personal favorite), summoning different units, and map alterations. Something fun to do to your enemy is to turn all of his city tiles to frozen plains or mountains.\n\nOverall, the game is very, very fun, and it is easy to get into the "one more turn" mentality that results in you playing for 5 more hours when you originally told yourself you would only play for 1. If you like fantasy turn-based games similar to the Civilization series, give this game a try.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","September 14, 2014","true","3.8"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","2"

Skip to the conclusion if short on time. Thank you!)\n\nI got the original WMotA game for free during some give away I can't remember. Then one day I looked up and the game was upgraded to the "complete" version for free too. Mind you, I still hadn't even played the game. I looked up some reviews and got a lot of mixed signals about it being good or not so good. The only constant was that it was a "Civ 5" clone. And since I'm a HUGE Civ IV & V fan, I didn't see a point in playing a knock off.\n\nTo the point of this review, I made a point of playing this game over the holidays. I didn't want to write a review of it until I played it at least 25 hours and gave it every chance under the sun to impress me. In conclusion, my verdict is...this is an outstanding game!\n\nThe first thing I want to say is, this is not some Civ 5 clone. And people saying that have no idea what they're talking about. Just because it has a hex-based tile map seems to give WMotA some stigma of being "like" or "a clone" of Civ5. There are tons of games out with the same system, so that characteristic is more than unfounded to say this game is "like" Civ 5.\n\nIn Warlock, you will master economics, amass a versitile army, strategize, and FIGHT! Furthermore, unlike Civ 5, you will not have a DULL moment before pushing the "end turn" button. That's what I hate about all Civ games. You will get to a point where entertainment turns to a chore...and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nAnd unlike Civ games, each turn in WMotA matters! You not only get to pick what building you want to build for what city, but where to place them in your region. That's part of the fun in the city-building aspect. Each tile may give a specific bonus and it's worth checking out what gets placed where. It's worth checking out if you have a resource in your region you can exploit. In Civ games, you just worry about the percentages despite its land resources. In WMotA, you can research spells to change the dynamics of the tile...which in essence, changes the percentages or bonuses of that tile. And there are a ton of spells to do a ton of different things. Too many in fact to go into. But volcano spells and removing swamps to make fertile terrain is pretty epic in this game. You'll see when YOU play.\n\nBut what I like most about WMotA is its variety. Look folks, you will never amass the amount of different units you can...collect...in this game and even remotely compare it to Civ 5. I mean (laughing histerically) this is supposed to be a fantasy game, right? But you got armored soldiers from a Civ game; you've got fantasy units from an Age of Wonders game; you've got undead units from a Lords of the Ring game; you've got blood sucking units from a Van Helsing game; you've got badass bears of all types from every game...I mean...LOL...it's ridiculous. And here's the kicker: No land-based melee unit can attack a flying range unit. So you won't see a knight on a horse killing a blackhawk helicopter like you WILL see in a Civ game! In WMotA, these units serve purposes true to logical gameplay. Not just some random point system statistical outcome.\n\nAnd then there are the portals that send you to other worlds. Where the hell is that in a Civ 5 game? In Civ 5 you play on 1 map; O-N-E!  WMotA has the main map, and then there are portals that can send you to as many other maps as you request in the game setup. Listen folks, I selected the XL map (the largest) with six alternate worlds (the most) against eight other mages (the highest) on the difficult setting (the default). It was a mad house... A MAD HOUSE! I had no idea I had to fight monsters and rouge civilizations along WITH the others mages in the game. Everybody was fighting everybody. It was insane! It was wonderful!!\n\nIn fact, the only, and I do mean only, downside to the game was its diplomacy aspect. It truly sucks. I can't even begin to lie about that; especially when compared with Civ games. I guarantee (unless you're a lousy player) that any "demand" from the enemy AI given to you will result in WAR. You're not even going to consider the ridiculous stuff this game offers you to keep from going to war. The other stuff though is plausable and makes the game fly by unscathed.\n\nBut back to the portals, man. They occasionally send up these strong monster units, and if you aren't ready for them, they will wreck havoc. Then there are the quest (again, nothing like Civ 5) that sometimes make you defeat enemies you've never even heard of, man. Like the time the game dropped this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off supernatural ghost smack down on my settlement without a hero in sight. That green ghost...man...he laid a smack down on my candy-♥♥♥ like The Rock. I finally got my hero chick over there to battle it. They fought for five turns until she finally overcame him and I won the quest. Got some sweet rewards too. Yet, that was only a SMIDGEN of what was going on with my other endeavours during those turns.\n\nSo I got pretty confident in my efforts and decided to send my tanked-out Hero Knight into one of these portals. When the map switched over...LOL...I was SURROUNDED by doubled-headed dragons, Fire Elementals, and other high-powered monsters I can't even name. I could not believe what quick work they made of my Rambo-Lancelot. I was truly butt-hurt after that encounter. I called the game a cheater and hurled all sorts of foul insults at the monitor for hours before quitting for the night. Heck, I almost quit the game twice after that beatdown.\n\nBut guess what? The next day and several hours later, I researched a spell that would bring my hero back to life. Not only did I finally get him back, but he was still tanked-out. I love this game. The next time, I sent a few zomie units to another portal to check THAT world out. Of course it looked TOTALLY different. Nice diversity in the maps here! My zombies didn't last long either but the spolied sacks of meat had like 60 hit points apiece. They lasted longer than the Hero Knight did. P.S., did I tell you one of my zombies was walking around on fire...after getting blazed by that two-headed dragon?\n\nBUGS: Believe it or not, there aren't many bugs in this game. In fact, I really searched and only found 1; and it isn't even that major. What happens is you sometimes get double event screens but you're only able to see the last event. So you can't close the first event or see it for that matter. You have to hit the escape key which takes you to the main menu. Select "resume" and you're back to your game and are able to close the last event screen. It's not as bad nor annoying as it sounds once you understand what's happening. It also doesn't happen that often. You can see what you missed at the top of the menu bar where the quests are kept.\n\nI know this was long (much longer than I meant it to be) but I wanted to express my disagreement with some of the claims out there. This is no Civ 5 clone. It's a great turn-based/action/strategy/4x game that fixes a ton of stuff that Civ games and Endless Legend gets wrong. You can hire heroes and equip them with armor, weapons and artifacts much like Endless Legend & Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes.\n\nIn conclusion, thank you for reading my review. This is my opinion showing no bias for nor against other reviews or reviewers but solely based on my gameplay experiences. In final, this game's sole similarity to Civ 5 is its hex-based tiles. With that in mind, I found WMotA to be a Civ 5/Endless Legend/Fallen Enchantress - Legendary Heroes chimera. And it would be WELL WORTH your time to experience it at least once for yourself. Thank you for your time. GO PLAY SOMETHING!","December 31, 2014","true","25.7"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","23","23","2","3"

Some of the same core mechanics are here; research, city building, army building, war and combat, leader traits and multiple paths to victory. Resource management, commerce, trade and diplomacy are also here, but are heavily simplified and limited compared to Civ V's mechanics; land management and building management have been combined for example. This game is geared much more towards war and combat.\n\nWonders have been replaced by Gods who grant rewards based on your favor with them. Technology is replaced by magic spells, but magic spells do not operate like technologies do in Civ V. Magic spells require mana and time to cast and do not provide civilization wide changes like technologies do. Most magic spells provide only small changes to the game such as damage to all units in a small area, the summoning of a unit or the raising or lowering of land and are not as important to the game as technologies are to Civ V.\n\nThe Civ V religion system is gone, there are no great people and many other mechanics of Civ 5 are gone as well. Some of the unique additions to the game are quests that randomly appear and grant rewards upon completion, 'Heroes' which are powerful units that can be purchased or found and Temple units which are powerful units granted by Gods. As said earlier, this game is geared towards war and combat and most of the additions to gameplay reflect that.\n\nIt's built on Civ 5, a solid and widely enjoyed game.

It would be better if you used the strategy convention of left click to select and right click to give commands. You can only cast one spell per turn, which means that I don't bother casting most of the available spells, because healing and damage spells are the most useful.

And even though they are making the same type of game in the same style, it doesnt feel the same, the magic and magical qualities of everything add a very fresh feel to it, it has a much different progression path and includes spell research.\nIf you like civ 5 and you like magic, you really need to get this game, chances are a lot of your friends got it for free too, so there even should be a good ammount of players playing it.\n\nAlso my only complaint to have about it is that there are a few bugs, and it says that the game is final release, so these bugs which were fairly easy to find will not be fixed, the main problem with the bug that I'm thinking of is that its game breaking and is able to be used in multiplayer, which is generally not accepted as ok.\n\n\nStory (Actors): 10/10 (The characters you can choose from have funny personalities, they're unique and fitting)\nGameplay: 10/10 (This is the same type of game as Civ BUT it also includes magic and type resistance, oh man this game is great!)\nPresentation: 10/10 (Doesnt take itself too seriously, perfect for a game this style)\nSoundtrack: 9/10 (Umm yeah whatever, bonus points for the Boing sound effects for undead arrows)\nReplayability: 10/10 (50 Hours in already, spending days playing with friends. its a GG)","September 13, 2014","true","128.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","1"

Multiplayer is supported too but i haven't tried it yet.\nIMHO, one thing could have been done better: tutorial and general guidance through the game when you play it for the very first time: it's not that easy to be ready to go but the learning curve is not that high either.. once you start exploring menu and icons you get the feeling on what is what and how things work.\n\nStrongly recommended, you can't miss Warlock: Master of the Arcane.","October 29, 2014","true","42.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

Basic things, like combat and resource management, may be familiar to RTS fans, and the turn-based nature won't bother RPG fans. However, the level of micromanagement and diplomacy can be overwhelming for newcomers who aren't familiar with the likes of Civilization and Master of Orion. Paradox saw how difficult it would be for new players to jump into a popular 4X strategy game and offered help with Warlock: Master of the Arcane, a strategy game that seems designed to ease players into the genre.\n\nInterestingly, the game gives the player no real backstory. From the online instruction book and the description on Steam, you know that the lands of Ardania (from the Majesty game series) have been chaotic since the last king died over 70 years ago. The gods feel that the time is right to appoint one of the High Mages as the next ruler. With seven mages vying for the role, your job is to have that mage obliterate everyone else and take the throne.\n\nRating: 8.5/10","May 6, 2015","true","114.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","2"

I played this obsessively for a few weeks, giving up entire weekends to it.  When you start one of these games, be prepared to give up the next 20 hours of your life, because that's how long some of these games can take, depending on the game setup (difficulty, world size, victory conditions, etc.)\n\nThe graphics, music, sounds effects, and gameplay all perfectly complement each other, and they don't get old even after hours of gameplay.  Because you don't want to leave a game unfinished, you end up saying, "Just one more turn, then I'll take a break."  Three hours later, you're still playing, literally starving because you can't leave the game to cook some food.  The game takes so long because it takes time to build up your force enough to overcome an enemy.  There are also neutral monsters which pose a threat.  Not to mention, you have to wait for the AI to finish their turns.  The wait is totally worth it, because the feeling of slowly overcoming your opponents is addicting.\n\nThe AI isn't super smart, which is good or bad, depending on your perspective.  Personally, I liked taking advantage of the flawed AI strategies, like sending their entire army to me by boat, which I destroyed before they could even land.  Diplomacy with the AI is somewhat of a joke.  They might make a truce with you, but they'll break it on a whim.  I tried to be honorable with truces, but after you've played awhile, you start to understand the motivations of the AI when they make a truce, and you can tell when they are about to break it.\n\nAnother great aspect of this game is the random world generation and fog of war.  From the initial setup, you have an idea of what the world is like, but not the details.  Curiosity and fear of the unknown helps to maintain your interest as you explore the map.\n\nAfter playing this, I tried Civilization 5, and personally, I hated it.  I'd rather take a history class.  Personally, I don't like playing games that remind me of reality.  Warlock is a fantasy escape into another world, and it really absorbs you.  I can't recommend it highly enough.\n","February 8, 2015","true","120.8"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

This land has appeared in numerous games, the first game I played in the series was "Majesty Gold Edition".\nIn this game, you are one of (X) amount of Mages/Warlocks, depending on the world size you may have more or less mages/AI/NPC's in the game. The more AI the more competition in the game. (But on the flip side, the more people fighting back the wild landscape... and trust me, it's wild)\n\nGame Play: Starting with the most basic explanation about the game play, you have Hex's which represent segments of the land, very similar other strategy games, some hex's increase gold, food, or magic... while others are just taking up space, or even reduce values.\nI compare this game to one of the Civilization games except that you're fighting with magic instead of science, and the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game of Land, Air, and Water units. It is now more like "Rock, Paper, Scissors, TNT, Chuck Norris, God"; There's magic that you can cast, there's magic units, heroes which can be equipped with better armor and weapons, you can upgrade them with gold, in addition to the typical "ship, flying, and land" units.\nI need to point out I haven't played the multiplayer yet. However, after looking it up, the game doesn't have "simultaneous turns", so the multiplayer will be at an even slower pace. You probably don't want to get into a very large game, smaller skirmishes so you can play the game for a day... ...instead of spanning over several weeks.\n\nAchievements: There are no steam achievements for Warlock - Master of the Arcane.\n\nPrice: Warlock - Master of the Arcane is priced at $24.99. For me personally, strategy games have always had a high value because I play them long and really enjoy the challenge. I won't lie, I picked this game up for free from Humblebundle, but this game on a 50% or better sale is definitely worth it.\n\nConclusion: The first time I played Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim (released in 2000), was when I was in highschool, I had no idea that there were more games from the same universe! So once I heard the announcer's voice I thought "NO WAYYYYYY!!!!" I'm happy to have returned to Ardania!\nAs I said earlier in my review, this game is basically Civilization with Magic. While it's not the most well made strategy game out there, there's definitely enough fun stuff you can do in the game to keep you entertained for a long time. I find myself thinking "okay... one more turn, then I'll go to bed" And just keep telling myself that for another hour.\nI recommend this game for standard strategy game fans, Chances are if you like Civ5, you can pick up this game... but you will find Civilization has been made much better and tighter fitting then Warlock - Master of the Arcane.","April 18, 2015","true","14.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","16","20","3","0"

There's no unhappiness and "growth" is a static number on your city so you just put down as many cities as you possibly can to try and grab up everything while building up as large an army as possible. It's fun for a bit but the AI is not very challenging at all, and the lack of depth regarding anything but the fighting is really off-putting later when it becomes tedious putting down the nth market/farm/mana farm because that's all cities relly do mostly.\n\nThe UI is also problemmatic because you left click to select and left click to move, meaning you can pretty easily accidentally click the wrong tile and waste your hero's turn, forcing you into a bad position you might possibly have to reload from. There also seems to be a memory leak becuase performance gets steadily worse the longer you play. If you do get it, restart the game occasionally...\n\nIt was ok, not something I'd recommend friends though.","December 15, 2013","false","31.1"," 44 of 71 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","44","71","0","0"

A Civ 5 game ofcourse, but a Civ game nonetheless, only there is actual difference between the races in the game in how they operate at the most basic of levels.\n\nThere's Human, Undead, Elves and Monsters and they all work differently.\nEach race has different units, though they do share some specific units and they all also have a few unique buildings, but share mostly all the same ones.\n\nHumans are balanced, because uncreativity.\nUndead eat Mana and are really good for taking out neutral cities early-game.\nElves are powerful and can research Spells the fastest.\nMonsters can produce more food than any other race, meaning more cities earlier on.\n\nThe game doesn't suffer from any Arbitrary systems that people have grown used to and grown to accept, such as Happiness, Culture, Religion or Tourism. There's none of that. Instead every building and every unit requires some form of upkeep. Some requiring food, or gold, or mana, or two of those, or all three I think.\n\nInstead of following a rigid as crap tech tree, you only research spells, which are situational abilities that cost mana. you accumulate it overtime like gold, and spend it on these spells, and the spells range from creating temporary units, damaging or buffing existing ones, or even altering spaces on hte board, like making more land. Yes, one spell turns ocean into land.\n\nWith tech out of the picture, you may ask "Well how do you get the cool units then?" well dear reader, you build stuff in cities. Progression is entirely based on what buildings you have in your cities, which each building occupies a space, and you can't pillage anything.\n\nIn my opinion, the game is criminally underlooked.\n\nThat being said, here are some issues I have with the game...\n\nUnlike in nearly any other Turn-based Strategy game ever, once moves are playing out, you cannot do anything until it ends, though you can easily Left click to skip them and finsih them instantly.\n\nSome controls (like moving and doing unit actions with hte left click) are a bit backwards when they feel like they shouldn't be (after all, it's common that LEft click selects, and right click does orders. It's a rule of all strategy games ever. Why not do that? It's simpler and easier.).\n\nThere's no actual in-game help, which there always should be in games like this. Even just control help would be useful. Meaning you need to refer to a Wiki in order to figure stuff out, or take forever in comparison, and learn what makes certain things go.\n\nAll in all, this is a game that any civ player should get, it's better than Civ 5 in my eyes and this is hte civ 2: Test of Time Fantasy Mode that Firaxis will likely never give again.\n\nI give this game an 8/10.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, voice acting is fitting and nice, and the game just looks like a gorgeous fantasy world.\n\nBonus points for using Multi-Map, which is CRIMINALLY Underused, like... Seriously.\n\nIt's worth getting.","June 13, 2015","true","10.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Sometimes perfect landscape locations.  Other times not too far from a volcano.  Sometimes foes are far away, an other times, you meet them in a turn or two.  I also like the almost like Sid Meier's like system of spell advancement trees, which at times look like they may be no real patterns.  Combat is fun.  The less health a unit has, the less power it has.  One also has to keep track of economics, food growth, and magic power available.

It looks like what would be a MOD for Civ V with fantasy elements. In a sense it’s actually that Civ V with wizards, dragon, etc. However there are clear differences.\n\nIn this game you play as a great mage, you decide the race, some races have an adherence to certain gods more so than other (that benefit is really clear when you are deciding to build a temple or completing a quest for the Gods). Don't feel flustered when choosing a race, you have a chance to invade and take over lands, and incorporate the people to your own army. For example if you are a goblin race who has taken over a Rat owned land, you now have the power to produce Rat soldiers and Goblin soldiers. This is similar to Civ V's aspect of taking over lands. The difference is that from my experience there is no corruption that is clearly seen when you force control other's land.\n\nAnother difference is that, even on the hardest setting the game is doable, in other words you can last at least 100 turns. I found the most difficulty is with not the other great mages you fight, but the "wildlife" elementals, dragons, etc.\n\nYou get Hero type characters at random times, they can be augmented with artifacts. The "Heroes" are similar to great people in Civ V, but they usually help to ramp up your army (as I found they are superior to normal creatures you recruit) they aren’t like great engineers or culture enhancers. There are limits to how many Hero type characters you are allowed.\n\nBuildings in the game are not built freely they are built when you level up your Castles (which are your Cities) you may build buildings and creatures at the same time (you may build creatures at any time given you have the improvements that allows you to do so). There is no starvation in any city, but if you accumulated many foods, excess will go into gold, if you are wanting to build great vast armies then having a lot of gold per turn is a good thing. Keep in mind that sometimes military creatures may take up gold, food, and sometimes even mana per turn. Development in your castle is notoriously slow. There are no workers to alter your lands, improvements to lands are done with buildings within the city/castle.....OR by you yourself...... but these improvements aren't necessarily land alterations but land utilization\n\nWays to utilize your lands. Throughout the game you can accumulate food, mana, and gold through city improvements, similar to Civ V. The difference is as mentioned before no workers, and also no wonders. Research is essential to gaining tools necessary to gain an advantage. In this game instead of discoveries or technologies, you learn spells. These spells are reusable they never expire, however there is the occasional prep time that requires two turns to use one spell, some can be used twice in one turn. In addition to the time required to cast a spell there a mana cost.\nSpells as mentioned previously are researched. Spells vary from direct damage, helpful enchantment, detrimental curses, to land alterations. You can scorch the land make it pretty much unusable, restore it, raise it (really nice feature), or lower it. A feature in the game is that if you hate water make land, if you can’t pass mountains lower it. The elevation levels are this: mountains-----hills----plains----water. (raising or lowering brings it up one or down one elevation level, you can use them repeatedly on the same lands) Mountains are unusable and impassable and you will benefit a great deal if you lower them. The water provides a tax in traversing, you also benefit by making new land from it. There are spells that make lands more food, gold, or mana productive. This is great when looking into resources found in the game.\nResources can provide a boost in gold production, special military units, or a boost in food production. This is similar to Civ V’s use of resources. Nothing really can be said here\nTroops that you recruit generally move faster than in Civ V (from my experience), and gain perks every level up (same as Civ V).\nThere are portals that traverse you to different realms that are usually inhabited by strong creatures.\nOverall this game was a good play, I got this game through a humblebundle, but I would highly encourage an hour of play to get it right, sometimes the hints are stuck and you would not be able to exit it out. I recommend turning the hints off altogether or press escape.\n","May 4, 2015","true","30.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

This is the main focus of the game.\n- There's lots of units, and you dont depend on one race, only start with one.\n- Only three races, but at least they're balanced and there's a boatload of indipendent units.\n- Simple spell research in place of tech.\n- Ability to unleash said spells to modify units, terrain or cities.\n- Simple but honest Truce, Pact or War diplomacy.\n- A world to explore and expand upon. Then another world when you find a portal link to it. And another one after that...\n- Guarded loot as in MoM, monster spawners, rampaging monsters, and other map features to keep exploration interesting.\n- Some spells are fire&forget, others are buffs that require upkeep.\n- Simplified economy. Few resources to manage, all directly related to keeping your war machine on the march and growing.\n- Slightly convulted way in which buildings unlock other types of buildings or even troops.\n- Very little terrain feedback! (Archery bonuses, terrain defense, etc).\n- Oceans that are worthless except as passages.\n- Pumpkins as a resource on which Shrines of the Rotting Pumpkin can be built. ikr, awesome!\n- Resources that grant bonuses or allow for units to be built in the city.\n- AI that can fight. (turn up the difficulty)\n- AI that ... will occasionally attack Ghosts (weapon immunity) with a common melle unit (uses weapons).

Granted that it's not one of the best ever made, but it's very good and can favorably be compared to Civ V (IF, and that's a big IF, you want the game simplified and focused on combat).

The metascore doesn't give the game full credit because many great features were added months after its launch (especially hero units and items). The focus is clearly on unit management and fighting. The city and resource management is rather limited to finding a suitable place and expand and build fast. An interesting aspect is to take over cities of other races so that you can also use their race special abilities, units and buildings (and even build new cities by using peasants of that race).\n\nOne weakness of the game is that it kind of always plays the same (at least for me). Expand fast (with some luck of enemy and especially monster positions). Build, upgrade and buff your units. Fight until all enemies are dead. You can also try to focus on your magic power but since it is rather easy to create nearly unbeatable units (especially heroes) I find it more attractive to just build a handful of super units and kill everything on sight. I personally love that approach of warfare but whoever prefers big armies of cannon fodder or diplomatic victories might not like the game as much as I do.\n\nUpdate: I have to say that when you are looking for a remake of "Master of magic" I suggest to try "Fallen Enchantress: Legendary heroes" which is even closer to the "original". It features turn based combat instead of worldmap combat and is a lot harder but I like both games for what they are.","December 20, 2013","true","58.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The series went onto make all kinds of sequels, one of which was Fantasy General.  That game scratched an itch for me in that I like Grand Strategy War games and I like Fantasy games whether strategy, tactical, role plying or other.  It was a solid effort but something was missing.  Warlock re-treads this ground in Wizard’s robes and does it quite well.  It has the tight and balanced combat of the PG series with plausible and clever (role based) fantasy units brought from several traditions.\nThe Bonus to me is that there is as well a generous layer of Civ-5 era Civ-type flavour heaped on.  Research tree, Religious favour, building wonders (sorta), and cultures with distinctive units all have their place in the overall game play and strategies.\nThis game may not have the most original ingredients but it has taken the right amount from each of it’s influences and mixed them well.\nAlthough I like this game quite a bit, I do have some complaints:\n- There does seem to be a memory leak where one needs to reload the game every few turns to prevent processing slow down.\n- The underworld's populations seem to grow exponentially out of control by mid-game.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to gamers who are any flavour of strategy enthusiast or specialize in turn-based-strategy, hex war games, fantasy strategy or are looking for fantasy/strategy options away from the main stream.\n- Overall: 8/10.\n- Tighten up the scripting: 9/10.","November 21, 2015","true","52.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

First, the good bits... it is an entertaining, light-hearted, turn-based, fantasy 4x strategy game that is quite good at evoking that infamous "one more turn" feeling. The unit voices and descriptions are hilarious and there are a lot of fun units and spells. The skills your units acquire as they gain levels are also a lot of fun. It should be noted that the game puts you into conflict with other mages really quickly, so expect to be battling right away. If you like subtle victory conditions in your 4x games (diplomacy, intrigue, culture, research, etc.) then this is not your game. This sucker is all about stomping your rivals to goo with the biggest, baddest units you can muster.\n\nNow for the bad bits. The game is horribly unoptimized (every spell effect in the game causes the graphics to stutter), quite buggy (we're talking game crashing bugs here along with the little stuff), and there are gameplay aspects that REALLY need improvement. The game is particularly bad at providing information you need to make good strategic decisions, such as telling you the prerequisites for a building or telling you what a skill will do if you select it when upgrading a unit. The final kicker is the developer simply stopped supporting Warlock to release Warlock II, which appears to be just a patched version of Warlock. It all feels like I was scammed into buying something they never intended to finish so they could charge me again for the patches. If Ino-Co Plus showed ANY inclination to support this game and fix the issues, I would whole-heartedly recommend the game, but they have not issued a patch since December 2012, so it is obvious they intend to let it rot. I hold Paradox (the publisher) to be somewhat at fault here too for not insisting that Ino-Co Plus fix Warlock's problems before they would agree to publish Warlock II.\n\nTo sum it up:\n\n1) if you have a high tolerance for bugs\n2) if you don't mind looking up all the info you need from a wiki instead of seeing it in-game (which, btw, is somewhat problematic because alt--tabbing out of Warlock introduces some strange graphical quirks)\n3) if the game is on sale\n\nthen you will likely get your money's worth of entertainment out of Warlock. While I've certainly gotten mine, the fact that Ino-Co Plus has refused to fix the game has left a really bad taste in my mouth and I'll never buy anything developed by them again. Paradox didn't do themselves any favors either and I'll be very leary about purchasing anything published by them in the future.","October 3, 2015","true","252.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Just don't expect a deep tactical strategy game, though. Almost everything about Warlock is extremely simplistic: from spells to combat to enemy AI to diplomacy, there's very little deep thinking in the game. Diplomacy in particular is a bit daft -- there are few options aside from trade and basic alliance requests, and the only choices when facing an opponent's demands for physical goods are "Accept" or "Declare War". Also, as i s the case with virtually every Civ-like strategy game ever made, the AI will start to cheat once you gain an advantage.\n\nOverall, Warlock is pretty addictive. There are a ton of different units and abilities, and each race has distinctive perks. But as of now, it's way too easy to steamroll the closest AI opponent early on, thereby allowing you complete domination of your region before even setting sights on the next AI player.

The game can somewhat be compared to Civilization 5 but in a fantasy setting. The combat is done the same way.\nWarlock also features "other realms". Which may contain stronger monsters but also more/better items/resources.\nUpgrading units can only by done by upgrading buildings in cities, which are placed on the map, so you can't build everything in every city. Additionally, every city can have a specific race like elf or orc, which also changes what units they can produce.\nAdditionally, you have Hero units which can be recruited by random events which can be equipped by items you may find scattered on the field.\n\nOf course, is no fantasy game complete without magic. Thus you can research spells and cast them them to damage enemies, buff units or summon an army.\nIt all is a fun concept and it plays very nice too.\n\nHowever, ever game has its flaws and so does this game.\nThe AI, for example, loves to declare war at you, even when they can't reach you and then settle for peace. All the time.\nThe battling/Sieging AI is also not the best, sometimes retreating randomly when they destroyed nearly all defences.\n\nTechnically, that would be the biggest problem as the rest, are all small annoyences, rather than actual problems.\nFor example, I notice you can only end the turn when every city is atleast building something when there is a slot available or that units you control must move every turn. (I could be wrong here but I never noticed the opposite)\nThat is just one of the small ones. Most are hard to explain and only really be noticed when you played the game.\n\nIt's a great game with only some small annoyences and I would really recommend it if you enjoy strategy games in a fantasy setting. Additionally, a Warlock 2 is coming soon, so if you read about these annoyences, you could hope 2 removes those.","March 9, 2014","true","8.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mickmane/recommended/203630/","Mickmane","Mickmane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mickmane/","397 products in account","Fun, but for something that calls itself "Master of the Arcane" there's awfully little arcane, relying on pushing units around the map.\n\nOne or two spells per turn on average, versus countless units, I would have prefered it the other way round. Plus, casting a spell is pretty much the only thing it does not remind the player to do.\n\nI do like the unintrusive way it reminds me of other things, so that's a plus on the interface.\n\nA minus is that it doesn't show me what units I can build where in the city list, so I'd have to guess and check all of them. It also isn't very informative on what I need to do to get what. One of my cities won't let me build a Mana Trap, and I have no idea why. Earlier I wanted to research Fertile Lands, but had no idea how to get that either. At some point I could suddenly cast it (I assume I found it).\n\nA few more postives:\n\n- Customizable Win conditions. No need to keep an opponent alive (like I used to in Master of Magic) to cast the Unity spell, simply untick the win option of beating all opponents.\n\n- Go-to orders come AFTER I did my turn (after pressing end of turn), so I can still change their orders before that, and it's still/again my turn when they end up with movement points left after they arrived. (I hated having to wait through all the go-to orders in Civ before I even get to do something.)\n\nAnd while you can't disable movement animations/showing enemy moves, clicking somewhere cuts that short (the plain info of "Enter ends your turn" under the purple button at the bottom right corner is perfect for that).\n\n- Little gems of humour hidden away, sometimes referencing films and possibly other media. They always make me smile.\n\nA drawback is that the game slows down after a while on my computer (which isn't that old), with a noticable delay when I click on one of the reminders mentioned above, before it gets to the relevant place. So I have to save, quit, and start the game again to get normal response time again. (Edit: Friend told me how to fix or at least delay that: don't use the wide option of the spellbook.)\n\nBut that's not the only problem. With graphics on max, even the Steam chat input was delayed, huh!? (The reason I have the graphics all on lowest. Which still has all the animations active. The tiny figures doing stuff is very cute and well done, but it would be nice to disable that.)\n\nRight now I ran into a graphic glitch that keeps turning up when I capture a certain city.\nsteamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=316952843\n\nBut overall it keeps me entertained for a while.\n\nEdit: For anyone where the "Read the user manual" option at Steam launch of the game doesn't work either, I just found this:\nhttp://www.warlockmasterofthearcane.com/gallery-downloads/game-manuals/\n\nAt first glance it doesn't explain much more than the Tutorial, though.","September 21, 2014","true","254.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's definetely very fun. It is similar to Civilization V but with different play mechanics. In Civ V one of the things that I really didn't like is that it starts out very slow. In this game, you get melee units from turn one with a city that has enough population to build things. It starts out very fast and you can start attacking other cities very early on. This is why I like it. As many have pointed out it is about war. Granted there are other ways to win, it's mostly about capturing capital cities of enemies. There's a lot of variety when it comes to monsters. There's all kinds of creatures from rats to fire shooting golem elementals (the Fire Elementals).

The game mechanics themselves are straight up great; from micromanaging your individual unit perks to keeping an eye on your macroeconomy, the process is intuitive, and once you've got the mechanics down you can optimize.\n\nPartially because of this, the game feels a little bit like "what if Civ didn't have empire size balancing." Economic advantages snowball to the point that endgames can sometimes feel like a chore. But crushing your enemies into a fine powder isn't so bad of a chore. It's considerably more of a challenge to limit yourself to a certain number of cities.\n\nAlso, if you ever played the game Majesty, you'll notice many of the same gods showing up, as well as certain catchphrases.

I play Civilization, Galactic Civilizations and more, while most of the time I go for passive/defensive victories and boost my civilization, Warlock is mostly about war, diplomacy is nice, improved, but still not very complicated, the city management has been improved too, but still pretty easy to figure out. Generally speaking, the game is easy to learn especially with previous experience and the HUD, the notifications, the info about units lets you figure out the game pretty soon, but it's still fun as hell and not so easy to master. Some say this is the spiritual successor of MoM or Age of Wonders, it does give this feel but it's easier and as said before more war based, you should focus on troops and spells to support them or some offensive spells. The game however has been continuosly fixed and improved to this day, even multiplayer has been added on 1.2! I had great fun in multiplayer, definitely one of the best additions for an already superb game. You may try the demo, which is the old version and then buy the game with the awesome DLCs and see a much more improved and polished Warlock, but yeah do try the demo, it's the one that convinced me. Oh yeah, about that war-based, you can still be passive/defensive with the unity spell which is a technoligcal/wonder victory, but the fighting is so fun even I got sucked in it.","January 7, 2013","true","38.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game mechanics themselves are straight up great; from micromanaging your individual unit perks to keeping an eye on your macroeconomy, the process is intuitive, and once you've got the mechanics down you can optimize.\n\nPartially because of this, the game feels a little bit like "what if Civ didn't have empire size balancing." Economic advantages snowball to the point that endgames can sometimes feel like a chore. But crushing your enemies into a fine powder isn't so bad of a chore. It's considerably more of a challenge to limit yourself to a certain number of cities.\n\nAlso, if you ever played the game Majesty, you'll notice many of the same gods showing up, as well as certain catchphrases.

There is no tech tree, complex diplomacy, cultural trees, no real research besides random spell picks or any of those Civ trappings, it's mostly about warfare.\n\nMy only complaints would be that the AI is not evenly challenging and that endgames can verge on the boring when you know you have the power to crush the enemy but sieging cities takes forever. And don't leave your cities unguarded, as some random events spawn powerful creatures behind your lines.\n\nAll in all though, highly recommended. Looking forward to the sequel!","September 29, 2012","true","127.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A fantasy version of Civ 5. A half-done fantasy version of Civ 5. I was wrong and right at the same time.\n\nThis game - as I just said - is pretty much a Civ 5 clone at first glance, however later on you learn that this game is not quite. With game mechanics that parallel them, this game still has plenty of other ideas, concepts and such which are completely different. The first that springs to mind are the spells.\n\nSpells are either the worst thing you in the history of ever or the best thing ever. Depends purely on which side you're on. These are an interesting - though unsurprising - element added to the game. Their near unlimited number and their wide range of effects can basically make you god-like, however these spells require mana and time to cast and if they are ongoing spells, mana for upkeep. However if you have tonnes of mana and little gold, fortunately you can just have the mass of your army be summed creatures that simply require mana for upkeep rather than gold (Some require both. Awesome...)\n\nAn unusual set of elements are artefacts and lords. They randomly come about throughout the game and can be purchased/hired so long as you have enough gold to afford their upfront cost. Although you can find them in the map at various locations, I seem to find them a lot more of them to purchase at the start of the turn. The lords are a lot like their common unit counterparts, however with unique perks and abilities with the ability to equip artefacts to them to change or add more abilities. One lord got my attention and stood out from all the rest. It is - and I'm not making this up - the infamous rabbit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I have screencaps of it if you don't believe me. The funny thing is about this creature is that it is one of the most OP units in the game Arm the rabbit with a broomstick and it can fly, crossing all terrain with no movement penalty and the ability to take on any creature. However there are stronger lords beyond this one so [OP intensifies].\n\nThe game also has pocket dimensions and they are randomly scattered through the map (supposing you have enabled them) and are infinitely useful once you managed to capture one, drive out all the late-game monsters and in general wrestle them under your control. However once one is under your control, you essentially increased the power of your empire without the further need to war with other Great Mage (players or if you don't have friends like me, the CPU). Even then, if the wars do happen, the other Great Wizards are going to go through hell to reclaim any pocket dimension.\n\nThe communication and interaction with the Great Mage is fairly limited compared to those in Civ 5, with no request there being something that can have a minor result if you decline. If someone either demands resources from you or has a request, declining it can either result in outright war with the other Great Mage or destroying your alliance if it's a request. It would be great if declining wouldn't be so extreme and would simply just decrease the Great Mage's attitude towards you rather than... this. Another thing that bugs me is that either there's no option to request a war with another Great Mage or I've missed it entirely.\n\nThe same applies with quests. These are also unusual game mechanics that at some times can be VERY ANNOYING! Why? Failing to complete a quest can result in a punishment. Usually they don't amount in much e.g. some gold/mana lost, but some can be kinda... dumb. For example, one god losing favour with you simply because you couldn't build a church in time. For that to happen, you need to get yourself some holy ground and if that's in anothers' land, you have to go forcibly take it from them. Something like that isn't usually done in a small space of time. Taking a city can take many turns, even with a decent, strong army. Fortunately, some quests seem to last forever so you have plenty of time to do that quest. Unless you forget the quest and do other more presssing matters at hand.\n\nOverall, Warlock is a pretty good stratergy game but could do with a bit more effort towards the interaction with other Great Mages and a bit of rebalancing with their lords.","November 28, 2014","true","35.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

They have done enough to raise my estimation of the game to the point that I would actually recommend it.\n\nFor me, Warlock is the perfect after work slice of strategy gaming. Where Modern Manshoot 5 is just to brainless and Complicted Inaccessible Grand Strategy is too complex. Warlock sits in a comfortable niche of being accessible but thoughtful.\n\nIt's not the sort of game you'd lose a weekend to though.\n\n","July 17, 2012","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And the option of cylindrical or flat (so you can either exit one side and appear on the other, or have to run right to the other side all across the map in "flat")\n\nAble to face 8 Rival Mages (so 9 players inc you), and this wonderful feature called "additional worlds". Portals in game that lead to magical worlds riddled with dangerous enemies and loots! With the possibility of 6 of these!\n\nSo at max you may have 9 players, on the biggest map, with 6 additional worlds to roam to. And that's not to mention all the monsters in the game that spawn with you, the ones that spawn via random events (which can inc loot drops n such) AND Neutral Cities which act like lesser ai and are at multiple levels, so capturing isn't always easy.\n\nOther stuff in the game includes  random quests, Religious Alignment, Powerful Hero units, Spells and Spell Research and Diplomacy. Along with a multitude of different buildings for each race and appealing graphics. I feel the game runs really smooth as well, atleast on my rig.\n\nI HAVE NOT PLAYED MULTIPLAYER so i can't comment, though im sure the same settings apply, exept with other humans of course.\n\nGames can be quite long as well, even on small settings.\nFor example im playing on the second difficulty "casual" (though i could play higher, still trying to learn the game more), on a small world, 1 enemy mage, 1 additional world and it still takes me 2 hours to win. Though you can win in probably half that, im the type of guy who likes to explore the lands and kill all the monsters and get loots and build heaps of cities and stuff, always more than i really need.\n\nI just recommend this game to anyone into Turn Based/Fantasy/RPG/4X/Strategy and even probably City Builders.\nI believe it has something to appeal to all and once you've gotten through your first 1 or 2 games (with very helpful tutorial tooltips which you can enable on and off, so if you forget, you can just play a normal game again and have em pop up without having to do an actual tutorial mission) you will finally start enjoying it atleast twice as much and start thinking of strats and combos and cool ways to play!\n\nI got this for free, but do i think it's worth $25? Hell. Yes. Even without a Story Mode. The amount of content and options is worth, let alone the value for multiplayer. And remember it's for the complete addition which includes the base game and 5 other content packs.\n\nSo if it sounds very appealing to you, $25 would be a good investment I feel, and if you score it on any kind of sale even 25% off, bonus!","February 9, 2015","true","66.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But for some unfortunate circumstances I couldn't get it on Steam, so I settled with this one. Turns out this game wasn't that different from Civ V, all the core elements are there, with the addition of a fantasy setting, mythological units and the ability to research and cast spells.\nThe goal of the game is simple enough, all you need to do is to defeat the other mages in the map. To do this, however, you need to manage your cities and resources, expand your empire, explore the game's world and capture important resources, research the right spells that match your strategy, and guide your troops and upgrade them. On paper it doesn't seem different from a RTS game, but the turn-based system is a bit more tricky. Unlike RTS games, it does not emphasize on micro-management, but careful planning before making any move and having a strategy.\n\n\nThe game has some optimization issues, the story is non-existant and the game could get a bit repititive if you don't know what you're doing. But it's still worth every penny (and seeing how the game is on sale all he time, it won't cost you much anyway)\nI say it's a decent alternative if you can't afford Civ V, and a good start if you want to give this genre a try without spending much on the other more famous titles.","February 14","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game seems interesting at beginning, welcoming you with nice graphics and interesting introduction, but it  quickly shows it true colors.\n\nThe Diplomacy is tragically primitive. You make your offer , other reject it unless you give him really sweet deal. This doesn't lead to anything. This is based on some really silyl calculation, as for example when AI that was loosing badly wanted to make peace with me, it gave me MUCH better offer for peace (peace+ gold + some spell) a turn after it declined my offer (peace for peace)\nEnemy can "demand" something from you and you have choices then "Agree" and "War" .\nAnd that is basically it diplomacy-wise.\n\nThe "requests" for aid are just some random kill this build this stuff events, that do not bring anythiing to the gameplay.\n\nThe spell system is practically broken by the design. You can basically cast a single spell each turn, and that's it. There is no possibility to really "improve" your casting abilities (you can develop a spell that can help you tiny tiny bit).\n\nThe portal to other worlds - because it's quite rare you find it usually a bit in the game, so when you enter the portal you usually find yourself with your single unit surrounded by horde of monsters, that dispatch even your advanced units really fast.\n\nThe units progress/upgrades has not been give apparently much though, as the cost/upkeep of units rises out of proportion to the units real power. At some point it would simply be insane to produce best units instead of making more of the average ones. This is especilly visible with the ranged units.\n\nThe cities seem to grow ower time and this is somewhat related to food available, but unlike in similar productions it's really hard to see/predict when the city will grow and enlarge it's zone.\n\nThe worst part is the ending/ pushing towards the win. At the point when you reach the clear domination over your rivals, you will need at least the same time to finally finish them of.\n\nCombat - combat is pretty standard, although one really really irritating design decision is that if you kill enemy or make him retreat by meele unit, your unit automatically moves in the defeated enemy spot. You have no choice in that matter. So basically if there are more enemy units your "winning" unit practically walks in the middle and get's dispatched at enemy turn.","October 7, 2014","false","12.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Warlock uses a modified Civ5 engine and heavily modified gameplay. While this sounds great, sadly the modifications gameplay wise hurt the game. It's certainly a beautiful high fantasy world with an interesting concept, but that's about it. The gameplay is lacking and awkward. It lacks the refinements that the Civ series has, even in the most basic aspects. Diplomacy and city management are especially simplistic if not downright bad for a Civ fan. If you're incredibly interested in the concept or really like the world from the Majesty series (Warlock is part of it), pick it up, preferably on sale.

You use mana to maintain enchantments and magical units, as well as cast spells. Food goes to supporting cities and units. Gold goes to building and army upkeep, as well as buying new units.\n\nIt's simpler, but still crazy addictive. There are also 'Lords', basically hero units that require a lot of upkeep but can equip artefacts and are essentially more powerful than standard units. Seriously, if you pile the enchantments on, these guys can get ridiculously OP, it's so fun.\n\nThere's a religion system, where you do quests to earn favour with gods that govern particular spheres (such as death, strength or the sun). At first I thought, oh great, another list of made up deity names for me to learn, but there's not so many and they all make sense. It's especially easy to remember as they have polar opposite gods as well, e.g Dauros is the god of order and law, his rival is Fervus, god of chaos and nature.\n\nI'm not a massive strategy fan and I love this game.

Suprising is the ease of play, the comfortable interface, & (for those frustrated with Majesty's notorious command system) managable AI.  In fact, if you didn't like "Majesty's" mechnics, but loved the story, art, & lore, "Master of the Arcane" plays at a familiar 4x pace without getting bogged down with technicality.  That being said, it is easy to learn, & progresses into the intricacy one would expect from arcane arts.  I love "Majesty II", despite it being hard as hell.  "Warlock" ranks amidst greats like "Fallen Enchantress" & "Endless Legend" (or even Civ.V)  by pulling you into its fun fantasy universe, satiracal yet believable.  Factions are fascinating, providing the ability to conquer other civilizations and make their troops / buildings as well, adding a crazy conquest element to the game.

Each round, based on your mana pool, you can cast spells that influence your units or other aspects of gameplay. From increasing your food supply to levitating your infantry units so they can pass over the water.\n\nThe different races have a different play style too and benefit from different priorities. If you capture cities owned by other races however, some of their unique perks can be supplied to your units. Vampires with Silver Weaponry? Why not!\n\nYou can even build a multi-cultural army later on, so you're not overly hindered by your initial choices.\n\nI give it about an 8/10, just a few annoying glitches here and there (if you alt-tab out to use the internet, you get massive keyboard lag).

Only skirmishes.\nLots of bugs\nDumb AI\nRandom mob spawning\nSome spells are overpowered\nThe game is fun, but has too many downfalls to enjoy for long. My biggest concern is that the enemy player AI is really easy to beat. They don't have a strategy, they don't match attack types to defence types, and they randomly proclaim peace or war. Even on the hardest difficulty they're easily beaten.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of difficulty, the game introduces random mob spawnings. The strength of these mobs seem to be random, so it's very possible that you get wiped out early in the game by a mob spawn. They can spawn anywhere and at any time, which makes it hard to create a strategy to defeat an opponent. Even worse are the Dremer, who also spawn with gates and contimate the lands. This gets really tedious after a while since there's nothing you can do about the spawning, and they just serve to increase the game difficulty in an obnoxious way.\n\nAnother thing are the spells. You can resurrect any unit, but not always a hero. You can lower the land and put tough enemy units in the water, making them easy to defeat. You can cast mana drains on your enemies or erupt vulcanoes on their lands. This severely debilitates them, but they never apply these tactics to you. So after some time, the gameplay becomes the same. Slowly advance towards the enemy while dealing with the random spawns until you kill all. It gets tedious after a while, which is a shame as I really wanted to like this game.","March 31, 2015","false","35.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","1"

The resemblances are so similar it looks like a cheap knock off, but is it? I am happy to say that the answer is no. While there are some similarites between both games, warlock focuses purely on war.\n\nYou build military on a seperate queue from regular buildings, you have no workers to manage, no happiness to keep positive and by extension no luxury resources, everything you see and find is for war.\n\nYou can win by owning most of the land, or researching the ultimate spell, or capturing all capital cities. Don't these victory conditions sound familiar? The only problem is, you will never have a game that lasts long enough unless you intentionally drag it out to achieve any other victory except a war/domination victory.\n\nThis game begs for multiplayer, which thankfully it does have! The netcode is pretty okay too. The downside? No simultanious turns. You cannot take your turn (or seemingly do anything) while your foe takes their own turn which means that games drag on way too long! This is a game about war, I have a large military to move every single turn and so do my foes! This limits multiplayer to 1v1 because large groups are not going to finish a match in a day.\n\nWarlock is fun, the mechanics are engaging, the lore is rich and humourous in places and playing 1v1 with a friend is very stimulating. If I could rank a game as neutral then this one I would. But I can't so I can't recommend this game.\n\nOne last thing, enemy AI. They are brain dead. You can win games by simply leaving the AI alone long enough to die to wild monsters. I am not even joking. They have no concept of how to play the game and certainly no idea of how to win it. If you played Civ5 and thought the AI there was bad, then that AI will seem like HAL from a space oddysey after you have seen the bone-headed bizaare AI that this game offers.

This combined with poor balance between spell power and the time it takes to cast it (spells that give 50% boosts to existing units combat power take 1 turn and spells that summon mediocre units take 2 as an example).

Game is super boring. First off, there is no tutorial, just a few hints, so nothing to describe convoluted interface, all the mechanics, the upkeep, resources, how everything works, etc. Then there is no campaign, just running skirmishes on similar levels with similar opponents against the computers. There are tons of inconsistencies that don't make sense. Why for some reason if you attack can you not move after, that makes no sense. If I can move then attack, why can't I attack then move, like with archers, it's called retreating.....it's called battle tactics, look it up. Then sometimes I will run out of movement and be right next to a guy, but it won't let me attack them because it says I am out of movement......well I am just attacking him I don't need to move, so that makes no sense. Sometimes you can move past guys on squares, sometimes you can't. Then the action is dumb. Sometimes you lose a ton of your units sometimes you lose like nothing, and you can't get a good idea of what will happen. The gameplay isn't fun either. You have no clue how much your guys can move without moving them on the board. It will sometimes not tell you if you have a guy with moves left in a turn. You spend 2/3 of the time ending turns and waiting. Your guys only move like 2-3 spaces per turn, meaning they can't do anything.  You can build 1 single building every like 5 turns and it takes 4 turns to build. Guys take like 3-4 turns to be produced. You build up mana and everything so slowly you can cast a spell once every 30-45 min or so, and the computer can cast tons of spells. Also how fast mana and food and everything comes is not explained and you have no idea what your production is at. It takes forever to kill a single group of people and especially a little town or village. I spent like 2 hours in 1 small circle area and nothing happened. You only get basic boring units for the first few hours, like archers, swordsman, a ship, a bat, and a caravan. It was so uninteresting and uneventful and slow I finally had to call it quits. If you want to spend 2/3 of your time in a game ending turns and accomplishing nothing until 15 hours, then this is the game for you.

Where is it, you might ask? It was lost to the void of the internet when a page got accidentally refreshed.\n\nMany months later and I’m still butthurt about losing it, I worked really hard on it because I felt the game deserved it. So here is my very very abridged version:\nWarlock: Master of the Arcane is a Civ knockoff. It’s not bad but it has some key flaws. The most glaring is how cumbersome the UI is. Coming from Civ is also annoying because basic shorthand like right clicking to move a unit is a completely different function. The verdict is that if you’re hard up for some Civ-like gameplay, Warlock is alright, but I personally would rather just play more Civ. The theme change doesn’t justify the feeling of having to relearn the genre.","April 6, 2015","false","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Units have no auto explore. This has been a part of 4x games since Civ 3 I think. It is absurdly frustrating and time consuming to have to literally click on every unit every turn.\n\n2. Clicking: WHY did you not use both the right and left mouse buttons? It's insane. The clicking over a unit to then do all actions with the same button is very frustrating and often leads to multiple clicks to get one action done. Also click zones are very tiny and leave you inching your mouse to get the right thing.\n\n3. Minimal control of your economy and tech tree. Basicly you have no input onto what is happening. Should I build more gold or more mana collectors, who knows. Oh I'm suddenly bankrupt, but wait, it has no effect because the next turn I'm fine. WIthout some kind of feedback into your economy/techtree the user is very disconnected from the guidance of their own civ.\n\n4. On that same note, you elminated so much of the users investment in their character by nutering the character design. I know this is just a reskinning of Master of Magic so I'm not expecting anything groundbreaking, but by removing the faction aliance to life/death/fire/air/etc you took away the special feeling of a character growing and learning a certain type of magic for a certain philosophy. Now all characters are bland and seem to take magic from all schools.\n\n5. Never ending enemy spawn. Now I get that this is a core part of the game but it's also unnecessarily frustrating. As a builder I want the sence that I'm taking over this land and making it safer/better for my people. What's the point of me having magic walls around my cities if skeletons, vampires, and cheap humans just suddenly appear. On the same note they really don't do anything to you except attack your cities again and again and very rarely can they beat your cities ability to heal, essentially making them just a nusiance.\n\n6. Oh last but not least, Users CAN'T SKIP ACTIONS! I don't care if some random village was built and I don't care if a sea monster is swimming past my capital. I should not have to bomb every enemy that walks by. I should have the choice.\n\nOverall I cannot recomend this game. The reskinning of MOM is long awaited and the graphics for the most part are great, though many buildings are difficult to distinguish adding another minor frustration. This game was almost good but overall I say skip it.","July 19, 2015","false","17.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akalonian/recommended/203630/","Akalonian","Akalonian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akalonian/","356 products in account","Overall description:\nIn short: If you like other turn-based strategy games, you will like this one as well.\n\nThings it has in common with other turn-based strategy games:\nRandomly generated maps.\nEverything is on hexes.\nGrowing cities.\nSettlers that build new cities.\nNegotiations with other Warlocks.\nWarships for sea battles.\netc...\nThis this game does differently, compared to other turn-based strategy games:\nThe city upgrades are visible on the map, but can't be destroyed by enemies.\nYou can build Forts and Magic-towers that, along with the city, can fire on nearby enemies. These two buildings can be destroyed.\nEach unit and hero takes up one hex on the map, you can't combine them.\nEach ground unit turns into its own transport ship. The ship disappears when they land.\nYou can cast offensive, defensive, and even map-changing spells.\nThere are alternative worlds that you can raid.\nConstant random map events.\nNot overly complicated.\netc...\nAt first, some people will feel weird with each unit taking up on hex, but you get used to it and actually learn to like it. As your troops and heroes level up, get more upgrades, and become stronger, you learn to value each unit and want to keep them alive.\n\nYou research spells and harvest mana to cast them. Each spell has a mana cost, but there is also a limit on how much you can use per tern. Spells will use up a small part of what you can use per turn, a big part, all of it, or even take several turns to charge.\n\nSome of the most fun I had in this game:My enemy had a large fleet of ships that wanted to invade me. I held the beach with three melee groups, one archer group, and a healer hero that had a healing aura passive ability.\nI was destroying his ships before they landed and bottlenecking anything that landed. A lot of spells were used and a lot of people died... it was glorious! The guy offered resources and begged for a non aggression pact after I held the line.\nIn another game, I kept trying to assault a guy, but I got pushed back several times because I was outnumbered. I lost a lot of heroes and a few really upgraded units. In my last push, I sacrificed two really good heroes and took two cities. Then I built forts and mage-towers between those two cities to draw the border line. I help it with Stubborn Knights, two groups of heavily upgraded Elven archers, a healer hero, a flying Elven boat, and two groups of druids. After holding the line and devastating the enemy capital with spells, all the land was cursed and filled with tentacles from all the spells. I devastated his army and blew up his capital city... I loved it.You don't really get moments like that in other games. In Total War, you have something similar during the RTS, but it's a lot more fun with spells blowing things up everywhere and randomly appearing armies.\n\nIf you decide to get this game, be warned:The game is not very well optimized and there are a few bugs. The game may crash and may even freeze your computer.\n\nThere are typos and it's clear that development was abandoned, but it's a fun experience. I got the game from a pack for 1$, but it may be worth buying when it is on sale.","September 29, 2015","true","36.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

City growth is pointlessly limited and constricting, not to mention slow, with games being as good as over before getting past your basic warriors. The magic system is an enjoyable power trip once you learn to use it ,then a terrifying fall back to reality when you realise the enemy can too, then back to power trip when you see that no, they really couldn't use magic to save their lives. I would recommend this game to someone new to the genre as a whole, as the game itself is fun with all the mechanics meshing together rather well with alot of room for error, and is a good judge of whether you may like the strategy genre, but for those looking for a deeper experience I would recommend they look elsewhere.","December 22, 2013","false","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

City growth is pointlessly limited and constricting, not to mention slow, with games being as good as over before getting past your basic warriors. The magic system is an enjoyable power trip once you learn to use it ,then a terrifying fall back to reality when you realise the enemy can too, then back to power trip when you see that no, they really couldn't use magic to save their lives. I would recommend this game to someone new to the genre as a whole, as the game itself is fun with all the mechanics meshing together rather well with alot of room for error, and is a good judge of whether you may like the strategy genre, but for those looking for a deeper experience I would recommend they look elsewhere.","December 22, 2013","false","9.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After one playthrough of the game, I'd have to say that it was a good introduction. I can't really compare it to other similar games, so there won't be a wall of pros and cons, but this game proves to be simple and fun.

It took me 12 hours, victory by conquering. Game is similiar to Civ5 - many things are similiar and some were simply copied without alterations. Although in here instead of research you have spells (that can be powerfull) and on the first plane are not towns and civilization - but heroes. They gain levels and are more powerfull and ALL buildings eiher give the ability for you to PURCHASE perks for each individual hero (not globally but micro-management) in addition to choosing traits after each level. Other buildings allow you to promote unit to more powerfull type or unlock new ones. There are 3 races: Humans, Goblins and Undead each with complete upgrade system that relies heavily on resources scattered on the map. They allow different things for different race, but play a while and you will be able to produce settlers of each nation (if you conquer their city).

Labcoat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LtLabcoat/","1680 products in account","The easiest comparison is Civilization 5 with magic. Alright, review over, that was easy!\n\nOkay, really though, it LOOKS like Civ5 at first - it's a city-building game with hex tiles and units that don't stack - but it actually works fairly differently. To explain:\n1: There's a whole lot less focus on cities. In particular, there's not even a research tree! Each city instead has a progression of buildings it can produce and... well, to avoid getting into details, let's just say that every city is just going to specialise in producing one resource and it's nearly always obvious what to build next. It's very simple compared to Civ5.\n2: On the flipside, there's a whole lot more focus on military. In particular, constructing units does NOT slow down constructing buildings, instead costing their own resource (gold) to produce. And there's always wild monsters of varying toughness to kill. The end result is that, rather than in Civilization where peace is the most beneficial option, in this game EVERYONE has an army!\n3: Spells. There's a LOT of spells, and they do a lot of stuff - from hurting and healing to buffing and nerfing to summoning units to changing the landscape to, hell, there's even city-wide buffs in this game. Spell research is what takes over regular research in the Civ games.\n\nThis is all leaving out the other big details, like heroes and gods and the nifty way you get better units. But that could go on for a while. And it's got some problems of its own because it lacks polish, things like a point where micromanagement gets annoying, and that you can't turn off animations (although you can skip them every time), and there's no synchronous multiplayer turns which it so desperately needs. The lack of polish is why I'm really looking forward to Warlock 2.\n\n\nBut the short of it is: I really like it! On it's own, it's really not as good as Civilization 5, it just didn't have the budget to be. But if you love playing super-aggressively in it, this is a game made all about that!\n\n\nOh, as for DLC? Elves adds a new race focused on research and Armageddon introduces a rather nifty man-vs-monster mode, so they're both great. And the rest... isn't worth it. Although really, if you haven't got the game yet, you should just get the Ultimate Edition, it's definitely worth the extra cost!","March 9, 2014","true","31.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm not sure why. Once you know the ins and outs of the game, there's nothing to it and it becomes very boring and uninteresting. Occasionally the AI opponents will declare war on you for no reason. Occasionally monsters will randomly spawn in your territory for no reason. Often times there's zero threat and even on the harder difficulties, these messes can be cleaned up easily. Its less fun and more annoying than anything else.\n\nWarlock is in desperate need of more variety. For game that comes across as a fantasy version of Civilization, it instead chooses to ape Warcraft 3 making for a weird turn based version of it. Ripping off Civ would have worked more in its favor.\n\nThen there are other things in-game that need clean up. The spell book for instance is disorganized listing the spells in order you learned them vs alphabetically or by spell type. In fact, some of the spell descriptions need to be revised for the simple fact none of them tell you who or what it targets. Then there are also redundant spells that are slightly more powerful versions of what you already have. Would've been great if they kept it to a single spell but added a new power level to it in order to decrease disorganized clutter, but whatever.\n\nI bought this game on sale with all its DLC for $6 and pocket change, and I don't feel it was worth it. Not recommended at all.","July 20, 2014","false","30.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The combat aspect does but the problem is there actually seems to be so little else.  There's nothing wrong with combat in an empire building game, of course, but the lack of other gameplay dimensions just leave MoA feeling rather unsatisfactory.  With their being few options to win other than destroying - or at least dominating - the opposition alliances seem rather pointless, rather too obvious examples of marriages of convenience.  Focus is so much on the 'home world', units continuously fed and gobbled up into the unending battle, that diverting resources to the alternative worlds is wasteful.  Any serious attempt to move into such worlds requires such numbers that it inevitably leaves the flank of the home world vulnerable, often ensuring defeat.  Sadly, this leaves the additional worlds feeling irrelevant and gimicky, as oppose to the desperately essential New World fat with resources Myrimor felt like in MoM.  There seem to be rather rudimentary omissions too - after all my hours my victory is greated with a rather underwhelming still; there is no leaderboard to record the same after the disappointing image; there are no steam achievements; the choice of wizards somehow lack personality.  It's seem polished at first, but somehow a bit by-the-numbers and rather unfulfilling.

IIRC you can't even tab out of the game without issues.\n\nAlso, letting people take turns at the same time or at least do *something* while the other players are doing theirs would go a long way.\n\n\nIf you don't mind the game balance being so-so overall, it's a servicable SP game.","March 31, 2015","false","1.9"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","4"

This game's DOS predecessor, Master of Magic, had more mechanics despite being programmed on a much lower budget. Throw in the reality then, that this game's graphics are not top-end, and you end up with a subpar spiritual successor.\n\nThere's a lot to be said for a game that lets you customize a president-wizard with chaos and holy magic and lead a nation of vampires and undead against the elven necromancers, but once the inital glee at customization wears off, the game has shallow mechanics for combat, no population happiness/revoltrisk like in other civilization games, and a meagre selection of units. Winning is just about expanding with generic "settler" units, building the same buildings, and researching a limited selection of spells. Even though there are multiple ways to win the game, they all work around this same principle: there's no real way for small kingdoms to win.\n\nIf you want a fantasy civilization game, I would suggest searching for Civilization IV or V mods, or going back and playing the original Master of Magic on DOSbox.","January 20, 2014","false","83.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Over the years, many game companies have been trying to bring back or remake a lot of the original older games with modern day technology. Such games include Duke Nukem, Shadow Warrior, Wizardry 8.\n\nWhen I first played the game Civilization V, it was very remarkable and I had a great time playing that game. Now, they designed a game that plays just like it, only it's this game, WARLOCK. This is a fantastic remake of the classic "Master Of Magic". Although the original game company is no longer around, this is not to imply that this IS the remake, because it's not... not officially anyways. But this game comes so close to Master Of Magic, I just love this game.\n\nIt plays just like Civilization V, only you also learn spells, summon monsters, and hire heroes to help you protect your kingdom and realms. With so much to do and so much more than Civilization V, you only thought that you played the best strategy game. Get ready to be a Wizard istead of a Mayor.

I got this as part of a bundle without knowing anything about it at all, and was pleasantly surprised.  It's a hex-based strategy game which is realtively light, and whose mechanics keep it tight the whole way through.  The gameplay is sort of like Civilization 5 minus Civilization 4 - city building and resources are dealt with in a minimalist style, and the hex-based combat has a similar feel to the best of Civ 5, with an expanded system for damage types.  It also has an overland magic system that will remind you of Master of Magic.  Apart from tight mechanics, this game is also very colourful - visually appealing with an entertaining roster of units, and a sense of humour which isn't forced or overlaboured.  The only real downside is that the animations are too long, and you need to skip them to play at any rate - doubly bad as that detracts from the atmosphere and also gives you RSI.  Would still strongly recommend if you're looking for a combat focused turn-based strategy game that's a bit more lightweight than other games in the genre.","May 23, 2014","true","67.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I was to point out a single flaw it would be the strategy level of things which is to be considered ''light'', as diplomacy, city management and internal governing is rather streamlined and simplified but this  would depend greatly on a player's taste.\n\nIt is a fantastic game that keeps suprising you, keeps you interested in its late game and seemingly never runs out of things to do!

Warlock isn't an entirely faithful remake but as the subtitle suggests it definitely takes a lot of inspiration from it, marrying Civ-style empire building with fantasy concepts and most importantly magic, right down to spells that can change terrain types, summon powerful units or place permanent enhancements on units.\n\nThe game is well-balanced and allows for enough diversity in approach to offer good replay value. It's solidly constructed but maybe a bit too shallow for diehard strategy fans. The GUI can be a bit iffy at times, getting you stuck on screens without discernible exit, but hitting ESC usually solves that problem. Considering the price tag that's not even an issue however.\n\nBeyond the magical elements it squarely falls on the Civ side of strategy games, omitting detailed battles for simple unit vs. unit square-offs on the world map. Anyone who enjoys any kind of Civ game and is looking for something less complex they can finish inside of a few hours should be delighted to have this game. Anyone who likes fantasy themes and is looking for something with a bit of strategical meat to it (where games such as Heroes VI or King's Bounty are mostly governed by tactical rather than strategical choices) should be equally happy.\n\nAnd lasty there's the humor. The game doesn't take itself or its setting all too seriously which helps keep the experience light.

I thought it might be somewhat similar to XCOM, which was my first foray into turn-based strategy games. No such luck. Warlock - Master of the Arcane has no story, clunky controls, annoying voice-overs, cliche lore, and is painfully sexist. There is apparently no real campaign, just quests that randomly appear. The controls work some of the time, and there is no menu to map controls to different keys. The voice acting is stilted at best, and tends to be jarring. Play is slow and uninteresting. Out of all the character options (~12) there are two females - a healer and a dragon queen. There's no female undead character, or a female battle-mage, which was extremely disappointing. The only redeeming qualities? Well, the graphics are nice enough, but the best thing is I got this for free in a humble bundle, so I can throw this abysmal excuse for a strategy game away with no regrets.\n2/10","December 17, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And you'd be pretty accurate.\n\nOn the other, you could call it a surprisingly deep and funny hex-based grand strategy game with clever tongue-in-cheek flavor text and voicing to back up a fast-paced, engaging, and interesting gameplay that will always leave you with plenty on your plate to work on and plenty to look forward to until the moment you win.\n\nYou will probably never run out of world to explore, even after searching most of the primary map, since the best resources are off in the distance, hiding, and the alternate worlds have even better loot to find, and you will probably never be able to dedicate as much of your resources as you'd like to exploring, because there are always monsters or angy neighbors on your doorstep just waiting to punch you in the face when you aren't looking.\n\nWhile it puts just a little much value in the city-spam, Warlock is a fiendishly fun and interesting game that is yes, like Civ, but also independent of it in character and style.

It shares some elements with Civ5, Heroes of Might and Magic and of course Majesty.  Diplomacy is a little lacking and schizophrenic so it's really war heavy, I've found it necessary to constantly sign and resign non-aggression pacts in order to stay at peace when my army's busy clearing another realm for expansion.   The spellcasting is a really neat element though and a lot of fun to play with especially the terraforming spells.  Need a land bridge between continents?  Raise one.  Farms not producing in your frozen tundra?  Make the land fertile.  Don't be afraid to enchant away either, the upkeep really isn't bad considering how much mana you eventually bring in.  The difficulty is a little on the weak side though and once you get the hang of the mechanics  it's not really challenging in the long run, then again that's a problem most 4X games have so I wouldn't let that influence things much.","November 8, 2014","true","152.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought it might be somewhat similar to XCOM, which was my first foray into turn-based strategy games. No such luck. Warlock - Master of the Arcane has no story, clunky controls, annoying voice-overs, cliche lore, and is painfully sexist. There is apparently no real campaign, just quests that randomly appear. The controls work some of the time, and there is no menu to map controls to different keys. The voice acting is stilted at best, and tends to be jarring. Play is slow and uninteresting. Out of all the character options (~12) there are two females - a healer and a dragon queen. There's no female undead character, or a female battle-mage, which was extremely disappointing. The only redeeming qualities? Well, the graphics are nice enough, but the best thing is I got this for free in a humble bundle, so I can throw this abysmal excuse for a strategy game away with no regrets.\n2/10","December 17, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not too bad, for what I played. It's very reminiscient of the old game I had the pleasure of playing called 'Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim'. Though don't confuse the two. The playstyles of each are entirely different. The only thing in common is the game takes place possibly during the events of Majesty II, its sequel, as a war of sorts. Your goal? To conquer the lands as your chosen lord, leading your armies to conquest.\n\nYou can play a variety of races, from the usual humans to bestial creatures to undead, while being able to use each one's skill to however your preferences are. After gaining enough experience with a unit, the option will be given to promote their abilities at random. This, along with the random spells you get help to make the game interesting. It never becomes too doldrum to enjoy, but it can become complicated with so much happening on-screen at once, and it'd leave the players somewhat confused. Though if you can overcome this, this is truly a unique and challenging game that I'd definitely recommend to any of my friends and any who see this comment.","September 23, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can tell by the screenshots that the landscape is great, Units look great, effects look great, everything graphical is great. 10/10\n\nSound: Great sound. From great music to units shouting out battle crys before attacking. Spell sounds are also done well too. Voice acting is also pretty good. 10/10\n\nStory: Really, it's a 4X strategy game (amuch like civilization 5) so there isn't really a story-line here. But because it's a 4X it doesn't need it. But this game goes further and puts in a bunch of lore for each unit, resource, and great mage there is the game, which is always a plus. 9/10\n\nGameplay: If you like Civ 5, your gonna like this. It's basically that with a high focus on a Fantasy setting, which I personally love. But there some changes though. This game gives you full customization of your world as well as your Great mage from the start, which is always nice. And, probabbly the game's biggest selling point, it has a HUGE unit variety. Even units that aren't appart to your Mage's race can be used by capturing one of their cities. This makes for some awesome mixed armies. There isn't technologies anymore though, instead there are spells, which I thought was a good change. These spells range from summons to buffs, attacks to heals, and even let you alter the land itself. However there is one major flaw I see. ALL of the game's victory conditions are basically militaristic one way or another. This makes Diplomacy seem like a very small edition that you really don't have to worry about. And Diplomacy itself is very basic. Now, I'm sure the Developers purposly did this due to large amount of units, but it really just limits the game. 8.5/10\n\nReplayability: Like I said, High Unit amount. 3 different races of monsters, as well as some special creatures. However, due to the extremely similar victory conditions, it takes away from the replayability. 7/10\n\nLast thoughts: I loved Warlock. Sure Diplomacy is mostly pointless and late game can get kinda tediouse (but this is apparent in most 4X titles) and the victory conditions may be very similar, but that doesn't stop this from being a great title. If you like 4X Strategy games. Buy it. Like Civ 5? Buy it. Like Fantasy Strategy Games? Buy it. Theres even a demo if your unsure. my thoughts on the sequel. Don't but it. Just buy this game with all the expansions and you basically have the sequal.\n\nFInal Score: 8.5/10","July 24, 2014","true","32.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a simplistic, fantasy themed Civ V.\n\nNah really that's it. There's not much happening here. There are three resources to manage, three different races to play, you can kind of choose different 'civ leaders' to play but you can edit them easily because they're literally a few buffs for resource gathering and a few staring spells, you have a bunch of units whose stats are pretty straight forward and you can improve them but they don't really 'advance' other than leveling up and building improvements, your civ researches are replaced with researching new spells, there are neutral 'city-states' that you can fight and take over because there's no diplomatic options with them, there are monsters you can murder, and there are multiple worlds that function somewhat similar to the one you start on but tend to have more and higher level monsters.\n\nThat's everything. That's all the game's features, right there. I might have missed one or two things but there's just not much to 'get' from this game. There isn't even a campaign, it's just skirmish or multiplayer. Having played other turn based strategy games, this one seems like it would be good for someone who's never played one before.\n\nThat said, it's not bad. Everything in it is functional. You do have to have graphical options above a certain point or a lot of the game's UI features don't work, at least for me, but really it's not terribly intensive even on the higher settings.\n\nIf you like turn based strategy and fantasy, this is okay. It does a lot of macro-level controls very well. If you want very precise control, or even a lot of things to manage in your turn based strategy game or, I dunno, a lot of options for things you'll probably want to find something else.","September 10, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals are pretty nice and certainly help draw you in a little bit but only as much as a top-down perspective really can.  Despite being turn based if you really get into it the gameplay can get the blood pumping quite a bit.\n\nThe game has plenty to offer and multiplayer can be an engaging playthrough as well.  The sounds and music can be fun and help to draw you in as well and sometimes it can just be kind of funny hearing some of the things that the units spout forth such as "Best archers in the world" from the goblin sharpshooters.\n\nMy overall rating for this game as compared to games within the same genre, particularly big name games like Civ?  8/10 as some things could have been done better.\n\nComplaints?

If you pick it up on sale its very highly recommended. It has some different game elements and part of your sucsess depends on what tiles you have acess to, in that you dont build units based on buildings in your city that you obtained from the tech tree but there would be a resorce tile that allows you to build certain units. there is no tech tree at all. at least not one that you choose, you get to pick one of five random spells and whichever one you choose the next time you can choose again only that one gets replaced. if you get fire bolt at some point fire ball might come up. the parallel plains are an interesting concept but i was never able to actually kill any of the gaurdians of the gates. neat game but a little rough as far as some of the interfaces go, kind of frusterating because it seems like it would be an easy fix.","April 11, 2015","true","70.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a cross between civilization and might and magic, done ok.  Battles are a bit lopsided as the bad guys get units that kick the crap out of yours early on and tha tis on NORMAL mode.  It takes awhile for you to get enough units to fight one of theirs...as it often takes 10+ units to take out one of their "special guys".  Normal units die just as easily as yours.  Strategy wise I dont' really see too much of it.  Other than you have to have area of control to use certain buildings to get certain units.  It is more of a build this to attack kind of a game than having an overarching requirement of strategy.

But, let's go into detail as to why.\nSetting: A high-fantasy setting with dragons and mages and gods and stuff. (If you couldn't figure that out by the title, I feel sorry for you.)\nWho you play as: A master ritualist, who is able to cast spells clear across the world. You control mass armies with absolutely no minds of their own. (as standard for 4X games)\nNow to the jucy stuff.\nHow optimized is it? To give you a good idea: I bought a 300 dollar laptop to be nothing but a virus-free stock trading machine, with almost no GPU or CPU power. Runs it just fine. A tad slow, but still runs fine. There is a point here, though, that I MUST  point out. You can NOT turn off animation, by what I can tell. And just about everything has god damned animations. Don't get me wrong they look really nice, and they are well-optimized...but if you could disable the animation, you could probably use a $100 laptop from 8-9 years ago to run this game. Animations, especially for a lot of simultaneous units costs quite a large deal of power.\nResearch is not for typical technology. In fact, technology is not dependent upon research at all. Instead, it's determined by your buildings, which is somewhat odd...yet neat at the same time. Now, what your research IS for: new spells and rituals which you can then cast to either plague your enemy or grant boons to your allies.\nHow is research done? Well, kinda standard: you select what you want to research, then wait for a set amount of time based on points required / points generated per turn. But, unlike most games which have specific tech trees, the spells you get the chance to research are relatively randomly picked, and you get a selection of 5. I think there are some basic requirements before it is in the pool of potential spells, as I never had a top-tier spell show up early on, but I did get like a lesser and a greater version of the same spell in the spell research at the same time.\nHow's the unit selection? Well, it's damn good. Took me a good several games to play most of them, and even now, after 47.3 hours, I've yet to use some, or have them used on me (most notably the incredibly expensive dragon...which takes so long to build, and save up for, it's pretty much not worth it). There are some slightly unbalanced units, at least for their cost, but it's nothing gamebreaking, and even old trolls can be killed quite handily.\nThere are also champions, or basically super minions that must be bought when they randomly appear. This comes from one of the DLC, and REALLY seems like an after-thought more than anything. Some are just not good for their cost, others are quite insane, and snowball so extremely that they single-handedly decimate armies and take entire towns in one shot. Now, several heroes can EVENTUALLY do that, but of course, some are just overpowered, and ramp up far too quickly.\nNot to mention the only way to attract them is to wait for the RNG to give you the chance to buy them. There is NO way to influence this by my experience. This is a particularly dissapointing part of the game, but, I think the other, more polished features make up for this.\nGraphics: I really can not comment too greatly on this, as I am no graphic critic, but they looked pretty nice. I also liked the graphic style, but that is nothing mut personal preference.\nAI: Can be quite punishing. I, however, was never really at any risk of losing...aside from at the very beginning...from an AI. But, they do have no problems with taking your undefended, and lightly-defended cities. The diplomacy system, however, is kinda weak, and kinda lacks a bit of the personality you would like, but it's...robust. It works. You, however, can force someone to bribe you for peace, then just continue to conquer them. I am actually ok with that, but the AI never learns that you do this, so they will keep giving you money to continue your conquest.\n\nMaps: there are several parts that make a good map, in my opinion, so I will split this up.\nVariety: Each map is randomly generated. So yes, it's got a good deal of variety (Screw spelling). There are also a nice, large number of different types fo tiles, and their art work is not wholely independent of eachother. If a plains is by a lava field, the lava art will leak over into the near-by tiles without changing the tile itself. Just look at the screenshots for exampls of this.\nShape of tiles: Hexagonal tiles are always the best. It will always take the same number of movements to move from one tile to another, so long as you go directly there, regardless of moving diagonally or up then right or left.\nHow easily can you tell the terrain types apart? Incredibly easily. A swamp looks nothing like a volcano or ocean, a plains looks nothing like frozen terrain. You can easily tell when tiles are seperated by rivers.\n\n(OK, my mind blanked right here. I'm going to bed, I might amend the review later when I wake up.)","February 21, 2014","true","89.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It shares some elements with Civ5, Heroes of Might and Magic and of course Majesty.  Diplomacy is a little lacking and schizophrenic so it's really war heavy, I've found it necessary to constantly sign and resign non-aggression pacts in order to stay at peace when my army's busy clearing another realm for expansion.   The spellcasting is a really neat element though and a lot of fun to play with especially the terraforming spells.  Need a land bridge between continents?  Raise one.  Farms not producing in your frozen tundra?  Make the land fertile.  Don't be afraid to enchant away either, the upkeep really isn't bad considering how much mana you eventually bring in.  The difficulty is a little on the weak side though and once you get the hang of the mechanics  it's not really challenging in the long run, then again that's a problem most 4X games have so I wouldn't let that influence things much.","November 8, 2014","true","152.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's basically Civilization V... but with MAGIC... dragons, gods, mythology, wizards, and monsters. Need I say more? Well here's more:\n-The graphics... holy cow the fidelity! So vivid, lush and vibrant! Some of the most beautiful environments I have ever seen. Care was even placed into animating city borders. Everything comes together to seriously make you feels that the world you're playing in is filled with magic.\n-The combat in this game completely blows the Civ5 combat system out of the water. Your units can continue leveling indefinitely and gain permanent buffs from the spells you cast upon them. As a result you end up caring about your units and start to grow with them through the ages. They each become quite formidable in their own right. That archer you started out with on turn 1? Well guess what, he's fighting an immortal god now on turn 80 because you kept investing in him.\n-There are randomly generating events happening all over the world that affects all players, which is absolutely awesome. You're fighting not just on land and sea but in other dimensions and planetary planes. There is also huge replay ability through the randomly generated maps, and the versatility in which you can play your wizard. Do you want to create the most powerful cities the world has ever seen? Or do you want your units to take on gods? Or would you rather amass the greatest army or navy? Or just burn everyone with your magic!\n-The units you can build are based upon your environment... that's right... you can potentially get different types of armies every game! You are no longer tied down to your race or class but can scour the world seeking elves, werewolf, or dragon turtles.\n-The interface looks absolutely breath taking. Someone put a lot of love and care into designing an extremely immersive interface.\n\nCons:\n-Unit controls and deselection sometimes executes commands you did not intend.\n-There is no visible tech tree for spells, which I'd imagine is quite extensive, you end up praying for the spell you want.","October 1, 2014","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got a great deal of depth. There are 3 major races, all sorts of special resources some of which give you additional military units or other bonuses, 8 gods, up to 8 planes of existence, perks, special spells depending on divine alignment... the list goes on and on.\n\nGet the ultimate edition if you can - the DLC isn't essential, but it does add a number of fun features I like to play with.\n\nIf you`re interested, there`s a free demo to try out too. It gives you about 50 turns of gameplay to try out, and gives you a decent starting taste of the game.\n\nFor those looking for game comparisons, it`s probably most similar to a very old game called Master of Magic. It runs on the Civ 5 engine, though, so it`s very pretty. There are some background story elements loosely borrowed from Majesty (the choice of gods and to a loose extent the races and creatures), but it is a very different kind of game than Majesty was.","June 8, 2012","true","98.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a lot like Civ 5, but you can actually do things like changing the terrain, attacking with spells, buffing your dudes and so on.\n\nWith the Ultimate edition, you have access to 4 races which are fundamentally different. You colonize the world civ-style, but you also have access to other dimensions that you can take over via portals. You can also raise or lower the land level, change the land type, and so on.\n\nThe combat aspect is WAY better than in Civ 5, with buffs, debuffs, 5 attack types, 4 unit types (flying, aquatic, amphibious and land) and such.\n\nThere is only one majow flaw: There's no hybrid turns in multiplayer.

A fan of traditional fantasy settings and overly powerful magic spells?  Want to mix the two?  Warlock is just that.\n\nThe setting is based on the Majesty universe: all the typical fantasy tropes (humans, undead, dwarves, elves, dragons, trolls, etc, etc in a medieval time period) with a lighter (less doom and gloom, more tongue-in-cheek) feel.  The gameplay is mostly Civ, but with a few twists.  Build progressions for cities feel like a good mix between Civ and the Majesty world, and the tech tree is replaced by a progressive magic research tree.  Want the best units?  Rather than relying upon long term tech research, powerful units are acquired through hired or captured heroes and specific city building dependencies.  Research is still a big part of the game, but it instead leads to more powerful spells that you cast to effect the world directly: heal, destroy, buff or curse units, terraform land, bless your cities, etc.\n\nWhile I was never personally a fan of Civ's barbarian AI (frequently capable of screwing players randomly early on, never relevant in later game), Warlock really improves upon the typical "barbarian" elements and adds a more RPG feel with interest and depth to the later game and a better balance early on.  Rather than generic hordes or goodie huts, enemy AI forms into unique AI enemy sets,  complete with quests, unique spawn points, and build-up over time.  Ignore those generic AI spiders over there?  They will grow stonger, more numerous, and vastly more dangerous over time.\n\nAnother twist is the addition of alternate worlds accessible through discoverable "gates".  Like the general map, these lands are completely developable, but they tend to contain higher level AI enemies as well.  Conquer one of these worlds and you'll have some great resources at your disposal, as well as a narrow gateway to defend your territory via these secondary worlds... but to do so you may have to fight some tough AI "barbarians" on this second front, all while playing the main map's Civ game against your usual foes.  Let an opponent "dig in" to one of these zones and you've got an even bigger fight on your hands.\n\nAlso, since the time-span is limited and not a span of all civilization like Civ, it pays to maintain, improve and defend every unit.  Even docile units gain XP and level up, and the most active units can accumulate quite a pile of buffs and levels.  Dislike losing veteran units in Civ?  You'll really hate losing them in Warlock.\n\nThere's some general system steamlining too.  Personally, I find the lower level of city and civilization micromanagement an improvement, but if you prefer city management to unit development, your mileage may vary.  Diplomacy, general civilization alignment, and city development and mass unit buildup is fairly simplified by Civ standards in favor of hero units, conquest and a questing system.  It doesn't feel like an oversight though, since the former, simplified areas aren't really where Warlock concentrates its focus, and the later mechanics are well fleshed out.\n\nOverall, Warlock is a pretty great take on the Civ formula.  If you like fantasy rpgs and 4x style games as well, you'll likely find Warlock at least worth the entry price.","March 19, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a very combat-focused 4X game, but since everything is for the ultimate goal of combat, it ends up feeling very narrow. The world has lots of NPC monsters that create a cool world, but they quickly become just background annoyances that you have to spend resources to control.\n\nTo be fair, I only got about two hours into a game after playing the demo several times, so maybe it gets way more interesting later on (for instance, I barely got to explore through any of the portals), but I just got bored and didn't want to see any more. If the demo REALLY grabs you, you may also like the main game, but otherwise, I'd go elsewhere for your 4X strategy fix.","February 9, 2014","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this as part of a bundle without knowing anything about it at all, and was pleasantly surprised.  It's a hex-based strategy game which is realtively light, and whose mechanics keep it tight the whole way through.  The gameplay is sort of like Civilization 5 minus Civilization 4 - city building and resources are dealt with in a minimalist style, and the hex-based combat has a similar feel to the best of Civ 5, with an expanded system for damage types.  It also has an overland magic system that will remind you of Master of Magic.  Apart from tight mechanics, this game is also very colourful - visually appealing with an entertaining roster of units, and a sense of humour which isn't forced or overlaboured.  The only real downside is that the animations are too long, and you need to skip them to play at any rate - doubly bad as that detracts from the atmosphere and also gives you RSI.  Would still strongly recommend if you're looking for a combat focused turn-based strategy game that's a bit more lightweight than other games in the genre.","May 23, 2014","true","67.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I was to point out a single flaw it would be the strategy level of things which is to be considered ''light'', as diplomacy, city management and internal governing is rather streamlined and simplified but this  would depend greatly on a player's taste.\n\nIt is a fantastic game that keeps suprising you, keeps you interested in its late game and seemingly never runs out of things to do!

The UI is nearly a pixel-by-pixel clone of Civ 5, but the streamlined combat-oriented nature of the game speeds up the pace a bit.\n\nWandering creatures, aka barbarians, also play a more prominent role compared to the Civ games where they cease to be a threat. Similar to HOMM, defeating monsters on the world map is key to growing your territory and consolidating your power before taking on the other great mages. Diplomacy consists of "give us stuff, or die".\n\nUnfortunately, the AI is dumb as bricks which takes away most of the challenge and pretty much kills the replayability. I usually play at Prince or lower in Civ, but I was able to beat the AI opponents in Warlock quite easily on hard; I would not recommend this game to strategy buffs. So in terms of value, it's not all that great, but it's fun for a more beat-em-up style diversion once or for people who think the Civ games are too hard or complex.","November 27, 2013","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It gives you about 50 turns of gameplay to try out, and gives you a decent starting taste of the game.\n\nFor those looking for game comparisons, it`s probably most similar to a very old game called Master of Magic. It runs on the Civ 5 engine, though, so it`s very pretty. There are some background story elements loosely borrowed from Majesty (the choice of gods and to a loose extent the races and creatures), but it is a very different kind of game than Majesty was.","June 8, 2012","true","98.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The UI is nearly a pixel-by-pixel clone of Civ 5, but the streamlined combat-oriented nature of the game speeds up the pace a bit.\n\nWandering creatures, aka barbarians, also play a more prominent role compared to the Civ games where they cease to be a threat. Similar to HOMM, defeating monsters on the world map is key to growing your territory and consolidating your power before taking on the other great mages. Diplomacy consists of "give us stuff, or die".\n\nUnfortunately, the AI is dumb as bricks which takes away most of the challenge and pretty much kills the replayability. I usually play at Prince or lower in Civ, but I was able to beat the AI opponents in Warlock quite easily on hard; I would not recommend this game to strategy buffs. So in terms of value, it's not all that great, but it's fun for a more beat-em-up style diversion once or for people who think the Civ games are too hard or complex.","November 27, 2013","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, let's go into detail as to why.\nSetting: A high-fantasy setting with dragons and mages and gods and stuff. (If you couldn't figure that out by the title, I feel sorry for you.)\nWho you play as: A master ritualist, who is able to cast spells clear across the world. You control mass armies with absolutely no minds of their own. (as standard for 4X games)\nNow to the jucy stuff.\nHow optimized is it? To give you a good idea: I bought a 300 dollar laptop to be nothing but a virus-free stock trading machine, with almost no GPU or CPU power. Runs it just fine. A tad slow, but still runs fine. There is a point here, though, that I MUST  point out. You can NOT turn off animation, by what I can tell. And just about everything has god damned animations. Don't get me wrong they look really nice, and they are well-optimized...but if you could disable the animation, you could probably use a $100 laptop from 8-9 years ago to run this game. Animations, especially for a lot of simultaneous units costs quite a large deal of power.\nResearch is not for typical technology. In fact, technology is not dependent upon research at all. Instead, it's determined by your buildings, which is somewhat odd...yet neat at the same time. Now, what your research IS for: new spells and rituals which you can then cast to either plague your enemy or grant boons to your allies.\nHow is research done? Well, kinda standard: you select what you want to research, then wait for a set amount of time based on points required / points generated per turn. But, unlike most games which have specific tech trees, the spells you get the chance to research are relatively randomly picked, and you get a selection of 5. I think there are some basic requirements before it is in the pool of potential spells, as I never had a top-tier spell show up early on, but I did get like a lesser and a greater version of the same spell in the spell research at the same time.\nHow's the unit selection? Well, it's damn good. Took me a good several games to play most of them, and even now, after 47.3 hours, I've yet to use some, or have them used on me (most notably the incredibly expensive dragon...which takes so long to build, and save up for, it's pretty much not worth it). There are some slightly unbalanced units, at least for their cost, but it's nothing gamebreaking, and even old trolls can be killed quite handily.\nThere are also champions, or basically super minions that must be bought when they randomly appear. This comes from one of the DLC, and REALLY seems like an after-thought more than anything. Some are just not good for their cost, others are quite insane, and snowball so extremely that they single-handedly decimate armies and take entire towns in one shot. Now, several heroes can EVENTUALLY do that, but of course, some are just overpowered, and ramp up far too quickly.\nNot to mention the only way to attract them is to wait for the RNG to give you the chance to buy them. There is NO way to influence this by my experience. This is a particularly dissapointing part of the game, but, I think the other, more polished features make up for this.\nGraphics: I really can not comment too greatly on this, as I am no graphic critic, but they looked pretty nice. I also liked the graphic style, but that is nothing mut personal preference.\nAI: Can be quite punishing. I, however, was never really at any risk of losing...aside from at the very beginning...from an AI. But, they do have no problems with taking your undefended, and lightly-defended cities. The diplomacy system, however, is kinda weak, and kinda lacks a bit of the personality you would like, but it's...robust. It works. You, however, can force someone to bribe you for peace, then just continue to conquer them. I am actually ok with that, but the AI never learns that you do this, so they will keep giving you money to continue your conquest.\n\nMaps: there are several parts that make a good map, in my opinion, so I will split this up.\nVariety: Each map is randomly generated. So yes, it's got a good deal of variety (Screw spelling). There are also a nice, large number of different types fo tiles, and their art work is not wholely independent of eachother. If a plains is by a lava field, the lava art will leak over into the near-by tiles without changing the tile itself. Just look at the screenshots for exampls of this.\nShape of tiles: Hexagonal tiles are always the best. It will always take the same number of movements to move from one tile to another, so long as you go directly there, regardless of moving diagonally or up then right or left.\nHow easily can you tell the terrain types apart? Incredibly easily. A swamp looks nothing like a volcano or ocean, a plains looks nothing like frozen terrain. You can easily tell when tiles are seperated by rivers.\n\n(OK, my mind blanked right here. I'm going to bed, I might amend the review later when I wake up.)","February 21, 2014","true","89.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Targetting the weakest resistance is a big part of being successful in combat. However, you can't just pile on resistances; you get diminishing returns, so you will always take -some- damage from a powerful attack.\n\nUnits can't stack, either. There's none of the Civ-style nonsense where 1 low-tech unit can indefinitely fend off mountains of high-tech units (1 pikeman vs 5 tanks, pikeman wins, gg).\n\nAnd then you have the spells, which are balanced by how rarely you can cast them. Which spells to cast is a major strategical decision.\n\nI highly recommend it if you like 4X games.

It is a 4x hex based game (expand, explore, exterminate, and exploit), akin to Civ 5.  My very limited exposure to Civ 5 leads me to halt any more comparisons there, however I have read there are significant differences between the two games.  I've seen it most compared with Masters of Magic.\n\nThe single player can be quite fun due to the interesting characters that exist within the game.  It's also got very solid gameplay and the balance isn't too bad.  The main gripe I've seen about balance is Undead and Favor to Grum-Gog, since it allows the expansion phase to be dominated by the player who chooses it and abuse the fact that Undead don't use food to spam Strong Rats, who use only food as a resource. This can also be abused in multiplayer (which is currently deserted).  Also another gripe I have is the maps are randomly generated, which for the most part is okay, but if I were to take this game super seriously and decide to be competitive, I'd want to be able to make maps to make sure they are well balanced and strategic.\n\nThe base game features 3 different races that you can start off with, and each are different enough.  As you take over other towns which belong to a different race than what you start with, you can use their technologies and units to add to your army.  There are dozens of spells that are available that you can use on average once per turn, unless you use a spell that reduces casting time.  The spells range from pure damage to buffs and debuffs to units and global as well as city buffs.  There are also spells you can only get if you worship one of the eight gods, like the Summon Strong Rats I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe DLC is decent, one allows you to have hero characters which you can customize with up to three items, one introduces an entire new race, and another allows for a more difficult challenge.  I'd probably get the Armageddon DLC if anything just to make the game a bit more difficult, since the AI's in this game are pretty limited.  The extra race isn't necessary, but it's unique and the hero units are really very strong and can be buffed to ridiculous levels.\n\nAlso, before now there was no hope of this game going anywhere.  But there is a new subforum on the official forums for modding.  Before now, Ino-Co or somebody didn't want this to be modded at all, and in turn it pretty much killed the forum community since the game stagnated and there was no more DLC.  Though it looks like that may be reversed soon, which would be way cool.\n\ntl;dr version: 4x game, decent balance, random maps, lots of spells, cool characters, ok DLC, currently no modding, maybe modding later. Good game.","May 6, 2013","true","314.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FaithfulArcher/recommended/203630/","FaithfulArcher","dracushawktalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FaithfulArcher/","67 products in account","This is a pretty fun game.\n\nWhile on the surface it's clearly a Civ V clone, the added flavor of the Majesty universe really helps this game stand out on it's own. The three core playable races are interesting and different enough to add some variety and the alternate planes make it possible to expand even in the endgame.\n\nThat being said, there are some problems.\n\nThe diplomacy is terrible. Every demand, request, etc. only ever has two option: accept or declare war. On top of that the things that effect your standing with another Wizard/Mage/whatever are shifted heavily towards the negative. Heck one of the biggest negative impacts is "Envy of the Leader" if you, you know, actually play to win and don't putz around.\n\nSecondly, the costs are insane. The resource and upkeep costs for units (particularly elites) are massive. While the idea make sense: they're elites, you're not supposed to have a lot of them, the execution is poorly done. This also applies to certain "special" units like Elves (without the Return of the Elves DLC), Dwarves, or Minotaurs that require special buildings on unique hexes to attain. While some hex resources like Gold or Jewels can help aleviate this it takes only one Temple or a unit from them to negate any bonus. It's not uncommon for you to be in the red in terms of gold or mana income for a while until you can build cities to specialize in resources. This brings us to our next problem.\n\nThe expansion of your city can take forever. Since it's so similar to Civ V I'll use that as a comparison. In Civilization you're not limited by population size when it comes to building structures in your settlements and cities and territory for upgrading resources hexes. If you have the tech, space, and hammers you can build it. This is not so here in Warlock. While the resource hexes exist and are a lot more varied than in Civ the various buildings, monuments, and wonders that are built simultaneously in the cities don't exist. This means that the only bonuses you can get for the cities are upgrades for your hexes. This would be fine except that you can only build one upgrade/building per population point. The game will give you a notification that your settlement is ready for a new structure, you assign it to be completed, and you wait for your city to grow bigger so that you can repeat the process. The whole system can be annoying especially coupled with the upkeep costs  and the rush to acquire space and resources at the beginning. You end up creating specialised cities that deal in each indiviual resource which works until something happens and the flow is interrupted and you find yourself with a big red "-30" next to your gold counter while you're at war and trying to expand or upgrade your army.\n\nAll in all this fits the Paradox formula. It's a good game with a creative idea but it's kept from being great by gameplay issues. This is great if you want to play a fantasy Turn Based Strategy but if you're looking for a more in depth game that's *slightly* more balanced you're better off with a game like Civ V.","February 6, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cities don't require a ton of micromanagement, while each choice is still important.  Every unit has it's advantages and limitations, and can level up in order to gain small bonuses or even entirely new abilities.  Vampires, for example, if leveled high enough, grant an aura effect to allies units that allows them a vampiric effect - 40% of the damage they deal, they get back as healing.  Terrain modifiers can easily make or break a battle, and powerful spells can alter that terrain.  The high level of freedom can also allow for many outside-the-box strategies, as well.  In one game, I used the "raise land" spell to create a small island, and then used the teleport spell to slowly ferry my troops across the ocean.  This allowed me to skip waiting on my navy to clear the ocean of sea monsters, and probably sped my conquest of a mostly empty continent by around 20 turns.\n\nThe whole atmosphere of the game is light hearted, with a good deal of humor hidden within the description of the various units.  Even the units themselves can be good for a laugh, with anything from goblin archers saying reversing whether to aim or shoot first, to the fact that one of the strongest units in the game is a giant, fire-breathing turtle.  The game is still medieval fantasy, but it definately has a bit of fun with it.\n\nOne common mistake I see, however, is the belief that this game is a clone of Civilization V.  In fact, this game isn't based on Civ V, it's based on another, much older game.  It does contain many modern updates of the old turn based strategy game design, such as hex grids and 3D graphics, as well as some entirely new material, like the terrain altering spells.  Still, it's long been the nature of every game to be compared to a single, super-popular game within it's own genre.  Kinda like how World of Warcraft is mentioned in virtually every conversation of whether some MMORPG is a good game or not.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is fantastic, the potential for strategic thinking is very high, and aside from an AI that makes me want to punch the other leaders in the face (mostly due to their manipulative design), I really do enjoy this game.  Heck, I've even found some ways to turn the AI's back-stabbyness against them.  Now if only the sequel would hurry up and get here.  =)\n\nP.S. Try the demo.  If you like it, consider Ultimate Edition, because there isn't a single expansion or DLC I didn't like for this game.","March 14, 2014","true","311.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are now "hero" characters and you can equip them with items, so the game now has a mini inventory system. I haven't seen any updates for a while now, so the game may be considered "complete." For the price it is surely a gem.\n\nThe review is written the first week of release. This game takes place in the Majesty universe (Ardiana)\n\nA demo is available on steam that gives a good representation if you care to try before you buy.\n\nFirst thing. Should you buy it? If you are looking at this game because you want to 4X game in a fantasy setting the answer is for $20 or less, YES!\n\nMany people cite Master of Magic as "thee fantasy all others should be measured by." I never played it. My 4X history stared with Civ2, than Age of Wonders Shadow Magic (AoW:SM). AoW:SM was my gem, and I will say Warlock: Master of the Arcane (Warlock) gets close. First there are no separate instanced tactical battles. Fights are pretty much exactly like Civ5. The city building is like Elemental, which means, every building you produce takes up a tile, the space around your city is the limiting factor, every unit/building takes a certain number of turns to produce (there is no varying production). You are limited by area to build (city growth) and for troops your upkeep costs (which can only be balanced by building certain buildings in your cities. That is a unit may cost 3 gold per turn to upkeep, you can build (in one of your limited building squares) a market that will provide you with 3gold. If you produce more troops that you can support you will eventually go broke. In my opinion it works, at least in the early phase of the game. There have been complaints the AI doesn't seem to abide by the same system, and also that players can reach pretty much levels of infinite resources later in the game.\n\nIn addition to making units, when they level up you can pick a bonus much like in Civ4/5. Also units can be enchanted (by casting spells onto them at the cost of magic), or be "outfitted" with "equipment" (for a cost of gold). There is no "crafting" or backpack or item inventory. The way it works is once you build a foundry on a map iron resource you will have an option to click on a unit and click on masterwork armor pay 50gold and you're done. It is more a perk than an item. You can't transfer anything, and if the unit dies all your investment is gone. You choice is pretty much spam units, or produce less units but buff them up. Or work somewhere in-between.\n\nThere are plenty of special locations on the map. They provide a bonus once you build upon them. For example a silver resource for instance you can build a mine for extra Gold, or a silversmith for the ability to upgrade your troops resistance to melee and ranged damage. I really enjoy the choice of two different buildings most times. In past games it seems you pretty much only get one option of what to build on a resource node. One issue is right now you can not destroy a building, so if you decide you want to change your choice later you can not.\nQuests. The games quest system if very similar to AoW:SM. Instead of the spirits of War, Magic, etc, you of the Gods of Ardiana. You get your basic, "Build this", "kill that," "conquer this." Complete quests gives immediate rewards (not completing has a penalty), and in some cases a successful completion will affect your relationship to the corresponding Gods. Favor of a God can unlock extra spells and units, as well as a Victory pathway within the game.\n\nMagic. Magic feels potent. It can keep your troops alive or bring down your enemies. Focusing on Magic research can lead to a Victory pathway.\n\nAI. It does a decent job resisting the player but never really threatens. You can also game the system once you learn the naissances of the AI behavior. For example I let an AI faction that I was at peace with whittle (6 unit army attacking that enemy city for probably 10 turns ) another factions city down to no defense and then just ran in with my rangers and captured it. The AI just slowly walks away, no fuss or complaint.\n\nOverall. Warlock will likely scratch that itch that many gamer have felt since their beloved 4x fantasy game became too outdated. Out of the box it plays much more fluidly and faster than elemental. I've never felt the need to just pound end turn. To me that means the game is fun to play, instead of just parts of the game. For the price of $20 I would buy the game again without second thought. The game is not perfect, there are bugs, but most don't affect gameplay. Also some of the games features to me feel somewhat superficial (diplomacy, getting a quest to build a farm 5 times in a row, having an enemy attack your city every turn retreat->heal->attack again - this doesn't seem effect the output of the city at all) and some promised features that aren't available at all yet (multiplayer). If these features were flushed out just a bit and the bugs taken care of, Warlock could very easily be a satisfying game even at $40. As it is though I think the game is a very good entertainment value for the price of admission. A demo is available on steam that gives a good representation if you care to try before you buy.","August 8, 2013","true","54.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are some background story elements loosely borrowed from Majesty (the choice of gods and to a loose extent the races and creatures), but it is a very different kind of game than Majesty was.","June 8, 2012","true","98.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A fan of traditional fantasy settings and overly powerful magic spells?  Want to mix the two?  Warlock is just that.\n\nThe setting is based on the Majesty universe: all the typical fantasy tropes (humans, undead, dwarves, elves, dragons, trolls, etc, etc in a medieval time period) with a lighter (less doom and gloom, more tongue-in-cheek) feel.  The gameplay is mostly Civ, but with a few twists.  Build progressions for cities feel like a good mix between Civ and the Majesty world, and the tech tree is replaced by a progressive magic research tree.  Want the best units?  Rather than relying upon long term tech research, powerful units are acquired through hired or captured heroes and specific city building dependencies.  Research is still a big part of the game, but it instead leads to more powerful spells that you cast to effect the world directly: heal, destroy, buff or curse units, terraform land, bless your cities, etc.\n\nWhile I was never personally a fan of Civ's barbarian AI (frequently capable of screwing players randomly early on, never relevant in later game), Warlock really improves upon the typical "barbarian" elements and adds a more RPG feel with interest and depth to the later game and a better balance early on.  Rather than generic hordes or goodie huts, enemy AI forms into unique AI enemy sets,  complete with quests, unique spawn points, and build-up over time.  Ignore those generic AI spiders over there?  They will grow stonger, more numerous, and vastly more dangerous over time.\n\nAnother twist is the addition of alternate worlds accessible through discoverable "gates".  Like the general map, these lands are completely developable, but they tend to contain higher level AI enemies as well.  Conquer one of these worlds and you'll have some great resources at your disposal, as well as a narrow gateway to defend your territory via these secondary worlds... but to do so you may have to fight some tough AI "barbarians" on this second front, all while playing the main map's Civ game against your usual foes.  Let an opponent "dig in" to one of these zones and you've got an even bigger fight on your hands.\n\nAlso, since the time-span is limited and not a span of all civilization like Civ, it pays to maintain, improve and defend every unit.  Even docile units gain XP and level up, and the most active units can accumulate quite a pile of buffs and levels.  Dislike losing veteran units in Civ?  You'll really hate losing them in Warlock.\n\nThere's some general system steamlining too.  Personally, I find the lower level of city and civilization micromanagement an improvement, but if you prefer city management to unit development, your mileage may vary.  Diplomacy, general civilization alignment, and city development and mass unit buildup is fairly simplified by Civ standards in favor of hero units, conquest and a questing system.  It doesn't feel like an oversight though, since the former, simplified areas aren't really where Warlock concentrates its focus, and the later mechanics are well fleshed out.\n\nOverall, Warlock is a pretty great take on the Civ formula.  If you like fantasy rpgs and 4x style games as well, you'll likely find Warlock at least worth the entry price.","March 19, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, let's go into detail as to why.\nSetting: A high-fantasy setting with dragons and mages and gods and stuff. (If you couldn't figure that out by the title, I feel sorry for you.)\nWho you play as: A master ritualist, who is able to cast spells clear across the world. You control mass armies with absolutely no minds of their own. (as standard for 4X games)\nNow to the jucy stuff.\nHow optimized is it? To give you a good idea: I bought a 300 dollar laptop to be nothing but a virus-free stock trading machine, with almost no GPU or CPU power. Runs it just fine. A tad slow, but still runs fine. There is a point here, though, that I MUST  point out. You can NOT turn off animation, by what I can tell. And just about everything has god damned animations. Don't get me wrong they look really nice, and they are well-optimized...but if you could disable the animation, you could probably use a $100 laptop from 8-9 years ago to run this game. Animations, especially for a lot of simultaneous units costs quite a large deal of power.\nResearch is not for typical technology. In fact, technology is not dependent upon research at all. Instead, it's determined by your buildings, which is somewhat odd...yet neat at the same time. Now, what your research IS for: new spells and rituals which you can then cast to either plague your enemy or grant boons to your allies.\nHow is research done? Well, kinda standard: you select what you want to research, then wait for a set amount of time based on points required / points generated per turn. But, unlike most games which have specific tech trees, the spells you get the chance to research are relatively randomly picked, and you get a selection of 5. I think there are some basic requirements before it is in the pool of potential spells, as I never had a top-tier spell show up early on, but I did get like a lesser and a greater version of the same spell in the spell research at the same time.\nHow's the unit selection? Well, it's damn good. Took me a good several games to play most of them, and even now, after 47.3 hours, I've yet to use some, or have them used on me (most notably the incredibly expensive dragon...which takes so long to build, and save up for, it's pretty much not worth it). There are some slightly unbalanced units, at least for their cost, but it's nothing gamebreaking, and even old trolls can be killed quite handily.\nThere are also champions, or basically super minions that must be bought when they randomly appear. This comes from one of the DLC, and REALLY seems like an after-thought more than anything. Some are just not good for their cost, others are quite insane, and snowball so extremely that they single-handedly decimate armies and take entire towns in one shot. Now, several heroes can EVENTUALLY do that, but of course, some are just overpowered, and ramp up far too quickly.\nNot to mention the only way to attract them is to wait for the RNG to give you the chance to buy them. There is NO way to influence this by my experience. This is a particularly dissapointing part of the game, but, I think the other, more polished features make up for this.\nGraphics: I really can not comment too greatly on this, as I am no graphic critic, but they looked pretty nice. I also liked the graphic style, but that is nothing mut personal preference.\nAI: Can be quite punishing. I, however, was never really at any risk of losing...aside from at the very beginning...from an AI. But, they do have no problems with taking your undefended, and lightly-defended cities. The diplomacy system, however, is kinda weak, and kinda lacks a bit of the personality you would like, but it's...robust. It works. You, however, can force someone to bribe you for peace, then just continue to conquer them. I am actually ok with that, but the AI never learns that you do this, so they will keep giving you money to continue your conquest.\n\nMaps: there are several parts that make a good map, in my opinion, so I will split this up.\nVariety: Each map is randomly generated. So yes, it's got a good deal of variety (Screw spelling). There are also a nice, large number of different types fo tiles, and their art work is not wholely independent of eachother. If a plains is by a lava field, the lava art will leak over into the near-by tiles without changing the tile itself. Just look at the screenshots for exampls of this.\nShape of tiles: Hexagonal tiles are always the best. It will always take the same number of movements to move from one tile to another, so long as you go directly there, regardless of moving diagonally or up then right or left.\nHow easily can you tell the terrain types apart? Incredibly easily. A swamp looks nothing like a volcano or ocean, a plains looks nothing like frozen terrain. You can easily tell when tiles are seperated by rivers.\n\n(OK, my mind blanked right here. I'm going to bed, I might amend the review later when I wake up.)","February 21, 2014","true","89.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a hex-based strategy game which is realtively light, and whose mechanics keep it tight the whole way through.

It also has an overland magic system that will remind you of Master of Magic.  Apart from tight mechanics, this game is also very colourful - visually appealing with an entertaining roster of units, and a sense of humour which isn't forced or overlaboured.  The only real downside is that the animations are too long, and you need to skip them to play at any rate - doubly bad as that detracts from the atmosphere and also gives you RSI.

It's a cross between age of wonders and civ. its a very agressive fast paced game with tons of combat, heros and leveling. the resourse section is simple to understand. you have gold, food and mana. this game is almost too easy to grasp. the AI is alright. some such as the dragon queen are so agressive you will almost always be at war. the combat doesn't seem like anything to special. but the beauty of the game is trying to keep soldiers alive and buffing them. nothing will make you happier then seeing a cruel creature ( a bunny) slaughter an entire enemys kingdom because they didn't have any magic. i have too many good things to say about this game. I bought it on sale for really cheap, but would buy it now if i didn't have it. depending on enemys difficulty, amount of other worlds, how agressive you are, type of world and amount of enemys, games can take a long time, but i have played an impossible AI on a small map and had it last only a couple hours. but if you go 6 impossible AI on a huge map with 6 other worlds, be prepared to have a long game. 8/10 game score","December 5, 2013","true","294.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The magic system isn't great and the casting times make it a lot of hassle to use all the low impact spells that would be optimal. The religion system offers all the specialized spells, and can be very important for elite units depending on race and resources, but doesn't work well either, you gain favour by having expensive starting perks, randomly getting a quest that is completable or finding one of the rare and defended holy grounds (in my first game I found none of them for ages and wondered how I was meant to complete the quests to make temples I kept getting and losing favour as I failed). Water units are also lacking, with very little varity or ways to upgrade compared to land. I found games becoming a hassle and the AI stopping being a threat late on, and had the shrink down the worlds and factions generated to make things quicker.\n\nDespite that nitpicking it is an engrossing 4x, managing the one-more-turn compulsion. I've already played a lot and enjoyed it, without even touching multiplayer or the apocalypse mode.","April 10, 2015","true","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you pick it up on sale its very highly recommended. It has some different game elements and part of your sucsess depends on what tiles you have acess to, in that you dont build units based on buildings in your city that you obtained from the tech tree but there would be a resorce tile that allows you to build certain units. there is no tech tree at all. at least not one that you choose, you get to pick one of five random spells and whichever one you choose the next time you can choose again only that one gets replaced. if you get fire bolt at some point fire ball might come up. the parallel plains are an interesting concept but i was never able to actually kill any of the gaurdians of the gates. neat game but a little rough as far as some of the interfaces go, kind of frusterating because it seems like it would be an easy fix.","April 11, 2015","true","70.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a cross between civilization and might and magic, done ok.  Battles are a bit lopsided as the bad guys get units that kick the crap out of yours early on and tha tis on NORMAL mode.  It takes awhile for you to get enough units to fight one of theirs...as it often takes 10+ units to take out one of their "special guys".  Normal units die just as easily as yours.  Strategy wise I dont' really see too much of it.  Other than you have to have area of control to use certain buildings to get certain units.  It is more of a build this to attack kind of a game than having an overarching requirement of strategy.

Since a player is only able to send a small army, which is advised by the gaming studio, you are totally wiped out. It really doesn't seem worthwhile to leave the beginning world in my opinion.

I'm going to make a lot of references to Master of Magic (MoM) because I love that 20 years old game and this one reminds me of it in a good way. For example:\nThe research system is reserved to spells, but there is a tech tree of sorts to the units too: In order to build units you need buildings and more advanced buildings for more advanced units. To build the advanced buildings you need to have the basic buildings first. The difference to MoM is that the buildings occupy hexes and there isn't necessarily room to build everything... until you learn the landscaping spells to make more room, that is.\nMoM had the other world besides the main map: Myrror. In this game there can be several alternate worlds, though they are smaller than the main map. They are not as developed as Myrror, only filled with dangerous monsters. Also there seems to be only one portal to each, which could be a bottleneck.\nThe different races with unique buildings and units, though this game has only 4, while MoM had 14.This game also adds to the mix a parthenon of deities, which is a pretty standard thing in fantasy literature, but usually missing in these games. There are divine spells, which are mostly slightly powerful or a bit easier to cast versions of regular spells, that you can only research and cast if you are in favor of that deity. You can gain favor by doing quests and building temples on the holy ground. While you bow down to one god, you show your backside the opposite god. One way to win the game is to get one god so angry that it manifests on the map and then destroy it. Religion also affects the relationships between the wizards. It's a nice system.\n\nSpeaking of quests, they kind of suck. You just get some random build this building/found a city/kill these random enemies that popped up here/capture this city/defeat this player that just pops up. Same with random events being just monster lairs popping up on your lands. Definitely the weakest part of this game. MoM's events had much more style. Some might argue that the AI not being able to handle the complexities could be a bigger problem. I didn't play enough to be sure, but it seemed to be struggling with it. Not worse than Civ 5, but in this game it has to handle with the parallel worlds, terrain changing by spells and stuff like that too.\n\nAll in all a very nice concept that could use some tweaking and filling out the content to be really great. I'm glad I got this free from Humble Bundle. Made me put Warlock II high on my wishlist.","November 13, 2014","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sort of, but not really. There are a few different strategy elements which are mildly interesting. First, you've got your cities. Each city can have buildings, each of which have different bonuses. You have to manage your mana, food, gold, research, and unit production. The trick is to just build cities and focus them on just one resource (to max out your bonuses).\n\nThe second strategy layer is the units and combat. You've got melee units, ranged units, and AoE variants of the two. The general strategy is to have your melee units in front and your ranged units in the back, and try to kill the enemy units faster than they can make them. You also get hero characters, which, with careful management, can become very over powered. In fact, the focus of the game trends towards trying to keep your heros alive as long as possible.\n\nJust to keep you on your toes, the game randomly spawns lots of monsters of a random type every 30 turns or so. It is more of a nuisance than anything else.\n\nThe AI and diplomacy is absurdly simplistic though, so that's quite a fault of this game. You pretty much have four possible relationships: War, rivals, peace, allies. In terms of diplomacy, the only purpose is to turn an AI player into your friend to keep them off your back while you fight some other AI player. Inevitably, each AI player will declare war on you, so don't bother trying to build any sort of close relationship.\n\nIs the game fun? Sure, I enjoy it. I can easily lose track of time playing this game.\n\nIs the game *interesting*? Not really. The mechanics are just too simplistic to give the game long term interest. There's just not a lot of versatility, so the replayability suffers quite a bit once you've got it figured out.\n\nShould you get it? If you've played every other 4X fantasy strategy game out there, this one just promises to deliver more of the same with some variations to the flavor.","May 9, 2014","true","56.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Got this for free during the Humble Bundle thing and had a great time with it ever since. Warlock - Master of the Arcane is a turn based strategy game about a warlock (surprise, surprise!) battling his colleagues in an epic battle for a world filled with Gods, parallel worlds, and more monsters than you can count. The game itself shows a clear influence from the Age of Wonders series. Research spells and unleash them to grant your troops new abilities, weaken and damage your enemies, or change the face of the world around you. Water blocking your way? Raise the land and create a passage for your troops that doesn't put them at the mercy of naval monsters! Mountains slowing down your troops? Flatten them. The mountains, not the troops. Just make sure you have the mana to sustain all your permanent spells. There is little as terrifying as a flying ogre with a vampiric regeneration and an area attack.\n\nMana, as well as gold and food (your main resources) are generated by city buildings. You can found or capture cities, although make sure they have enough room to grow. Place them near strategic resources for some special buildings, depending on the faction that lives in your city - the undead will utilise a pumkin patch different than humans would. Depending on which buildings you have, you can purchase powerful upgrades for your troops, ranging from a slight defense bonus to health regeneration each turn. They will also gain experience from battles, and you may choose an improvement with every levelup as well.\n\nBattles are fairly simple. Move your troops on the hex of the enemy you wish to attack, and they automatically fight. Damage is determined by the health of your troops (full health = max strength), as well as their damage type and the enemy defense. Heroes on either side, like the aforementioned flying ogre, might turn the tide of a battle, and placing your troops in cities or on mountains might give you the edge you need. Randomly given quests by Gods, guilds or an advisor will offer you some short to middle term objectives and keep you busy for a bit, as you wouldn't want to anger a God. Especially the Divine missions often offer a great reward as well, be it a spell or a troop tied to that particular deity. You wouldn't want to miss out on those now, would you?\n\nAll in all a great game with a lot of unit variety, customiseability and a weird sense of humour. One minor issue, though... please don't use Google Translator for in game text. I originally installed the german version, and promptly found some rather glaring issues with that (Close was basically translated to 'near city view' as opposed to 'close that window', for example). Luckily, Steam allowed me to easily switch to english.","February 7, 2015","true","120.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Absolutely terrible AI, play on the highest difficulty if you want even a slight challenge or against the Dwemers or w/e they're called.\n\nStill pretty good.","December 30, 2015","true","99.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy Civ 5 but would rather play with fantasy creatures like elementals and minotaurs instead of horsemen and panzer tanks then this game might be appealing in single player mode.  I would recommend reading other reviews and seeing where this game fails.  For me it was enjoyable playing in single player mode despite the horrible bugs (3 years since release and some MAJOR game play breaking bugs are still present).\n\nThe game is, however, completely unplayable in multiplayer mode. I launched 9 different games on 6 systems to see if maybe changing hardware would help but the game is just broken.  On the first game we had to quit after just 1 turn because one player couldn't move their units (a known MAJOR bug that Paradox has not fixed).  Second game the same things happens on turn 3.  Rinse ans repeat - each time the game getting stuck just a couple turns in. I'm now requesting a refund for this turd.\n\nSteam really needs to remove the multiplayer tag if the developers admit to not fixing the game breaking movement bug after 3 years.","January 1","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
