It's on-rails and you shoot enemies and objects to let them produce sounds, while collecting power-ups to keep yourself alive long enough to survive the boss fights. The worlds and main character aren't as detailed though, and Rez is still the better game between the two (play it if you ever get the chance!), but I'll be honest, Fate is not bad either. It's simple in its presentation, like all the other Bit.Trip games (ok, maybe not Runner 2) and they're never expensive. But, except for Runner 1 and 2, the games never manage to capture my attention long enough. I usually get bored of them within less than 2 hours.\n\nThat, and the fact that there are no checkpoints make it difficult to recommend this game. Sure, it's challenging, but it's too unbalanced. if you die during a level you have to replay the entire level all over again. It can be frustrating because you can usually make it to the boss fights without getting hit (too much).\n\nYup, the boss fights are tough. 'Aren't boss fights supposed to be tough ? And doesn't practice make perfect ?' Well, yes, but only if it's fun to play in the first place. Fate just isn't fun enough.\n\n[Rating: 68/100]","July 25, 2013","true","3.1"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/205080/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","Bit.Trip Fate is somewhat different in terms of incorporating music than other titles in the series, but is still a fun game to play. This game is a literal rail shooter as players control Commander Video and shoot enemies. There are some musical elements when firing at enemies, but this is not a rhythm game. Also, enemies fire in patterns reminescent to bullet hell games, making this game a mix of these three genres of games.\nGraphically, this is similar fare to other Bit.Trip games, but has a design similar to Runner with mostly 3d objects. The backgrounds are somewhat trippy, yet have enough detail to stand out as three unique locations that are traversed in the game. The story continues from Runner as well, with Commander Video and his buddies teaming up to destroy Mingrawn Timbletot. Overall, the story is darker as well with the Commander wanting to fight the enemies with anger as shown in some of the cutscenes. Dubstep style music adds to this dark feeling while playing the game, and the music does sound great as well while not being as dynamic in other games. Music cues are made when destroying an enemy, but they are not in sync with the background music as in other games.\nEssentially, the gameplay is a literal rail shooter with bullet hell and musical elements. Players control the Commander in a set line path, only being able to move left and right along this path. Like in other Bit.Trip games, the player can increase or lose rank, and this powers up or down Commander Video. The game is lost if Commander Video is in Nether mode and gets hit. Powerups are in the stages, each with varying effects. Enemies shoot bullets and occasionally lasers, some of which have their own kind of pattern to dodge. The meat of the difficulty lies with the bosses at the end of each level. Usually, these guys start out with hard patterns at first, then tend to get easier with the next parts of the boss. Most of my deaths were up in the boss areas, although the levels tend to be easy when repeating them.\nThis game can easy or hard depending on those who played bullet hell games before. Many enemies will fire a lot of bullets, so it will take some replaying to follow the pattern and dodge the bullets. For me, the first half of the game was pretty easy, but the second half give me a bit of a challenge. It is definitely shorter than Runner with a total of 6 levels that are each around 10 minutes.\nBit.Trip Fate doesn't have strong rhythm elements in the game. However, it is good in making a different kind of shoot em up game that plays great and has some of the style of the series with its art and music. In essence, this game follows some of the same art and music style, but breaks away from being mainly a rhythm game to deliver a shooter game that delivers its unique and engaging gameplay well.","July 17, 2014","true","2.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/205080/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Never content to repeat the same thing, Bit.Trip once again reinvents itself in Fate, an on rails bullet-hell shooter that feels right at home along with its equally offbeat predecessors. As Commander Video you guided through six levels by a roller-coaster like line, destroying enemies on all sides and attempting to make it to the boss at the end in one piece. As you land shots and collect pickups from you fallen adversaries you level up, which acts as both a health and upgrade system. With each new level your gun becomes more powerful but with each hit you take you lose a level, ultimately leading to a game over screen.\n\nThe basic design of Fate is top notch with an original gameplay mechanic, creative bullet patterns, and great boss battles all covered with a thick coating of Bit.Trip paint. Where it falters is in making enemies satisfying to defeat, as bullets never seem to physically connect despite registering as a hit and causing enemies to disappear in an anticlimactic manner that feels like popping a stubborn balloon. Levels also feel a bit long in the tooth topping off at about 10-15 minutes a piece, which seems to drag on longer than I would have liked and makes it somewhat less ideal for quick play sessions.\n\nDespite not making the same impact as something like Bit.Trip Runner, Fate is still an enjoyable experience that does something new and interesting with the bullet-hell genre that I would like to see replicated in other games. The art and music follow the trademarks of the series while going in a darker more subdued direction, and multiple difficulties give a reason to go back after completing it the first time (which will likely take you between 1-2 hours depending on your skill level).\n\nEven if not everything works just right I still applaud Gaijin Games for continually branching out and trying something new, and am once again impressed at how much does work with Bit.Trip Fate despite the radical difference in gameplay it presents. For fans of the series its worth trying just to see how remarkably dynamic the team behind it is.","December 24, 2013","true","1.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","7"

Trip Fate was highly popular on the Wii’s download service and now, a few years on, the fifth game in the Bit. Trip series has made its way onto the PC via STEAM. Like the rest of the series the game takes a simple idea and enhances it with quirky, retro-style, visuals and music to create something vibrant and fun to play.\n\nThis time Commander Video is tasked with traveling along a set path and shooting his way through a set of weird and wonderful stages while dub step inspired 8-bit tunes blast away in the background. A shooter on the surface the game also has a number of similarities to games such as Vib-Ribbon as you are locked into your path and have to react to things as they fly and shoot at you.\n\nShooting enemies fills up a bar which when full upgrades Commander Video to a more deadly state. This continues to grow until you hit ‘Giga’ and turn into a fully-fledged death dealing machine. Every time you take a hit you drop back to your last form. When you only have one hit left the screen loses its sound and everything begins to become entangled in static. Again, players of titles like Rez will be in familiar territory here and it’s a system that works well for this style of game.\n\nAlong the way Commander Video can pick up power ups which enlist the help of some his friends - such as Super Meat Boy or CommandGirl Video. For a limited time these characters then circle our hero and grant him extra powers such as changing his bullets to lasers or one giant blast. It all helps to add to the fun the keep the game ticking along.\n\nControls are now handled with a combination of keyboard and mouse and they more than match the twin stick control options of the Wii version. The mouse is used to aim and fire while keys control movement left and right along the linear path. It’s simple but effective and allows players to concentrate on building up their high score and keeping Commander Video in his Giga state for as long as possible.\n\nThe game isn’t going to last you forever in terms of how long it takes to beat but it does get punishingly difficult as it goes along. When you die you return to the start of the stage and have to go through the whole thing again. This includes if you die while taking on the boss creature at the end of each level so you have to remain alert at all times. As with all the best score attack games though you will likely be drawn back to beat your score again and again.\n\nThis brings us onto the only minor issue we really found with the game. Some of the stages just seem to go on for a bit too long to be sent all the way back to the beginning. If there were a few more stages but shorter in length then that might have hit the sweet spot dead on. That said, it’s a minor issue for what is a charming and good natured game.\n\nBit. Trip Fate is going to provide bite sized chunks of fun for PC owners who need something to play when they have the odd half an hour free. It’s as great now as it was on the Wii when it came out a few years ago and is well worth your time. We can’t help but feel its natural home would be somewhere like the PS Vita but then we are more than happy to play it on any system really.\n\nOverall, it’s a fun and colourful game with a quick witted personality and it will make you smile far more than many other games out there. It’s always fairly safe hands when getting any of the Bit. Trip series and so it remains with this. If you haven’t played it already then you really should be heading off to have a look at it right now.\n\n8/10","February 4, 2014","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/recommended/205080/","VultureBike","Ernie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/","240 products in account","So, this was my first Bit.Trip game and it really put the series on shaky ground with me.\n\n\nOf course, I don't read directions or instructions, I just hit play. I did that with this game, and it worked well except I was trying way too hard to dodge things for a long time.\n\nYou play as Commander Video and you're on a rail type deal (that's the technical term) so you can only move forward and, by moving forward, you'll maybe go up and down depending on the rail. Your goal is to shoot anything that moves because it might shoot you first. I think.\n\nThe game has a very relaxing ambiance to it, despite it being pretty similar to many "bullet hell" games. The music was relaxing and the voiceovers for powerups seemed very relaxed too. This is very interesting because the tone of the game seems very casual but you can die and take hits and lose points by losing your combo status thing (another technical term) very easily by being shot through the heart.\n\nI can't say I enjoyed this game particularly, though. I think I got to the second boss before I got all the cards and moved on to a new game? Something like that. That's not to say the game isn't fun or anything, it's just the game lacked anything to suck me in. There wasn't anything that struck me as "holy crap this is super fun I'm going to play this forever," but rather the game was like "Well, this is a reasonable way to spend my time."\n\nThat said, this game is definitely among the most reasonable ways to spend your free time.","December 24, 2013","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/recommended/205080/","Jragghen","Jragghen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jragghen/","965 products in account","BIT.TRIP FATE is a pixel rhythm game loosely based off of old-school sidescrolling shooters, in which the player is on a literal rail as the screen scrolls to the right, and is responsible for shooting the enemies before being shot. It is the fifth game in the BIT.TRIP series, and pretty readily the easiest of them all.\n\nLike other BIT.TRIP games, as you string together a number of successful hits without a miss, the game will move to a "higher" mode which has more graphic effects, and as you miss enough without getting an appropriate number of successes, you will move to a "lower" mode, which has fewer. FATE continues the pattern of adding a new mode with each successive game, adding GIGA. In addition to the modes, there is a series of powerups which the player can pick up which will modify their weapon in one of four ways. Additionally, the power-up, when combined with GIGA mode, gets extremely powerful.\n\nHonestly, compared to other BIT.TRIP games, the music has less impact, as it's ultimately up to the player when to take care of enemies instead of being sequenced to the music. It consists of mostly easy levels with more difficult bosses, but it never strays into the "I'm not sure if this is unfair" territory that other BIT.TRIP games can sometimes reach. For someone curious what BIT.TRIP games are all about, this might not be a bad place to start, given it will be more forgiving for new players.","February 26, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think it's not that fun and the hit detection is a bit wonky.  But I definitely see why people enjoy this game. It's a game where you play Commander Video and honestly I didn't pay much attention to the story so, yeah, that's all I got.\n\nBefore, I said that I see why people could enjoy the game. But the game's definitely not worth 10 euros. I got it on sale when it was  1 euro so I got my money's worth. So let's look at the positives:\n\n+The controls feel responsive.\n+Even if you can die pretty easily thanks to one of the negatives it still feels that there are pro players that can beat this game without dying.\n+A lot of powerups.\n+The presentation is pretty good.\n+Controller support.\n+The bosses seem quite good.\n\nNegatives:\n\n-The game is on rails so you can't move freely. I feel that this is one of the worst design flaws in this game. People say it makes it more challenging (at least my friends do) but this is a bullethell shoot 'em up it should be ALL about dodging.\n-Controller controls feel a bit awkward but that might be because you move your crosshairs instead of something like Monaco did where you move your RS at the direction you want to move.\n-Is it just me or are the levels WAY too challenging for all the wrong reasons? It might just be a previous negative (on-rails) so this might just be a worthless negative but still.\n-Gets boring quick.\n-Some powerups feel worse than your base weapon.\n-Since it's  an on-rails butllethell I get confused a lot of the time when I'm trying to dodge.\n-As I adressed before, the price. This game is nowhere near worth 10 euros. So pick it up on a holiday sale.\n\nOverall, ok. Not good, not bad. But if you were picking between this and Runner 2? Definitely get Runner 2. The game's just a lot more fun in my opinion. If there was a Mixed option, I would pick that one. If you're a bullethell fan you'll certainly have a lot more fun than I did.","January 1, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First off, the game is ever so pointless making you feel like every second you spend playing it is just time you'll never get back. Two, the game looks lousy. I've played many pixel games that I've enjoyed but the pixelation was done so badly that I couldn't even tell what was going on. Overall, I found this game nothing more than a pain.

The game is difficult and reasonably so. The game is a quasi-bullet-hell-on-rails-dualstick-shooter, if you catch my drift. It's solid and after playing it a bit you come to understand the mechanics quickly. I would just like to iterate again that the game is really difficult and in the time I have played I have died a couple times and had to restart the level.\n\nGot through about 3 levels and find the game oddly soothing. I played with a controller so I do not know how the PC controls are but I feel they probably would be better.\n\nIf you want a dual stick shooter with a twist and getting close to what Bullet hell games can be you would like this a bit. this game isn't for everyone but I liked it, and so might you.","November 12, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is probably because I grew up on arcade bullet hell shooters like this.\n\nIt's standard fare for anyone familiar with it. Shoot baddies, get powerups, get obliterated by bosses several times harder than anything that you faced on the way to them (at least until you figure out the patterns). The catch is that you can only move along a specific path left or right. Points for the idea, but there were definitely times where I would have liked to have some freedom of movement.\n\nOne final note of warning. There is a reason the boss of level 5 has a special achievement for getting a perfect run on it. Nothing else in the game is anywhere close to as tough as that thing.\n\nIt's not that special of a game, honestly.","May 1","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
