Crimes and Punishment is a blast to play! The new engine offers breathtaking views and stunning textures, and the voice acting is fantastic. You have to make moral choices in this game, which affects the story.\n\nThe cases are much more interesting in this game then the previous Sherlock games, thanks to great mission variation. Solve murders, investigate thefts and missing people. "Will you follow the law or your moral?", is the question you have to go by on every case.\n\nEvery case is smart and well thought out. You always think you understand who did the crime, until it suddenly turns the other way around. When you finally complete a case you feel satisfied though. You will look around for a long time, just because you want to find every clue. If you get stuck you can get hints, look in your journal and ask doctor Watson.\n\nI think this game is very underrated. It's one of the most polished games released in 2014 and offers a great story with absolutely fantastic cases. If you haven't picked this game up yet, please consider doing it. I really hope Frogware will release more content for this game. DLC, expansion or sequel, because I adore the game and would really wish for more great and exciting cases to solve.\n\nCrimes and Punishment gets a warm recommendation from me.","March 28, 2015","true","19.5"," 180 of 188 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","180","188","5","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/recommended/241260/","kenuty","Kenuty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/","1340 products in account","[SPOILER FREE]\nSherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishment is a beautiful and impressive  adventure puzzle game starring a very popular detective  who players will enjoy playing as to solve crime and choosing  thier own choices in a case's outcome through deduction.\n\nFirst off, the graphics of the game use the unreal engine 3 and a step up for the series.The facial features of the characters such as pores, scars, and even the detail on the clothing.  Not only is the character  detailed but so are the aesthetics and details put into each of the maps that the players will traverse to solve crimes, which gives it a it more immersion.\n\nThe music is appropriate for the game and kicks in at the right moment though the rest of the time the game is pretty quiet to letting concentrate and could use more to bring immersion. The voice acting is also decently done for most of the characters in the game and brings them to life in the game world.\n\nPlayers can  play the game with either a keyboard and mouse or with a game pad. Both are configured well and didn't include key binding, which isn't too bad since there aren't many keys to press for this type  of game genre. Players be able to play this game in first or 3rd person whichever choice you decide.  The controls may feel a bit stiff but overall it is not too bad at all.\n\nEach of the maps in this game is really focused on the area where the crime appears. You won't find yourself in unnecessary places or free roaming since it isn't that sort of game though it is something to suggest for a future sequel. The game uses a fast travel system to travel around the map with a push of a button. With a button click, players can  bring up a map and click on locations to travel where they need to go whenever you want. With each loading screen, Sherlock in the cab where the interface can also be brought up for the  menu to look over the clues, evidence, and deduction while they wait. The menu itself is very sleek and organized.\n\nThe game play to Sherlock is to solve puzzles, gather evidence and to come up with deduction and solve crimes. The puzzles range from ordinary lock puzzles where you match locks to complicated puzzles where you rebuild molds, combine chemicals or find clues to fix certain situation, compare notes, Extreme arm wrestling and lots more variety to keep the game intriguing. There is a skip function for those that get frustrated or stuck at a puzzle but keep in mind that it is a puzzle game, and that self-satisfaction comes from solving by oneself.\n\nSherlock is armed with an arsenal of tools to help him combine clues and solve puzzles. Focus will help him see things that he will miss at times such as small marks and such. Imagination is  when he gathers enough clues to solve a puzzle, he will be able to recreate the scenario in his mind to gather more clues and evidence and finally when he does get all this, he will be capable to go into deduction.\nIn deduction mode, Sherlock can look over his facts and evidence, draw a line between them and form bubbles and by doing so created deductions. Sometimes there is only one deduction in a bubble but other times. There will be two totals. As players look through all these bubbles, they'll be able to draw and combine a conclusion to the case. If the case is a contradiction, it will tell you between the bubbles. If it combines there will be a larger bubble and there will be a choice to the entire  scenario. Either the person is guilty/innocent or an alternative choice route opened will be up to players to decide by finding enough clues and evidence.\n\nThe game introduces five case scenario total and may take a player 12-15 hours total to complete depending on how good they are at gathering clues and puzzles.\n\nMy opinion is that this is possibly the best puzzle/adventure game I have yet played. I enjoyed it though some of my cons are that the disguise function wasn't used as greatly as I thought and that the game hopefully will be even frequently more expansive with the deduction system in the future because that felt like the real meat of the game to me personally.\n\nPros\n+ The graphic details are beautiful. You can see the details of the faces of characters, clothes, and the aesthetic to the background looks great with the Unreal 3 engine.\n+ The puzzles are brilliant\n+ The case themselves are very realistic  in a sense\n+ Brilliant story and cases. Especially the third case Blood Bath.\n+ The voice acting is decently done. Most of the characters sounded great.\n+ Deduction offers the players choices and replayability. Multiple choices on how to punish a crime or finish it off with another outcome.\n+ Game lasts 12-15 hours\n\n\n\nCons\n- Though beautiful the maps were decently sized and it felt too closed in especially with parts blocked off. Hopefully we'll see even larger areas in the future.\n- Disguises weren't used as much in the game\n- There is a skip button that pops up everytime that just seems to invite players to push it. Should be something you can turn off\n- The online feature should take in more stats instead of just who chooses the choice or discovering it.\n\n\nYoutubet/Twitch- Kenuty\nSubscribe if you like my review and follow up on curator  search "stream".\nVideo review -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlfGZpYF4BM&feature=youtu.be","September 29, 2014","true","12.4"," 278 of 334 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","278","334","2","9"

I‘m very picky and not every adventure game will satisfy my needs. I have stumbled on Sherlock Holmes Crimes and Punishment a while ago and added it to my wishlist. I bought it on summer sale and i don‘t regret it. I love the game.\nFirst thing what caughts  the eye is graphics. It is rare for an adventure game to have a really good graphics. Keep in mind that „technically good“ and „nice to the eye“ is different. A drawn 2D graphics can look much better than technically more advanced 3D graphics with poor 3D models. I remember when Broken Sword gone to 3D graphics, it looked awful, i was angry about that, i was disappointed that developers decided to go that way instead of just classical 2D graphics. It was a trend at that time and it was a bad trend. Sherlock Holmes Crimes and Punishment is one of those adventure games in full 3D where graphics looks really nice. Character face models are amazing. It lacks better animations like in Beyond two souls, Heavy rain or LA Noire, but i guess this game had much smaller budget, so it‘s really amazing what they had achieved in graphics department. Environments looks great too. You can take rally nice looking screenshots. The environments are different and pretty detailed. In short i don‘t have any complaints regarding graphics.\nThe game consists from 6 chapters which are 2,5-3 hours long each. The gameplay consists from exploring the crime scene, taking notice of every detail, gathering evidence and talking to the witnesses and victims. After all these things are done you can start a deduction process where you must make connections between collected statements and evidence and get a conclusion. There are few outcomes in every case, there‘re always few suspects and you can wrongly accuse a person of doing a crime and condemned him. But most fun is to find out who‘s the real culprit is. Even when you find him you can absolve him or make him guilty so that he would receive his punishment. It‘s your moral choice at the end of the chapter.\nThe game is not too hard but it‘s not easy either. You can be stuck at some point not knowing what to do. As always it‘s just some small thing you missed. There are some puzzles in the game. Each case has few of them. I like that puzzles are all different and are pretty logical and not too complicated except for lock hacking puzzles. They‘re in every case and sometimes you get more than one of it. But you can skip the puzzles, it doesn‘t have any impact to the story or outcome.\nAll in all i recommend this game to everyone who loves adventure games, you will not be disappointed. This is one of those hidden gems (*cough* The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 *cough*) made by a small company which probably didn‘t pay back.\n","July 5, 2015","true","17.0"," 76 of 82 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","76","82","4","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/recommended/241260/","Sequekhan","Sir Auron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/","280 products in account",""Be quiet Watson, I'm trying to concentrate."\n\nAs puzzle games go, Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is fairly tame. As tedious as the achievement for reaching all conclusions is (if that matters), the game is worth the experience - well thought-out characters, realistic motivations and a chance to play at being the world's greatest detective.\n\nThere are six individual cases, or chapters if you will, each with a unique crime for you to solve. Gameplay involves first gathering the evidence in the form of point-and-click / exploration. Suspects and other people are interviewed. During the course of doing this, sometimes additional information about clues you find can only be discovered by researching Holmes' archive, or by conducting an experiment, or even by chemical analysis. All of these actions combine to give you deductions, which take the form of facts floating around inside Holmes' brain, visualised by neurons firing between each other.\n\nThe next part is what I find to be the most fun though. Just having these facts floating around inside your head isn't enough. You have to put them together. For example: a person needs a certain Strength Requirement to wield a harpoon properly, also you know the victim was Pinned to the Wall. Put them together, and you conclude the murderer must be physically strong. Put enough of the facts together and you'll be able to conclude who the guilty party is.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that there are various conclusions for each chapter. Each of them makes its own kind of logical sense, and is fun to experiment with. There is even a 'correct' answer to each of the cases - and the opportunity to check whether you have the right one or not is entirely optional, meaning nothing is given away without your wanting it. The only problem I find with replaying for different endings is the necessity of starting the case over again from scratch - there is no option to simply replay your deductions from near the end of the case. This unfortunately makes for a bit of a grind as some cases have numerous location changes - many of which are for as little as a single item - meaning you will grow bored of seeing the interior of Holmes's carriage very quickly. One case has as many as six different endings.\n\nMore on the gameplay. I've already mentioned finding objects, interrogation, drawing deductions. In addition, there is lockpicking (an interesting take on a concept rife in so many games today), imagination (a little-used idea that works well to break up other gameplay elements), and there are also conversation events whereby Sherlock catches people out in lies. Leaving people gaping like fish and floundering for words is very enjoyable.\n\nThe cast for voice-acting is excellent, although I think it is soured by Robinson's aussie accent. There are two aussies in this game - while Lady Brackenstall sounds more genuine, Robinson sounds exaggerated, a bit too much like Steve Irwin for my liking. Perhaps for the time-period (1890s) this is accurate, and perhaps it adds to his character, but I just found it too over-the-top.\n\nThe visuals are mildly impressive. While nothing stands out as particularly fantastic, the landscapes and rooms depicted are done well enough that you feel transported to late 19th Century England. Typewriters and the general hubbub of Scotland Yard offices is one of the better sounds.\n\nIn closing, I should point out that the game is inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, and that Crime and Punishment is a reference to Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel of the same title - giving the gamer the opportunity to find the right culprit, and to make the moral choice of condemning or absolving their actions.","August 8, 2015","true","40.1"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","60","65","5","13"

In Crimes and Punishments, you have six cases to solve, and its completely up to you to deduce the facts, and bring about judgment. Oh there is so much goodness where to start? The game is gorgeous. Victorian England never looked so good. The amount of different places you get to visit is amazing, from beautiful mansions to seedy back alleys. The voice acting is superb. Also, the voice synch is perfect. What I really love about this game is that after finishing a case, you can always come back when you want to do another case, without worrying if they are connected in any way. Each case comes with so many different possibly outcomes, if you find the evidence and come to certain conclusions. How you sentence who you believe is guilty also influences how the public sees you. The in-game journal is wonderful in helping you keep track of who is involved in the case, what items can help you advance the case, or look back at a dialogue that may have a clue. So the good stuff in a nutshell: The Look, the writing and the acting, the Game Mechanics, and the Stories of each Case. The negatives: I can't find them.\nThis is a great game to start with if you are interested in the Sherlock Holmes franchise. If you have already played through the catalog available of SH titles, I dare say you must play this because I think you'll find this to be arguably the best SH games to date.","January 13","true","24.9"," 61 of 69 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","61","69","0","2"

C&P plays a bit more like an interactive movie such as Heavy Rain or The Walking Dead than a typical adventure game. But the experience is still rather enjoyable, and the change certainly makes C&P the most accessible title yet. The game also seems to borrow the "observation text" from the BBC Sherlock mini-series, which is a nice touch. I think there may be some inspiration taken from LA Noire as well.\n\nAlthough there are few puzzles to speak of, the most interesting feature is the "conclusion system". Even if you uncover all the clues (which is very easy to do), the player is able to deduce multiple conclusions. Only one conclusion is "correct", but it isn't always obvious which that is. The game requires you to pay attention and in some cases think rather carefully in order to come to the right conclusion.\n\nThe game also appears to borrow from Telltale's TWD and Wolf Among Us in introducing episodic gameplay with a "moral choice" at the end of each case. There are 6 cases total, each lasting roughly 2-3 hours. In addition to deciding the conclusion of each case, you decide between two moral choices. This doesn't seem to have much impact aside from showing you a different ending sequence. Although saving is automatic, after finishing a particular case ending sequence, you can restart before you committed to the conclusion and moral choice. This conveniently allows you to see all possible endings, if you so desire, in one playthrough.\n\nAlthough the episodic gameplay introduces more variety than previously seen, the individual cases are not quite as compelling as the storylines of previous titles. Some cases are perhaps a bit too obvious, although there's still plenty of cleverness in the writing.\n\nAs an ardent fan of Sherlock Holmes adaptations as well as the source material, I definitely recommend this title.\n\nIt's also fairly easy to unlock 100% achievements. This is possible to do in one playthrough, although doing so without a walkthrough would be difficult. Unfortunately, most walkthroughs tend to spoil the plots of the cases. It is possible to replay any case after completing the game, though.","October 20, 2014","true","32.9"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","50","54","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/241260/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","-The gameplay for the most part keeps in line with the rest of the series, with only a few noteworthy departures. There's now a sort of "detective vision" that highlights examinable objects, and while it can be ignored most of the time, it is sometimes necessary to find things like scratches on a lock or markings on the floor. The game does bring up a prompt when it's required, however, so you can safely ignore it otherwise if you choose to for the sake of immersion or challenge. You also now have the ability to talk with suspects at jail, and can present evidence to them to disprove any lies they may be telling you. Finally, you can now access the wardrobe and disguise kit at any time by going to your apartment, and you can select from a small variety of hats, facial hairs, and suits to wear (which is sometimes required for the sake of disguising yourself). Aside from these changes, anyone who's played the previous entries will be right at home (and the game does give minor references to the previous games in the series); there are still more "classic-style" adventure game puzzles (though they're sometimes repeated, like this one lock puzzle that shows up around once per case), and things like Holmes's chemistry set are used once again.\n\n-The game does give you more freedom than the previous games, which I think adds a lot to the experience. To use the first case as an example, by the time you've collected all the clues and pieced them together (you do this on your own in a menu, rather than having Holmes explain everything away for you), you're left with three different suspects, which you then have to choose from on your own based on your evidence. You're free to arrest any of them, and the game doesn't actually tell you which one was correct unless you choose to reveal the "spoiler" at the end of the case. You also get to choose to either condemn or absolve the criminal, which seems to be more of a moral choice than an actual logical one. The game ultimately leaves a lot up to the player, but it does slightly hold your hand. If you have evidence that needs to be used, discussed with someone, or researched in the archive at your apartment, it'll have a small icon on it in the inventory menu that tells you that. The game also somewhat spoils you with the Objectives menu, in that it makes it difficult to not find all the evidence due to the game generally not removing a "Investigate ____" objective until you've found everything in a particular area. If there was one thing I could change about the game it would be the inclusion of a "classic mode" that removes the objectives menu and the icons, and I hope they will take this into consideration for further games.\n\n-One thing that bothered me is that there isn't much of a connection between the cases, and there doesn't seem to be any consequences for your choices. Whenever you choose to let the killer go free, Sherlock makes up an excuse to tell Scotland Yard and that's basically the end of it, with the only continuation of each case being receiving a letter from the culprit at the start of the next case thanking you and explaining what they're doing now. I don't think that this diminishes the effect very much, since on a by-case basis I do still care about the characters and I think just having a choice at all is a great step forward, but it'd be nice for them to put some sort of penalty on absolving people instead of condeming them so that it would be more difficult to just let everyone go free (which might end up happening a lot, since the culprits generally have at least a slightly element of moral grayness with some exceptions).\n\n-One of the cases is rather short, but aside from that outlier they're each somewhere around 3 hours long, and there are 6 of them in total. If you prefer games with a long-running narrative instead of 6 mostly unrelated smaller cases then you might be disappointed with this. The game's overall length is fine in my opinion, but on a by-case basis the cases are somewhat short.\n\n-This is a small feature, but one thing that I thought was really neat is that during the loading screens between areas it shows Holmes and whoever is travelling with you in a carriage and allows you to access your evidence to review the case or your deductions to link points together while the game loads, so that you aren't just sitting around waiting. The loading times aren't substantial enough to be irritating anyways in my experience, but it's a nice touch.\n\n-The graphics are extremely good, particularly in the character models. The characters' faces are very well-detailed and animated.\n\n-The characters all seem to have been at least slightly redesigned, though Watson mostly still resembles his old appearance. And I can't say for certain, but it seems like everyone has different voice actors now. They still sound close enough that it isn't jarring, and they've already grown on me after one case so it's not a problem, but it's something worth mentioning. Edit: I've noticed that Sherlock hasn't actually changed designs, it just looks that way because of his new default hairstyle. He does look slightly different than he did before facially, but when you use the wardrobe to put his old hat on (which happens automatically in the second case) he looks almost the same.\n\n-Creepy Watson does not appear to be in the game, despite the April Fools video giving hope that he might be back. RIP Creepy Watson 2008 - 2008\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of the game series or just enjoy Sherlock Holmes or mystery novels in general, you could make worse purchases than this. It's a strong mystery game overall, though there are a few things that I hope they do better with in later games.","September 30, 2014","true","18.7"," 79 of 104 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","79","104","2","0"

It's not that at all. It's more like an interactive story with a few added  case solving mechanics and mini games.

Usually I'd put myself in that class but I found  the sheer entertainment value of this game is one of the best I've come across.\n\nBest points:\nExcellent visuals and voice acting,\nProperly laugh out loud moments alongside the more serious plots.\n20-25 hours of gameplay.

This gives you thoughts which you have to link together correctly to make deductions that you tie together to solve a case.  It is a fun mechanic but the deductions are sometimes too obvious. o=One or two are nonsensical.

You gain deductions by following up on clues,  which requires talking to people,  inspecting the environment, and playing a variety of mini games (everything from lock picking to arm wrestling, to chemistry).\n\nThe characters have incredibly good facial animation and well rendered skin (definitely the best use of sub surface scattering that i've seen in a game) which, combined with some truly stellar voice work, gives them an extremely 'human' quality.  All of this leads you to care about them,  and the stories they have.   That's a pretty important thing, because the bulk of the game is spent listening to them speak.\n\nIf you are into adventure or puzzle games, or just someone who appreciates great visuals and attention to detail this is a game well worth picking up.\n\nI would give this game 10/10 raging clues.","November 5, 2014","true","19.8"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","1"

There will typically be at least three solutions with separate suspects and different means of having committed the crime. The different clues which have been collected during the investigation must be arranged to form different deductions in order to single out the perpetrator. The system is genius except for the fact, that the developers have failed to make some deductions more correct or coherent than others. Thus you can never be sure your chosen solution - based on solid reasoning (what Sherlock Holmes is supposed to be all about!) - will be correct. Even if you have taken all things into considerations and logically chosen the most likely explanation. This have been incredibly frustrating and immersion breaking.\n\nTo further explain what I mean by the solution being arbitrary, I will provide the following observation:\nAny case in  "Crimes & Punishments" will have established means, motives and opportunities for all suspects, if you diligently have found all the different clues. The problem as I see it is, that there should at least be some few things that makes one suspect more likely than the other, or deductions that stood out as far less sound, as they appeared to be in conflict with other circumstances like causality or the existence of contradictory evidence, but no. All the solutions are equal in likelihood and reasoning, and as Sherlock Holmes we are bound to make a decision on who we would most wish to see having committed the crime or who we intuitively believe did the crime based on knowledge of crime cliches.\nIt seams the developers have constructed the clues, deductions and solutions in order to  fit the model of "means, motives and opportunities" as conditions in order to establish guilt as found in common law legal systems. This still only provides a dissatisfying experience, as this doesn't prove the actual guilt of the suspect, which in turn today nor in Victorian era Britain were enough to lift the needed burden of prof of having committed a crime. Establishing the presence of these three elements is not, in and of itself, sufficient to provide a conviction beyond reasonable doubt; the evidence must prove that an opportunity presented was indeed taken by the suspect and for the crime with which he or she is charged. In "Crimes & Punishments" the different solutions are entirely equal in probability, and this is the prime weakness of the system: If all the suspects can be reasoned to be equally as likely the ones who committed the crime, then they are all equally as unlikely to be guilty, and in a court of law this would actually make providing a conviction impossible. The conclusion simply  cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIt frustrates and saddens me, that the deduction system have been built in such a way as the solutions are wholly arbitrary and in total disconnect with the books of sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Mainly because if you can ignore this, then the game is fantastic. The atmosphere is fantastic and the locations and voice acting is great.","September 26, 2015","false","13.0"," 76 of 104 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","76","104","4","2"

The stories are for the most part well written, and with good mechanics to help you explore the crimescenes fully. The most impressive mechanic here is the system set up to "gather your thoughts", where you combine clues to create a basis for deduction and those deductions lead you towards the truth of the matter. The mechanic in itself is ingenious, but what really satisfied me is how the storytellers have utilized it, to the point where you can actually legitimately deduce the "wrong" answer, allowing you to further imerse yourself by making the needed deductions in between to lead you on the right path.\n\nThat being said, there is still room for improvement in how one investigates a crimescene, as this game as earlier games still carries the stigma of old point'n'click adventures where you don't find much outside of what is actually usefull.

You collect pieces of evidence and use Sherlock Holmes power of deduction to come to a reasonable conclusion and uncover the truth. But be aware, can you come to the right conclusion? Or are you going to verdict an innocent man? Sometimes you know quite fast who did the crime, but how can you prove it? Use all of your senses.

You can also reenact some crimes in your mind to see if the witness’s statements are conclusive.\n\nGraphics 8 of 10\nThe graphics are really good, you can even see dust particles in the air. The unreal engine really did do some good for the game. Especially the faces, when you're interrogating the witness's. You almost can’t tell they are game characters.

All minigames are now skippable, but they're also easier so you probably won't need to skip them. Graphically improved, especially faces are really well done. Lip sync is fixed now, after seeming off in the Testament. The game is divided in six separate cases that allow you to solve them in multiple ways and also give you some moral choices. My favorite case is #2 - the missing train, which is strangely also the only case I didn't solve correctly - I nailed the 'who', but missed the 'how' after stupidly changing my deduction because of some clue conflicts. And the game let me do this and continue, which is great. There are some new mechanics that work to make you feel like the legendary detective by showing how he gets to his conclusions.\n\nThis time you can only play in first or third person, the point & click mode is gone. I guess that's a plus, since there are no items that are really hard to even spot while playing in first-person mode.\n\nMy only gripes are the new Watson VA - he's okay, but the previous one just nailed it, and the cab cutscene that shows when you travel between locations that for some reason really bothered me, I'd prefer a loading screen instead.\nAlso I became 'stuck' several times, had to mash WASD to unstuck myself.

I think this is probably the best game I've played in over a year.\n\nWhy?\nThe graphics are very good, it's easy to manoeuvre in the game and even I as an amateur detective can solve and enjoy the cases, but I also made some mistakes, so the game isn't super easy -- yet anyone can play this, I'm sure!\n\nWhat makes this game stand out and go from solid to phenomenal, is the stories. There's six stories (cases) in all. Great dialogue and the game leads you from step to step. It's fairly easy to find clues, but the smart part is that YOU, the player, get to interpret the clues.\nTo give you an example, you find clues that the rails are removed  near a lake and near a cave. You're looking for a disappearing train. What do you deduce? You need further evidence to make the correct deduction. If you do this well and interpret the clues correctly, they will lead you to the correct conclusion. But if you make errors, you can reach a wrong conclusion and send an innocent man to prison or the noose! Brilliantly done!\n\nYou really feel you're back in Sherlock Holmes' day and age, with gas lamps and coaches. It is so well done, I even started reading a book with Sherlock Holmes stories after finishing this ~27-hour game. Turns out the stories in the game could VERY WELL HAVE BEEN WRITTEN DOWN in the form of a book. So this game plays great for Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts as well as for SH rookies.

It’s had its ups and downs, but the general tendency was upwards. After Frogwares reached their peak in the previous game, The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, they decided it was time for a general refurbishment of the series. So they picked the last two games and put them into a mixer, along with The Walking Dead (by Telltale), The Cave and L.A. Noire. Can the result live up to this legacy? If you bear with me for a moment, then I will tell you.\n\nThe first choice by Frogware was to ditch their in-house engine for the Unreal Engine 3. The result is jaw-dropping graphics. I was really astonished. Take a look at the user screenshots, this is the best-looking adventure game I have played so far.\nHowever, the advertising screenshots and videos are slightly misleading. With two exceptions, all the locations are quite depopulated.\n\nThe second choice was to switch to an episodic model like The Walking Dead and other games, except that the six episodes were all released at once and are almost completely disconnected from each other, so there isn’t really such a thing as a progressive storyline. However, the game fits into the canon of the series.\nFrankly, with the episodic model and a storyline unclosed because it was never really opened, the game has this smell of possible upcoming DLC about it. I wouldn't be surprised at all if one or two DLC episodes popped up.\nIndividually, the six episodes are like well-written short stories. The cases are interesting and well-written, conceivable and logically constructed with some very neat ideas and quite unusual locations. But only the last episode has something that resembles a progressing story, the other cases consist of little more than the whodunit.\n\nThere also is a moral choice aspect which is misunderstood by many critics. It is not a moral choice system in the sense of The Walking Dead, but more in the sense of The Cave. The Cave had a moral choice aspect you might ask? Well, for each character there was a bad ending and a hidden good ending, go look it up. Which ending you got hinged entirely upon a decision at the very end of the game.\nSherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is similar. For each case, there are between three and six possible conclusions. You can pick one and choose if you want to punish the prosecuted party with the full force of the law or if you want to handle the case more softly. And after you watched/played your particular ending sequence, a very bright design choice comes to life: you can return to the point of your choice and try another ending. So unlike other games with moral choice systems which have to be played multiple times, you only need to play the game once and may see all the possible endings in a single playthrough.\n\nBut as we have learned half a year ago from NOCLIP – The Game (also known as Murdered: Soul Suspect, read my review), good graphics with the Unreal Engine and a decent story cannot hold up a game if the gameplay almost completely sucks. Be relieved, Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments does not make the same mistake.\nSherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is not exactly a Point-and-Click adventure. You investigate the crime scenes and look for clues. Many of them are tied to minigames, most of which are skippable. You also collect items and information and talk to witnesses and suspects. Occasionally you will catch someone in a lie and have to present evidence of the lie, just like L.A. Noire.\nThe clues you found are presented on the very fancy deduction screen, where you have to combine them into facts. And out of the facts, you draw conclusions. This game mechanic has replaced the inventory puzzles.\n\nThe aforementioned jaw-dropping graphics come at a price, and that price is loading times. The game needs to load for quite a while between every single scene transition (and there are many of them), so Frogwares made that commute less dull by A) making this particular loading screen not look boring after five seconds and B) letting you consult your notes and the deduction screen.\nBut the game also loads briefly before every dialogue and before many of the minigames and QTE-scenes, which messes with the pacing when the bad guy draws a gun and you are supposed to resolve this situation in a QTE, but inbetween you have to stare at a black screen with a spinning circle for fifteen seconds.\n\nOther than that, the game flow works very well. You can always look up what tasks are left to do, so you never really get stuck and there is little reason to consult a walkthrough. Maybe it has become a little too easy, but the challenge lies in finding the correct conclusion.\n\nConcerning the playability, I have been playing the release version and found a couple of minor glitches, but nothing remotely significant or gamebreaking.\n\nSherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments introduces many new borrowed ideas, but only few of them can unfold to their potential. It is not without criticism and some of its potential is lost. The game took a step back from classic Point-and-Click adventures and made a step towards interactive movies, but without falling into the pit of irrelevant gameplay like NOCLIP - The Game, which I mentioned earlier. This time, I can recommend to actually play the game instead of just watching a walkthrough. And given the length and the very good quality of the game, I would say that the experience was worth 40€.","October 3, 2014","true","19.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

It is rather fun initially to run around sniffing out clues and talking to people, however this becomes repetitive rather quickly. There's very little available to actually challenge the player, as it's more or less a point-and-click to find the clues then these clues simply describe and fit themselves into the overall puzzle.\n\nThere were an entire range of different aspects that I would have rather focused on in each of the cases if it was a more free-world kind of game, however the game simply guides you towards conclusions. As a mental exercise the game is therefore practically worthless, which is a pity considering it is about one of the more intellectually gifted characters of the modern world.\n\nThe inability of the player to actually go wrong anywhere except in the final conclusion does rather reduce the level of reward the game can offer.\n\nAs a relaxing little piece of visuals flitting across your screen the game works well. However at $40 the price is rather steep. I would price the value of this game at about $15-$25, depending on what you're looking for. If you're more interested in nice visuals and atmospheric gameplay then you might be willing to fork out a bit.\n\nIf you're more interested in strong gameplay and a mental challenge rather pick up one of Paradox Intereactive's games for half the price, wait for this to go on sale (like, 50%-75%), or play a game of chess.","April 4, 2015","false","24.7"," 57 of 90 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","57","90","5","0"

The level of intrigue cannot be topped. His use of pure deductive reasoning and keen observation can be truly astounding at times. However, none of the cases in this game gave me such a feeling. Actually, the cases often felt quite cut and dry. Perhaps having all the clues revealed to you the moment you find them ruins the climax--the moment where Sherlock reveals how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together. But often, the pieces don't even fit together and many outcomes (as many as six at a time) remain possible.\n\nLike Holmes always says: When you have eliminated the impossible, what you have left is guess-work.\n\nWhen you find a clue or learn a fact about the case, the game often suggests you hit the B key which brings you to a screen where the facts float about the screen and by clicking on two related facts, connecting them, Sherlock will make a deduction about them. Sometimes, multiple deductions can be made. For example "it was an accident" or "he did it on purpose". The right combination of deductions leads to more deductions, leads to a conclusion. While this demonstrates Holme's deductive reasoning in an interesting way, even after collecting every clue and making every deduction, many branches cannot be eliminated, and concluding who committed the crime without absolute certainty does not seem faithful to Doyle's writting.\n\nAs simply and adventure game, Crimes and Punishments lacks well-drawn and interesting characters, difficult puzzles, good dialogue, and good story telling. Most cases can be solved in just an hour or two and the clues practically jump out at you, so as long as you don't skip entire sections of the map, you'll find most everything on your first go.\n\nOccasionally, you have to activate Sherlock's heigtened powers of observation (it'll tell you when) and the clue will glow yellow so you can't possibly miss it. In some cases, the clue is entirely invisible without this, and in others, even if you've spotted the clue (which I challenged myself to do), Holmes won't examine it. It would have been more immersive if they just had him take out a magnifying glass.\n\nThis is by no means a bad game--despite my complaints, it is perhaps more disappointment over several design decisions than anything else. It's just not a great game, and for the price they're asking, I think you can find a better game to play, at least in the adventure genre (The Longest Journy?), although I don't know many in the crime genre and this very well could be the best.","October 11, 2014","false","17.0"," 45 of 69 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","45","69","0","4"

Unlike most linear adventure games, this game only guides you to enough clues to form a few very possible conclusions; afterwards, you must use your own judgement to decide between them.\n\nLet me give you an example:\n\nUpon recovering all the clues in the first story, I was left with three possible solutions, two of which were more possible than the first. Instead of allowing you to follow up on those suspects, the game flat out refuses to allow you to investigate further and essentially tells you: "That's enough, its time for you to think like Sherlock Holmes and figure it out yourself"\n\nThe game sets up the cases such that the solutions are possible, so you'll have to make a judgement call and establish what posulations are plausible and which solutions to commit to. It was quite nerve wraking at first.\n\nAdmitedly, the gameplay is not perfect. There are frequent load pages (though you are able to review your deductions and notes on these pages, which is nice) and there's an element of pixel hunting. It's also a slow and methodical game except for the occassional minigame or Quick Time Event.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this to someone who enjoys a slow puzzle. Perhaps someone who might enjoy a game like "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter". Since the game is rather methodical and slow, I would really aim to recommend it to a specific sect of puzzle loving adventure fans, whose main draw to adventure games isn't the comedy (if you love Sam and Max because of Sam and Max, this probably isn't for you).","January 1, 2015","true","8.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

It was enjoyable and I want to see more.\n\nLong Version:\nIt was okay.  If you like tracking down clues with Telltale Games-ish point-and-click mechanics, but need a bit of hand-holding when it comes to anything more arduous than looking at people, then this one's for you.  The moral choice system is a bit shallow since the only real choices are at the end of each case as you're about to name your killer: "will you condemn the villain most harshly, or let them off easy this time?"  Mind you, that choice can be a lot harder than it sounds, and it's more satisfying than the usual "good or evil" option that pollutes choice-based games these days, but there were no lasting consequences either way; when a case was over, the slate was wiped and everything was back to normal, so the moral choices, which were actually quite difficult, were reduced to something less intense.  Good game, nonetheless, and I hope to see more, even better entries from the studio in the future.","October 25, 2014","true","21.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

This game is no exception.\nPros:\nGameplay. Amazing, feels more explorative than a few of the earlier titles. Love being able to look for clues myself instead of being pointed to everything. Dialogue feels more choice based than previous as well.\nChoices. The deductions you can make are nuts. You can get things wrong, cause people's deaths, put away the wrong suspect. It's limited, but then, these titles are smaller than other companies' and what they are doing in terms of choice is still pretty incredible.\nStory. A mix of canon and new cases makes the game pretty enjoable, and not as predictable as it would have been if they'd had cases from the story at every turn.\nVisuals. BEAUTIFUL. Although lacking in a few areas, so many of the enviornments were very pretty and immersive. It was great to look around at the scenary while progressing.\nVoice acting. The best so far in the series, I think. Loved Holmes' actor.\n\nCons:\nChoices. Limited. Want more hands on ability. But obviously we're getting there.\nExploration. The worlds felt very alive and very cool, and being able to miss clues makes me want to go out further to explore things. The day we get an open-world Holmes day will be amazing.\nStory. The short cases were great. However, it lacked a story on the whole as the previous games had one. I missed that. Working to an end goal of a larger mystery while tying up these litttle problems would have been incredible.\n\nPros and cons aside, this game is defnitely worth playing if you like the title, and if you're into seeing how mystery games are progressing.

The backstories for each case is unique and solid. I'm not a Sherlock Holmes fan but after palying this game, I am now. This is my first Sherlock Holmes game and by far, I have enjoyed every minute of it. From the first case to the last case, my mind was boggled and amazed. Some of the cases maybe rather obvious but there are also some where you get to really think who was culprit or how he/she did it. The game also has a lot of minigames from interrogation to looking for clues to special cutscenes that require player interaction.\n\nPros:\n+ Great Graphics\n+ Great Soundtracks\n+ Great Voiceovers\n+ Interesting characters and cases\n+ Has a lot of gameplay (a lot of minigames)\n+ The mind boggling marale choices at the end of each case\n+ A choice of whether you play on 3rd Person POint of view or FPS\n\nCons:\n+ Long loading screens (well, actually it's in the form of travelling from place to place)\n\nI haven't played the other Sherlock Holmes games but for newbies to the genre, it's a good experience to start with this. I highly recommend this game to those who are really a big fan of Sherlock Holmes and to those who love detective games that does not only involve point n' click find the object game but other gameplay as well.","April 19, 2015","true","19.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Felt the game had great acting, a very interesting story (as I understand the cases in the game are all taken from actual Sherlock Holmes stories) and some neat puzzles that were neither too hard, nor super easy, and also were varied and integrated well with the object, challenge or environment.\n\nThen I got to the end. And I'm not sure if this is the fault of the game or the actual story, but if you are feeling like you are trying to really solve the case - it feels like there is always something purposely left out that you have to make a leap of faith to make the pieces fit.\n\nSPOILERS BELOW\n\n\n\nAn example of this is in the first case. You don't meet the killer until the VERY last action / location / person of the game. It is contrived. If you would have immediately searched for other sailors at the very start (if the game let you, which it doesn't) - you'd essentially have exactly the same amount of facts and clues to pass judgement on his guilt as you do at the very end of the game.\n\n\nThe main thread is the killer saw the victim kill a guy when they were both on a boat many years ago and disliked each other. The killer came to see the guy to ask for money since the (to be) killer was a down and out of work spearman and a fight broke out and death by the killer defending himself from the drunken victim ensued in the victims cabin.\n\n\nYou don't need *any* of the other facts you wasted your time on for the case as they are all superfluous. In fact, they are all there as a distraction. To me, that just feels lame. Even if you have all the facts at the end, you still need to make a leap in picking the right killer as it's never a fact/proven/known that the killer went to the victims cabin for money at the night of the murder until you pick a final conclusion.  In fact, the fact that his pouch was there doesn't prove he was there ..at all. It's just as plausible that it was stolen as it was that he dropped it there - so why would we have to assume he was there instead of the other plausible (but not as perfect fits to the contrived story)?\n\n\nIt is noted the killer was poor and out of work, but in fact, everything the game / story relates to you about him would define him as an honest, hard working, non begging individual...he did a hard job at sea, never attacked, ratted on the victim when he saw him many years prior kill a man, never tried to bribe him, was trying to earn money (not beg) at the pub via armwrestling and was genuinely thrilled when Holmes lies to him about the possibility of getting a spearman job with 'Capt Ahab'.  Also, although he disliked the victim, it was noted the victim lived in a fairly remote part of town and nowhere was it every noted/implied/hinted that the killer ever spoke to the victim any.  Even if they both got drunk at the same pub - that gives even more reason why the killer wouldn't go to his far away shack to ask for a few silver coins if he had access to him at the pub regularly (and also more credence to the possibility of a stolen pouch). It's a leap. You don't get any of his story until the very last thing you do and even then - the more plausible answer (which is wrong) is for the other suspects to be involved.\n\nWhen the case comes together and you see the conclusion after you pick the killer (who by the way comes to the address given to him by Holmes as the possible location to meet 'Capt Ahab' about some hard work), you wonder why killer (a supposedly honest, hard working sailor) would go beg for a few silver, then kill the victim instead of turning the other cheek and leave like he did many years ago on his boat. In fact, nothing shows him to be a violent person, and even one of the endings has him suddenly raging out with a fist fight..wha?  For every fact given to you as a reason for the final outcome to have happened - you could come up with a set number of equally plausible counter actions that would have rendered the outcome differently. Sadly, none of the actions are tied to any real facts. The killer could just have easily not gone to beg for silver and the other 2 guys could have been attacked by the drunken victim and speared him. The killer could have also as easily ran away when the victim drew a knife on him and ran out the shack.\n\nIt's all too contrived and not based strongly on anything you actually do so makes it feel really shallow. I'm not sure this is the fault of the game or the story itself - regardless - the end enjoyment (or frustration) is there if you really think your going to be able to logically deduce the conclusion. There's just assumptions you'd have to make (which isn't very scientific, nor flawless) when you make your final decision that make the whole thing slightly more than educated guesswork. It's bound to be fun to read and say "ah ha!" when you read the ending, but it's not nearly as enjoyable if you are playing out the character and looking forward to the challenge when you are certainly not given all the pieces (or have to accept random actions unknown to you as what actually happened).\n\nAs far as my game played time - yes, i stopped after the first case. I read somewhere some folks also had issues with the logic on the 2nd case - and the desire to play any more cases vanished after the mechanics of the first played out. That would tend to speak volumes towards the value I found for the game if I stopped after the first case.\n\nCould be tons of fun - just knowing the amount of logic leaps make it less so.","May 31, 2015","false","3.8"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","21","33","0","0"

But make no mistake, this is a pretty classical Sherlock game set in the original time period (the modern clothes are just an unlockable) and a sequel to Frogware's other adventures with the character. I don't have too much experience with the older games, finding them a bit obtuse and clunky at times. Crimes and Punishments is their attempt to get the series some broader appeal, and it largely works. Controls are simplified but without sacrificing too much of the formula.\n\nThe game takes place over six cases, all mostly standalone so it has a pretty episodic feel to it. There's a small running plotline about a "terrorist" group called the Merry Men that runs throughout but is mostly just background filler. I've lamented on here about how there's not many games that actually make you feel like a detective, and this game is one that does. For starters, every case has multiple suspects, and you can actually draw the wrong conclusions and condemn an innocent person if you're not careful. Each suspect you choose also has variations on how you handle their fate. A cold blooded murderer you might want to send to the gallows, while someone acting in self defense you might be kinder too. The actual murder weapons and motives can play into these endings too if you get them wrong, so each case has at least like 6 endings. That is where the title comes in, their crimes, your punishments.\n\nThe games does clearly try to ape the modern BBC series a bit, with a focus on profiling characters from the fact they have callused or danity hands, or a telegram sticking out of their pocket. It actually does a good job of making you think like Holmes, and you start to actually be able to guess what he learns from these profiles before he says it. That's actually I think one of the best accomplishments of the game. It kind of immerses you in the minutiae. Using Holmes' analysis table on Baker Street is kind of a laborious affair, often having puzzles that in most games would probably include half the steps. But I'll be darned if they didn't manage to sucker me in with the use of pipettes to test various chemicals. You will also need to browse Holmes' large collection of newspapers, research, and encyclopedias when you see or hear about say, a robbery in 1889 rather than just asking someone about it.  You'll even get to control Watson and his dog Toby at various points in the game.\n\nThere are couple minigames that are busts, often ones requiring aiming or precision, which is not a surprise given the developer's pedigree. Most of the voice acting is well done, if a bit theatrical (Sherlock himself gets pretty hammy at times, but it is largely amusing). Some of the stories are a bit basic, even if they provide a good mystery at first. Graphics are pretty great for the most part, thought that's largely thanks to most areas being pretty small. You can "customize" Sherlock but those options are actually pretty limited. Most of the options are only available when the story gives an option to disguise yourself to get information, which are pretty rare.\n\nAnyways, if you like adventure games, snag this when you can. Much better than I anticipated.","December 27, 2014","true","12.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This is the best Sherlock game, actually the best crime/mystery game I've played.  The game isn't one big storyline.  There's 6 crime cases in the game.  This is good if you like to have stopping points to take a break.  Crimes and Punishments plays a lot like Testament but better.  It's not a point and click game.  You can control Sherlock in 3rd and 1st person view.  You get to question suspects and look for clues.  Sherlock can use his instincts to find hidden clues and visualize what might have happened at the crime scene.  You can go back to Baker Street (Holmes' home and lab) to do experiments and research.   After you get enough clues you make deductions to form a possible answer.  The game allows you to freely gather clues, talk to people and travel to different locations.  It nudges you in the right directions but you have to think sometimes.  If you get at a tough spot just Google a walkthrough.  Crimes and Punishments is a fun and easy game to play.  If you like murder mysteries and especially a Sherlock fan, you need this game!\n\nPros:\n+6 different cases\n+Well developed game and written storyline\n+Ability to freely investigate\n+Holmes can change disguises\n+Graphics\n+Voice acting\n\nCons:\n-Some of the quick-time events can be challenging but you can always try again if you fail.  There's very few QTEs but since I hate QTEs I say it's a con.  But they don't make the game bad.\n-I wish some of the cut scenes could be replayed.  If you're playing the game and say the phone rings, if you didn't pay attention, well tough luck.\n\n(Note: I advise you play The Testament of Sherlock Holmes before playing Crimes and Punishments.  This game is a sequel but not to the storyline.  But some of the characters appear in both games.  It just helps make sense of certain characters.)","April 27, 2015","true","18.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

After playing through the testament, I was very pleased with the experience.  The puzzles were varied and thought provoking, and aside from the occasional "hunt awkward item that is not easily found" problem that comes with most adventure games of this ilk, I very much enjoyed the experience.  What impressed me most in that game was the overarching storyline.\n\nSadly, this was not the case for Crimes and Punishments.  The puzzles were overly easy, the overarching storyline was all but nonexistent, with some hint of it during the first case and the only other thought of it at the very end of the last case.  The puzzles weren't that impressive.  Whereas in the testament every lock was a different puzzle, in this game every lock was the same mini game.  The entire game held your hand, providing you with icons for when to use different modes (imagination or heightened senses).  I became actually very bored halfway through the second to last case, and that boredom continued on.  I had hoped that I was simply playing a bunch of opening cases before I got to the meats and bones of the game, with a drawn out series of cases that didn't hold your hand.  Overall, I was very disappointed in this game.  The graphics and sounds were amazing, but that is all.  If you enjoy adventure games with a lot of mind twisting puzzles and an interesting storyline that carries through the entire game, this is not it.","October 16, 2014","false","20.9"," 43 of 77 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","43","77","0","2"

This game really impressed me.To be honest, I haven't played much of the other Sherlock Holmes game yet (I'll do so soon) so I cannot compare this to its prequels. So I simply say what I think of this game standing on its own.\n\nThe typical adventure elements (combining items, etc.) are reduced, it's all about the case and how you proceed. Finding clues, talking to people, doing experiments to test theories, check your archives - that's all you do in order to solve the case.\nThere are six different cases in total which are not connected, although there is a small side story line that will resolve in the finale (Don't worry, I won't spoil more) You play as Sherlock, occasionally as Dr. Watson and as their dog Toby.\nEach case has its own unique characters, its own story and background information. From Baker Street to Scotland Yard and the crime scenes you  visit a lot of different locations which are all very well designed. This game sure has one of the best level designs I've ever seen - you really feel the heart the developers put in each location. The character design is outstanding as well - just look at the faces. Choosing Unreal Engine 3 was the right decision.\n\nWell, what else to say? If you like adventure games, cinematic games like TellTale's games (The Walking Dead, Wolf among us) with more actual gameplay and logical thinking this game is just meant for you. As a Sherlock Holmes fan this is a must-buy game anyway.\n\nIt is elementary to buy this game I'd say!","October 7, 2014","true","16.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

One of the first things that I noticed about this game was the new engine. It is beautiful and mostly smooth (with slight stuttering). It is much more demanding in terms of resources. I have an Intel i7 4770k and an Nvidia GTX 660 OC. The only real time it would stutter would be during some cutscenes. Other than that, it worked perfectly. Although, I will note that there are few options for video settings.\n\nI found the gameplay to be fun. You mostly look around a particular area, waiting for the prompt to pop up, indicating a clue. I know that sounds a little too easy, but the challenge comes when you attempt to build your case through the deduction system. It is important that you pay attention to what a suspect says because some clues are not recorded. It is up to you to remember it. This is important, because when you attempt to build a case through the deduction system, there are some clues that have more than one branching possiblilty. So, you cannot rely entirely off of the game deduction system, but rather you need to do some deductions of your own. This is common when you hear testimony from multiple people who offer contradicting stories.\n\nIn this game, it is possible to punish someone who is completely innocent, although you won't know it at the time. This forces you to actually pay attention to every small detail. Sherlock will not hold your hand in this game. It gets more interesting when you consider the fact that it is also possible to convict the right suspect, but be wrong about how he committed the crime. This happened to me once, but I was right about the other five cases. But at least I never convicted someone who was innocent.\n\nAnother thing that I loved about this game is the freedom that is offered to you. You can use a fast travel system to go to any place that is relevent to the case at any time. Do you think you might have missed something? Then go back. Sherlock will not tell you that you missed something, adding to the feel of performing your own investigation.\n\nAll in all, I would say that I really liked this game. It does not have a grand plot, as all six cases are unrelated, but the story that is there and the acting is good. For a Sherlock Holmes game, that is. I don't feel that I can go into any more detail without giving it all away, so I say pick this game up when you get a chance. It took me about 12-13 hours to complete, with cases being around 2-3 hours each.\n\n8.5/10","October 9, 2014","true","15.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

There are multiple conclusions to the cases which only one is the correct one. When you chose a conclusion you get to select a moral choice that is either condemn or absolve the culprit.\nThe Imagination mode lets you reconstruct an event that happened in the scene, it contains a minigame where you choose the order of events.\nThe Sherlock Talent is a mode where you can notice stuff that normally you can't, it's only a way to let you obtain new clues simulating the fact that Sherlock don't overlook anything and see every detail that the police miss.\nThere's only a bad thing about these modes: the game tells you exactly in which area you should use them, making the game quite easy. I know that lots of people is going to be upset about this.\nOf course in the game you get to interrogate witnesses and suspects and when you do you get to analyze them and find information about them that you can, occasionally, use against them if they lie. This was pretty cool too.\nI loved the characters of the game, especially Sherlock. The cases are curious, but if you're looking for a deep story you're not going to find it.\nYou're often followed by your friend, Watson. Our doctor may be a nuisance, since he has the bad habit to follow you in every narrow path blocking your way if you decide to turn back. His AI goes offline in huge halls so you don't have to worry if you have to examinate stuff in big rooms.\nThe game has minigames such as picking locks, examinating stuff, doing experiments and so forth. Some of them are really easy, other are ok and one is terrible ( the rope bridge ).\nSadly the game is fairly easy and it's nearly impossible to get stuck, thinking what to do next, so the challenge drops a lot. That is unless I'm some sort of genius that gets all the puzzles quite fast, and somewhat I doubt that...\nI would have liked the game not holding my hand through all the game and offer me some more puzzles to solve, but for me was a enjoyable experience nonetheless.\nI reccomend this game if you enjoy Investigative games and like Sherlock Holmes.","October 5, 2014","true","10.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The deduction system is just brilliant. You can actually solve all the six cases wrong, or at least get the murder method wrong in some of the cases.

(Read below for more details. Expect spoilers, of course!)\n\nThe Kew Gardens Drama nonsense:\nWhy are the plants located at the syndicate when they never stole them?

It's a highly polished game with good graphics and (mostly) excellent voice acting. And it does a good job of capturing the essence and the quirks of the Greatest Detective, making it a good buy for fans of the famous character.\n\nBut what really makes this game stand out amongst other adventures: "Crimes and Punishments" actually gives you a chance to fail without reprimanding you for it. You will form your own deductions based on the clues that you find. Evidence will be ambiguous, leading to various possible outcomes of each case. The correct solution is not always obvious. And if you accuse the wrong person of comitting a crime, the game follows through. No "You failed", no "Reload and try again". This notion of non-linearity is somewhat of a novelty for adventure games which I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nMy only criticism would be the lack of an overarching, meaningful story to tie it all together. The game tries to get a bit of closure during the last case, but feels way too rushed and too contrived, resulting in a rather bland anticlimax.","May 14","true","44.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Maybe my expectations were just lowered but it's a genuinely pretty game with a strong art style. I particularly like the attention to faces. Also the first person mode means that you feel a lot more immersed in the world.\n\nWriting - solid. If you're a fan of the stories you'll enjoy the mysteries here as they're not only pretty interesting in their own write, but they also feel very much like something Doyle would have written himself.\n\nMechanics - fun. They can feel a touch contrived at times (press F for imagination) but they're free flowing enough to make you feel like a detective. It's worth emphasising that for the most part the mechanics compliment your own thinking and puzzle solving, rather than just doing it all for you.\n\nMisc - voice acting is.... peculiar, it is often wooden, and over affected. The game would benefit massively from more talented voice actors, especially because you have to listen to people talk so much. It's not game ruining, but it feels like a missed opportunity for a game that works so hard to immerse you in its world. For the most part, it's not game ruining, but it damages the game's otherwise strong effort at immersion.\n\nFinal thoughts - Fancy a story driven game? But you're bored of shooting people in deserts/sewers/deserted cities? Yet you still want the good graphics and immersive perspective typical of the AAA genres? This is a good choice.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pbablue/recommended/241260/","pbablue","serendipity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pbablue/","1430 products in account","Crimes and Punishments is an adequate rom thru late 1800’s London and the surrounding areas that both pushes the adventure genre in some new and interesting directions. Each case plays out like a short story on a book; they aren’t necessary related to one another but new cases aren’t unlock until the previous one is completed. Though the mysteries themselves don’t become more complex, the mini games like lock picking and puzzles to unlock clues do become more difficult. The games starts off on the right foot with a wonderful grizzle murder mystery with the victim impaled on the wall by his own wailing harpoon. It’s the perfect way to introduce players to the games interviewing puzzle mechanics. Interviewing suspects and witnesses lead to new clues, but physical clues in the environments or by inspecting what NPC’s are wearing and how they hold themselves can help catch someone in a lie or in a contradiction. This quick inspection of what each characters wearing is clearly inspired by BBC series and it works well in the videogame setting. But clues aren’t all found by grilling witnesses, a large portion of the game involves searching the environment. As clues and stories start to piece together, Crimes and Punishments opens up the synapse deduction system which chains the collaborating stories and physical clues and brings them to a logical conclusion. Each case has multiple outcomes, all of which have solid evidence to backups your suspicions. Once you come to a personally satisfactory conclusion as to who you think guilty is and you then ask whether or not that person is morally at fault. So you can find someone guilty of murder but choose not to testify with your evidence, because you feel they were within their right. The game never comes forward and says “definitively, you’re right or you’re wrong with your decisions” This open ended sort of victory is oddly satisfying. It’s not the game’s version of correct, it’s my version of correct! But it’s a version of correct that made me second guess myself? On the other hand, some cases lack of real sense of closure no matter what verdict do you render. You may deduce where a final piece of evidence is or where some bodies maybe buried, but you never find out for sure and in that regard it can be maddening. For the most part, the cases are fun little mysteries in features some fantastic writing. Out of the seven, five of them captivated me and the remaining two however, fell so flat that I felt no need to explore any other possible outcomes that might have come from them. The mini games and puzzles within crimes and punishments are pretty satisfying! There are few particularly the “arm wrestling and rope bridge crossing” mini games that are infuriating but for the most part; puzzles, mini games and finding new clues all follow path of logic. There are no absurd solutions to simple problems and thankfully the game doesn’t turn into daunting pixel hunt. Don’t be mistaken, there will be times when you’ll have to hunt thru the environment just to find one little item to progress the story. The game might also force players to make deduction a bit prematurely just to advance the case. One of CNP’s biggest setbacks is its misused or disused of available resources. The custom and disguise system couldn’t be utilize to a greater effect but sadly it only comes in to play twice throughout the entire game. And Watson who should be brimming with personality and insight, largely plays a background role throughout the entire experience. He remains inhumanly upright silence and on occasion when he does talk, he doesn’t act like a capable doctor and former soldier that it should be. The game also has more that it fair share of an invisible walls and junkie environmental exploration. But who exactly is Crimes and Punishments for? I’d say that anyone who’s interested in Sherlock Holmes whether the classis version or even the new modern literation’s of the character, will enjoy themselves with Crimes and Punishments. It’s not gonna rock anyone’s world but it will certainly entertain for a while. I’d also recommend for anyone whose new adventure genre after being introduced by Telltale Games “The Walking Dead Series” but want something requiring a little more brainpower. I would not recommended to people who haven’t spent much time with an adventure genre nor to gamers only play faster paced shooter or action games. But truly, I enjoyed my time with Crimes and Punishments. The morality, judgment and deductions systems worked amazingly well for the adventure genre. The stories entertained me and I felt the sense of accomplishment when I finished the game. But the flows of the game has might be too much for more demanding gamers. At $40 Crimes and Punishments feels adequately priced especially for quality of the writing and the length of time that took me to complete it. It’s a good move in a right direction for the series and the genre, it’s just not as refined as it could be. It’s definitely a serviceable game worthy of the time of the curious and its directly targeted audience.

You do so by searching the environment, analysing things you found in your laboratory, reconstruction of a scene, searching your archieve and so on. Some if the evidence geathering is connected to different mini games, which i don't want to spoil, but in my opinion they are always very cool and suit the different cases well (there are different techniques of gathering evidence introduced in the different cases).\n\nYou have to do this, until you found enough evidence to make a judgment. However. for that you don't have to finde all the clues a case has, just only enough so that it is possible to go to the judgment part of the game (which is done in Sherlocks Brain, you pick different possibilities there which might indicate a suspect is guilty or innocent, and if your assumptions are consistent and you made enough you are able to condemn a suspect). That means, you can end a case without searching for all evidence and thus comdemn an innocent. However, even when you found all evidence present, you will in most cases never be realy sure who commited the crime. There are always several suspects, motives or sometimes even weapons to choose from. When you are sure you found the criminal you always get two options to choose from, one which is the strict appliance of the law, the other a lenient sentence (which might go as for as to let a the person go because he acted out of selve defense in your opinion). This is pretty cool (Sherlock can do so because he is not directly employed by Scotland Yards) and when making your judgment you have to consider all the clues you found like articels in newspapers, letters or what other persons told you.  Based on your coise there will be different solutions and endings to a case (which person you confront and how you do it)\n\nSo this is what the game is mostly about: geathering evidence and creating a picture of what has happened and afterwads making a judgment based or the clues you found. All in all the game offers:\n\n6 different cases (which are not realy connected to each other, but after you finised a case you can read a letter about the outcome) However, in some cases you get to know someting about a group called "Merry Man" and they will influence your very last decition in the game, which I found very cool (kind of fight club like :P )\n\nIt took me 13,7 h to do so, I colleted all the clues and finished every case 100 %\nHowever there are several Endings, which depend on the choise you make in the judgment section of the game, and I only did one for each case, which i though fits the game best. So you might add some minutes here if you watch all the different endings (but for me that was not the point of the game).\n\nSo would I recommend this game? And is it worth the 40 Euros I payed for it?\n\nShort answer: I would totally recommend this game. It is the first I played of this kind, and I enjoyed every minute of it!\n\n\n","October 7, 2014","true","13.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Το “Crimes and Punishments” είναι ένα εξαιρετικό παιχνίδι, ένας από τους τίτλους εκείνους που κάθεσαι με ηρεμία το απόγευμα, το βράδυ ή όποτε άλλοτε προτιμάς κι ασχολείσαι αρκετές ώρες μαζί τους, μέχρι να φτάσεις στο φινάλε.\n\nΔε θέτει δυσκολίες διότι δε θέλει να το κάνει, πατάει όμως στις ηθικές επιλογές που μας δίνει, στο replayability που έχει, στο σύγχρονο και πολύ εντυπωσιακό οπτικοακουστική πακέτο που προσφέρει και στη συνήθη πολύ υψηλή ποιότητα παραγωγής του. Είμαι βέβαιος πάντως ότι, αναλόγως και της εμπορικής πορείας του παρόντος, θα δούμε τουλάχιστον ένα ακόμη παιχνίδι της σειράς που θα έχει πανομοιότυπη δομή με το “Crimes and Punishments”, κάτι σαν sequel αυτού.

It brings many innovations to the franchise, such as moral choices, conclusions about various characters' possible guilt and heavy use of deduction boards. The only thing I just can't stop wondering about is if Holmes himself would like his cases to be so simplified and easy to solve.\n\nhttp://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-pc-review","October 11, 2014","true","24.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game has so much in it, and it would be fair to say is one of the best Sherlock Holmes games (paying respect to some of the older games, which are still brilliant, but not as interactive or huge as this game).\n\nMany other Sherlock Holms game have one case, which is not that bad for a game, but Crimes and Punishments has six cases in it. All these cases are unique and interesting, although some are more interesting than others. To complete a case you need to at the least get enough evidence and clues to come up with a conclusion, which is not too difficult, but ending a case prematurely can result in you being wrong. Yes, in this game you won't always be right. Crimes and Punishments in all about choice, there will be a lot of choices in the game, they don't necassarily affect too much, as each case is individual and is not affected by any other cases, but these choices you do make ARE important.\n\nFor each case you will need to choose the right conclusion, which is something you can create from evidence gathered, but there is so much evidence to take into consideration, so there will be a lot of conclusions you could make from all the evidence you have gathered. Sometimes you can be wrong, but don't panic on that, for those who are perfectionists and want all their cases to be correct, you have the option of checking before you confrim your choice and you can chnage it, although some people say it ruins the game, and they don't need to use that feature. After you solve the case correctly (or incorrectly) you can choose a moral choice, absolve or condem, which will give you a personality ranking, either compassionate or cold hearted, this personality will go up or down from each case, depending on what you pick.\n\nSo, the game is obviously great in that point, and there are many other points it's great in as well. It has a lot of refences to the books, referencing Sherlock as being a drug addict, Toby the dog being in the game (AND PLAYABLE!), Sherlock Holmes playing dress up, the witty humour of Sherlock being present, etc.\n\nThis game gives you a lot more freedom than a lot of Frogwares previous Sherlock Holmes games, you can run around and fling open doors (which never gets old), go from first person to third person, dress Sherlock up. And although it's not quite open world, you can still move about freely. You can collect evidence in any order, and if you find the puzzles in the game too difficult, you can skip them with no coniquences (except losing achievements). Sherlock Holmes' voice is quite okay in this game, which you'd take as a given, but considering some past Sherlock Holmes games, it's quite nice to have good voice acting. Collecting evidence is also a lot of fun (but that just might be me), and it's made quite easy and there's no pixel hunting, when you do need to 'pixel hunt' the game will let you change the vision over to something that will reveal the hidden objects (keep in mind you cannot interact with said objects without said vision, so it's not cheating, it's a part of the game). The sound effects are so good at one point I was convinced there was a fly in my room, and I freaked out.\n\nThis game is utterly amazing, I took a while to complete it, despite buying it when it releases, as I couldn't figure out where the archieves were in game during the second case, which took me around a year to work out (they were in the carriage), which was not supposed to be hard or even relevent. But when I did get past that part I could barely stop playing it until the end, as it is such an enthralling game, and so much fun. If you like the Sherlock Holmes series of either games, movies, books or shows, you should play it.","January 20","true","15.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

Some of the cases are harder than others, sometimes the conclusion is pretty obvious and sometimes it's really hard to figure out, I got it wrong in one of the 6 cases. I like that the possible conclusions keep changing with new evidence.\n\nWould have been more challenging if you had to pick which item to use when you need "an object of interest" instead of the game just giving you the right option. Also would have been more challenging if the game didn't tell you when to use the "Sherlock Talent" and the "Sherlock Imagination" abilities.\n\nThe environments are beautiful, would have loved to try this in VR. I spent some of the time just looking around and enjoying the scenery. Voice acting is very nice in my opinion; a historian friend of mine noted that Sherlock's accent didn't sound right, but I had no problem with it.\n\nOverall a very fun experience for me, I enjoy games that make you think, and this is much better than just a regular adventure game. Would love to play many more cases, but the game is definitely worth buying "just" for those 6, every case is more than an hour of very interesting content.","November 3, 2014","true","20.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Might not be everyone's cup of tea, but especially for any Sherlock Holmes fan out there, this shouldn't be missed.\n\nLonger one:\n\nThe best one in the series. Frogwares has really managed to capture the oldschool holmes vibe and once again did something a bit different to break their formula - something I respect a lot. The production values have also gone up a notch once again, as did the writing of the cases. I also really, REALLY liked the deduction space in this one and the possibility to do totally wrong deductions and even accuse the false party (something I also enjoyed a lot in for example LA Noire). This one wasn't that much about the puzzles, but really capturing the essence of Holmes. It's easy to see how much the team loves the title character (and I also bet the old BBC adaptation of the Holmes cases :) ).\n\nThe ONLY real nag from me is the hand holding nature of the "inspector-mode". Why on Earth have they decided to not put the hinting icon for switching into inspector-mode (and re-enactment also) as an OPTION, in beyond my understanding. IMO this game would've been even better, if that could've been turned off and let for the player to figure out when to use it.\n\nCan't wait the next one in the series, as Frogwares have better themselves on every instalment.","November 9, 2014","true","13.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Also looks visually appealing. Six cases to solve. First person adventure game. Walk around the crime scenes and find the clues, etc. Actually quite difficult. I've gotten used to games telling me who the culprit was at the end, and this one doesn't do that. It requires that the player use the clues to determine who they think did it, and it can be challenging. Some cases allow blame to be given to just one suspect or multiple, which means there's a lot of possible outcomes and evidence needs to be examined very carefully. I'm only on case 4 of 6 right now and I've only gotten one case correct on my first try (it lets you check if you're right at least, yay!). Discovering evidence that literally made me yell out "I KNEW IT!!!" proved to me just how much I was getting into this. Kind of like L.A.

I will say that the load times are WAY too long. Quite often in each chapter you will be treveling between each area at least 15+ times which combined can take up a hell of alot of time.\n\nAside from that this game is very fun to play if you are familliar with the other Sherlock Holmes games. I highly recommend it though there isnt really any great build-up to the end like in the last game, just case after case with a tiny moral choice at the end....it is in a way very minor sequel bait.\n\nI also got to mention that its great to finally have a choice in the case of who is the guilty party, you can in fact arrest the wrong person/people so dont take the deduction board for granted when it seems like things match up. You can go back if you made a wrong choice though so dont worry. The puzzles/minigames while solving cases can sometimes be a literal pain in the butt, like the time where you got to arm-wrestle a geezer which was not fun :c But its nice of the developers to allow you to skip every single one of the puzzles/events though you will not get the achivment if you do this.\n\nOverall this game is really pretty and fun to play...just the loading times being a literal nightmare brings it down a bit but I recommend this game if you are a patient person.","July 2, 2015","true","19.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It turns out I should have gotten around to it sooner; it's not the budget title I expected, but a serious and earnest attempt to do the mystery genre real justice (so to speak) in games.\n\nFIrst, I should note that the presentation is solid; although it's not an AAA title and never will be, the environments are detailed, the people are expressive, and the voice acting is uniformly solid and engaging. Everything related to storytelling clearly got priority. The stuff that isn't up to snuff are the things that are secondary to that experience, like the somewhat sluggish mouse controls or the kind of janky running. These things are minor annoyances sometimes, not dealbreakers, and have nothing to do with the real meat of the game.\n\nAnd the meat of the game is this: every single mystery has multiple suspects with plausible motives and multiple ways events could have gone down. Simulating "solving a mystery" is one of the absolute hardest things to do in a videogame and it's why so many "mystery" games (including this one, to a degree) are really adventure games with puzzles as stand-ins for actual reasoning. Thankfully, while there are some minigames and jigsaw-puzzle-solving and connect-the-dots and so forth, Crimes and Punishments mostly consists of accumulating real clues and listening to real testimony and it's committed to letting you miss things or draw the wrong conclusions and even accuse the wrong people (at which point the game just keeps going!). It's a great design approach and I hope anyone attempting mystery games in the future takes note.\n\nJohn Walker at RPS hated it but reading his review it becomes clear that he kindasorta didn't solve a lot of the cases. Like, he talks about how case such-and-such has a nonsensical out-of-left-field ending and I'm pretty sure it's because he didn't collect all the evidence and didn't come up with the right picture of the crime.\n\nAnd it made me realize that that's always going to be a problem with the genre, even when the games aren't low-budget titles from France - if a mystery game plays fair and doesn't railroad you and gives you real chances to succeed based on your intuition and deduction, that means it's also giving you real chances to fail, and a lot of people are going to fail and just think the mystery is dumb or the game is stupid, regardless of its actual quality.\n\nIf you understand that, and you're willing to accept that this game represents - to possibly the greatest degree yet achieved in a videogame - an actual test of your reasoning skills, I think you'll be in for a lot of fun.","December 13, 2015","true","29.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I expected a game that only involved looking at the environments to gather clues, maybe aska few questions here and there. Oh what am I saying, this is SHERLOCK HOLMES the game!\n\nPros:\nRanging from reenacting the scene using Sherlock's imagination, looking into the very fine details of objects, the gameplay is fantastic. It showed me how the mind of the world's greatest detective works, and now I can understand why some of the demands he makes can be eccentric, and yet is actually part of the research that is required. it is extremely amusing to see Watson struggling to catch up with Sherlock and sometimes he finds Sherlock absurd, and the interactions between him and Sherlock definitely made me laugh aloud a few times.\n\nWhat astounded me the most were the character portraits, whereby you observe the details of the person that you are currently talking to to get his/her background. It strongly resembles the way Sherlock in the BBC TV series observes people.\n\nThe mini-games, or puzzles to be exact, involve dabbling in a bit of chemistry, researching in your archives, and finding locations using your map. Even though it may sound boring in this review, they are both interesting and intriguing. You are given a choice to skip most of these puzzles, but more often than not, I never actually do, because such puzzles are actually unique and I have never came accross such mini games in all the time I play other games.\n\nThis game shows you how Sherlock's mind works. How he processes and gains vital information from the littlest of things. From there, he does his deductions. Is it person A that murdered him or person B? Is it so sure that there is only one culprit? At some point in time, you will find that some deductions conflict with the others, and from there you must gather even more evidence to decide whether or not that deduction is accurate. The ultimate conclusion is up to you.\n\nYou are also given moral choices at the end of each sequence. Are you an emphathiser or justice seeker? It is up to choose what fate you want to give to the culprit.\n\nAlso, your gameplay is not limited to Sherlock and ONLY Sherlock. I will not say the rest due to spoilers.\n\nCons:\nVoice acting - Voice acting can certainly improve. Although I find it rather alright at most points of the game, there are moments whereby I cringe at it.\n\nReused default lines - Every time you talk to a police man... "Mr Hooooolmes."\n\nInvisible walls. Everywhere- This is not a sandbox game. You are expected to only walk around a certain area. Although I can understand, this disappointed me as there are parts whereby it looked like you can explore further, but then the map pops up whenever you go past a certain line, and your POV is suddenly switch 180 degrees around. Rather annoying and confusing at times.\n\nWatson not sufficiently involved in cases - Apart from 1 or 2 times whereby he was crucial to the storyline, he is pretty much useless most of the time. During cases I usually try to talk to him to gain some insights or his opinions, but most of the time he just gives me the default answers and follows me around. There is no difference whether or not he decides to accompany you on a case or not, because he doesn't do anything. Period. It would have been nice if he would give personal opinions like "This suicide seems highly suspicious Mr Holmes.". Or if there were options where you could ask him to examine the victim and therefore give important clues as to how he died, which will then add on to the details that you gather from the autopsy. All these would have given him far more character.  But no. It doesn't work that way here.\n\nOverall, great game. I had a fun time finishing it. But I feel like it is only good for playing through once. Replaying it would be the last of my thought.","October 11, 2014","true","13.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It feels like an authentic Conan Doyle -written Holmes experience; the setting looks fantastic, the music lifts the atmosphere, the voice acting is convincing, and before all else, the cases are unique and intriguing.\n\nThe gameplay consists of three different main parts: finding clues, interrogating suspects and questioning witnesses, and deducing the solution to the case from all gathered information. The game very generously helps with the first two parts, and you can always check Holmes' notebook to see what to do next in case you forget.\n\nFinding the clues is for the most part fun: altough the game follows point & click traditions, finding objects isn't a tedious pixel hunt, everything you can interact with is clearly higlighted when you are close enough to them. There is a plenty of minigames and puzzles, and while for example doing chemical experiments is fun and interesting, the lockpicking does get old by the end of the game.\n\nThe interrogation and questioning is mostly quite straightforward, but whenever meeting a new person of interest you can stop time and observe minute details about the person, such as a missing wedding band or a peculiar tattoo. These details make up a profile of the person, and after a while you start to piece together the persons background in your own mind, as Holmes would do.\n\nThe last part is in my opinion the most interesting one in the game. All the facts about the case are laid out in front of the player, and there are many different possible solutions to the case, but it is up to the player to figure out how things actually happened. After coming to a conclusion the player still has a choice: to either condemn or absolve the culprit(s). In one case in particular I had a lot of trouble with this moral choice, and still don't know if what I did was the right thing to do, which wonderfully highlights the games theme of morality.\n\nIn conclusion, no other game has made me use my brain for deduction as well as Crimes & Punishments. It truly made me think, really use that gray matter of mine. While suffering from a few less than stellar minigames here and there, the rest of the game, especially the deducing, shines so brightly that those few misshaps can easily be forgiven. I fully recommend this game to anyone that is interested in detective stories, and having their deductive powers tested, or just about anyone in need of a polished game that excells at what it does.","June 24, 2015","true","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

About a week after that I noticed this game on sale and I thought I'd give it a try..... Initially, I was a bit taken back by the minimalist approach but as the game went on it became something I not only understand but totally love. It has this "wide linear" feel about the whole game that keeps you focused on the task at hand while also giving you a relative amount of freedom. Definately a refreshing game if you have been playing "quick twitch, headshot, find next target" type games and want something different. Overall, this game is one that should not be missed by anyone who has read, watched, or listened any Sherlock Holmes related story before. Even if not, this game is a great entry point into Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson's adventures.\n\n9/10","July 8, 2015","true","57.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments plays out much like one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories, and is a genuine pleasure to play. The positive notes of the gam are that ambience of the game is on point, and the cases kep you interested through to the conclusion. The negatives are that, firstly,  the game controls feel a bit clumsy at times, most notably when investigating some clues,  and secondly, that the puzzles themselves are not particularily challenging. A third drawback can also be argued in that it has next to no replay value, but this is more an inherent flaw in the genre of mystery games as a whole than a reflection on this game in particular.\n\nIn short, if you have $35 and a weekend to yourself, and are a fan of Sherlock Holmes or even just a good mystery, pick up this game. you won't regret it.\n\nImmersion: 4/5\nAmbience: 5/5\nControls: 4/5\nReplay Value: 2/5\n","May 18","true","15.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't expect hardcore 90s point and click puzzles tough; whilst not at the walking dead level it has more an emphasis on the story, which personally suits me better. This seems to have been a late change in the gameplay as bits of mini games gameplay with time based response or choices are still there but frustrating consequences look like they have been removed to get a more fluid experience.\n\nThe game is split in several stories which are the size of a Sherlock Holmes novel, maybe an hour or two each. A very good format for spending an evening on a story or two. The novels are inspired by actual novels. I don't know if it is the case for all but I had personally already red 2 or 3 of them a while ago, which somehow spoiled a bit the story.\n\nIf not technically stunning compared to a AAA, the game leverages on a few effects unreal engine. Maps are small (and sometimes even unoptimised on a GTx970). The artistic direction really deserves to be noted with some gorgeous textures and moody lightning. It is really good at setting the atmosphere "as if you were in the book". The main menu animation simply sets the feeling.\n\nIf you like a good Sherlock Holmes story in a gorgeous poised Conan Doyle atmosphere, go for it.

Sherlock Holmes is back with six cases of varying lengths and complexity that are sure to tingle some neurons in people's brains in an all-new absolutely fantastic continuation of this particular game series.  With all-new recently-inspired gameplay ideas that add an even deeper level of intrigue, any fan of Sherlock would hate to miss this.\n\nAs the brain of Baker Street himself, you must solve six cases all of which are unrelated and just another field day's work for Holmes from odd puzzles to figuring out people.  Whilst the puzzles are still tricky but much more well-designed on a level akin to Testaments' work, the forensic aspect of the game has jumped HUGELY in quality.\n\nHolmes can now gather clues from various places and even return back to original places to compare some new clues with old findings ranging from footprints in the mud to wheel tracks in the loch beach.  The game takes very clearly a lot of inspiration from LA Noire in terms of studying and investigating things which certainly works for its favour, allowing you to compile a bunch of clues in order to come to one of many conclusions.\n\nAll six cases have several conclusions you can reach and judge for yourself on who the real killer is.  But only one conclusion is actually right and the game does allow you to either be confident in your conclusion, or actually tell you after everything's said and done if you made a mistake and would like to try again for a different conclusion.  It's surprisingly forgiving that way but also allowing you to come to your own sense of judgement.\n\nAnother wonderful thing of the game is the new Sherlock Scan ability as I have unofficially named it stealing off from TV Tropes.  Taking blatant inspiration from the recent BBC series of Sherlock, you can now scan potential suspects of particular abnormalities that they exhibit allowing you to compile a portrait of them so you can gleam more information out of them.  This is fantastic and frankly the best thing in the entire game for true Holmesian fans.\n\nSo let me just rundown the pile on the good and bad of the game.\n\n= Pros\n* First of all, the graphics look absolutely wonderful and well-nourished with a much better design on characters for a reason that will come up later.  Holmes looks less "Sheldon Cooper" than he did in Testaments and is a lot more elegantly handsome of a more true descript to the original design from the stories.  The environments are incredibly lush for Victorian London with much better lighting work than even the previous game.\n\n* The gameplay is absolutely fantastic, completely rehauled to be quite different from Testaments but in a much more involving manner, giving you the feeling that you are doing just as much as YOU want to investigate.  You want to actually scan people, do so!  You want to bother going back to the crime scene to compare notes, go ahead!  There's very little the game actually forces you to do and in the end all that is driving you is your own sense of curiosity.  You can even finish the case quite shoddily without finding everything and still come to a conclusion (that may not be right) but the fact it has the freedom to let you, is quite impressive.\n\n* Puzzle skipping returns for those who are too taxed by some of the puzzles, but for me I never had a problem with any of them and I daresay they are better designed than even Testaments' ones were.\n\n\n= Cons\n* Unfortunately, despite the wonderful presentation of the game, none of the music is actually made for the game itself and has been taken largely from a free library courtesy of Kevin MacLeod.  Not that the music is any BAD, it's actually quite good and very fitting but the fact there is no real original music for the game just sours me a tiny bit as an enthusiast of videogame music.  But that is just a tiny smidge against the work of this game and really only something to nitpick.\n\n* The real problem I have with the game is the fact there is no overarching storyline.  All of the cases are individual and while they themselves are still interesting by themselves, there is not the same sort of interesting drive as the other games did when it was all one big case.  I speak only of this because, without going into too much detail, the PRETENCE of an overarching storyline is most egregious when it comes towards an ending.  And there is one, but it seems very out-of-nowhere and unrelated and not even really trying to connect to anything.  Which just makes me shrug wearily.\n\nRegardless of this, you should definitely buy this game if you appreciate Sherlock Holmes.  It's smooth, it's funny, it's incredibly deep in its gameplay possibility, there are a lot of outcomes you can take very easily, the puzzles are fantastic, the voicework is definitely a lot better than previous works and overall they just really keep raising up the bar as I said.  See for yourself what conclusions you come to, you won't regret it.","April 28, 2015","true","13.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I really enjoyed the last game, and this game is more of the same but much more beautiful. The scenes in this game are magnificently beautiful, the people look lifelike and the shadows and lighting are goregous. The compromise to this is the excessive loading times. This can be a annoying when you only need to visit a scene for 1 clue, which may take but a few seconds, and then it loads for a couple of mins to get there.\nThe game is difficult but there doesnt seem like a way to truly mess up. You are always guided by Holmes and Watson. I would like more of a sense of failure, which may alter the play of the game. However, this doesnt change the enjoyment of the game.\nI would really recommend this game to people who enjoy a good mystery, but do check out the previous game too.","October 1, 2014","true","17.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Testament was the best of these, atmospheric and tense, engaging puzzles, good characters.  Crimes and Punishments is none of those things.  This game is a series of mystery mini-games to solve little drama pieces that aren't really interesting, nor do they do much for any characterization.  The new featurues added to this title in the series are not new at all, either.  The facial ticks for truth vs. lies is lifted straight off of L.A. Noire.  The head-to-toe scan of interviewees is not interactive and is just a linear point A to point B checklist to reach a cutscene.  Lastly the Watson character was nothing more than a one-liner side show, not an integral part of the story like in the other games.\n\nMany other reviewers have commented on nice graphics.  I have to assume that these are reports from Nvidia equipped machines, especially given the prominent PhysX ad in the introduction of the game...but my R9 290 equipped machine gave different results.  There was screen tearing.  Not in the conventional vertical sync fashion, but horizontal screen tearing.  How does that even happen?  Anti-aliasing had jaggies everywhere on character and environment shadows.  Building textures were not as crisp as in Testament.  And finally, possibly most importantly, the loading screens were excessive and even the animations in them were choppy.  My machine generally performs well, even when faced with high demand games.  Without stating conclusions, that result did not happen with this game.","April 22, 2015","false","10.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

Load screens for load screens.

I thouroughly enjoyed the game and it ran well on my pc. The puzzles and gameplay were done well, with a nice mix of challenge and involvement. The story however, seemed scattered. The game is broken up into different cases, with no relationship between them. The ending also shares in this problem by seeming random and out of place, with all the choices available in the previous cases, like whether to absolve or condemn the perp, proving relatively pointless in the end. All in all i enjoyed it and look forward to additional cases being released as DLC.

The facial textures and expressions are nothing short of absolutely astounding. Who ever worked on that, good job. The puzzles aren't too difficult, and the "lockpicking" is a bit repetitive, but the game makes up for that in the moral choices and the reasoning you have to use to make a final decision as to who committed a crime.\n\nDespite all the evidence you collect, at the end of many cases you can still be left scratching your head as to who committed the crime. This is pretty awesome because I had to review all the evidence I collected, and really take into consideration details that on the outside might seem trivial. These very small details made all the difference. In this sense, the game is very true to the Sherlock Holmes experience you would expect.\n\nI do have one gripe though, and it is a very small one. The outfits that you can wear are almost always locked. I honestly would have liked to have worn the unbuttoned shirt and scruffy facial hair to look a bit more like Dr. House. I was actually hoping that once I beat the game all of the outfits would be unlocked, but sadly that didn't happen.\n\nIf you like the adventure genre, this is one to have in your library.","October 12, 2014","true","77.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think :P]\n\nAdventures aren´t dead!\n\n...especially when developers put some effort into their work.\n\nSherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishment is an interesting approach to the genre of adventure-games ... and it´s well done.\nThe game mechanics are ´fresh´, new and innovative, "forcing" the player to listen and think instead of clicking random everythings and skip dialogues. Talking about the dialogues: They are very well done: Lovely british accents, good voice actors and a general high level of quality make it a pleasure to listen. The graphics in this (on the hardware side very humble) game are beautiful and atmospheric.\nAlso, the authors of the game seem to be fans of Doyle´s stories. The first case (The murder of ´Black Peter´) are a 1:1 copy from the original story and can be understood as some kind of tutorial to old Holmes-fans.\n\nThe system of deduction is typical and interesting. The further you get with your case, the more theories build up for the play to combine and analyse. That brings in some skills and thinking instead of random clicking.\nThe cases and puzzles are logical, the minigames are good, not too many and skipable, if the player does not like them.\nHowever, "C&P" is a game that´s fun to play and a worthy continuation of Holmes´ life.\n\n----\n\nGameplay-> 9/10 (It might be a bit too easy for experienced ´adventurers´, due to Holmes´ skills)\n\nAuthenticity -> 10/10 (Lovely voices, believable characters and places (.... only Mycroft is not as fat as he should be :P)\n\nGraphics/Animations -> 9/10 (It is not perfect, but still an eyecatcher)\n\n"Size"->9/10 (3rd of 6 cases, 6 hours .... it should take around 10 hours to finish the game ... Maybe some DLCs will follow)\n\nBite-my-keyboard-factor->10/10 (No crashes or major bugs, no frustration so far)\n\nValue-> 8.5/10 (It is not particularly cheap, but not overpriced. If you are not sure about the purchase, wait for a 10 or 20% sale)\n\n\nSo far ... case closed,\nhave fun with the game. ;)\n\n","October 11, 2014","true","17.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It   makes sure the player never forgets anything and is always able to keep track if something is missing, which makes things a bit too easy. Nevertheless, i found the experience very enjoyable. The deduction system is the best it's ever been and the cases are, overall, fairly interesting. The game is looking great and the mechanics hold no mystery, everything is intuitive.\n\nSomething a bit annoying are the loadings. There's plenty of them and they aren't that fast. While it isn't a major complaint, it's a nuisance.\n\nAs game the progresses on a case-by-case basis it leaves room for expansions containing more and i really hope Frogwares is thinking about it. I could play some more cases!\n\nSo, if you are a fan of the series you will probably enjoy more Sherlock Holmes. If you are new to the series, this instalment is the most beginner friendly and might pull people to the series.

Good characters, beautiful locations, and unique story lines make this a must for any fan or the genre. Although, as a fan of all the Sherlock Holmes games I do find Crimes and Punishments to be ridiculously easy. I remember Nemesis being a real challenge and this was what got me hooked on the releases to follow. This current title feels more like the game model employed by Telltale in "The Walking Dead". That is, supplementing any challenge with rolling story. It is still a good experience, but their lacks a "sense of achievement" which you would recieve with the other titles.\n\nAnother problem I have with this latest installment is that of travel. You frequently visit locations, do one thing, and then travel back to a previously visited location via horse and cart. There can be times when you're literally staring at a loading screen 80% of the time, to spend 1 minute at a location before moving on to another. This is the biggest problem with the game in my opinion as it reminds me of surfing the web on a 56k connection in order to read one sentence from various websites. I miss how Sherlock Holmes vs Jack the Ripper had you walking around albeit a small part of London and how there was no "press t to find everything" mode (That cannot be disabled)\n\nOverall a good game but not without its frustrations 7/10.\n\n\n","October 7, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayyalicia/recommended/241260/","ayyalicia","ayyalicia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayyalicia/","60 products in account","Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is an absolutely beautiful strategy game where the player's choices ACTUALLY matter.\n\nI've spent nearly 30 hours playing this game and am tempted to replay it again just because I love the experience of it. Crimes and Punishments offers the player engaging story lines, mechanics that "just feel right" (I LOVED the deduction screen), and enough ambiguity to really keep you guessing up until the time you have to choose who done it. When the case slowly comes to a close and a decision has to be made, I found myself on several occassions having to revisit clues, statements, and areas two or three times over before making an arrest. THAT'S what I want in a mystery game!\n\nThe game finds a really great balance between casual gameplay and challenge. There are other reviews that mention that the small bouts of handholding the game does ruins gameplay, but I found that it really assisted in keeping the momentum. There was never a time that I felt that I had to "put the game down" because I was at a part of the game that I was unable to figure out.  I actually found the handholding to be really necessary. It could be toned down just a tad, but I felt overall it added significant value in making the player feel smart like Holmes and keep the player *playing*! That's what's important.\n\nAs you begin to build a case, the player has the opportunity to do a lot of different "mini games" that give them more clues and continue the storyline. They are necessary. Toward the end of the game, there were new "mini games" that were introduced which I thought was fantastic. You get to become Toby and follow a scent, reenact the situation to toss out theories, create timelines, and even use your imagination to put the events in order. These are only some of the "mini games" that are included and they add a lot of dimension to gameplay and help break up the monotony of having to bounce in between locations to talk to different people, or revisit evidence.\n\nI thought that each of the 6 storylines were well developed. You'll see in the forums some weren't as strong as others, but I think overall they're really good. There is a *very* small storyline that ties them all together that ends up being forgotten until the end (at least I forgot about it).\n\nThe deduction screen that the player uses to find relationships between clues and, eventually, uses to name the guilty party is hands down my favorite feature. They made a great choice by allowing the player to make the wrong decision if they aren't thorough- I hope they include more nuiances like this in future games. The moral choice feature during deduction time is really well done. It doesn't change the game much at all, but adds an interesting dynamic where not only do you get the power to name the murderer, you get a choice on what to do with them. Adds another great level of power to the player.\n\nAs far as replayability goes, this is one of those games that just isn't meant to be endlessly replayed. The stories, I think, are fantastic length and keep the player engaged for a long time. If you happen to guess the murderer right, there's no need to replay the case again unless you're interested in the different cinematic endings. However, if you do get it wrong, then that's the opportunity to play again, or at least guess again.\n\nFinally, if looks are what you're after, this game definitely brings something to the table. The cinematic interviews are absolutely beautiful. Interrogation seems real. Sitting with Sherlock in between locations as it loads doesn't even bother me; the opportunity to check your casebook during the loading cinematic is so fluid and flawless. Even the mechanic to call people out during conversation is well done! I do wish that in future games they don't handhold the player when an individual says something that can be proven wrong- I think the small bouts of information you gain from those integral parts should only be awarded to those who notice the lie. Even so, I also particularly love how you can look a character up and down their person to learn more clues about them that build out their character profile. So freakin' well done.\n\nOverall, I would absolutely buy this game. Especially if it's on sale. If you're into games that challenge you, or enjoy games where the decisions you make matter, I think you'd really like this.","September 5, 2015","true","27.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love mystery type games where you have to search for clues but this game is a bit more than that. You get to make choices and moral decisions with different possible outcomes. There's not a set path that eventually leads you to one conclusion. It's possible to reach multiple conclusions and find different characters guilty. You have to choose whether you will condemn or absolve them and that has its own outcomes too. It is possible to reach a wrong conclusion! Also, you can reach the correct conclusion but mess up during a mini-game at the end and not receive your acheivement. (You can replay the endings though.)\n\nThe scenery is pretty awesome and I especially love the atmosphere in some of the places. The Blood Bath case is my favorite so far with all the different places to explore and clues to find. There are a few somewhat creepy-feeling places in this case too which I love. :)\n\nMy only complaint is that there are long loading screens and lots of them. There is a black loading screen before you get to the carriage loading scene. A loading screen for a loading screen is a little frustrating. But at least during the carriage loading screen you can open up your casebook or check deductions so it's not too bad.\n\nOverall I would defintiely recommend Crimes and Punishments, especially if you are a Sherlock fan, and I'm definitely going to be checking out the other Sherlock games after I finish this one.","July 4, 2015","true","37.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The new engine runs beautifully and the textures allow for a very immersive game-experience, though I at times wish some of the 'maps', such as the train stations, were a bit bigger...\nThe mini-game puzzles for the most also differ alot, which, again, keeps the game from becoming teedious and boring.\nThe indidual cases are well thought-out and just as you think you have the right answer everything gets flipped on you...\n\nHowever, perhaps one of my personal favourite features about this game, is the ability to not only choose what fate shall befall the criminal, but also - perhaps especially - the ability to get the wrong answer. In some games, the game is programed in such a way that you will not be able to preceed before you've got the right solution; something that, at least to some degree, ruins the ability to fully immerse yourself in the story. In Crimes and Punishment, however, the game just rolls with the flow - even if you royally ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\nAll in all a very enjoyable game.

Interactive environments, solving cases that sometimes lead to more questions and segments. If you are looking for a game to shoot bad guys like LA Noire that isn't this game, this game requires patience, careful calculation about finding suspects and clues and sometimes it has a mini-game that allows you to throw things or even shoot things. There are some funny moments and one odd thing which is a telescope aimed at a window with an obese lady staring back smiling.\n9/10\nThe only thing that's down is the annoying map that pops up constantly when you venture slightly out of the area.","May 27","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It has taken many attempts, and though a few - such as 2004’s ‘The Case of the Silver Earring’ and the most recent iteration; ‘The Testament of Sherlock Holmes’ - weren’t terrible by any means, they still fell for a lot of antiquated adventure game trappings. They were awfully slow paced and the puzzles just felt obtuse and drawn out. Well, that is in the past. With the oddly (yet aptly) titled ‘Crimes And Punishments’’, Frogwares truly outdo themselves. It’s akin to Testament in that it’s not a straight up point & click game, but more of a third person adventure game with point & click mechanics. But where Testament felt stiff and unwieldy, Crimes is anything but. The gameplay is fluid and the pacing is much more efficient. You’ll be exploring a lot of environments, studying a lot of items up close and reading a lot of faces to find people’s dirty little secrets - so it’s good that Frogwares are one step ahead for once. The visual fidelity is impeccable, and few adventure games can profess to look better. Sure, you’ll find the rare oversight and texture pop-in here and there, but it’s still a beautiful game, and the locations you visit are all distinctly different. You will, of course, be doing a lot of the same work in all of them, but the puzzle-variety is actually quite decent too.\n\nI think I can safely attest that this is just about the best Sherlock Holmes game made to this day. Does that mean it’s perfect though? Sadly, no. For a game that focuses on the incredibly perceptive Sherlock Holmes of all people, a person who can figure out your entire lineage by glancing at a scar on your nose, Crimes feels way too easy. You’ll rarely find yourself even remotely stuck with a puzzle. Games can cater to new players and  veterans alike. But too often, it feels like Crimes completely forgets about the latter group. Take the special vision mode you can enter by pressing T, for instance. It’s okay that new players have this to more easily spot clues in the terrain that they might’ve missed, but it becomes a problem when you’re forced to activate it in order to spot certain clues that are otherwise invisible. I want to explore! Not press a button and let the game do all the work!\n\nIn closing, I think Crimes And Punishments is a game about giving you the feeling of being the genius detective Sherlock Holmes - and it does so quite well for the most part, being a very faithful gamification of sir Conan Doyle’s literature. But if you were anticipating a game that would challenge your mind to reach the levels of the master detective himself, then you’ll find yourself disappointed. Even so, there is still more than sufficient amounts of fun to be had, pretending to be mr. Holmes for the 10-12 hours it’ll take you to complete all the cases.

The original universe of the detective is respected, with the quirky nature of Sherlock being accompanied by Watson's serious temperament. Crimes & Punishments follows the inspector through six cases interrogating, inspecting and solving, and each case has something interresting about it.\n\nThe game has a good life-span (around 10-12 hours) and the replayability isn't too bad because you can replay past cases while changing your conclusions. The puzzle mini-games are really fun, even though the picklocking gets pretty old before the end of the game.\n\nMy only real problem with the game is the lack of open world.

The previous game was a massive leap in comparison to the ones before that and this one takes it to the next level.\n\nThere is a lot of inspiration from the BBC series "Sherlock" in this game. Words pop up when examining people for example. It makes the game feel fresh.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty easy and even if they become too troublesome, you can skip them if you fail enough. The game does a good job of making you feel like a detective, it's a pretty unique experience, and I think it's worth a purchase just for that.\n\nIn this game you're able to convict other people, depending on how you interpret the evidence. In my opinion, that part of it doesn't really pan out. Conclusions can feel very wishy washy.\n\nThe cases can feel way too open ended, the evidence not conclusive enough and there are red herrings everywhere. The "deductions system" is hard to use.\nI usually make it to the end of a case with all of the available clues and someone I think is guilty.\nHowever, "lining up" the clues so that I "deduce" that person is declared guilty is way harder than it needs to be.\nI usually end up aligning the clues so that I actually get to any conclusion instead of just being... stuck.\nEven after declaring the person you think is guilty and with the game confirming that he is in fact guilty (by giving you an achievement), you're still not 100% sure.\nThe conclusions never seem rock solid.\n\nMost cases take around an hour to solve. Case 4 is a weird outlyer that only took 20 minutes to solve, had one location to visit and only one outcome (I did enjoy the case itself though).\n\nTIP FOR DEVELOPERS: You're able to skip pieces of dialogue even if the text isn't completely displayed on the screen. Please make sure in the future that all text is displayed onscreen before being able to skip it, thanks.\n\nTIP FOR DEVELOPERS 2: The trailer lied!","March 12, 2015","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The distinction is clear.'\n\nThat is a perfect description of how I felt when playing this game. All the small details Holmes aquires in this game make or break each case and often the simple answers are the most important. The cases make it so you have equal suspicion of who commited the crime until you get that one clue which puts all the pieces together. I have never felt more stupid for selecting the wrong choice in a game in quite awhile and all the reasons why the actual person commit the crime makes so much sense it makes me feel even more stupid for not realising it earlier.\n\n'There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.' Which is so true in this game.\n\nBut when I got to 'The Kew Gardens Drama' the 5th case in the game I began to understand and started to piece together the clues and created a 'theory based on facts and not facts based on theories' and i turned out to be right giving me the greatest feeling of satisfaction.\n\nThis game has 6 great cases that are all unique with multiple endings, deceptive characters and great graphics. This is a massive step up from The Testament of Sherlock Holmes which was also a really good game and this is a game I would play again to experience the other endings I could have chosen.","January 26, 2015","true","13.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is a big contrast from the previous games, especially Testament, where he's shown to be just as competent as Holmes.\n- Is so different it feels like a standalone game, not part of the Frogwares series\n- Made up of a bunch of miniplots that don't have any relation to one another (this is a little truer to Holmes canon, just imo doesn't suit an adventure game very well).

After having played through most of the Sherlock Holmes games I also like the direction the developers seem to be taking this series. This last installment is certainly my favorite of all I've played so far, but it is of course not without its issues.\n\nFirst, I want to mention that the graphics are quite gorgeous in this game, and in several instances I found myself just gazing on the terrifically detailed and beautiful locales. Also the characters themselves are highly detailed and I sit left quite impressed. I did however find most areas a bit "foggy" and also animations not equally impressive. Close up of faces looks stunning, but feel stiff and lifeless.\n\nAs with the previous game, the voice acting is top notch and every character you play and meet are believable. I had a bit of trouble hearing the voices of our Baker Street duo in the beginning as voices seemed to be set quite low, but it was easily adjusted through the options screen. Music and sound effects throughout the game seemed very good.\n\nAll those things are good to have and helps the immersion and the general enjoyment of the game, but it all comes down to how the game plays. I know that this won't be a game for everyone. It is slow paced, dialog heavy and a lot of traveling back and forth, and for people who like their action a bit revved up this game will have a hard time to convince that it is worth their time. However, if you are into good story telling, enjoy having to think a little and don't mind lots of dialog then this right here is quite a gem. It will of course help if you share my interest in Detective/Murder/Mystery previously mentioned.\n\nThe game is seperated into six seperate cases of a little varied lengths and difficulty. They are all interesting mysteries with added twists and appear in well varied and interesting locales. They are truly seperate cases and are not smaller parts of a bigger scheme. I like that setup. It feels like they were going for an episode based game but you get all of it in one dash. Felt good to end one case one day, and then start a fresh new one the next. Kept it constantly interesting.\n\nIt is not a particularly difficult or challenging game. It felt more like a guided experience where you in the end decide who the culprit is and his or her fate. You do this through a deduction minigame that you constantly add to as you uncover clues and statements. In the end you can be totally wrong and have an innocent person thrown in jail. So you need to pay attention.\n\nThe game has a few various puzzle mini games and quick time events that give good variation to the gameplay even though the QTE's feel a bit out of place. You also have some "super" abilities that you need to use certain places. But don't worry you will not miss anything as you will always be notified when you need to use them.\n\nI like that they put in some references to previous games in the series and also a nod to other things. The Calvin & Hobbes reference was particularly enjoyable :o)\n\nBecause the game is split up the way it is it seemed like a lengthy game for an adventure type game and I spent about 18 hrs to play through it. Even though it felt too easy and too guided I feel like I really got my money's worth in entertainment from this game.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have is that they have reduced Dr. Watson to a walking, talking obstacle that just seems to be in the way, and contributes nothing. Surely there would be ways to include him in various ways for a fuller experience?\n\nIn the end I have to say that I would easily recommend this game to all Sherlock fans, adventure game fans, murder/mystery fans and similar gamers.\n\nI give this game a 8/10\n\nHappy gaming!\n\nJ3ST3R","January 30, 2015","true","18.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

C&P doesn't hide any of the process from you; it's a slow accumulation of clues, associated by deduction to arrive at conclusions. To me this is the pure essence of what a detective game should be.\n\nThe puzzle sections, and yes, even the dog sequences, are lightly sprinkled throughout and give a nice sense of pacing. None of them are very hard, but they are good speed bumps to break up what would otherwise be monolithic walls of text. These sections are always at least marginally sensible, and make me feel like I'm doing something to earn my clues ... even when it's a straightforward series of operations like "pick up eyedropper, drop acid onto metal, observe results". Some of them are bona fide puzzles requiring moderately crunchy brain work, but if you are looking for hardcore gameplay challenges, this may not be for you.\n\nThe really wonderful thing about the game is that the deduction system lets you be wrong. There's no mechanical penalty whatsoever to screwing up - you can finish the whole game and never get a right answer. The game provides numerous red herrings and false conclusions to pursue, and if you're simply bashing through like an action gamer, trying to "win" as quickly as possible, you probably will ... and you'll probably be wrong. As you collect the clues, though, you are given a great deal of "soft" information that will lead you to the correct solution. It's demanding my attention in a way no game has before. You will find enough evidence to reach a conclusion; it is probable, though not guaranteed, that you'll accumulate all available clues, and by testing deductive permutations, unlock all available solutions ... but even then, arriving at the correct one requires thoughtful consideration.\n\nIf Frogwares keeps this system for future games, they've earned a new regular customer.","April 1","true","26.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The result is that you have indeed a long game, but one that you can play for a couple of hours, maybe a day or two, and then leave and return much later, and you won't be lost because there are multiple stories, and you may be beginning a new case. The short story format works for the kind of mysteries that sherlock solves, as in the novel by the original author. In fact, some stories were adapted directly from the original ones. Also, because of the different stories you have different kinds of mysteries and settings, so it adds  a great deal of variety.\n\nThe game itself is really fun! The game has many different kinds of things to do and riddles to solve, not just dialogue, or puzzles, there's much much more than that, it's not an interactive movie, here you have lots of gaming to do, and it is done in an original and different way and in relation with sherlock homes universe. It is not terribly difficult, and you have help, the interface for the game is very clear and has good design. Also you have the option of bypassing any puzzle if you are stuck.\nWhat i think is very well done is the deduction system, in wich you associate clues gathered while investigating and you create different relations between the clues (in different ways) and you arrive then, to  different conclussions. This conclussions could be right or wrong... and it is done in a way that is not so obvious, and it really makes you think. At the end, when you finally choose who is guilty, you have the option of checking before continuing if you made the right decision or not\n\nThe graphics, are AAA quality, wich is great and really puts this game at the same level of any other game of any other genre that is currently out there. The animations are not so great, but just in comparison to the details of the graphics, but they do their job very well. The voice acting is the BEST, wich is enormously important for a game of this kind, if you don't have for example the voice of your main character (Sherlock) done right, then you are so screwed, but in this game all voice acting is great and helps build the characters, specially because is the only real human component in a game with 3D graphics. I said this about the voice and the graphics, but i don't think having computer graphics instead of real actors (in this case) it's a disavantage. On the contrary, i think having computer graphics for a sherlock holmes game, works specially great, better than real actors, because in this case, trying to do a real life impersonation would be too difficult too expensive, and ultimately it would never be like the novels (all my respecto to the movies and tv series) but i much really prefer, in this case, the sherlock depicted here. Because, more than any movie or any series to date, it is SO faifthfull to the original novels. Not only the characters, the construction of the era is done right.\n\nPlaying this last game, i felt like i was playing with the original Sherlock, the one from the novels. I think that, a video game, (and more than that, and ADVENTURE game) is the best possible medium to experience a sherlock holmes mistery in the 21th century. Because you do not only follow a story, but you play one, you solve the mystery, it's great.\n\nFor the first time in years i don't feel ashamed to recommend and adventure game, because this is not only a great adventure game, it's just a great game overall, doesn't matter which genre you like, anyone should enjoy it as it has TOP quality graphics and voice acting, great story, and a lots of good gaming.\n\nIf you want to play a game this year set in the 1800s victorian london.... with a good story, great characters, and stories that have closure at the end... play Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments.\n\nUPDATE 26/03/2016 :\n\nAfter playing finally many adventure games from 2014, i have to say absolutely, this is the best adventure game from 2014. It is, what a modern adventure game should be,  a game everyone can be interested in, and play, not only adventure fans, but everyone as well. The puzzles are well done, original and not too much difficult or too much easy,  it has great graphics, great sound, great production values, the story (stories) are great, very well done, the characters are great, the dialogs. And it shows, many people have played this game since 2014, not only adventure fans.","October 18, 2015","true","31.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Firstly is that of the inclusion of two cases from the Sherlock Holmes novels (and if you are a true Holmesian I need not point out which ones they are), secondly is the apperance of Sherlocks brother Mycroft who was only in a couple of the orginal novels. The deduction system in this game is certianly different from all of the previous games as you can use Holmes's imagination to recreate which either have or will take place, and based on clues, testimony and evadence you also have the moral option of condeming or giving that person another chance even in light of the curcumstances of the crime they commited. Even the cases that where made up by the developers where every well done and worthy of A.C Doyle himself.

I have earlier played The testament of Sherlock Holmes and there are some differences between them. In Crimes & Punishments it's more like a crime case solving game where you find clues, interview people and have to decide which of the suspects are guilty based on what you have found. Every crime case is unique with their unique story. The game feels actually closer to L.A Noire on some points when it comes to this new gamestyle.\nIn the previous game, The testament of Sherlock Holmes, it was more like a linier puzzle solving adventure game.\n\nThe game is stable and I didn't have any bugs or issues with it. The only annoying was the lack of custom control. First time I started the game it wanted to use my gamepad as controller and I did not find any options to pick mouse & keyboard instead. I had to start the game with my gamepad unplugged to play with mouse & keyboard.\n\nThe only big downside in this game really is the lack of cases. 6 cases total and it took about 16 hours for me to complete. I did not rush through it nor skipped any content that could be skipped/fast-forwarded. For almost 40€ I think it should have been more cases to solve. I think 30€ would have been a more acceptable price.

But that's only for some, and they generally work out much like Doyle's short stories - varied, complex, and often incredibly surprising.\n\nThe world is richly showcased, with the player being easily drawn into the 19th century London locales, and the superb writing and voice-acting only help to cement this achievement. The system of gathering clues and putting them to use in a logic system is improved, perfected, and now stands as a testament of what investigation/adventure games ought to go for. Varied choices, conclusions, and consequences.\n\nIt is here that my one complaint of the game comes up - it holds your hand, often a tad too much. Items and locations that have a deeper meaning are immediately noted as such when you spot them, meaning that if you didn't use them, you *know* that something was missed.\n\nAnd yet, considering that certain game paths don't open at all unless you reach them as a logical conclusion, I still bow in thanks for the experience.","February 7, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It does a really great job making you feel like a detective, namely Sherlock Holmes of course, and its focus on exploration, dialogue, and deduction really enhance the feeling. It genuinely feels like you're playing a Sherlock Holmes story. Unlike many other games that have tried this game does not hold your hand and you can actually completely screw up and make the wrong verdict on a case. The majority of the puzzles make logical sense and fit with the investigation, though there are some pretty awful QTE segments and a few bad puzzles though they can be skipped. The game has long loading times, but this alleviated some by being able to review your casebook during it.  Despite any flaws Crime and Punishments is a damn fine game and what other adventure games should strive to be. I'm really looking forward to what Frogwares does from here. Highly recommended for detective story/Sherlock Holmes and adventure game fans.","April 10, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Noire\n- The deduction system in the game makes this game (and this is no exaggeration) the BEST detective game EVER MADE because you actually have to solve the case.

The games have 6 cases for you to solve. Some of them do feel alot simple compared to the others, but they are quite original and enjoyable. The puzzles in this game as would say our friend Holmes are quite "elementary", so for someone who has played the previous games may find them to be easy, but someone new to the serie might find them difficult at time. Sadly, some of the puzzles felt repetitive. Visually the game is beautiful, the visual expression and the details of the characters are amazing, the environment of the places you discover are well detailed and they are worth exploring. The controls are clunky at times, especially when your are walking in smalls corridors because Dr.Watson can block your way back since he is following you most of the time. Overall Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is a game worth buying for fans of the serie or those who wants to get into Dectective/Puzzle games.

Though not as challenging as previously in the Frogwares series of Sherlock Holmes games, it provided me with a thrilling story, beautiful visuals, and relatively relatable motives and characters. This game is able to trick you into thinking that you're a master detective, and even if I've realized it was all a ruse, I can still appreciate being given a little bit of my childhood dream. The puzzles are somewhat less puzzling, and the deduction portion is exponentially simpler than in Testament, I believe that it was well worth my friends money, and I will continue to enjoy solving the crimes in different ways for a long time to come.","December 31, 2014","true","13.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The mysteries that are present are excellent, but are some what linear in the way you must gather evidence and search for clues. What prevents this game though from becoming a visual novel in my opinion, however, is the fact that not only can you reach the wrong conclusion with the clues you gather, but you are presented with a moral choice to make about how to handle the culprit/culprits you accuse. This mechanic is not only well used, but it is probably one of the few times I have felt that my choices really did matter instead of just pretending to matter. Several of the choices I ended up making or doing over have left me some serious impressions in how games like TWAU, Mass Effect, and other titles should use the idea of choice driven stories when designing their games.\n\n\nThe atmosphere that this game also presents is very compelling. They keep true to the feel and style of the books, while still drawing from more modern interepatations, such as the floating words that shows the wheels turning in Sherlock's head that the new BBC show uses. The voice acting, for the most part, is solid, and I enjoyed these mysteries. However, there are a few bug and game glitches, and some people may be put off on the idea that the gameplay is somewhat for a more casual audience on top of the fact that there are only 6 mysteries for a 40 dollar price tag. Also, the loading screens are horrendous, often taking a consdisidarable amount of time, even on a a higher end pc, though your milage might vary. They try to counteract this problem of waiting around, (which is something you most likely will have to do fairly often) by allowing you to review your case notes, but often either freezes the game, or flatout causes it to crash.\n\n\nMy final thoughts would be that if you are looking for style over substance, this game is certainly that, though there is still a decent amount of meat to the game. If you are looking for a game that is more focused on letting you explore a story and trying to solve crimes and an interesting atmosphere, and not for steller gameplay, then I would very much recommend Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments.","January 2, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I consider him to be one of the greatest fictional characters ever written and in many ways he was a significant role model to me, as I grew up. I have read all of the Conan Doyle stories (including the ones that were of admittedly lesser quality).\n\nAs with Frogwares' previous efforts, the love of Conan Doyle's stories shines through. As with The Testament of Sherlock Holmes (which I enoyed) there are references galore. For a fan like me, the lovingly crafted art design and atmosphere cannot help but bring a large apprieciative smile.\n\nHowever, while I enjoyed Testament as well, Crimes & Punishment is a much stronger game. The gameplay is smoother and less clunky.\n\nYou will take on the role of Sherlock Holmes in investigating six distinct cases, many of which are references to Conan Doyle's stories. The way in which you go about gathering clues and connecting them is undoubtedly the game's greatest asset. Especially since it--to an extent, allows you to form your own theories and make conclusions based on the evidence that are not necessarily correct.\n\nEach case features several different possible endings and outcomes, and even if you miss the "official" outcome, the one you have chosen may well prove equally satisfying. It is done very well and most of the time it feels true to Holmes' character, which I feel is the highest compliment I can give to the game.\n\nIf you are a Holmes fan like myself, I would consider this to be a must buy. It has been one of the most enjoyable games of 2014 for me. Even if you are not--but possess an appreciation for narratively driven games or crime thrillers, I can confidently recommend it.\n\nI very much look forward to seeing what Frogwares has in store for Sherlock Holmes in the future.\n\n"The game is afoot"","January 2, 2015","true","15.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When I saw this game, I decided to trust it one more time,and it completerly surprised me. I used 15hrs to finish all six cases. Although I don't know how long it takes to finish for other players(i think 15hrs will be better than most of others), I really enjoyed the game because of its fantanstic graphics and some interesting detecting skills which Holmes uses. The price of this game is a little bit expensive,so I know when you will be confused whether you should buy it or not, here is my advice---you don't need to be worried, you can just buy it when it's discounted, like around $20 or $30. Truly, $5 for each case is not a bad deal. I are sure you will love it.","December 7, 2014","true","40.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","1"

The developer can use any engine and it will be still a ♥♥♥♥. Because of that I would recommend for the team to hire the proper division of the programmers and the designers. Apparently the hungry students can't do much. This game shouldn't be in the price line as an AAA product. The above average indie product at most.\n\nDespite the fact, I'm afraid you will not be able to find on the market another game with a such good written dialogues.

Not a single bug. Great content. Adequate technology. I want more, more, more!\n\nReady to dive into and explore your own corrupted self and eccentricity? Look no further!\n\nSix cases of varying complexity are waiting for you to be investigated in this game, which involve premeditated homicide, manslaughter, theft, betrayal, false accusations, extortion, bribery, as well as cases of plain self-defense, suicide attempts and planned and unplanned post crime cover-ups, all that spiced with a good deal of deception and despair coming from all sides.\n\nYou will have to collect clues at the crime scenes, interrogate victims and witnesses, make experiments, even conduct a post-mortem examination and re-enact different possible progressions of events. The game is freshly designed without any need for pen and paper to master the complexities of the cases and without any repititive save-and-load-game-chores in the more difficult situations, which are usually involved in this type of game. Instead a British bloodhound is at your service, when needed, not forgetting Dr Waton's energetic support in any time of need.\n\nYou think you would realize when people lie straight to your face? You like to condemn people to the gallows, without having unmistakable evidence, or do you prefer to put the reliability of your thinking to a test? Maybe you're even not endorsing the death sentence out of categorical or philosophical considerations? The cases are too complex for just guessing and the game offers a really nifty interface apart from the authentic british weather and furniture atmopshere created by the Unreal engine during gameplay, not only to review all collected evidence, support material and relevant dialogues, but also to rethink the countless possibilities of "what-ifs?" involved in the deductions in a systematic and comprehensible way.\n\nWith all this freedom and your foreknowledge, that you accumulate by working on the cases, also comes the responsibility for selecting which information you will forward to Lestrade and the Yard and which parts you rather keep to yourself and Dr Watson. Even with your deductions executed flawlessly, the evidence rarely gets unmistakable and there's always still room for interpretation, afterthoughts or last moment surprises. Even if you get a confession from an alleged culprit, there might still be lies involved and you will need to handle probabilities just as well as you need to handle undeniable facts versus uncertainties.\n\nPlaying this game is like reading six really well written and highly diversified "whodunit" crime novels in a row, while not only being given the opportunity to engage in the process of deduction yourself, but here you will have to also justify the decisions in front of yourself, because they will affect the continued fate of the culprits, other people involved and your reputation as Sherlock Holmes. You will have to make those decisions, that are usually a given in crime novels or simpler games, that will ultimately climax in the revelations of the cases coming to their finale. Are you worthy to call yourself Sherlock Holmes? I remember well the sweat on my brow, when I had to make these decisions while playing this game to its end.\n\nAs far as I remember Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels, which I've read as a young lad, the game is fully respecting the heritage of this great author in its entire variety and is a valid advancement in matters of crime fiction as a genre on its own.\n\nI had 36 hours of wonderful gameplay with this title. I'm very thankful for the good design, the obviously highly accurate quality assurance during production and I can only wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone interested.\n\nI wasn't playing any computer games for about twelve years at all, and I had a single spot in the game, where I was just too stupid and not persistent enough, failing to acquire a single specific clue. There is an official walkthrough available in text form, the discussions on Steam for your guilt ridden or still puzzled afterthoughts, as well as countless videos on YouTube, which you can consult in the case you would ever get stuck in this fine game. But when you're taking the time the game is asking for, no help at all should be required to solve the cases.\n\nEDIT: This is a very subjective review of my own experience playing this game. If you prefer a more objective and concise review I recommend this review by user "ros": http://steamcommunity.com/id/ros1981/recommended/241260/\n\nI fully endorse the review of user "ros" and just marked it as helpful. It's the most accurate I've read so far, based on finishing the game myself. I find this review much better written than my own, because it is not as subjective as mine and both more concise and more accurately describing the few potential downsides of the game, which I perceived in a similar way, but didn't mention in my review - just because I found them irrelevant to me personally. However, with the responsibility of writing a review for other Steam users, it's of course better, more credible and finally more objective mentioning them accurately and without judging them, like it's done here so well, in order to prevent potential disappointment due to unfounded expectations or personal preferences. However, many press reviews I've read about it previous to my own purchase I found quite inaccurate and biased. The "video walkthroughs" user ros mentions in the beginning of his review can be found on the well known video platforms of the Internet without problems and also finally convinced me that this game is worth a try, which I don't regret and still think give a valid impression of the game experience, while of course are being spoilers, too. Accolades where accolades are due! Again, a great game! Just bought it another time, this time as a gift.\n\nHowever, let me clarify the following differences/additions I have to the review of user "ros":\n\n1. No save games: they aren't needed, due to game design, hard to understand, huh? Agreed. Well, you'll see you won't need them. Still they can be found easily in the filesystem as a file (PC).\n\n2. very little challenge in deductions: the clues you find do not let you make unmistakable deductions, the sheer mass of clues found I consider quite challenging and comparable to a written novel and the deductions themselves are not the difficult part, but deciding which of them are probably the correct ones is the brain-teaser! Managing the sheer mass of clues is well implemented in the game.\n\nTo put the last part into other words: you can miss clues by not exploring the crime scenes enough and by not talking thoroughly enough to the crime NPCs involved (witnesses, potential culprits, ...), which then can lead you to false conclusions.. I found that to be quite an additional challenge to the decisions which of the deductions are the correct ones and that is what this game is about for me.\n\nThe minigames or puzzles might indeed not very challenging, as user "ros" is telling, however they can all be skipped, when you don't like them. I skipped some of them, because they're really not what I was looking for originally, but I also didn't find them disturbing or too easy.","December 3, 2014","true","36.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The graphics look really nice with detailed backgrounds and plenty of figures populating them. The developers really did a lovely job of bringing Victorian London to life. The voice overs are also quite good.\n\nThe game does a good job of making you feel like you are a detective. The puzzles are perhaps a little simple (opening locks, finding patterns, mixing reagents, etc.) but the cases themselves require some thought and have several possible outcomes, including accusing an innocent suspect. The cases run in a faily linear fashion. You usually have one or two tasks to complete at any one time and the game triggers new events and offers new tasks when you've completed the previous ones. As the detective you do control which sites you (re)visit and what evidence and clues you want to collect before talking with the witnesses and suspects. The game then lets you connect the clues in a map until you arrive at a suspect to accuse. Successfully connecting clues also opens up new tasks and associated puzzles or minigames. A very nice touch is how you can look at the people in detail and pick up on the hints Holmes needs so he can deduce things about the person. The detailed character models really shine here.\n\nIf you enjoy adventure games and light puzzling, then this is the game for you.","November 27, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you like Sherlock Holmes's fictional character (books) you will like the game. If you never read a book, you will start to read one after this game.\n\n---------------\nVery nice detective experience. I agree with some other reviewers: best detective experience after L.A. Noire. I would not count The Vanishing of Ethan Carter because it was in my opinion more focused on exploration rather than case solving....\n\nThis sherlock holmes offers very nice graphics, incredibly suited humour, challenges cases to solve, and almost perfect gameplay mechanics (the whole synapse - case solving - crackfest).\n\nHow the unreal engine performs in this game is splendid. You can find its limits (facial expression in primis) but the game is super smooth with enough graphic settings to satisfy a PC gamer. It runs ok in ultrawide although you can't make the FOV really high but is not needed, it is high enough.\n\nTo be honest some cases are weird: the solution (the game tells which solution is the real right one) is not what you expect it to be rationally, and would rather be a little too exaggerated, too impossible in real life. Only one case I found like this though. The other cases may appear weird as well to some players but that is only because they didn't find or interprete enough clues. Everything makes sense in this game.\n\nHere some screens from the game:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/rogermorse/screenshots/?appid=241260&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall","October 29, 2015","true","15.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcanelight/recommended/241260/","arcanelight","abe.austin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcanelight/","292 products in account","Let me just start off by saying this is one of the best mystery games I've played, comparable to the likes of L. A. Noire.  As such, I do recommend it...but I must mention that I do so with reservations.\n\nPros:\n>Atmosphere: Every case takes place in vastly diverse settings and each one is a piece of high quality design and detail. Whether on the London streets, in a mansion, or traveling along the railway, each and every one breathes late-19th century Britain and the world feels authentic and lived in. Little nuances like walking down a street and realizing that the pub window you just walked by is actually looking into a fully rendered and populated room gives a reality that few games achieve.\n>Gameplay: The game is divided into 6 intriguing cases. For each one you will find yourself doing the typical Holmes-esque activities of questioning witnesses, scouring scenes for clues, looking for tell-tale signs on individuals to determine their pasts, testing materials in your laboratory, and just being an all-around super sleuth. There are a variety of minigames to open locks, wrestle with opponents, and piece together clues. These can be skipped if wanted, but they aren't too difficult and they provide a pleasant change of scene. The game is very smart in how it allows you to access your case book during its loading sequences, allowing even its "down time" to be busy getting each piece properly fitted into the developing puzzle.\n>Writing/Acting: Much of the writing is directly from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's richly-crafted short stories and the lines that aren't fit in perfectly with the rest to make a cohesive and engrossing narrative. The characters are all distinct from one another and brought to life by the talented actors portraying them. There are the occasional awkward elements but they are not the norm and are easily forgiven.\n\nCons:\n>Conclusions. The journey is so excellent that it makes the lackluster conclusions at the end stick out like a sore thumb. You're progressing along, pairing clues together to make deductions, the whole picture starts coming together and you think you finally have some solid theories. At this point you, like any self-respecting investigator, you'll probably want to formulate a couple tests that will systematically prove or disprove the validity of each theory until only the true one remains. That would be the logical and scientific thing to do, which is what Sherlock Holmes is all about after all. But no. At this point the game artificially cuts you short, tells you that there is nothing more you can do, and you simply have to guess between the valid conclusions. Occasionally there was a case where only one answer made use of ALL the acquired evidence, but more often than not the ending was completely (and intentionally) ambiguous. In L. A. Noire this sort of uncertainty played directly into the theme of harsh realities in investigations that it was trying to convey, but it's not fitting here where you are meant to be the great Sherlock Holmes. Honestly I finished these levels feeling like a cheat, as if Sherlock had no idea of the truth, but had simply gotten good at spinning yarns that will convince people to believe in his random guesswork.\n>Loading. The game takes a long time to load the settings and it does a lot of it. You'll frequently have to travel back and forth between areas and every time you do you'll have to sit through a lengthy loading sequence. To make matters worse, often you'll load an area just to have another loading screen, this one to prepare a cutscene for that location.\n\nIn conclusion, this Sherlock Holmes game is flawed, but it wasn't such as to ruin my entire experience. Frogwares has absolutely nailed atmosphere, faithful recreation of Doyle's stories, and basic gameplay. I have high hopes that in their next outing they can rectify its few (but serious) remaining issues for a truly sublime experience.","January 3, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You can construct your own Holme's "train of thought" and come to a decision. Will you accuse a seemingly innocent person, or the definitely-he's-the-bad-guy fellow? Will you arrest them, or choose to let them go? While this may sound empowering, out of the  6 cases, only 2 give that "uncertain" vibe. The rest were dead giveaways and pretty easy. I really wish the game would be longer, adding more cases and varying the mini-games, that would really justify the price.\n\nAside from the wonky running physics, character design and overall look was a delight.

SH:C&P consists of six separate cases, each taking approximately two hours or thereabouts. Two of these cases, namely, Black Peter and Abbey Grange are from the original Holmesian canon and if you are a `loyalist`, so to speak, you may follow the same line of reasoning in the original stories.\n\nSH:C&P, however, has no `wrong` paths in the game - each story features multiple leads and these are supported by various types of evidence. When you observe a fact, it is displayed on your `Deduction Board` which, this time, is an image of myriad neurons and nodes in Holmes` brain (presumably). Everytime you come up with a piece of information, there are two deductions you may derive from it, which in turn corresponds to other such deductions. Furthermore, in the end of each case, you are asked to decide whether you`d arrest or absolve the culprits. When looked at the right light, each case has an equal weight about such actions and thus, there are no clear-cut moral choices. This translates into a good deal of replayability.\n\nSH:C&P gameplay consists of 1st / 3rd person navigation as well as `sixth sense` type of perception, which highlights various clues around Sherlock Holmes. A good deal of the game revolves around dialogues, which may become more resourceful if you manage to collect more clues pertaining to your interlocutor.\n\nOne rule-of-thumb may be using the portrait icon below the dialogue options before starting an interview. This allows the player to observe the interviewee and pick up on various details upon their person, such as missing buttons, dirty fingernails and other such details that Sherlock Holmes is known to be attentive about. The benefit of this becomes apparent in the Quick Time Events (QTEs) in dialogues - if a character makes a statement about which you have a rebuttal (e.g. catching their lies etc.) your prior observations may provide the correct answer.\n\nOccasionally, Holmes is required to conjure a setting, in which he imagiens how a certain chain of events has occurred. This works similar to the sixth sense feature and one needs to reconstruct the chain of events by following the possible routes in the scene at hand.\n\nOverall, the game is remarkable in its design, setting and challenges. The only drawback is perhaps its rather disappointing length. However considering the replayability it offers, this can easily be disregarded.\n\n9 / 10","December 20, 2015","true","28.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story is very loose, it's basically just six unrelated crimes that Sherlock Holmes sets about solving for various different reasons, but that allows you to just concentrate on the actual fun of solving the crimes instead of worrying about what little plot there is.  Each crime is well constructed and allows you a lot of leeway in terms of how you go about solving it, and plenty of freedom to make all the wrong choices/deductions/conclusions etc.\n\nThe biggest downside is probably the frequent dashing back and forth between locations, necessitating loading screens of Holmes and Watson sitting reading in their carriage.  You can review the crimes during this period but I imagine most players would probably just sit waiting for the "click to continue" button.\n\nAt the end of each case you can replay it and see how things could have worked out different based on making different deductions from the clues you gather.  While there is always a "correct" answer, you get freedom in what you do with that information, and one of the funnest parts of the game is agonizing over whether to condemn a suspect, let them get away with it, or do your best to reduce the severity of their punishment.\n\nA very fun game, very recommended.","March 14","true","12.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is, by far, one of the best I've ever encountered. It's seamlessly designed, beautifully crafted, amusing, intriguing, and unique. So, full and absolute recommendation.\n\nThe true moment where this game shines above all other Sherlock-ian homages is in the final moments of each case. Once you've collected all the evidence and pieced together the puzzle, you're presented with multiple "conclusions," that is, multiple theories of the crime that can fit the facts and evidence. While collecting all the evidence isn't too difficult, figuring out which theory is correct relies entirely on the player interpreting the facts, leaving you, and you alone, to make that final decision.\n\nWhat's more, even once you've made your decision, you're given yet another choice: how will you close the case? And here, there's no correct, or incorrect, answer, leaving the ending of each story entirely up to the player, dependent on what you believe is the appropriate moral choice.\n\nThe combination of strict deductive methods and a very true-to-the-source portrayal of Holmes with this moral ambiguity actually got me to care about what I was doing in the game, to pay attention to the dialogue and plots moreso than just to solve the case. That, to me, is the best win a mystery series could accomplish.\n\nHowever - PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT BELOW -\n\n- NO REALLY THIS MAY RUIN A REVEAL FOR YOU -\n\n- LAST CHANCE -\n\nI have one caveat, concerning one, single scene, which happens to be the penultimate scene of the game and not actually associated with any of the individual cases.\n\nThere's ... some attempt at an overarching plot thread that lurks in the background of the cases and cumulates in a final confrontation after the last case is solved. You end up sitting through a cutscene that involves a militant revolutionary group explaining their motivations, which is very anti-aristocracy. If you lean left, you might call it a group of Victorian-era "99%" protesters. If you lean right, you might call them communist terrorists.\n\nEither way it comes across as more than a little preachy, especially since, no matter what option you pick, you can't actually arrest them. (I could be wrong, because I haven't replayed the game with every alternate moral choice path to see if being a hard case could change that last scene, but I highly doubt it would. If you can arrest them, it's still weird, though, see below.) It's not because the game forces you to sympathize with them: it's stated, if you decide against the group, that Holmes lets them go because he's irritated at the person who needs to deal with them. Still, the fact that you sit through the leader's heated defense of his cause and then can't have them all arrested, and the wording choice in the final scene, indicates a very strong political preference on the part of the game designers.\n\nNormally I would shrug and move on. It's their game; if I had fun playing it, and was engaged by the story, then a political or philosophical message is just an interesting element of the experience. The problem here is that the rest of the game is SO very wonderful by comparison, and so very well crafted to give the player that control over moral choice. Being given this ultimate choice that doesn't really represent a moral choice undermined the entire system.\n\nMorover, Holmes is a very anti-political character. Anyone who's read the original stories will tell you that Holmes is the kind of man who has memorized the law and lives by it, and doesn't give a damn about politics. Much as modern interpretations might give him depth of feelings or awarenesses, the classic Holmes, which this game was trying very much to emulate, would never allow a group of people who admitted to planning and organizing a large-scale violent act to flee in order to potentially commit more violent crimes.\n\nFINAL VERDICT -\n\nFantastic game that I loved deeply and could not stop playing, though I really wish the last two scenes just didn't exist because they kind of ruin it.","August 8, 2015","true","12.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In this game you can ONLY open the same locks and no more puzzles!!!!!\n- Secondly when you need to search documents in encyclopedia you need just read title and NO more.For example in " SH: Nemesis" you need to guess ciphered in the name of book riddle and then you`ll can find the right book.\n-Thirdly in this game you can investigate 6 different crimes and they really short.I got used to long story and it`s very good and interesting but here...\n-Fourthly. Watson is very useless in this game.It`s really unright. He is doctor and he has piece of knowledge of Sherlock Holmes and he use nothing at all.\n-The next problem. You always have the list of tasks and you know what you need to do everywhere and everytime. It makes game very very easy.\nAbout advantages.\n+Graphics looks nice but could be better.\n+The piece of the last crime is good because it`s connected with "SH:Jack the Ripper" and i remembered about good time in that game.\nMy opinion 7/10.

The Testaments of Sherlock Holmes had a more of an adventure/puzzle feel while this one had a detective/adventure feel. The cases had a lot of areas where you can explore and find things that could be relevant to the case or irrelevant which makes the game amazing as a detective game, where you could overlook some very important clues and miss a possibility. There are many choices that you can make in your deductions and it requires thinking and retracing what you saw when you visited certain areas. After solving a case you can hit spacebar and find out if you were right or wrong and shows how many other players that solved the case like you did which I think it's fantastic.

Поэтому читая данную рецензию, не стоит считать , что она даст вам глубокие познания.\nЕсли вы фанат Шерлока Холмса, вам стоит поиграть в Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments , только лишь ради раскрытия преступлений и проверки своих навыков и элементарного мышления. Наблюдать за поведением персонажей довольно скучно - они не эмоциональны,  а вот геймплей и стилистика соответствует жанру. Несмотря на небольшое кол-во дел, нам придется поломать голову, если вы конечно не откроете сайт с прохождением. Игра показалась мне неоднотипной и нешаблонной. Она стоит своих денег. Игра расчитана на одно прохождение, но оно сделано в расчете на ваши дейсвия и умозаключения. В конце каждого дела игра дает вам характеристику вашего расследования . Это хорошая авторская задумка, расчитнная на честных игроков. Общего сюжета как единого целого нет.\nВ конце вы ожидаете прочитать общий итог, но нет, чтобы судить о игре , нужно в нее поиграть.

For what the forums say it's almost completely arbitrary which systems experience crashes and which do not aside from some unsupported Intel HD graphics cards or some weird controller issues.\n\nAside from that the game is actually very enjoyable although that statement is highly subjective to be honest. At least if you are into detective games or a fan of Holmes, especially of the new movies (which Crimes and Punishemts orients itself to), the chances that you'll like this game are pretty high. The game looks good and even though it was developed with a controller in mind it plays quite well with mouse & keyboard BUT controlls are not rebindable, graphical options are very limited and not adjustable in-game. In fact you have to return to the main menu, go to the options menu, change whatever options you want changed and then manually restart the game. Dear devs, that's just lazy and unnessecary. Oh.. and the framerate is all over the place. Mostly stable at 60 but it drops frequently below 40 in some in-game menus, conversations and cutscenes which really puts you off.\n\nWhat really lets me not personally recommend this game though are the crashes. I experienced two in the first murder case. The first I could avoid by skipping the "mini-game" affected, the second though is not avoidable for me so far and prevents progression by continously crashing right after the interrogation of an important suspect. Therefore I am currently not able to provide more in-depth impressions.\n\nOnce they fix their unstable mess of an otherwise reasonably good game I will gladly rework my First Impressions but until that happens consider this a carefull warning.\nSherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments might or might not run on your system due to obviously bad optimizing. Even though I'm running this on a notebook my rig isn't all that exotic and I'm usually able to run even the most abysmal console ports as well as these things tend to run that is..\nMaybe worth mentioning is that there exist worakrounds for some crashes though the lack of specific error codes in my case makes troubleshooting kinda troublesome to say the least.\n\nSo long,\nMeVriS","January 5, 2015","false","1.5"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

In fact, after the loading screen, the game gives you a few more seconds of loading before you can finally play! You may find yourself waiting for a minute, then playing one, then waiting again. Loading is not just between scenes, but also every single time you initiate a dialogue or start a mini-game. While you may think that it won't be too bad, I can assure you that large parts of the game mainly feel like waiting for the loading screen to finish. I had to play games on my phone or Alt-Tab out of the game to browse the web. The waiting times completely break the immersion, especially as you are often forced the change scenes frequently.\n\nOverall, this game needs several more months of optimisation and bug fixing. I encountered several crashes and a game-breaking bug that forced me to replay a whole chapter. It is worth noting that you are not free to save anywhere, but are forced into an autosave system that will save the game even when a game-breaking bug has occured.\n\nSadly, the game sufferes from the addition of mini-games, apparently to extend game time. While you can skip them, you will miss the achievements associated with them. It may also be worth noting that several of the achievements force you into certain moral choices or force you to replay the whole game (unless you look up spoilers beforehand) just to get the achievement.","December 23, 2014","false","15.9"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","0"

The graphics, settings, and ambient music all help to immerse yourself into the story and world of Sherlock Holmes. The voice acting is also well done, in particular for Holmes and Watson.\n\nMy first complaint is with a core mechanic of the game; gathering and organizing clues. Often, gathering clues is relegated to simply clicking wherever the game will allow you to. For example, when scanning a person’s body/clothing for clues about their personality, you simply click wherever your cursor turns blue.\n\nSimilarly, organizing the information you get can be a “Click until you get it right” affair. For example, you pair pieces of evidence together to draw conclusions. You can simply click randomly over and over until the pieces match up. There is no logic or puzzle solving skills needed.\n\nHowever, as you begin gathering evidence, you will need to take that evidence you’ve been given and figure out whodunit.  This is, in my opinion, the best part of the game and where you really do feel like Sherlock Holmes. You put together different pieces of evidence to visually map out different possible conclusions. Evaluating all the evidence and figuring out what actually happened can be very engaging and rewarding.\n\nYou must also make moral choices. Are you sympathetic to the guilty party due to their circumstances? Do you let them go or force them to face the full wrath of the law? Like The  Walking Dead, the game will compare the logical and moral choices you make with other players.\n\nFor my fellow Sherlock Holmes fans, I’d definitely suggest picking this up. If you are into investigation games/books, I think it’s worth considering. However, if you aren’t a fan of the genre at all I don’t think that this game is going to change your mind.","September 29, 2014","true","7.1"," 18 of 45 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","18","45","0","1"

It feels like a watered-down, poor imitation of LA Noire, without the worldbuilding or possibility of failure. It is not possible to lose this game, and so every action feels - and is - meaningless. The scenery, character details and environments are beautiful. But the mechanics, writing, deductions, and flow are just...terrible.\n\nThe cases themselves are familiar and - with the exception of the Kew Gardens case - mind-numbingly dull. The amount of puzzle mini-games is vastly reduced, which is lucky, because when they do pop up, they feel clumsy and frustratingly pointless. Supposedly "ambiguous" conclusions are anything but; by the end of each investigation, you have been pointed almost irresistably toward the correct answer, and your moral choices have ZERO EFFECT on the game as a whole. Zero. This is not The Walking Dead Game, where your decisions will come back to haunt you. The wasted potential here is incredibly frustrating.\n\nBy far the worst aspect of the game are the interminable load times. If it takes you an hour to solve a case, at least 40 minutes of that hour will be spent staring at Holmes as he sits in his carriage, or trying vainly to distract yourself in his 'brain space' while you wait. This is made worse by the fact that the game loves nothing better than to send you back and forth to different locations to perform a single action, then back and forth again to analyze your results, and so on.\n\nMost disappointing of all is the utter laziness of the writing. The cases are entirely unconnected to each other. Writers, a few lines of dialogue scattered between opening sequences and then cooked into a baffling, completely irrelevent ending scene does not make for a satisfying conclusion. The final conversation before the end credits is just...what? Is it meant to foreshadow a future game? I'd rather have an explanation of what just occured in THIS one.\n\nAs much as I love the Sherlock Holmes stories in all their formats, this just wasn't enjoyable. If you're looking for something clever and diverting, the Testament of Sherlock Holmes was miles beyond this installment. Time to hire some new writers and raise your expectations, Frogware.

Unfortunately, there aren't enough combinations for how you can solve a case, which is limiting, and the game lacks the ability for conversations to go the wrong way, like in L.A. Noire. Everything is set out for you in this game.\n\nWhile it is kind of tempting to play through the game again to witness every morale decision, it's the kind of game which was boring halfway through, and due to how linear the game is, it provides very little replayability.","October 30, 2014","false","46.8"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"

This time Frogware opted to try its hand on the slightly more open ended investigations of LA Noire, where you can accuse any of the suspects, so long as you have a viable rationale. Parallel to this mechanic is the development of Holmes's morality, mirrored conveniently by his reading Dostoevsky's classic novel.\nWhile some puzzles are little more than interacting with the right item, the overall experience will still have its challenges.

Still, it's hard for me to imagine that there is any other game on the market that managed to capture the essence of Sr. Conan Doyle's story so well.\nThis game is not just another adventure game based on a famous franchise, nor is it a game of search and puzzle. It's more than that. It's a real detective game, in which you need to gather the clues and create the deductions to reach the conclusions, one of which is true.\nI wouldn't say that it's extremely challenging. After all, it's not too hard to reach at the right conclusion, if you manage to find all the clues and stay attentive. Besides, two of the six cases were taken straught out of the books, which makes them so much easier to solve. But does it subtract from the enjoyment? Not at all.\nYou also have some puzzles and mini-games as a welcome distraction from the process of gathering the clues.\nThe only complaint I have with the developers is that they used the same facial features for multiple characters, which may be a bit confusing for some. I guess, it was done due to the low budget.\nAll in all, a very welcome interpretation of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Highly recommended.","January 25, 2015","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What made this game stand out the most was the way you were actually compelled to see through Sherlock's eyes, a tactic that BBC's Sherlock uses by instead of Sherlock constantly telling us what he observes, we are given descriptive words next to clues and characters. This game also made a good use of the way players can connect clues and form their own opinions of who was responsible for the many cases and even what form of judgement to pass.\n\nThis game is perfect for those people that are sick of being tied down to the strict plot set by most detective/search games such as previous Sherlock Holmes or even Nancy Drew games. The players are given some level of freedom in deciding what certain clue associations mean and for some cases are given the option to sentance a person, without informing the player that there are more clues yet to be found. I actually found myself completely imersed in this game and was impressed with the graphics.\n\nThere were a few downsides to this game, mostly the overall plot. I understand that this game was to focus on smaller cases but at the same time the writers attempted to make us care about this underlying issue involving a group of anarchists who threatened Great Britian's stability. However the group was not referenced for me to pay much attention and when the group finally became of some importance to one of the cases. I couldnt have cared less.\n\nAnother downside was the third person view though the first person view was waaaay better than the previous games. The third person view was clunky and awkward and I actually got kind of dizzy playing through the first case in this view. The camera angles just didn't support the game very well.\n\nLastly, this is something that doesn't really affect the overall game experience but after I played through the game I couldn't help but feel what the point of having Watson was except to have someone to tag along, occasionally get in the way, and for one or two cases actually lend some form of assistance. In many cases and locations Watson would actually stand off to the side and would not follow Sherlock, which anyone playing the previous games would understand why (Watson is always behind Sherlock). However, what made the Sherlock Holmes mysteries and series so great was not only his view and how he solved cases but how Watson percieved Sherlock. It just felt like the one missing element.\n\n\n\n","December 25, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics, animations and voice acting have all improved considerably, which makes it feel like the player is participating in an interactive movie. The research into the furniture, clothes and technology of Victorian period is reflected in the superb models which contibute greatly to the sense of immersion. If you like Sherlock Holmes you can't fail to be impressed with these aspects of the game alone.\n\nThere are several new features in the game. The first is an analysis of persons appearance for clues, where you freeze time and run the game pointer over the surface of the person. Any clues will cause the game pointer to turn bright blue, when it does this, you click with it, and the clue is added to your notes. Holmes then magically produces a character portrait based on this evidence (which sometimes surprises the player).\n\nThe second is an increased sense of perception. Normally in a scene, all clues are highlighted with an icon, which you can click on and which adds the clue to your notes. If there is a clue you can't see, a prompt appears suggesting to turn on the heightend perception. You turn this one, then the invisble clue appears. You can then click on it, and the clue is added to your notes.\n\nThe third is imagination. Occasionally you are allowed to imagine something. On these occasions a prompt appears, suggesting to turn on the imagination. Then you see something that might have happened, which is added to your notes.\n\nFourthly, when interrogating a subject, you can interupt the answers with another question. Again, this happens in a pre-programmed way and the questions you can choose are restricted to a limited list.\n\nThere is also a clue pairing and deduction map mode, which allows you to put clues together to form mind map style deductions. You can rearrange this map to achieve different outcomes if you have enough clues, and these outcomes form the basis of your accusations.\n\nThe problem is that everything is too obvious and easy because the on-screen prompts and highlighted objects tell you what to do and when to do it. And just in case you did miss anything, there's a tasklist which tells you what you need to do next, even who you need to talk to.\n\nSo although this game appears to allow you more freedom than its predecessors, it is still a linear game. It would have helped if you could, in the options, choose to turn off the prompts and highlights. At least this would have made the linearity less obvious. Or perhaps a few more false leads, or red herring clues. Some freedom. But ultimately the gameplay is like an interactive movie with a limited number of pre-programmed outcomes.\n\nLA Noire had the same problem, but unlike LA Noire, this game does have a large living sandbox world to enjoy and explore. Although Crime and Punishments does allow you to jump freely to unlocked sandbox locations, those locations are still relatively small and lifeless, and once you have checked all the obvious clues there's nothing else to do there.\n\nLargely though, the presentation of Crime and Punishments is rich, realistic and enjoyable, and definielty recommended to fans of Holmes and Victorian times.","April 3, 2015","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still, it's hard for me to imagine that there is any other game on the market that managed to capture the essence of Sr. Conan Doyle's story so well.\nThis game is not just another adventure game based on a famous franchise, nor is it a game of search and puzzle. It's more than that. It's a real detective game, in which you need to gather the clues and create the deductions to reach the conclusions, one of which is true.\nI wouldn't say that it's extremely challenging. After all, it's not too hard to reach at the right conclusion, if you manage to find all the clues and stay attentive. Besides, two of the six cases were taken straught out of the books, which makes them so much easier to solve. But does it subtract from the enjoyment? Not at all.\nYou also have some puzzles and mini-games as a welcome distraction from the process of gathering the clues.\nThe only complaint I have with the developers is that they used the same facial features for multiple characters, which may be a bit confusing for some. I guess, it was done due to the low budget.\nAll in all, a very welcome interpretation of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Highly recommended.","January 25, 2015","true","20.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I usually don't like point-and-click adventures, but the genre is perfect for a detective stroy. the usual frustration of looking for that one stupid thing I need just to advance the story translates better in a game where the whole point is being observant and finding the elusive clue.\n\nThe setting is perfect. I can really get into being there in the stories. It makes me wish it were an open world I could just go adventure in, but the limited location sizes do help keep me focused on the task at hand.\n\nThe story line is the usual tangled-linear path of a point-and-click, but it really feels like you could make a bad decision every step of the way. There are lots of minigames, and they are easy enough to not be frustrating or inhibit the story, yet challenging enough that they don't seem entirely pointless.\n\nThe game is broken up into several shorter stories, which allows you to go from start to finish, and get a sense of accomplishment, without feeling like things are dragging on. The stories tend to follow the typical formula of a classic Holmes story as well (Think, "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," if you've read it), so they are familiar and enjoyable.\n\nIf you enjoy the writing of Arthur Conan Doyle, you will really enjoy this game.","June 12, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The meat and potatoes of this game is the deduction system where you combine relevant clues together to find inferences, which allow for 1 of 2 interpretations that ultimately lead to different conclusions for the case. Its an enjoyable mechanic that makes you think and is supplemented by the ability to do character profiles of the suspects (rather simple) and QTE counters when the suspect is lying about a point based on the evidence you have. There are also puzzles but only a few are tricky.\nIn terms of length, the game is fairly long for its type. Six cases, about 3-4 hours each. You get your money's worth.\nGraphically-speaking, this game is a definite improvement from its predecessors. I've played the older games and Frogware has come a long way. It still has its quirks- Watson was submerged halfway into the floor in one case and there are some occassional spelling errors in Sherlock's casebook.\n\nAs a whole, a great game for what it is. The individual cases work better than perhaps one overly long story found in previous games in the series.

I found myself fully engaged and as a Sherlock Holmes' fan, utterly delighted.\n\nPros: -Shorter cases. I enjoyed the longer cases in previous games, but felt the shorter cases were easier to wrap my mind around and get a complete sense of the whole mystery. It was also easier then to sift through evidence and come to a sound conclusion.\n-Getting to come to your own conclusion. In the previous games, Holmes guided you through. In these games, you ARE the detective. And you can get it wrong. It makes the game all that more intense since I know I can lose.\n-The ease of assessing information. The file system makes it easy to look over all the information you have gathered. The deduction board was is an ingenious way to put the clues together. You make links between different information and evidence to form conclusions and there can be multiple conclusions.\n-The mysteries are solvable. I do not like it when a mystery game's answer comes out of nowhere and you feel that you never had a chance to solve it. The mysteries in this game are all solvable. If you go over the clues, review evidence, reread dialogue and think about it, you can get the right answer. I got all but one of them correct. I had determined to go over all the evidence thoroughly before deciding on a final answer and that helped. But still, pressing the button to launch my conclusion always had me nervous! I looked back over all the evidence of the one mystery I solved incorrectly and realized what erroneous conclusions I had drawn.\n-In my opinion, the best addition is the morality choices. In Conan Doyle's stories, Holmes often makes moral decisions concerning the fate of the culprits. He does not consider himself necessarily bound by conventional law. The morality choices were an added layer that made the game all the more real and like the Holmes stories.\n-Two of the stories are Conan Doyle stories. They were modified a little, but not enough to take away Conan Doyle's original plots. I am a Conan Doyle fan and so enjoyed getting to play his own stories. One was an obscure enough story that I recognized it, but didn't remember much about it and so had to figure it out along with all the other mysteries. The other I knew very well and flew through the case, but it was still fun to be in the story.\n-The variety of the cases. Nothing was redundant. Each case was unique and completely held my interest.\n-Telescope easter egg. So funny.\n\nCons: -As someone who adores the Conan Doyle stories, I didn't like the characterization of Mycroft. It seems the thing these days in recreated Holmes stories and shows to make Sherlock and his brother antagonists. They just are not like this in Conan Doyle's stories. At one point, Sherlock tells Watson in one of the Conan Doyle stories that he has gone to Mycroft at times for help. And if Mycroft were to show up asking Sherlock for help, he would not be indifferent.\n-The characterizations of Watson and Holmes also suffer a little. Watson is turned more towards the bumbling idiot Watson. Sherlock is made more aloof and cold than in previous games.\n-In one of the mysteries, a clue is worded in such a way that it can lead the player to an incorrect conclusion. I decided to ignore the wording in light of other evidence and that led me to the right answer, but I was worried it would be incorrect because of the clue wording.\n-There is less freedom to explore your environment than in previous games.  The game boxes you into an area and if you wander to the edge throws the map in your face. That was a little off putting and reminded me I was playing a game. I would have rather Holmes had said something like, "There is nothing interesting over there."\n-Final screen.

So well constructed are the models that it comes as a shock when Sherlock's pet basset hound, Toby, is added as a mechanic in later cases and is modelled somewhat inexpertly, leaving him with a model that is merely good among a cast of great.\n\nThe "deduction" system that acts as part hint system, part progress meter and part inventory system for clues is a unique addition to the genera. It's fortunately flexible enough to allow you to follow the case in your own route, revealing enough information to grease the mechanics, without washing away all the challenge.\n\nThe imagination system is a rich concept that is tragically underutilized. This unique mechanic allows Sherlock to simulate events and see how they would fit the facts. The 2 or 3 times it's used to it's fullest effect, it's dead-on in terms of tone, style and function, but it's often not utilized, utilized only minimally, or outright replaced by other, similar, less well polished mechanics.\n\nsuffers a little bit from adventure game syndrome, but a lot less than many other games; there were only 3 places where I felt a puzzle was contrived for progress reasons or arbitrarily gated, and most of those could have been easily lamp-shaded away with some dialogue exposing the in-universe explanation.  The path based lock-picking mechanic is a bit weird, but it's nice to have something other then literal bumping or rotational hotspot systems, and it works with the narrative of Sherlock "deducting" the lock open.\n\nThere are some technical issues as well. One puzzle was simply impossible to complete due to a crash to desktop, and I’ve seen reports of others seeing similar issues with other puzzles. Fortunately, these aren't game-blocking, thanks to the developers including a no-guilt skip button on nearly every puzzle, acting as a pressure valve on frustrating puzzles (and the rare crashy sequence).\n\nthe major complaint that I have is that there is clearly a "right" answer to every case, but the cases are structured so many of the different solutions fit just as tightly. the discovery of the "right" solution in some of the cases is partially trial and error, and partially jumping on the train of thought of the designer; in one case, quite literally. I often felt less like a masterful Sherlock, and more bumbling Watson, when it came to wrapping the case, comparing two or three equally explanatory, equally comprehensive, and sometimes equally incomplete, explanations for the same set of facts and clues.\n\nof additional frustration, the punishment phase of every case includes a "moral choice" to absolve or punish the suspect. while there is no "right" answer, the choice is a false one, as which choice you make doesn't affect the ending of the case very much, but affects the epilogue substantially in non-obvious ways. the designers clearly had a "right" ending in mind and In a game all about the freedom to follow the clues and act upon the evidence, the decision to base the final ending upon unrelated choices from unrelated situations seems discordant and atonal.\n\nIn all, it's a highly polished, well built and interesting take on an area of culture that is largely absent from gaming.  At ~12 hours and ~US$30, it's well worth the little bit of frustration for the feeling of being the Great Sherlock Homes.","September 13, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are multiple endings to a case, which can hurt your head as it did me because real tatics would let you question a person more often and do a professional interview with a person and see if they cave. When you get to the end of a case and you must make a decesion. BUT, you can replay to the ending of a case which lets you pick a different guility party until you have it right.\nI reccomend this to someone who wants to do investigation for a future, not really a CoD person, and remember: It takes motive and opertunity to make a person break the law, not just one with the other.","September 22, 2015","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The writing is excellent, and each case will intrigue. The lack of a coherent overarching storyline is a tad disappointing, but that's simply not the focus of the game. It follows Sherlock Holmes doing what he does best - solving crimes and administering punishments.\n\nThe atmosphere and overall presentation are quite on point as well. Some of the animation can be stiff, but the overall attention to detail is commendable nonetheless. If someone has a limp, you can guarantee that they'll actually walk with a limp in the game. The texture and general location quality is also of note. While the game isn't taxing by any means, it looks gorgeous cranked up to maximum settings with detailed recreations of Ye Olde London. There isn't much music, but it's used to good effect when it pops up, and helps set a much darker tone and feeling than most Sherlock Holmes properties.\n\nFinally, the detective and puzzle gameplay itself. It's quite good! The puzzles never become extraordinarily difficult, but they strike a nice balance between needing actual thought and not being so complex as to slow down the pace of the story. There's good variety here, as well, with a number of small, mini-game esque challenges to beat (though they can be skipped if that's not your thing), interrogations, autopsies, crime reconstructions and even a few notable sequences of trying to rebuild the sequence of events in Holmes' imagination. You won't need a membership in Mensa to make progress here, but it will challenge just enough to make you feel like Sherlock Holmes himself. Ultimately, given that the game has his name on it, that's probably the biggest praise I can give this.","September 23, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I usually don't like point-and-click adventures, but the genre is perfect for a detective stroy. the usual frustration of looking for that one stupid thing I need just to advance the story translates better in a game where the whole point is being observant and finding the elusive clue.\n\nThe setting is perfect. I can really get into being there in the stories. It makes me wish it were an open world I could just go adventure in, but the limited location sizes do help keep me focused on the task at hand.\n\nThe story line is the usual tangled-linear path of a point-and-click, but it really feels like you could make a bad decision every step of the way. There are lots of minigames, and they are easy enough to not be frustrating or inhibit the story, yet challenging enough that they don't seem entirely pointless.\n\nThe game is broken up into several shorter stories, which allows you to go from start to finish, and get a sense of accomplishment, without feeling like things are dragging on. The stories tend to follow the typical formula of a classic Holmes story as well (Think, "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," if you've read it), so they are familiar and enjoyable.\n\nIf you enjoy the writing of Arthur Conan Doyle, you will really enjoy this game.","June 12, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It really does make you think without letting you reach your conclusions too far ahead. It also shows you what % of your fellow gamers reached the same conclusion.\n\nFor those inclined to actual puzzles, there are ad hoc puzzles sprinkled throughout each case like lockpicking, which you can try to solve or mercifully skip when your brain is tired.\n\nThese developers deserve a shot at an LA Noire-sized production.

So well constructed are the models that it comes as a shock when Sherlock's pet basset hound, Toby, is added as a mechanic in later cases and is modelled somewhat inexpertly, leaving him with a model that is merely good among a cast of great.\n\nThe "deduction" system that acts as part hint system, part progress meter and part inventory system for clues is a unique addition to the genera. It's fortunately flexible enough to allow you to follow the case in your own route, revealing enough information to grease the mechanics, without washing away all the challenge.\n\nThe imagination system is a rich concept that is tragically underutilized. This unique mechanic allows Sherlock to simulate events and see how they would fit the facts. The 2 or 3 times it's used to it's fullest effect, it's dead-on in terms of tone, style and function, but it's often not utilized, utilized only minimally, or outright replaced by other, similar, less well polished mechanics.\n\nsuffers a little bit from adventure game syndrome, but a lot less than many other games; there were only 3 places where I felt a puzzle was contrived for progress reasons or arbitrarily gated, and most of those could have been easily lamp-shaded away with some dialogue exposing the in-universe explanation.  The path based lock-picking mechanic is a bit weird, but it's nice to have something other then literal bumping or rotational hotspot systems, and it works with the narrative of Sherlock "deducting" the lock open.\n\nThere are some technical issues as well. One puzzle was simply impossible to complete due to a crash to desktop, and I’ve seen reports of others seeing similar issues with other puzzles. Fortunately, these aren't game-blocking, thanks to the developers including a no-guilt skip button on nearly every puzzle, acting as a pressure valve on frustrating puzzles (and the rare crashy sequence).\n\nthe major complaint that I have is that there is clearly a "right" answer to every case, but the cases are structured so many of the different solutions fit just as tightly. the discovery of the "right" solution in some of the cases is partially trial and error, and partially jumping on the train of thought of the designer; in one case, quite literally. I often felt less like a masterful Sherlock, and more bumbling Watson, when it came to wrapping the case, comparing two or three equally explanatory, equally comprehensive, and sometimes equally incomplete, explanations for the same set of facts and clues.\n\nof additional frustration, the punishment phase of every case includes a "moral choice" to absolve or punish the suspect. while there is no "right" answer, the choice is a false one, as which choice you make doesn't affect the ending of the case very much, but affects the epilogue substantially in non-obvious ways. the designers clearly had a "right" ending in mind and In a game all about the freedom to follow the clues and act upon the evidence, the decision to base the final ending upon unrelated choices from unrelated situations seems discordant and atonal.\n\nIn all, it's a highly polished, well built and interesting take on an area of culture that is largely absent from gaming.  At ~12 hours and ~US$30, it's well worth the little bit of frustration for the feeling of being the Great Sherlock Homes.","September 13, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is almost always the same experience: The games start great! You immediately find yourself at an enigmatic crime scene and get excited with all the newly added features and enhanced graphics and fall in love with the game within the first few minutes. However, Frogwares always successfully manages to let you down with a combination of inconsistencies in the plot, idiotic puzzles and graphical glitches. Fortunately Crimes and Punishments has a reasonably low number of these issues which makes it the least disappointing game in the series so far.\n\nCrimes and Punishments has a different structure compared to the previous Sherlock Holmes games. It consists of 6 different cases with different possible endings. Two of the cases are from the original series and are very nicely implemented. For each case you need to collect some evidence and make conclusions based on your discoveries. The main problem with the story is that in most of these cases there is not much that you can do wrong, in other words, as long as you click on every object that you stumble upon and don't miss any evidence, it is always pretty obvious who the criminal is. This makes the alternate endings of each case superfluous and lowers the replay value of the game.\n\nBoth story and gameplay do not allow you to be very creative. There are two new vision modes added to the game. One allows Sherlock to notice subtleties that other people might miss and the other allows him to use his imagination and go back in time at the crime scene. These are supposed to be game-changing innovations that take the game to the "next-level", but they fail to elevate from a mere visual effect that you need to turn on every time the game asks you to do so. The problem is that the game will automatically tell you when you need to use your powers. If the vision icons are not on the left corner of the screen, you will know that you are not going to discover anything new by using your vision modes anyway. So every time you use these abilities it feels like you are following orders instead of being smart. This might have been acceptable if you could turn these "hints" off, or if this was an action FPS game, but in the adventure world you need to allow the players to be adventurous.\n\nThere are a few technical issues in the game, such as long and unnecessary loading screens, Watson getting in your way in small rooms or corridors and etc. which could have been easily avoided but I think the amazing graphics and sound acting make up for these annoying bugs and make the overall gameplay experience enjoyable. If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan I absolutely recommend this game, but I would wait for it to go on sale first.\n","October 18, 2015","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/immortalbeaver/recommended/241260/","immortalbeaver","Immortal Beaver","http://steamcommunity.com/id/immortalbeaver/","578 products in account","Simply put, Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is one of the finer adventure/crime solving games I've played. The writing is excellent, and each case will intrigue. The lack of a coherent overarching storyline is a tad disappointing, but that's simply not the focus of the game. It follows Sherlock Holmes doing what he does best - solving crimes and administering punishments.\n\nThe atmosphere and overall presentation are quite on point as well. Some of the animation can be stiff, but the overall attention to detail is commendable nonetheless. If someone has a limp, you can guarantee that they'll actually walk with a limp in the game. The texture and general location quality is also of note. While the game isn't taxing by any means, it looks gorgeous cranked up to maximum settings with detailed recreations of Ye Olde London. There isn't much music, but it's used to good effect when it pops up, and helps set a much darker tone and feeling than most Sherlock Holmes properties.\n\nFinally, the detective and puzzle gameplay itself. It's quite good! The puzzles never become extraordinarily difficult, but they strike a nice balance between needing actual thought and not being so complex as to slow down the pace of the story. There's good variety here, as well, with a number of small, mini-game esque challenges to beat (though they can be skipped if that's not your thing), interrogations, autopsies, crime reconstructions and even a few notable sequences of trying to rebuild the sequence of events in Holmes' imagination. You won't need a membership in Mensa to make progress here, but it will challenge just enough to make you feel like Sherlock Holmes himself. Ultimately, given that the game has his name on it, that's probably the biggest praise I can give this.","September 23, 2015","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The deduction system which allows for multiple conclusions gives the game great depth in comparison to the previous installations.

The voice acting is a lot better this time around, but it's nothing exceptional.\n\nThe only issue I have with Crimes and Punishments is its longevity, as a full completion of the game clocks at about 15 hours if played slowly, with a total of 6 great cases of varied difficulty.\n\nWould I like to play more?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/241260/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishment is the latest chapter of Sherlock Holmes Games from Frogware, and they are slowly perfecting the formula and seems they are closer than ever. Playing as Sherlock Holmes, you will tackle six different cases, some from the classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories, others written fresh for the game. What makes this game unique from the previous iterations is the ability to accuse the WRONG person... and make it stick.\n\nYou see, in every case there are multiple suspects, and if you did your investigation wrong the evidence may lead you the wrong way. However, you are the great Sherlock Holmes, so nobody will question your decision... except yourself. And even after you have made the accusation, you can decide to either throw the book at the perp (to the gallows!)... or intervene and help him (or her) with the law to ensure the outcome "for the best of all involved".\n\nYou will travel back and forth amongst several locations, usually your Baker St residence, Scotland Yard, then various leads and scene of crime and such, and there are often things to do at each, as you examine things that needs to be examined, and perhaps do a few things to "open up" further avenues of investigation, and perhaps interrogate suspects for further leads after you uncover a few... contradictions.\n\nThe interface is optimized much from previous iterations. Research is now a matter of going back to Baker St. and access the archives, which are composed of various old newspapers, encyclopedia entries, and Holmes' own missives, i.e. multiple choice. To travel to a location you merely bring up case book / location, then click on a location. To run tests on a piece of evidence, you go to Baker st and play with Holmes' exam table.  Interrogation, evidence, and autopsy are now concentrated at Scotland Yard, as is Lestrade's office.\n\nThere are a lot of mini-games now including the puzzles. Most "locks" now require the "concentric cylinders to line-up" puzzle where you can rotate individual cylinders but you can't see all of them or some may be "joined" or "separated" at higher difficulty levels. There are other games including a "climbing" game where you need to quick click, then press A or D as prompted. There were a "skeet shoot" where you need to shoot someone before they shoot you. There is also a rope bridge segment (don't fall off as you try to negotiate this windy rope bridge) and more. All in all there are over 45 different minigames, and there are achievements for doing all of them. Good thing is they don't require too much reflexes, merely some "timing", but some of those can get quite annoying as they are not that forgiving.\n\nThe game borrowed liberally from all the previous iterations as well as from TV series, and other games. For example, there is now a "SherlockVision" mode where you can see things other people can't see, with words that pop up that shows your observations and deductions just like the BBC Sherlock series. There's also a "hypothesis / re-enactment" mode where you try to virtually piece together a sequence of events that may account for some actions of witnesses or suspects.\n\nEach suspect or witness you encounter also gets a mini-game where you try to observe him or her about details which lets you deduce background. Ring means married. Expensive but patched cloths means formerly rich, now poor. Brooch of certain design suggests immigrant from out of the country, and so on.  You need to make all observations to "pass" the minigame, and they weren't always obvious.\n\nWhat's best, ALL minigames can be skipped, if you failed too many times. You simply don't get the "did not skip" achievement.\n\nThe time travelling between locations can be used to review your casebook and/or make deductions using your virtual deduction board, which now resembles neurons connecting in your brain, leading to further conclusions or such, and that really makes you FEEL that loading time is a lot less.\n\nGraphics are good, with only occasional texture oops. All the characters are very detailed. Frogware chose to model the Sherlock Holmes and Watson after the Jeremy Brett version. On the other hand they had to tweak the characters a bit to make sure they don't TOO closely resemble the actors in the 1960's Sherlock Holmes TV series. Voice acting is excellent, as they all sound authentic British to this untrained ear.\n\nThe only problem I feel can detract from the game is the game sometimes hid the clues a little too well, and if you miss those clues you will end up with NOWHERE to search or continue!  For example, in the missing train case, there are some hidden documents that I never found in a particular station, which would not have shown up UNLESS I engage SherlockVision. As a result, I missed 2 clues out of 24.  In another example, I was completed stuck in The case in the garden also had a moment where I missed a clue, which got me stuck completely, as I literally had NOTHING else to investigate, and I was going nuts trying to figure out what I missed, and again, I missed a section of SherlockVision in an office.  So if you have problems, you may want to check every room and see if you need to engage Sherlock Vision (T key), and if it says you should, you're clearly missing something there.\n\nSome of the cases are pretty straightforward, and even followed the stories much. Others are more interesting as you don't know what to expect, as there are many red herrings. However, my favorite would have to be the final case, which involved not just one but TWO moral choices, and let's just say, your "instinct" will be severely put to the test.\n\nAll in all, this game is great, as you do have to make decisions based on the clues you gathered, and if you made the wrong choice, well, you'll have to live with it. Enjoy this great little puzzle adventure game. You should love it.\n\n","June 4, 2015","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was also easier then to sift through evidence and come to a sound conclusion.\n-Getting to come to your own conclusion. In the previous games, Holmes guided you through. In these games, you ARE the detective. And you can get it wrong. It makes the game all that more intense since I know I can lose.\n-The ease of assessing information. The file system makes it easy to look over all the information you have gathered. The deduction board was is an ingenious way to put the clues together. You make links between different information and evidence to form conclusions and there can be multiple conclusions.\n-The mysteries are solvable. I do not like it when a mystery game's answer comes out of nowhere and you feel that you never had a chance to solve it. The mysteries in this game are all solvable. If you go over the clues, review evidence, reread dialogue and think about it, you can get the right answer. I got all but one of them correct. I had determined to go over all the evidence thoroughly before deciding on a final answer and that helped. But still, pressing the button to launch my conclusion always had me nervous! I looked back over all the evidence of the one mystery I solved incorrectly and realized what erroneous conclusions I had drawn.\n-In my opinion, the best addition is the morality choices. In Conan Doyle's stories, Holmes often makes moral decisions concerning the fate of the culprits. He does not consider himself necessarily bound by conventional law. The morality choices were an added layer that made the game all the more real and like the Holmes stories.\n-Two of the stories are Conan Doyle stories. They were modified a little, but not enough to take away Conan Doyle's original plots. I am a Conan Doyle fan and so enjoyed getting to play his own stories. One was an obscure enough story that I recognized it, but didn't remember much about it and so had to figure it out along with all the other mysteries. The other I knew very well and flew through the case, but it was still fun to be in the story.\n-The variety of the cases. Nothing was redundant. Each case was unique and completely held my interest.\n-Telescope easter egg. So funny.\n\nCons: -As someone who adores the Conan Doyle stories, I didn't like the characterization of Mycroft. It seems the thing these days in recreated Holmes stories and shows to make Sherlock and his brother antagonists. They just are not like this in Conan Doyle's stories. At one point, Sherlock tells Watson in one of the Conan Doyle stories that he has gone to Mycroft at times for help. And if Mycroft were to show up asking Sherlock for help, he would not be indifferent.\n-The characterizations of Watson and Holmes also suffer a little. Watson is turned more towards the bumbling idiot Watson. Sherlock is made more aloof and cold than in previous games.\n-In one of the mysteries, a clue is worded in such a way that it can lead the player to an incorrect conclusion. I decided to ignore the wording in light of other evidence and that led me to the right answer, but I was worried it would be incorrect because of the clue wording.\n-There is less freedom to explore your environment than in previous games.  The game boxes you into an area and if you wander to the edge throws the map in your face. That was a little off putting and reminded me I was playing a game. I would have rather Holmes had said something like, "There is nothing interesting over there."\n-Final screen. Once you've finished the whole game it seems like there is going to be a cut scene, but nothing happens.","July 13, 2015","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will however note that each case has several possible conclusion (wrong and correct ones) and it is possible to get carried away by a wrong version or uncertainty. If however you are paying attention to all clues (which are not that hard to find) and apply common logic you would not have issues with this game, you will enjoy it.\n\nTime wise, if you go slow and read through all the in-game materials you are looking at 15-17 hours of gameplay.\n\nOn the negative side I can say that once you get hold of it the game becomes easy, controls are a bit glitchy, and there is a lack of British humour (there is some, but could have been more).\n\nAll in all this is a solid detective game that flows in an interactive story of each individual case you work on. 7/10\n\nFor more reviews join my group - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/\n","July 15, 2015","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game surprised me by having a pretty sophisticated way that events can chain and collide to produce many different results. For fans of the stories, it's a great reimagining. I can't say for sure if it will impress those who aren't familiar with Doyle's books but simply like adventure games, but I think it ought to work for both kinds of players.\n\nAs with any adventure game, there are occasional snags where you think the elements are uncovered but the game requires one more tiny nudge to prove that you've understood. Those rare occasions can be a little frustrating, but aside from that it's a very polished indie game with a lot to recommend it. Some people have complained that they weren't entirely sure if they'd got the right man/woman at the end of each case - if that happens to you, you probably haven't solved the crime correctly. I think it's good that the game allows you to get it wrong without telling you plainly, and only shows you that you were right if you were right, but not everyone will see that as a strength.","July 15, 2015","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

C&P's puzzles do sometimes look very similar, but overall they are actually quite good. From that description you would think it is, in fact, just "another detective game". However, it is far from the normal. What sets it apart from other games in the genre is the story. In fact, the game is so reliant on story that you are able to skip the puzzle minigames altogether.\n\nC&P envelops you in every case. Through the clue connection system in the game a simple case turns into a complex story of twists and turns.
