When you start, maybe you feel a little out of your element. Defenders of Time has a much quicker pace than DG2, Bloons, or Dungeon Defenders. Instead of sitting back and watching something happen, you're right there, in the moment, responding to things on the fly.\n\nHere's what I did: I knocked out the tutorials, played a game of single player, then went straight to the ranked queue. The differences between single and multiplayer are huge! Communication was surprisingly easy: I could draw, type, place "ghost" towers, and ping. You can even voice chat if you want to.\n\nAll in all, my experience has been a positive one. Indie games sometimes start a bit rocky, but dev-customer relations are almost always better when compared to the big guys.

It is very fast paced and can be a little complicated but I like that this game does something different. I am used to TD games where I can build my turrets, upgrade them, and watch them kill my enemies. I've noticed in this game I have to constantly pay attention to what I am fighting and change my play style constantly otherwise I will die very quickly.

My internet youth was spent playing maps like Turret Defense in Starcraft & Wintermaul/Wintermaul Wars/Line Tower Wars in Warcraft 3. I am so sick of the flash and mobile TD's of today. This game brings back the idea of hooking and hopefully will expand to bigger maps and allow spiraling. On top of that there is so much freedom in the current state of the game where it allows YOU to manage the creeps, not the other way around like most TD's of today. They have even added much needed improvement to the genre with features like pinging and a seperate flight/ground path system. There are so many improvements and I am just so happy with the purchase.\n\nThe community seems to be very friendly and helpful, I totally recommend this for anyone that has loved the original style of TD and if you have never experienced what it was like to play those maps... I am sorry... come, join us!","November 6, 2014","true","6.8"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

It asks for some multitasking skills but when you master those, it's plain awsome. The ability to play with friends that didn't pay for it is nice tho.\n\nBut there are some loose ends here. Sometimes the game bugs when you send stealthed units in-between the normal waves of monsters. And the biggest drawback of this game is the fact that it has a very low player base. I've been in a queue for ages, without any succes.\n\nUnless the low playerbase, i still recommend this game.

When I first started it was a little overwhelming trying to figure out all of the different towers along with their strengths and weaknesses while the game moves so quickly. You have to strategize quickly or else you die, it's not like other tower defense games where you have time to rest between waves.

The graphics are decent the mazes are fun. The cost of the game is great for what you get. However, the player base is very small and trying to play an online match can take a very long time, put it this way, I have yet to play one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/317330/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1777 products in account","The first impressions from looking at the store page is already a negative one. The "About This Game" section is poorly written and attempts to be comical. The horrendous video and screenshots aren't lying. Defenders of Time really does look bad, play badly, and even performs badly. It's out of date, it doesn't innovate and it most certainly is one of the worst tower defense games I've ever played.\n\nAesthetically, Defenders of Time looks like the results of a project from an early graphic design college class even at maximum settings. The game completely lacks polish and presentation. There is no story, no lore and no interesting factions or units. There is nothing that grabs a hold of your attention in any way. There is nothing to play for or to experience. From when you boot the game to the glorious moment when you click the "exit game" button, you will feel as though you could've spent your time doing something else. Anything else. This game adds nothing new to the tower defense genre. There is nothing to enjoy.\n\nIn addition to it being uneventful, uninspired, dull, boring and mind numbing, there is no single player campaign to speak of. This game was designed for multi-player alone and no one plays this game. What we have here is a game that was made in hopes to have a massive online multi-player community, and it doesn't. It never will. Even if it became free to play, there is nothing attractive about this game to bring in players. The single player portion of the game is just picking a map from a total of six and waiting for the mindless enemy units to make their rounds. There is nothing else. Also, even though the game runs smoothly at 60 frames per second, it will constantly take up between 20% and 30% of CPU power at all times. If all of this isn't bad enough, you are also required to create a separate account in order to play the game. Having a price tag of $20 is ridiculous. The developers couldn't have expected this to be a success, could they?\n\nDefenders of Time is painful.","January 1, 2015","false","4.8"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Game is so bad, no one wants to defend time.\n\nBased on the art direction, I feel this game is a tie-in to Disney's Meet The Robinsons.\n\nBut, anyway, Defenders of Time is truly an awful turret defense. One of the worst. The game is not balanced. Upgrades unlock seemingly randomly as a stage progresses. There's little to no explanation on turrets or enemy types. It is about as ugly, generic, and boring as a turret defense game can get. Defenders of Time is a real mess of a game.\n\nIts also highly overpriced. For $20 you get 6 maps, no single player campaign, and a game geared towards co-op (for TD? WTF! why?) with an on-line community that is completely dead. This game seriously feels like its still in alpha pase; rough, incomplete, lacking features that look like they were intended to be added in later but weren't because this game didn't sell.\n\nUsed a coupon to get this game for $2, and I still feel ripped off.\n\nedit: also, for some reason, it takes forever for the cards to unlock as well.","May 4, 2015","false","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
