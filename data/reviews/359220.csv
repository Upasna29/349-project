Leaving the Honda, Suzuki, and Kawisaki looking bikes besides what Rainbow and THQ bikes. I personally am a Yamaha rider in real life, so this bikeing being pulled from the PC version of the game really blows.

Not on PS2, Xbox, whatever. However, I did play MX Unleashed when I was a kid, so therefore, I think I can review this game.\n\nMX vs. ATV Unleashed is a great racing and freestyle game. Sure, you can play its races, but I barely knew anybody who did that. You know what I mean. All I do is goof off in Free Ride and freestyle. Now, let me talk about the main complaints, which I am going to defend.\n\n1. This game doesn't work!\nA: I know it doesn't always work. In fact, if you have Intel HD graphics, it won't work at all. However, here is how to fix it. Just launch the game and don't change any resolution, graphics, or texture settings. It's that simple. You can change the controls (Like I did because the default controls aren't good) and no crashes.\n\n2. OMG! 30 FPS LOCK?!?!?\nA: Yes, there is a 30 FPS lock. However, it doesn't affect how the game works. It's not like me where if it happened in an intense, precision game, where you need to instantly make decisions. Plus, this game is almost 10 years old. 60 FPS wasn't always the common things for games.\n\nThose were complaints I saw most. I do complain that there is no open world like MX Unleashed. If there was, I would love this game to death. But even still, I still can't hate this game.\n\nI would give this a 8/10. Just buy it now. And if you can't fix it, look on forums and then refund it.","November 27, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For a game from 2006 it's actually pretty decent, if nothing impressive visually. Controls work well with a 360 controller and even support both joysticks for camera rotation, something that older pre-Xinput games didn't always do, and the racing mechanics are solid enough.\n\nAll that said, even in 2006 there were better games you could have been spending your money on. The game looks and feels like a budget title even for the time, with the licensed soundtrack being the title's real high point. The AI rubber bands like nobody's business, a feature racing games still have a problem with, and the lack of real impact your bike or ATV has on the course makes for a game that just doesn't feel great to play. Combined with limited graphical and gameplay tuning options and you have an experienced that is easily surpassed by any number of titles both on and off Steam.\n\nThe price point isn't terrible, but feels like it is somewhat more than the game deserves given its limitations and the game's overall forgettable nature. On the plus side, the game runs fine first-boot on Windows 8.1 with a full suite of modern hardware, so if you do decide to take the plunge there is little in the way of configuration needed to get it to run, though widescreen support would have been nice to see.\n\nRecommended, but only for the fact that those with some sense of nostalgia for it shouldn't be disappointed by this version or its ability to run. For newcomers, though? Look elsewhere.","October 18, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Games now are so AAA mainstream and have to have the best graphics and a huge open world. But many forget games like this are what built the foundation for today's AAA titles. These games are classics in my mind and to their true fans they think the same.\n\nThis game is a 10/10 Easy. The best out of the series although "Untamed" has far more content and things to do. Cheap, simple, fun.","November 6, 2015","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game runs smooth as can be on windows 10. I've heard it doesn't work in windows 8 or 8.1. Not sure though. In order to use a controller you have to remap all of the controls; not that big of a deal, just annoying to do. Screen resolution is low as well. I think 1280 x 1024 is the max.
