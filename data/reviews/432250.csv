Very humorous implementation of a city builder in a disfunctional setting. The music and graphics are insanely cool. Still buggy but completely understandable given the unfinished state. Its a shame the developer is getting all that flak from apparently Russian gamers. I guess there should be a disclaimer stating this is not intended for sensitive Russians, in the end comunism wasn't strictly russian, some of us lived under it very far from Russia, and yes it sucked. Yes, this is loaded with dark humour, yes its a dark game, and yes, it's insanely cool. No, its not for everyone.

Its not so much based on history but more a parody of what some soviety city is like - there are a lot of neat ideas brought to the fore in how the player uses state terror and the double-edged sword this can be in both trying to keep the civilians under control but also answer the demands from the central government. Its well worth getting, can though be a little difficult to start with as there are alot of options on screen and time is ticking and there is seemingly alot one must do to meet 5 year plan goals and such - to some extent the game expects one to fail a few times in meeting such goals i think.","May 7","true","2.2"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

I encountered no errors, and load times were a little long, but by no means unbearable. The art and design are very nice, and the score is very appealing, almost soothing in a brain-washing sort of way, which I can only imagine was intentional.\n\nThe controls are easy enough to learn, though it may take some time to get used to the menus. One criticism of the menus is that they are not always labeled as what you may expect them to be labeled with, but that is easily overlooked once you learn the layout, which the current tutorial does a fine job of.\n\nThe biggest issue I've had is a few grammatical issues with tutorial text and loading screens, but they are easily fixed, and easily forgiven.\n\nEven at its current state, I would recommend this game to someone who enjoys city sims, as well as one that likes puzzle type games.","April 2","true","0.2"," 47 of 106 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","47","106","0","0"

I do not mean the tutorial, but it takes quite a lot of trial and error to properly get the hang of the entire economy of the game, each resource and the ways they are created.\n2 - The geography of the map is riddiculously bad: Forests tiles are riddiculously awful and hindering any plans.\n3 - There is no indication on how to get "Terror points" (which are quite important for some decisions) and that they differ from the "Terror meter"\n4 - You can only create your city focusing on souther border, as you can only place export tracks on southern border\n5 - "Holes" and water tiles ruining the map.\n6 - Various little bugs.\n\nHowever it is quite a fun little game, with a grotesque representation of a socialist state.

This game is ♥♥♥♥ing weird. One of your technologies is getting Mao Ze Dong to inspect buildings to stop idle workers. It's a puzzle game mixed with a city builder with a very abstract way of looking at city management. And it's also really freaking difficult with concepts that are not quite explained in a way that promotes a player-friendly attitude. Essentially, it's forcing you to figure it out yourself (which is kind of a pain in the ♥♥♥) while still attempting to balance the various "resources" in the game.\n\nThis just makes the game far more difficult than it really needs to be. There is no clear definition of how to get to your objectives, nor does there seem to be an easy way to do it. You will restart... a lot. Seriously, in just an hour I restarted over 8 times because I had too much terror, or not enough terror or I ran out of Rubels. That brings me to my next point, this game is very, very abstract in the traditional city builder sense. For example, how do you initally produce coal? Well you zap them with Soviet lightning and harvest their bodies to be burned in a crematorium which thusly produces coal, of course! Like I said... just weird.\n\nHowever, figuring out this game and how it works is actually... kind of fun. It's almost like a Roguelike, where the only way you can get better is to try, try again. After every mission you complete, you generate points which you can then buy upgrades that make the game easier from the main menu. I also really like the aesthetic of the game. Seriously, the watercolor paintings and the artwork in this game are downright freaking gorgeous. The music is pretty damn catchy too... never thought I'd say that about a Soviet-esque game.\n\nSeriously though, I recommend this game to only a select type of people... those who like intentionally frustrating systems or fans of roguelikes, very hard city builder fans or just people who like to make fun of Soviet culture and it's ridiculous brutality... if you like watercolors, you'll probably be a fan of this too.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kHKLY0Kcqc","April 2","true","2.2"," 31 of 80 people (39%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","39","31","80","5","0"

Being a kid from the 80s I felt right at home :)\n\n- Nice tutorial. It was actually fun learning how to play the game.\n\n- Soundtrack! The music is OUTSTANDING, I usually mute in-game music, but not here. Techno-Soviet might just actually become a thing.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to run a Soviet city - complete with 'human resource' management - then this is the game for you. But beware, you are just as vulnerable to being snapped up as a 'resource' as the unfortunate residents who haunt your streets are,,, **BANG**.\n\nYou could do a whole heck of a lot worse with your $10. Give it a go!\n\n10/10","April 2","true","0.3"," 21 of 65 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","21","65","0","0"

I would have backed the game’s greenlight from the get-go based on the concept alone, but it had already been greenlit by the time I got there, so I followed it closely, watching and waiting for release.\n\nAs a longtime student of Soviet history, especially of The Terror, I was mesmerized by the idea of being part of the uncaring, murderous socialist machine. Make no mistake, this is a very dark game. State sponsored murder on a large scale, is, in fact, a critical part of the economy in the system, and can’t be forgone if you want to succeed. In the horrifying picture of socialism it portrays, people are quite literally nothing more than resources to be either worked to death and then recycled, or simply murdered on a mass scale (and then recycled).\n\nGameplay is similar to just about any other city builder, albeit strongly tied to mission objectives issued from above. Directives, such as “increase the population by 3,000”, can be met by building enough housing for those people, or by sneakier, more conniving methods typical of highly bureaucratic systems that are rife with corruption (you can simply have the birth certificates fudged at the local hospital and voila! 3,000 new “people” for the state).\n\nThe art style is utterly fantastic, and one of my favorite aspects of the game. It captures the bleak, stultifying brutality of a country undergoing a mass terror campaign. Everything from the People’s Palace (presumably where your exalted self resides), straight down to the most decrepit apartment block, screams totalitarianism.\n\nThe developer has been accused of “Russophobia” by a few very loud critics that presumably didn’t play the game, or only bought it just to accuse him of such. The same people seem to have little trouble throwing pejoratives his way about his nationality, and I find this terribly unfair. While many aspects of the art and even the concept harken back to Soviet Russia, they also evoke the other Soviet republics, Great Leap Forward China, North Korea and others in equal measure.  The word “Russia” is not used once, at least not that I’ve seen so far, and even if it is, that’s hardly “Russophobic” of the developer or his product. Let’s all be civil. If this game is “Russophobic” so are most of the Call of Duty titles.\n\nIt’s an uncomfortable game, and it’s intended to be. It should make you feel a little bit… queasy, at times. That’s the idea.\n\nI highly recommend Soviet City to people that enjoy city builders, socio-political history and dark (bordering on macabre) humor.\n","March 31","true","114.4"," 65 of 179 people (36%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","36","65","179","5","15"

Terror level and how to influence it is totally unintuitive. Iconography is unclear with insufficient tooltips to help explain what things do. It's a good game held back by bad UI. Buildings go idle and you have to send Mao to inspect, but explaination of this is absolutely terrible. Citizens randomly get upset and destroy everything, with the only immediate solution apparently being to kill people at random until you get the person who's unhappy. But if your terror level moves outside the acceptable range you just lose. Game doesn't explain why terror level goes up or down or how you earn terror points with which to kill people, so for the most part, when you lose you don't feel like you even know why. Basically, ♥♥♥♥ goes wrong constantly and it feels like you have to click stuff in the interface at random to solve. Again, it's a really great concept and maybe if you're the sort of person who doesn't mind stumbling around in the UI, you'll really like it. Me, I'm holding out for UI improvements and a freakin' tutorial.","March 31","true","1.4"," 31 of 126 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","31","126","0","0"
