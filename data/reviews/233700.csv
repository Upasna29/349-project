You will be hungry and starved, your equipment will break, your armor will fail, and your ammunition will run dry. You will be stunned, confused, blinded, and terrorized. You will be shot by crazed security robots, shredded by mutated terrors, and gnawed on by countless foes, and occasionally disintegrated.\n\n...so, you've got that going for you.\n\n\nOverview (what is it?):\n\nSword of the Stars: The Pit is a turn-based top-down roguelike, where you play a character exploring a hostile and ancient alien complex trying to find the cure for a plague that is running rampant through the worlds.\n\nGameplay:\n\nWell, for those unfamiliar with roguelikes - this game is not meant to be beaten in a few hours then discarded. As my introduction stated, this is a challenging game, with permanent death (the game mechanics prevent you from saving, except to exit the game) and you can only have one active game per character class at once, so you'll frequently watch as a character you've invested hours of gameplay into is wiped out or overwhelmed. Because the game is randomly generated each time, sometimes bad luck will end a good run with not much you can do about it. Your character has several limiting factors to keep in mind - ammunition is limited, and can only be replenished by finding more (which, depending on the weapon, may not be that common). Food is a concern as well, as there is a hunger mechanism that makes starving a real possibility if you can't find or make enough food to stay alive. Disease is a concern - not just from infected creatures, but perhaps by being forced to eat things you shouldn't...  And, of course, there's just running out of hit points and dying at the hands of the denizens of the complex!\n\nGameplay itself is turn based, with you and monsters alternating turns (though, if no monsters are visible or present, your turns run seamlessly together making it easy to move around). each turn you have a limited number of movement points to move around the grid squares and explore the complex, looking for abandoned equipment you can scavenge or repair, old lockers that might contain food or items you could use - and, of course, creatures that may still be lurking! Somewhere on each level is a hatch leading to the next level below, with monsters getting tougher as you descend.\n\nThe interface is a nice balance of being easy to get used to, though does take a quick reference of the manual to learn some of the finer points. generally, you move with the awsd keys, and use the space bar to interact with objects you face. 'Interact' is case sensitive; for a locker or a freezer, it'll be 'open', a locked vault will be 'unlock', a broken piece of equipment will be 'repair', etc. Combat is similarly simple - equip the weapon you'd like (or select from available hotkeys), and click on the target. (And, yes, there is a good tutorial available to teach you all this stuff!)\n\nOverall, though the game itself is simple, I found (and still find!) it interesting because some of the choices the gameplay provides. I'm hungry - do I dare risk eating my tainted meat, or press a little further in hopes of finding something more suitable? The room ahead is heavily guarded - is it worth the ammunition I'll use (and wounds I'll take!) to clear it in hopes of finding equipment I can use, or should I bypass it? My inventory is full - do I drop some of the parts I'm carrying in hopes of building something useful down the line, or sacrifice some of my limited food, ammo, or extra weapons?\n\nCrafting:\n\nSince I mentioned it above, a note on crafting. As you explore, you will find recipes and blueprints (or, sometimes, discover them yourself) that allow you to combine items you find to create new items. Some of these are intuitive (cook raw meat to make cooked meat. Combine certain meat with bread to make a sandwich, etc.) but the crafting system is very involved, to the point of being able to craft for yourself armor, weapons, and equipment that will drastically improve your chances for survival. How involved? Well, I'm several HUNDRED hours into the gameplay, and still am constantly finding new clues and recipes...   it's certainly a rich and rewarding ara to explore -though sometimes frustrating, as the random nature of the game means you may have a great blueprint, but be short of a needed item to build what you want, and unable to find said item (or, worse sometimes, have all the items you need, but lack a workstation to assemble it!) The limited inventory space means you can't simply carry everything - you have to decide what is important to you, which again leads to some interesting choices sometimes. Anyway, know that crafting is very important in this game, and there's much to discover here!\n\n(Also, note that I play The Pit with several DLC installed; this does add some to the crafting, but to be fair, I don't think I'm close to finding all the recipes from the original game yet!)\n\n\n\nCharacters:\n\nYour first choice when you begin a game is which character you'd like to play. The original game provides three options - a marine, who is very capable in combat but lacking in the finesse and scientific skills; an engineer who has lots of technical know-how but limited combat effectiveness; or a scout - a sort of jack-of-all-trades character, a mix of some finesse and technical skills combined with some light combat skills as well.\n\nAvailable DLC (downloadable content) allows you to broaden this class list: Mind Games adds psionic powers to the game and allows you to play as a human Scion or an alien Tarka Ranger, and the Gold expansion adds four more (three immediately and one unlockable) characters.\n\nI won't go into too much character detail here - the info is out there if you choose, but suffice it to say that each character has strengths and weaknesses, different starting equipment and skills, as well as a personal backstory for why the character is descending into The Pit.\n\nAnd the choices you make are very relevant, too - for example, the marine excels at combat, so you'd think he'd be easy to play, as monsters don't really scare him. However, his lack of foraging skills mean he's more likely to go hungry from not finding food, and he may run out of ammo faster from not being able to find more - plus his limited science skills mean he's less able to craft new equipment for himself.\n\nOverall, most of the classes are well balanced - there's one I find to be a touch overpowered, and a couple I don't play because they don't fit my playstyle (one in particular seems a little weak) but with this much to choose from it seems to me that the average player is going to find at least a couple they really enjoy.\n\nCharacter Advancement:\n\nYour character has four attributes (might, finesse, brains, and power) that you can increase as you advance, as well as various skills. Skills include weapons skills (pistol, rifle, blade, to name a few) and equally important non-combat skills (foraging, lockpicking, psionic skills, decipher, electronics, etc). The basic game has something like 20 skill areas available to your character, and the mindgame expansion adds five more (five different psionic skills) for a total of 25. Each time you gain a level, you're given a number of skill points (dependant on character class) to assign. Again, it comes down to choice - you can't be good at everything, so what's important to you? Skills will level with use to a certain point - but to be really good takes some added skill points.\n\nYour character also has various other values (hit points, armor, etc) that are fairly self-evident, but I do want to make note of the hunger mechanism. Each character has a 'food' bar, similar to a life/hit points bar- eat some food, this goes up to a certain maximum.","June 9, 2014","true","522.3"," 131 of 139 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","131","139","0","2"

I've never been one for Roguelikes, albeit content with minimalist graphics, ASCII lies beyond my tolerance, so I'm fairly new to the genre. Also, being a compulsive cleptomaniac in RPGs, permadeath and losing all my gleefully scavenged goodies has never been a positive factor. However, this has gripped me. Starting out is a little grindy, as you must unlock vital crafting recipes (i'd recommend the wiki) to really stand a chance at not starving to death early on. However, due to heavy randomisation, progress can hinge on redundant plans and experience is required to know how you can adapt.\n\nThe more you play, the more you learn and damn, is there much to learn as you desperately try to manage your equipment and potentially useful crafting items to survive another floor. Utterly brutal, but brilliant.

You'll have suffered at the hands of Risk of Rain, but eventually felt the sweet taste of coming out on top. You'll have been bruised and battered by ToME, but in the end, you showed that game who was boss. Probably you've gritted your teeth in the final boss battle of FTL at least a dozen times, swearing at it, but coming back for more, and eventually succeeded.\n\nSo when you play Sword of the Stars: The Pit, it's going to kick your ♥♥♥, and your first reaction will be: "Well, it's like those other games, I just have to learn how to play it." It'll happen again and again, defeat after defeat, spurning your best attempts to master the game, and slowly, but surely, you'll start to wonder: "Am I just bad at this game? Is it just THAT tough? That complex? Something beyond my skills?"\n\nAnd the answer is: No, it's not. It's just a ♥♥♥♥ game. Unfortunately, SotS: The Pit, suffers from having too many resources to manage(durability, Psi, food, health AND ammo), and aside from Psi, which can eventually alleviate two of them(health and food), there's no way to trade between your resources, and getting the right things to recover said resources is entirely random. You'll also have no idea which of the dozen or so crafting-and-foraging skills will be relevant on a given run, as the containers provided are entirely random, not to mention that you may simply get none of the necessary crafting stations even if you have all the ingredients, and since there's also about a dozen different kinds of ammo, and some armor and food don't work for all the characters... I think you get the idea. It requires such absurd luck to actually get what you need, and at basically no point is your own skill involved. You rarely get the choice of whether to engage or not, either, since anything you spot will likely move to engage you, sneaking isn't a skill and almost any hostile can outrun you.\n\nThe game also suffers from the fact that some of the playable classes have non-functional features, like the Lich. It's roughly a 50-50 chance whether his minions will ignore enemies or just wander in circles while said enemies liberate your femur for a chewtoy.\n\nReally, there's so much random chance involved that you may as well not even play the game, just roll a die to determine whether you succeed or not, keep doing it until you get a success, and then go play a more fun game.","March 1, 2015","false","36.2"," 211 of 321 people (66%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","66","211","321","24","26"

The monsters (of which there are so, so many different and unique types) get harder the deeper you go, the loot gets progressively better although is still wonderfully randomised -- sometimes you are cursing your lack of equipment, other times you get lucky. Food is scarce, so you must scavenge to stay alive. You can craft items and food from recipes which you can discover through experimentation or by hacking computer terminals and gradually uncovering pieces of text leading you to the full recipe. This element adds to the replayability as you'll likely learn something new from each run.\nThe game is brutally hard as you crank up the difficult level, but for those looking for an easier time the Easy setting is much more forgiving.\n\nSo yeah, if you like Rogue-likes and want an extremely polished turn-based game with wonderful graphical style, sound and huge replayability, I can't recommend this enough :)","November 26, 2013","true","63.3"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","37","43","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/233700/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","(In the interests of full disclosure, this review is based on the Gold Edition - which should be considered the best option available).\n\nA metacritic of 68? Who reviewed this game? Ben Kuchera? Did it not have enough empty houses for him to rummage through with stories of teenage girl angst to get voyeuristic over?\nIt's nethack, but not your father or your mother's nethack. This is tried and tested "Get in from the frozen exterior of a planet into a secret underground base that extends downwards further than any greedy dwarf dared dig." model, but brought up to date with a solid lick of paint, high resolution graphics, and a clear and consistent approach to enemies, objects and overall design.\n\nThe story, what there is, is much the norm for such roguelikes, it's merely the pretext for getting you to the front of the dungeon, the reality is that this is a true roguelike, you go as far as you can, aiming to reach the bottom of the pit, or die messily along the way. You only have one life, no do-overs. Unlike a lot of "modern" nethacks, this one goes back to roll style checks for skill tests, and gives an extensive list of possible talents to sculpt and model your character. The Gold edition additionally features several extra classes, giving you a respectable pool of choices, both human and nonhuman in nature (playing as an alien ranger is -awesome- ).\n\nIt's base levels all the way down, they're all evil, they all want to kill you.\nScattered throughout each randomly generated floor is a variety of traps, both tile and door based, locked chests and rooms, and various devices that may help or hinder your ability to progress. Ranging from defunct cookers that need repairing to prepare a simple blandwich (Don't ask what's in one, really, you don't want to know..), to advanced and somewhat dotty security computers that may just as readily electrocute you as deactivate the several heavily armed and armoured droids patrolling the area.\n\nThe game operates functionally as a turn based game, with each discrete action you take allowing the AI the opportunity to respond (hint - if the game pauses briefly between moves, there's something nearby, and it's almost certainly unfriendly). You take an action, the AI takes an action, repeat until either you or whatever the AI sent your way has collapsed in a pool of it's own fluids.\n\nMake sure you know what you're killing, and you're killing it with the right gun.\nWhen dealing with multiple foes, target selection becomes important, you can if you feel confident let the computer handle targetting and it does a sensible enough job, but on occasion you'll want to step in yourself to ensure that the scariest thing dies first. Combat employs a wide variety of melee and projectile weapons, and in keeping with the future sci-fi aesthetic, these can be pretty fantastical, including laser, plasma and other interesting effects.\n\nWith the addition of extra characters, Mind Games and all the extra ways to die, The Pit has become highly complex, very well supported, and a deep and involving creature, there's now many ways to die, many ways to survive, and many accomodations for various playstyles. This is -not- however, baby's first nethack. You will want to start with say, Dungeons of Dredmor, because this one will kill you in good order if you're not at least familiar with the concept of being pragmatic and cautious and making efficient use of your time. Hunger can ruin your life far easier than you might expect.\n\nIn such games, death can come in many ways, here is no exception. Simply being impaled is for novices, try being irradiated, choked by a mimic pretending to be a med station, diseased by an out of control experiment, or being melted in acid. It is important to note that in these games - Death is an opportunity to learn, not a signal of failure. Go in expecting to die a lot, and the ultimate victory will be that much sweeter.\n\nClosing thoughts\nThis game is not for the faint of heart, but it is well worth the effort, and for an intermediate roguelike player, someone who's cut their teeth on more forgiving entries to the genre (Dungeons of Dredmor is a great place to start), this is the logical progression. Welcome to The Pit. Enjoy your stay.\n\nVerdict : Highly recommended, and to the so called "professional reviewers" who say otherwise, hang your heads in shame you overpriced wastes of space. You no longer deserve the sites you work for.","November 26, 2013","true","19.7"," 61 of 85 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","61","85","0","0"

Completing a full successful run of The Pit is a pretty length endeavor as well, so if you are looking for a game that offers you a quick play, this isn't it either. If what you want is a scarcity-driven roguelike with a great interface and a well done setting and theme, The Pit will not disappoint.\n\nI also highly recommend this game to experienced players who feel that today's games are easy to the point of boredom. The Pit is hard, and in a good way-at first it seems that you lose to randomness, but usually it's due to playing sloppy or greedy and this game punishes mistakes in a way that most games don't.

Sword of the Stars: The Pit is an exceedingly competent entry into the genre that is well executed.  The graphics are a bit strange but familiar to those that have been with the series, and in the scope of it's own series are done fairly well if not extraordinarialy.  (The character animations definetely look to have been done on OpenCanvas or something similar and stand out against the rest of the game, though).\n\nThe roguelike elements are definetely the strength of the game.  Combat is intuitive, fair, and reasonably balanced.  The creature AI can be relied upon to act in a consistent manner which is fairly important for combat in roguelikes, and the different weapons actually add a variety of game mechanics rather than just being incrementally increased versions of the same guns, which is a pitfall of many roguelikes.  The random nature of the game can make things in some runs much more difficult, but I never felt the randomness broke a game in the way it can in many roguelikes.  If you got a bad roll on a level you can still have an entirely legitimate change of making it through the level if you play skillfully, such as utilising beserk mechanics to cause enemies to fight each other, luring enemies into environmental hazards, through grenades around corners, or placing traps.  Which also leads into another of the games strengths - there are a lot of mechanics such as those I just mentioned and they're fairly intuitive for the most part.  If you have any experience with roguelikes you likely don't need the tutorial or the manual, although both of those are actually quite well done.  The one mechanic I do have a gripe with is the idea of the crafting recipes.  It's supposed to be able to find recipes through some of the data panels but I have never done so.  Most of them can't be found this way and it turns the game either into experimentation with blind luck, or consulting a wiki.  There's some people that like their games like that however, and it's a subjective preference of mine that I don't.  The voice acted parts - albeit fairly rare - are actually pretty well done, as well.  The whole game just seems to be a game where a significant amount of time and effort has been taken on polishing the game, something sorely lacking from many releases big and small these days.\n\nThe biggest criticism I have about the game is that is very "safe".  It takes no risks and as such is very generic in the truest sense of the word.  However it's a well-executed implementation of the genre with an interesting background story and theme that offers a huge amount of replayability and a variety of different levels of challenge for someone to find their individual level of comfort.

I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game. The first thing to know is that this is probably the only modern roguelike on Steam. Sure, there's CoQ, ADOM, TOME, NetHack, etc. But those are ASCII roguelikes with tile interfaces. This has true ground-up, fully constructed graphics, sound, and music while maintaining the challenge and replayability of the others listed.\n\nHere's the love part of the relationship. This game is infinitely replayable. The different classes handle differently (ahem, other roguelikes that have nominally different classes that basically handle the same). This creates massive variety in playstyle. There is an epically huge amount of items and enemy types. Choices matter. Strategy matters. This is a roguelike with the greatness of a modern UI.\n\nThe hate part of the relationship. The recipe system was a hugely original and clever way to put persistence in the game without altering the gameplay or permadeath components. Unfortunately, it is a bit too steep. After 100 hours, I'm not even close to having completed the recipes. This drives me away in frustration every now and again. Once this part is completed, I'll probably enjoy the game more.\n\nThe other thing is that it takes a very, very long time to complete a successful run. This means you'll find yourself blaming RNG and the cruelty of the difficulty a bit much. Sometimes this drives me away. To be fair, this is an illusion. Anyone who claims the game is too RNG dependent doesn't know what they are talking about, and you can safely ignore their review. Go watch people who are excellent at the game.\n\nIf you play in the Easy - Hard difficulty settings, and you consistently die, then it is your own fault. Post a video of your run, and people will point out the hundreds of tiny mistakes you make each floor that caused you to die in the long run.\n\n\nAnyway, this game is excellent, and the flaws do not hinder it enough to ever truly pull me away. If you're a roguelike fan and you haven't played this yet, you're missing out big time.","December 16, 2015","true","157.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

You can't miss with this basic premise, but you can certainly sweeten the pot.  Making the loot drool worthy is a complicated exercise in tug-of-war: too strong, and you'll never find improvments, not enough and you have your players getting bored.  SotS deftly walks this tightrope with a deep crafting system and the depth of the game itself.\n\nLet me explain what I mean by that a little more:  The game is pretty difficult (if you're playing correctly :^)) but there are A LOT of cool things to find that can be a big help.  Whether it's a electronic chip that boosts your computer skill to max level, or a sick, sick piece of armor, every cool find is made cooler by the hope of getting deeper into your run they represent.\n\nYou start the game having to choose a difficulty (at least hard for the most fun) and a class.  The differences in the classes are refreshingly pronounced and greatly influence how the game plays out.  The Commando has a big advantage with starting equipment and stats, but doesn't grow as fast as the Scout (whom will get one or two shotted on the first few floors of the Pit).\n\nCombat is fluid and lovely. The game is actually turn based so standing still gives you time to size up situations and make a decision.  Everything takes place on a grid.  The game has a magic ability to shoot at the square you want even when you misclick.  Seriously, it's uncanny.\n\nAs with most roguelikes, your goal is to get as far as you can.  I think you can actually beat this game but it's harder than a mother ♥♥♥♥er.  Replay value is built in with the roguelike genre, but The Pit particularly so since the game changes even more than normal from run to run and class to class.\n\n8.4/10","November 29, 2013","true","24.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Between these two loosely defined and ocassionally overlapping categories, Sword of the Stars: The Pit is the latter. If you have experience with roguelikes, especially older ones, you have seen the elements that make it up before: heavily randomized level layouts, a prominent hunger mechanic to penalize idleness, and turn-based movement and combat. If all you care about is new game mechanics, this roguelike may not be for you.\n\nYet what Sword of the Stars: The Pit lacks in innovation it more than makes up for in polish, setting, and play style diversity. Each of the classes, with or without the additional ones from DLC, feels sufficiently different that relying on the same strategies in a universal manner is going to get you killed. With a host of stats and systems for gunplay, psychic powers and melee combat there is a class or two for everyone.\n\n\nChances are you will still die, of course. As rogue-likes go, this one is relatively forgiving, but the key word is relatively. You will still ♥♥♥♥ up and get murdered or starve, possibly several times in a row if you are unlucky or careless. If all you care about is getting to the end of a game, this probably isn't for you. If you can accept and embrace failure, however, Sword of the Stars has plenty of fun to be had on the way to the reaper.","October 9, 2014","true","9.0"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

It's a Rogue-like, and, if you know what that means, you're probably a fan of the type. If not, do a little research because the sub-genre isn't for everyone.\n\nFirstly, the game is very broad for how simple it is. There are a ton of interactable objects within the Pit to interact with, all relying on your particular class' skills and some RNG to determine the effect when using them. (Typically, pass/fail, but sometimes the reward or punishment can be greater than standard.) Tons of weapons, armors, utility items and the like to aid in your overall objective which is to reach the bottom of the Pit!\n\nThere's a crafting system in place, but you'll have to find the right Interactable objects and the recipes (sometimes, you can guess or cheat if you want) to craft the items. However, your recipes and 'deciphering' progress are saved across playthroughs, so you'll be able to access previously acquired recipes or progress to acquiring them regardless of your deaths. (And you will die, often).\n\nThe graphics are semi-retro but colorful and pleasing, and despite their somewhat lighthearted appearance, the game has this eerie feel to it that is enhanced by the imagery.\n\nThe audio is fine, nothing spectacular, but it isn't bad or unfitting. The soundtrack can become a little redundant once you've put a lot of time into the game, but the track changes ~5 floors. And honestly, I feel its atmospheric quality makes it acceptable 'background' music, in that it doesn't grate on your nerves.\n\nThe interface and controls are excellent. Straight-forward and for the most part, comprehensive. You can play the game completely without a mouse but I don't really see any advantage to it.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very different. You have 'moves' available displayed above your health/stats bars that dictates how many squares you can move before two things happen. 1) The 'time' increases by 1 point each time you exhaust your moves. 2) All the enemies on your particular floor will take their turn, whether or not it interferes with you. So it is at your behest to do more research on this style of turn-based play, I remember it being a little disorienting at first.\n\nAs time progresses lots of passive systems take effect, like your 'food' levels, health regen (you and enemies) buffs/debuffs etc. On the higher difficulties, time can become VERY crucial, making each step its own calculated decision. Some actions use 1 or more time units regardless of your Move allowance. Things like reloading or interacting with the world. There's a pretty sharp learning curve at the very beginning but it all makes sense very quickly and there are a ton of beginner guides that are far more comprehensive than this little review.\n\nALSO! Learn to make use of Ctrl+W/A/S/D this allows you to turn without using a move-unit, which is critical for observing your surroundings before potentially allowing the enemy a turn.\n\nI only just came back to this game after almost 2 years because someone commented on a forum post from way back. It reminded me how much I love this game and the punishment it can deliver. It's a great game by a great Indie company and it comes with a ton of DLC that add lots of little pieces and additional classes. My suggestion is to get it all at once, as some of the DLC adds quality-of-life and UI improvements that I wouldn't want to deal with anymore.

As I was playing, I eventually had a fatal thought. Why am I playing this instead of DoD, Dungeonmans, ADoM, or another vastly more enjoyable roguelike?\n\nI had no answer whatsoever and so I stopped - in the middle of a pretty good run that may well have led to victory - and uninstalled it. I feel better already.\n\nThe trickiness is that the game appears well-crafted and designed, and nicely executes on that addictive formula of needing just one more key ingredient or item to make a solid run. So you keep going, searching every crate and biopod for your holy grail. And when you don't find it and instead die, you think JEEZ I was SO close. And that thought, that sense of ALMOST is so overwhelming that you forget to ask yourself: was I even having fun?\n\nWell no, and here's why:\n\n-Every run begins with a boring grind. That's how it's designed. You have to be moderately idiotic or unlucky to fail within the first 10 or so levels, yet if you want to succeed in the later 20, you have to play those first ten conservatively and thoroughly. This means using your fists and knives to conserve ammo and durability - which means taking longer to kill every monster. You have to lockpick every door and station in order to raise your skills and get exp. This takes hours and it's not fun because...\n\n-Tactics and variety are both nil. Except for rare situations, combat tactics do not extend beyond conservation of durability and ammo. Most of the classes play remarkably similarly. The biggest difference is starting gear. But they otherwise have the same skills and stats, just different starting numbers... which primarily affect RNG success or failure. Weapons all function more or less the same. Not that it would matter anyway because the only choice you have is to use what the game gives you, and that's just how it's gonna be.\n\n-Inventory and itemization sucks. First off, as I said, nothing you get offers drastic new tactical opportunities. It's mostly just numbers. This bread can be combined with this meat to raise this hunger bar by this amount. This repair kit raises this durability number. This necklace gives 5 to your stats so you have a 1% greater chance at the RNG game. Nothing that will totally change how you play the game. Second off, crafting blows. Finding recipes is laughably grindy (and on some characters impossible), so basically everyone resorts to the wiki. But even using the wiki, I never once crafted anything cool. Not armor, not a weapon, not a robot friend to follow me around. At best, I put a scope on a rifle which -- yep you guessed it! -- gave me a slightly higher chance of winning the RNG game.\n\n-All of this combines to make death entirely unenjoyable and onerous. Which yeah kind of a weird statement. But not really. That's supposed to be a roguelike's modus operandi. Yeah, sure, your char permadies BUT here's some metagame progression to lessen the sting. OR hey that just means you get to try out a new character with totally different tactics! There is NONE of that here. You die - and it's 50/50 whether it was your fault - and that's that. And then you pick a character who essentially plays the same as the one who just died.\n\nBasically, if this were the ONLY roguelike available, I'd probably recommend it. Roguelikes are sweet. But there is NO particular reason to play THIS one. If you're tempted to buy it, don't. Get Dungeons of Dredmor or another roguelike instead. Or if you already own one, go load it up. You'll have more fun, I guarantee it.","March 31","false","17.1"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","29","49","0","0"

I never liked rouge likes or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ online card games (hearthstone, ♥♥♥♥ that toxic online casino for blizzard sheeple) that revolve mostly around RNG element. In the end, you feel that you have little to no control on whether you will succeed or loose. Maybe I simply suck with resource management in RNG games - I don't know nor I care.

The story is rudimentary and will neither surprise nor impress you from beginning to end, which is standard for the genre.\n\nThe game, with its DLC, currently features a single, procedurally generated 40-floor dungeon along with achievements, crafting, eight playable characters and four difficulty levels. Progress may be saved and resumed until death, which is permanent.\n\nCombat is turn-based and primarily involves guns and grenades but, since ammo is a finite resource, your fist and bladed weapons are there to back you up.  The bulk of enemies are either robots or run-of-the-mill insectoid and little green alien types.  In addition, you’ll have to deal with the threat of traps, status effects, starvation and equipment degradation.\n\nCrafting is necessary for survival and allows you to create food, medicine, tools and equipment out of components scavenged from enemies and containers.  Recipes can be found by decrypting messages on computer terminals and every action in the game requires you to pass a skill check with a chance to fail.  Electronics, computers, lockpicking, mechanical and medicine are a few examples of non-weapon skills.\n\nThe Pit is a traditional roguelike, where magic and generic fantasy have been replaced with uninspired technology and sci-fi.  Even so, the sci-fi setting is a breath of fresh air.  Despite feeling a bit slow at times, the game does a good job of forcing you to make the most of your supplies and surroundings.  Updates from the developer have been regular so I have to recommend it to fans of the genre, especially since professionally developed releases are few and far between.","April 8, 2013","true","20.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

It does everything a roguelike is supposed to do. Procedurally generated levels with a high degree of randomization. A class based system that can radically alter your playstyle as well as your access to items. An unforgiving difficulty that is a mixture of luck and skill.\n\nFrankly every roguelike does that, however, and this one has very little else going for it and a lot of strikes against it. For instance, you require food to survive, a resource which can be very limited. You get plenty of ingredients, but even if you do find a cooker it is most likely broken, requiring a skillcheck and a dice roll to fix. Even if you do fix it, you have to trial-and-error your way into a valid recipe, costing you precious resources with each failure. Even if you do find a valid recipe, that valid recipe can fail, consuming those resources anyways. It's a prime example of the artificial difficulty that plagues the game. Nearly every valuable item is secured behind some sort of skillcheck.\n\nCombat is clean and simple, but boring. Warrior types are simply left-click to win, while psionics-- the game's version of magic users-- have more options, but most will be constrained to a single attack spell until well into the game. Weapons and armor have durability and proper replacements are precious, forcing you into sub-optimal strategies in order to preserve your most valuable equipment from an unseen acid trap or simply usage damage.\n\nThe greatest asset to the game is its unique genre, as scifi roguelikes are relatively rare, and are helped by the Sword of the Stars IP by allowing you to play varied races in the DLCs. Despite that, expect to spend your first couple of levels fighting rats and bats all the same.\n\nAll in all, simply average. Would only recommend it to people who have exhausted the many other roguelike options and strongly needed a fresh challenge.\n\nTake a look at the gameplay here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNHDxZiYysY","January 28, 2014","false","1.6"," 37 of 66 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","37","66","0","0"

It's frustratingly difficult. Sometimes too frustrating, and sometimes too easy. Which is to say two things:\n\n1. The RNG in this game can be decidedly cruel or benevolent. Getting that one weapon from that one locker on floor 3 could mean the difference between dying on the next floor or 10 floors later. And then, sadly, sometimes you'll get that weapon and it'll be meant for another race. Or you'll get a power suit and you're not a marine (who plays marine anyway?). Considering the wide variety of items, and how exclusive many of them are, it stands to reason that they implemented my second point...\n\n2. ... that being the "blue rooms" on every 5th floor. Now, here's where you can basically cheese the game to make it easy, depending on how much time and effort you feel like spending. Every 5th floor there is a room somewhere that contains two storage units that can be accessed by any character on that same difficulty: one for experience, and one for items. A character who REACHES this floor may ONLY deposit into both of these, but they can deposit *anything*. Including all of your experience gained from level 1, if you chose to not level up your character at all, allowing you to donate a gigantic amount of experience (since it multiples your donation by 5). As well, you can donate any items, including any of your starting gear, which can allow for some nasty combinations. A NEW character that STARTS on the floor you donated to can access and withdraw from these, but not deposit.\n\nThis wouldn't be an issue to me if the system were implemented in an easier way. This is really my only gripe. A more thought-out way of giving your new character an edge based on how well you did/lucky you were on your last runs would've been appreciated--I choose to simply ignore the blue rooms.\n\nOkay, one more gripe: crafting. You'll find all sorts of stuff and have a hard time crafting. Your inventory will fill quickly and you'll not want to get rid of all the puzzle pieces you have for stuff. It's frustrating.\n\nThat's it, though. This game frustrates the ♥♥♥♥ out of me and I love it for it. Great survival gameplay, starvation is a very real threat (especially if you're Striker), as is running out of ammunition or having weapons break, things exploding, acid eating at your armor, traps destroying your favorite gadgets, poisons from annoying, screeching spiders with crazy movespeed that can kill you in a few turns, bullets that'll mow through the uncautious... fun for the whole family, really.","October 19, 2015","true","91.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There are 40 floors(with all dlc),5 difficulty modes,3 different game speeds(default for the normal gamer, the other 2 for casual gaming and people who want to play at a faster pace). The A.I is decent and not dumb,weapons have ranges + different accuracy rates,and abilities. Armor,weapons and items can degrade over time but be fixed. Devs are active with patches and any tweaks the community feels the game needs, and are responsive to questions of concern.Cheapest price for Gold (comes with mind games + gold edition dlc) was $1.74 @ amazon and $3.25 @Gamers gate over the winter 2013 sales. I advise you get the game with the mind games and gold edtion dlc(yes this is a dlc). Get the game already and have fun.\n\n##Detailed Review##\nDon't let its basic looks fool you,graphics although in a 2d style some might now like are well done.There are 5 various difficulty settings as well as game speeds(rate in which you can progress through floors).So the game should be good for the casual gamer,to the hardcore gamer.There are lots of skills you can level up with skill points + with use of the skills themselves.\n\nThe animations,environmental graphc effects are a nice touch. There are a number of races you get to choose that serve as the  character classes in the game. You have various status effects that can thwart your fight through the floors. In all 40 floors to fight through,various trap types to avoid,things to hack,safes to crack,things to forage through,food to cook etc.\n\nStarvation,illness,degrading armor and weapons are just some of the things that you have to worry about constantly.Weapons/armors can be repaired if you have the skill and the repair tool needed.Food can be cooked various recipes to make different things with chances of failure to make losing you the ingredients.Lots of craftable stuff in general.\n\nCombat wise with guns act as you might think ,shot guns have bullet spread,pistols have high accuracy but not limited range ,rifles can multi-target mobs per turn.Various melee weapons daggers,swords,etc,different types of throwables, and even psychic powers that have multiple types that function differently.\n\nMobs are varied quite well with different attack types,stats,behaviors,etc.The A.I. is pretty decent and they get tougher as you get deeper and deeper.Different environments/biomes make up certain sections of the floors as you explore.There are various debilitated items which can be restored (if successful) and then used.Lockers,beds,broken down medical items,etc can be found repaired or searched.\n\nAll the dlcs add character classes,weapons,armor,items,new mobs,new skills and more difficulty.Vanilla gives you 3 classes , Gold Editon DLC adds 3 more and mind games adds an additional 2.TBH I would suggest you get the whole thing as one package.Gamers Gate had SoTS:The Pit Gold for $3.75 during the 2013 winter sale and amazon for $1.74 durin the winter sale.Retailers outside of steam sell the game + 2 dlcs as Gold/Gold Edition.The devs actively patch and tweak things the community finds to be wrong.","December 27, 2013","true","96.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

The basic character classes seem a bit limited and don't offer any unique abilities although certain classes are more skilled doing certain things than other classes. It's a tough game to win because even on easy, other than unlocking doors, it is not forgiving. But it's usually hard because you can't find food, you can't find a gun or the right ammunition to fight, or you can't find ingredients to craft that precise recipe to cure disease--not because you died in combat.\n\nThe combat aspect of the game are indeed fun. The levels are small, yet rich with monsters to kill and other stuff to interact with. Every 5 levels down, the enemies gets tougher. Then at the bottom of the pit, the game becomes 20x harder than the first 29 levels combined because, well, they throw 20x monsters at you.\n\nOverall, the game is entertaining, but it primarily suffers from a bad crafting system that requires very specific ingredients for even the most basic items. Plus the crafting stations are usually nowhere to be found when you need them most. So ultimately you keep a bunch of items around in your backpack taking up precious space, but can never use them because that last ingredient will never be found. Still, five quarters was money well spent.","July 31, 2014","true","47.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Now with some skill under my belt, I never feel like the Random Number God puts me in an unwinnable situation except on very rare occasions. With your strategy, wits and a little bit of luck, you will pull through, and unlock safe rooms to start farther along. It's a fun system, and this game even has a story ingeniously implemented into a Roguelike; you find messages in terminals and desks, and must decrypt them. Some are random, some give much-needed recipes, and some still deliver snippets of story that lead you wondering what happened to Tamiko Hoshinara, the scientist recently vanished to the Pit, and why the twisted Suul'ka kidnapped her. It's dark, but comedic. It's challenging, but not impossible (except on the highest difficulty). Definitely a good buy, expansions recommended.\n\nWell, now that I've explored more, I can write a more in depth review. This game understands what it is to be a roguelike. It perfectly captures the fear, desperation, and loneliness of descending into a near-Lovecraftian monster's favourite toybox. Every step of the way you're worried about food, medicine, equipment, keeping armour repaired, finding food, but most importantly to what makes this game great: What that noise was. That deep throated growl followed by the stomp of a massive foot. It's the nature of the game, you never have any idea what's around the corner. There are monsters that are cannon fodder, ones that you will always shoot first to avoid the fatal diseases they carry, mechs to fill you wiith bullets, and of course, powerful, magnificent and terrifying monsters waiting around every corner that will make you their dinner if you aren't ready for them. As you descend (into perfectly created environments, with their own atmospheres might I add, every now and then there's a change of scenery that makes things more ominous- where can I get food here? What kind of enemies are there? From sleek hallways to blood splattered chambers, some of these wouldn't be out of place in a horror game), you never know what you will find next. And that's whats perfect about it. Mystery. Exploration. Atmosphere. It almost feels like you're there, if you can really get into a session. Kerberos? I cannot find another game that does this so well. Thank you so much. Final verdict: Buy it. Buy it now. It only gets better the more time you put into it, I have given it many hours and I suspect it shall have many more. Also get DLCs! They improve the variety many times over. I hope you find my enhanced review helpful.\n\nExpansion number three! The game has just undergone a massive overhaul and acquired a new DLC. HURRAH! Just a few comments here. I was noticing, I am encountering much more varied and surprising things much earlier along. Just by some different RNG, this game is now more than twice what it was before, every step you have to think- even early on, which was once merely finding food for the more dangerous lower floors. Never before has it been a better buy. Also expect my Juggernaut review soon!\n\nSorry to ramble in a disorganised manner, but character DLCs are highly recommended. Many a time, I have outthought my enemies as the Shephard, clobbered them under my warhammer as the Mercenary, and now, am in the process of watching them be torn apart by zombies as the skeletal Lich. The character expansions offer new and exciting playstyles, well worth the 2$ price tag per.

The controls are smooth and functional. The graphics are polished. The setting is immersive, and there is loads of content available even without any of the expansions.\n\nRoguelikes often suffer from too-steep a learning curve and impenetrable interfaces. Sword of the Stars: The Pit is really the first roguelike that has sucked me in without me feeling like I needed to do a lot of work to get into it. There's a tutorial, for starters. Then you can set a difficulty level. On easy, it takes a long time for the game to start feeling difficult - plenty of time for a new player to get used to it and confident in their ability to play.\n\nThen there's the atmosphere. You're sent into this place on a mission that really matters. No macguffins hiding behind an evil wizard here. You're on a mission to save an entire colony from destruction. People's lives depend on you surviving, exploring, and finding some sort of answer to their plague. There's not even a specific goal spelled out for you. No one knows what might be in there, but there's a chance there might be some kind of salvation, if only you can find it. You're on your own, and no one has ever come out of this place. There could be anything in here.\n\nAnd the gameplay really serves to increase that feeling. As you walk through the halls and decaying rooms, you hear the sounds of the creatures behind the doors. You can't see behind you (a fact that is graphically represented clearly and understandably), and there have been plenty of times when I've heard something sneaking up behind me and whipped around to find it about to try to kill me. There is a very serious survival element to this game. Food and resources are limited. This is not a dungeon strewn with discarded weapons and armor. Your equipment breaks down, and chances to repair it are rare. Items you discover are really valuable. Food can be very scarce. And around every corner are crazed robots and strange sentient blobs that ruin your precious equipment as they try to kill you.\n\nBut there are many possibilities for survival, as well. You have a starting choice of 3 classes (in the base game), each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and equipment. Raw physical strength is necessary, but there's also a frequent need for technical expertise, without which you won't last long. Fortunately, every character has at least some chance to learn every necessary skill. When you level up, you can choose a few skills to increase, and you also get skill points for successfully carrying out certain tasks, so it pays to take chances. Just be careful, because when you fail, you might set off an alarm or even make something explode in your face.\n\nMy only complaint is the recipe system. Some recipes for cooking and crafting items can be found by deciphering computer logs found now and then in the complex, but it appears that the devs intended players to learn mostly through trial and error -- and there are far too many possibilities for that to be viable. This is the one thing I needed a wiki for, and it seems silly, really. The game is difficult enough without making us destroy ingredient after ingredient trying to figure out what all that stuff is for. Fortunately, it's all been figured out by other players by now, so a wiki will solve the problem.\n\nAside from that one point, this is really a superbly crafted game, and I highly recommend it to everyone.","May 24, 2014","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You will not beat it in your first run as with any rogue like. But the core mechanics and game play are so solid you'll enjoy replaying it. Each time you replay the game you'll hopefully obtain a new recipe which will mean the useless crap you've been picking up as drops from monsters won't be as useless anymore. Not to mention you'll learn what to pour your points into for each individual class and more importantly when to STOP pouring points into a stat. As with any game based around luck you'll get bummed out when you have a sequence of bad runs but unlike don't starve or rogue legacy your first hour in any run will always be radically different.","May 5, 2014","true","58.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you use all your bullets at low lvl monsters at the beginning you possible ends up with your inventory full of useless guns.\n\nThere is so much more positive to tell about this game, but my advice is to really try it yourself.\nIt's more than Dungeons of Dredmor in space. It have a lot of detail, it's more random and in my opinion the graphics are more fresh.

Let me explain as I have put loads of time into this game and I keep finding new things to make/use/kill and I just love it. It is set in the Sword of the Stars sci-fi setting, there are aliens and it is set on a far away world. You have skills and equipment and there is a crafting and levelling system. Everything is generated from floor plans to encounters to the stuff you find and so the game is very replayable - but you only have the one life. If your character dies, he/she/it is dead and there is no coming back. But do not despair! Not all is for nothing, as recipies and decoded messages are available for other playthroughs and equipment and experience can be stashed for deeper starts.\n\nAnd get the gold edition.

The graphics are good enough for what they're supposed to do and the gameplay is easy enough to understand even without playing the tutorial. Assuming of course you have played a Roguelike of some description before. The biggest flaw upon the games release was the lack of content, so to speak, as only three classes were available to play as. For this reason I recommend getting the Gold Edition from the get go as it ups the number of available classes to ten. It also adds the gameplay element of psionics, which is the magic-version of this game.\nWhat however is probably the biggest critique I have for this game is the absurd ability of the RNG to absolutely shaft you. I had a perfectly good run once with plenty of ammo and weapons, but no food drops whatsoever, which doomed my run to end with starvation, which was actually pretty sad to watch given how it's not instant, but procedual death as your character becomes weaker until suffering the so called Stat-death or simply being overwhelmed by enemies because of the ton of debuffs that gets heaped onto you.\nNonetheless, if you're into Roguelikes and you want one settled in a Sci-Fi setting then I can wholeheartedly recommend this game.","November 30, 2013","true","46.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Pit brings a refreshing change to the saga as it introduces the world of SotS to players in the form of a dungeon crawler/roguelike. And what a way to enter the genre it is.\n\nI suppose the first thing to get out of the way is to mention that this game is hard. REALLY HARD. If you aren't a fan of dying over and over again in order to gain progress on your future runs, I suggest you to turn away and leave this game be. Don't let even the large variety of difficulty levels to fool you. Where as most games should never be played on any difficulty below Hard to experience the game how it should be, SotS:The Pit offers you a challenge harder than any I've experienced before when it comes to games and their normal difficulties. And of course in the spirit of roguelikes, every death is permanent. Every death is one step further in the line of progress.\n\nThe term roguelike might come off as the meaning of unfair to people who are familiar with it and SotS is no exception. It in fact takes the unfairness to a whole new level. The harder difficulties in this game are just brutal and they often don't even offer a realistic chance of it being teh urn. The whole grinding aspect will teach you to conserve ammo, items and just generally survive the life in The Pit better so you would have a higher chance of completing the game on your next venture.\n\nYou start off the game by choosing from a variety of different classes to play and truth be told, this is probably the biggest flaw of the game. Some classes simply cannot complete the game on harder difficulties unless you get extremely lucky. You should probably be using that amount of luck on winning the lottery though since that's an appropriate depiction of the luck needed. Once you have figured out the viable classes and the ones you love playing after several hours of dying, let the fun begin. Don't get me wrong, you can get most classes to work on most difficulty levels, but it's not really worth the effort.\n\nThe item variety in this game is really wide and the game even features a large number of crafted items. The crafting system is really enjoyable for only those who are really dedicated, hardcore gamers as the only way to discover recipes is to have high enough skill to access the computers you find in the dungeons. You are honestly just better off googling the recipes so you have even the slightest of clues about what half of the items you will find on your runs are good for. In the war that this game features, you will most definitely learn to conserve your ammo as it's very limited and you need to save every single bullet possible. Conserving ammo often means needing to learn which enemies can open doors and which don't and proceeding to trap those unable to do so in meaningless rooms.\n\nAll in all, I suggest this game for pretty much anyone looking for a good gaming experience and not getting butthurt over the game being cruel. Once you get into the flow this game will suck you in and you will keep coming back to it time after time. There's a fine line between the game being good and the player being masochistic. I endured it. Now it's up to you to figure out whether the game enthralls you or absolutely disgusts you, simply because the game is just that damn good if you happen to fall in love with it. At the current set price it's definitely worth finding out as this game will definitely offer you a superb bang for buck value.","February 27, 2014","true","108.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The point of the game is to get to the bottom of the 50 level dungeon (i think its 50, and im pretty sure it's 100 with the dlc). when you start you can choose from 3 different classes (5 with the dlc) each with different specialties and items they start out with. for each level you pass the game gets increasingly harder and new items and enemies appear. The game is turn-based because you get a turn where you can move a certain number of spaces, use items, open lootables and attack, and then the enemies get a turn. Although the turns go by so fast because you can only go 2 spaces each turn (with the marine), use items, or attack once, so you'll barely even notice its turn-based. personally its one of my favorite games of all time. everybody should play this.

The rouge-like dungeon crawling RPG provides a rewarding experience for novice and hard core players alike. The game offers a casual lvling system that probably will not appeal to players looking for an in depth character customization experience, but in turn offers a pick up and go go go experience. The action in the game flows fluidly and isn't hindered by lengthy and boring story lines. If your looking for a game with a great narrative you need not apply to this game or you will be disappointed. However if you are looking for a game that cuts all the BS out and delves into action, treasure, strategy, and crafting then this is the game for you.\n\nI personally love this game. I've been gaming for 24 years now, and i've played virtually everything. Most games haven't held my attention very long recently, but i logged 6 hours on my first session of this game. I've been wanting to play a game that cuts all the tired and boring stories out of the game for straight up action. This game delivers that. I can hop on this game and play for 10 minutes or 3 hours there will always be something fun to do.","March 30, 2013","true","107.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Are you faster or is it faster? Not to mention the level up system, HP bar, metoblism bar (Don't starve to death), psionic points bar, wide variety of different skills and characters...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/funkymoses/recommended/233700/","funkymoses","Funkymoses","http://steamcommunity.com/id/funkymoses/","194 products in account","The Pit is brilliant, but it takes some getting used to. If you're used to Roguelikes where everything must die you will end up running out of stuff and dying yourself. Fundamentally, it's about attrition. Weapons break, ammo is scarce, food is a real limiting factor. It's a constant, tense balance between forging forward at less than full strength and risking starvation, a balance between killing stuff for the XP and draining your ability to kill things. There's a shift that begins about halfway down; you go from gaining stuff to maintaining and then losing it as the enemies take more shots to kill relative to available ammo.\n\nThis means you're making choices all the time instead of whacking popcorn absentmindedly until you mistakenly whack a unique and die because you weren't paying attention.\n\nThere are two major problems:\n1. The crafting is vital but also highly annoying since recipies are hidden from you. It's kind of fun at first but eventually I just started wikiing it.\n2. The blue room mechanism veritably invites cheesing the game by starting characters, dumping their gear at level five, and starting over. It's tough not to do but removes a lot of what makes the game great. At the very least there should be some achievements for winning without using the blue room.\n\nDespite the above this is one of my favorite roguelikes ever.","April 5","true","471.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got hooked on this game through GOG when i got it as a freebee but Galaxy is so far behind on their updates and I liked the game so much I bought it a second time here on steam and all the updates to the last.\n\nAnd I didn't like it at first! I tryed it, and got my ♥♥♥ kicked. I thought, mediocre graphics and a game style and lore I'm not to familiar with / warmed up to, I'll just beat it quick and get on my way.\n\n100 or so hours later as a surprise to myself, the lore and gamestyle really was catching me... but I still hadn't beaten it! Make no mistake folks, this game may just drive you mad before you complete it....\n\nCons:\n- ridicuoulsy hard and punishing on later levels\n- random generation + perma death can sometimes mean a near unavoidable loss of many many hours of gameplay\n\nPros:\n- ridicuoulsy hard and punishing on later levels\n- supply management is tuned really tight so that everything from durability to storage space, to movement to food to ammo to weapon choice and armor choice must be managed correctly to make it far\n- great sense of peril and intensity the deeper you go\n\nBottom line, it's not one of those games that will likely have you with love at first sight but much like the dungeon itself the longer you spend in it the more intense it will get and less likely you are to escape it :p","April 13","true","318.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This carries across playthroughs in the form of an ingame database, another plus.\n+ What of it isn't flawed in design is well-polished.\n+ In terms of both metagame and individual playthroughs, the length of the game is pretty good.\n\n~ Decent graphics.\n~ Decent SFX.\n~ Acceptable controls, messy in areas.\n~ The vast majority of the items are highly situational, and because there are so many, any given resource is fairly scarce. Not all bad, since it usually just forces adaptive strategies.\n\n- Many categories of events are TOO random, the game's biggest flaw. This is most pronounced in poison, disease(both of which can randomly be fought off or worsen, but you cannot influence this in any way except direct usage of a health kit[which are uncommon]) and finding weapons(which eventually break, leaving you with absolutely no way to defend yourself).\n- Questionable balance between classes.\n- Levelups fully heal you and don't necessary need to be applied the moment your XP bar caps, providing a ready source of instant, full healing. Maybe it's an intended feature, but that doesn't make it any better.\n\nValue: $6.50","June 29, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
