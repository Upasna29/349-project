PINK!!!  Not based on the Aerosmith song, but because this game has an issue with everything showing up Pink.  How it manages to still remain on steam is a mystery to me.  I really wanted to like this game, but I couldn't even play this game.\n\nI don't remember when or where I purchased this game but I paid too much.\n\nIn case you can't figure out what I'm talking about here goes, the game starts up well enough, then you first notice the Pink, you won't realize it's an issue until you start to play the game.  It's there when the first card drops that you'll notice the card is completely pink.\n\nThink of that scene in Step Brothers, when Dale and Brennan interview for a job with Seth Rogan.  Everything is going fine and then Dale drops a nasty fart.  After that Seth realizes these two idiots in front of him aren't just being funny.\n\nIt's just like that with this game.\n\nAVOID buying this broken mess at all cost, unless you want to buy a game which will eventually be removed from steam.. which I have to assume this one will be..\n\n\n\n","February 27","false","0.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

All of the cards in the game display as pink rectangles. I tried to fix it - I really did. I tried verifying the game cache, and that didn't fix it, though it did find a file in error and redownloaded all 0 bytes of it. I tried changing the graphics quality, which did nothing except alter how laggy the opening video was. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and that did squat.\n\nDue to this, I can definitely say it's an issue with the game files players are given, and not something caused by the player's computer or a Steam glitch. There's no way for anyone but the developers to fix it, and they have yet to acknowledge it as an issue.\n\nI did see a couple of the menu screens, though, and they were...uh...decent, I guess.\n\n-- SOUND --\n\nIt sounds like a generic party game. Was not able to hear any of the sounds past the menu due to not being able to play.\n\n-- GAMEPLAY --\n\nDue to the graphical issues, I wasn't able to play in the slightest. Was sort of laggy, even on the lowest graphical setting, though.\n\nBut I can say that for a party game, I am noticing a distinct lack of multiplayer features. Hmm.\n\n-- SUMMARY --\n\nDon't spend your money on this game if you want something to play. If you REALLY want to play a Top Trumps game, you have other options. Better options.\n\nIf you did spend your money on this game, get a refund. Immediately. I can't believe this was actually published by the same people who published the Guilty Gear games on PC. It's awful.","January 5","false","0.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

But on to the actual review -\n\nTop Trumps Turbo is literally the dumbest board game I have ever played. And I've played some pretty dumb ones. It consists of comparing two user- or computer-selected (annoyingly, the game has no multiplayer with other humans) irrelevant statistics of the same type on cards. And, if you/the computer happen to reach the objective (spelling TOP TRUMPS TURBO at the bottom), you can totally lose it all if you don't make the cut during the showdown. Which is infuriating, because you spent all game building the objective up and now all of a sudden you lose.\n\nIt felt like the computer had total ESP at times, and the game felt like it was rigged when you got certain cards that you were absolutely bound to lose with. Also, the comparison didn't feel right - why would you choose which year is greater, wouldn't you want the item that's older to win?\n\nTLDR - opened game, it was crap, right click -> delete local content","May 14","false","0.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","2"

It is unplayable and has been abandoned by the developers.  I have no idea why Steam hasn't already pulled it from the store.\n\nTop Trumps Turbo has some form of coding error that causes most people to see almost everything as missing texture magenta.  This includes the cards.  You might be able to start the tutorial but you can't actually see any graphics.  Try playing a game of Top Trumps where you select your stat by clicking one of four identical hotspots on a sheet of pink.  Yeah, as I said, unplayable.\n\nThis problem has existed since launch (March 2015) and there are a few discussion threads about it but there are no solutions and no comments from the creators (who appear to have sold their computers and moved on or something).  I have to wonder why the company that owns the Top Trumps name has not stepped in and done something to remove this stain of a product from their brand image?\n\nAgain, DO NOT get this game.  Gamers, don't support absent developers.  Steam, don't allow unplayable games to sell for $20 in your store.  Multi-million dollar card game companies, don't license your brand to incompetent fly-by-night coders and then fail to quality check how they use your name.","January 16","false","0.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","1"

I do not like this game.\n\nThere is the obvious, very pink, elephant in the room. All of the textures were pink when I loaded up the game, it's easily fixed by changing launch options but I expected the developers to have fixed that by now. Graphically it isn't very impressive and looks like a much older game than something released in 2015. The music is kind of terrible too.\n\nYou aren't told what some of the statistics mean and whether it is 'better' to have a higher or lower value. I assumed that 'Hall of Fame' was how high in popularity they were in some ranking somewhere, with 1 obviously being the number 1 entry and therefore better. But it is the opposite.\n\nThere is no option to play classic TT either, with a whole deck being dealt and playing until one person has no cards. Currently it is more like really short (1-2 minutes at most) mini-games followed by a slightly longer round. I don't mind the mini-games but it would be nice to have the option to play with a full deck.\n\nLuckily I got a free copy of the game in a giveaway because I certainly would not pay £15 for this. I doubt it would even be worth buying when it is on sale. If you want to spend that much just go out and buy a few packs of real Top Trumps cards and play with your friends and family (or strangers on the bus).","May 28","false","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
