"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KitsuneRisu/recommended/338400/","KitsuneRisu","KitsuneRisu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KitsuneRisu/","590 products in account","I wanted to love this game. I really did.\n\nIt's with quite a heavy heart do I give this game a dreaded thumbs down, but there's honestly one rather large reason why, and  it can be summed up a simple sentence:\n\nThe game has no weight.\n\nFirstly, let me get it out of the way that the 30fps nonsense and the co-op controversy does NOT bother me much. Go read other reviews to find out more about it. It definitely affects the choices of other players and other gamers, but I just happen to be one who doesn't mind 30fps nor have any friends, so the issue didn't really factor in! If it does or doesn't with you, that's also something to take note of, and something that other people can cover better than I.\n\nBut getting to the meat of it, weight (or the lack thereof) is something that can be applied to a lot of things in this game. Let's go through the nibblets one by one.\n\nGameplay:\nUnlike every other one of Platinum's games, the fighting in this game feels hollow and lifeless. I'm not sure what it is, but there is this lack of a satisfying THUNK with every hit, almost as if things aren't even really connecting. Each slash and attack doesn't register with your senses, and were it not for individual life bars and body flashing, it'd be hard to tell that you did any damage at all. This is compared to other games in their history such as Bayonetta or Wonderful 101 or even Transformers where each punch, each special power and each defense carries a lot of, well, punch. I'm not entirely sure what's missing, but something is.\n\nStory:\nThe story is also kinda weightless in the sense that there's really a lack of a single thread tying anything together. The first few stages (1 - 6) can be played in any order, which means that as far as a cohesive story matters, it's simply a case of 'fight here until the boss shows up and then fight him' in terms of the micro-story, and nothing more than 'the Foot is up to no good' as an over-arcing plot. Now, while this is not necessarily the worst thing, and there ARE a lot of games which are very good that don't rely at all on plot, it's just something that would have worked better in favour of this game specifically, since the game tries to pretend that it has one. Since the game isn't linear, they can't really write good intrigue into each chapter without it just being repetitious. So why bother? The work could have gone into making each chapter more self-contained, and have the game be about missions out there in the wild instead.\n\nStage Mechanics:\nStages sort of occur as follows:\n- Go to area\n- Do random stuff in area until boss is triggered\n- Do boss\n- Party tiems winrar\nNow, the issue I have with this is the randomness of the 'random stuff'. The game is kinda unashamed at admitting that nothing really matters or has anything to do with the actual boss fight or plot of the stage itself, so the weightlessness comes in in this point with how redundant anything is. For example, in Rocksteady's stage, the 4 random 'quests' I had to do was carry 8 billion bars of gold across a platform with Sudden Death Lasers hindering me, deactivating 5 bombs in an area, and checking computers to find out where the Foot Clan was not once but twice in two seperate events. None of these have anything really to do with the actual story. Checking computers, alright. Sure. But the randomness of it (since the computers literally just spawn into the ground rather than being in intelligent locations) makes it feel like a slap-dash job with no real forethought. Also, carrying gold? The delivery point was literally just across the platform, and the only reason why it's difficult is because lasers suddenly come out from NOWHERE to hinder you just for that one sequence, and then you leave the gold on the floor at the other end and it's okay, I guess. Why is there gold being stolen in the subway, even?\nWhile I admit the randomness actually does give a really fun feel of a 'living' world, it was just not implemented on any meaningful scale to me, and I found myself distracted by it more than having fun.\nBesides, the big joke is, once I finally HAD used the computers to 'pinpoint' the location of the Foot activity, it just turned off a laser door that was the first thing I saw in the entire stage and said to myself 'there's something behind there'. The game is far too dumb for itself, and Platinum has known to be a lot smarter. Something got into the water, and it must have been old pizza.\n\nVoice Acting:\nIs terrible. Is hollow. None of them sound like they mean what they say. There is a line when one of the turtles dies that is horrendously delivered. It is a stutter where each single syllable is prounounced as if it were its own word. This is weightless because you don't feel like the actors mean it. There's no oomph. There's no flair, and no style. It's terrible.\n\nVisual Style:\nActually this one's pretty freaking nice. I have no problems with it whatsoever.\n\nControl:\nOutside of the fact that hits don't feel like they hurt, the game controls pretty good, really! So again, I have nothing to say, and this is a big plus in my book. Oh yeah, they run really slow, though. Doesn't feel like they're moving fast at all.\n\nFighting Mechanics:\nThis one's weird. This one is a negative in my book, but not because of lack of trying. I like the idea of using all four turtles. What I DON'T like is how complicated it is to use them. Each has their own inventory and load out, which is cool. Each has their own fighting style, and way of doing things, which is ALSO cool. ALL FOUR SWARM YOUR SCREEN LIKE IDIOTS, which is not cool. Quite a lot of the time, I find myself not really having to do much since my cool bros do everything for me. Setting the AI to just hang around turns them into bricks, in a way that they don't really do anything at all. The game, unfortunately, is balanced for the swarm, since there are infinitely-spawning enemies who try to swarm you back, and certain enemies and bosses have unfairly huge life bars to make up for it. The game wasn't built around the idea of you being a turtle fighting. It was centered around the idea of you playing a team, AS a team (sorta wonderful 101 style) but it didn't really work out. Individual action is confused with action of the group, and in places where it should be handled as a group, it doesn't, such as life gain. You get one new 'pip' of life for every 500 points of score you earn while in a level (which resets to default every time you start a new level), but it only applies to the turtle you're controlling at the time. So if you favour one, he gets a load more life and others trail behind. Yet, when you fight by yourself, you EASILY get swarmed by certain types of units, such as those chain-ninjas that basically spam and lock you up. A lot of in-game actions take a heck of a long time to complete too, upwards of 20 seconds by my estimate, and your AI buddies need to keep enemies at bay.\n\nBut at the same time, you can switch between any of the turtles on the fly, which don't share life gain, but DO share item usage (I think? Maybe not even then!), and... it's kinda confusing if the game is supposed to be a character action game or a characters actions games with too many plurals.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nI bought this game because I like TMNT games, and Platinum is cool. However, it doesn't mean they can't sometimes make mistakes. Everyone has to, once in a while, and sometimes our favourite franchises are sorely mishandled. I've already refunded this game to purchase Transformers Devastation again on this computer because it's far, far better. I appreciate Platinum for trying, but if there's anything I can say about this game, it's the shiniest movie tie-in game that I actually know of (since the TMNT movie is coming out soon, eh!)\n\nWell, they tried. And so did I. And so should you, if you like TMNT. But don't expect anything more than just a polished pile of steaming hope.","May 25","false","1.3"," 183 of 223 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","183","223","5","4"

I would even say that the game is guilty of false advertisement with Platinum Games' claim of skipping the local-coop in order to get the 60FPS target. However, that's the least of this game's issues. While there are a few good ideas going of it, TMNT: Mutants in Manhattan not only feels rushed with little to no thought into its gameplay, but also manages to be so unompimized making this game run worse than Korra.\n\n\n\nPros:\n-The 4 turtles play different from one another with their own individual moveset players can customize\n-Challenging difficulty levels is that one could expect from Platinum Games\n-There is some variety to the missions in each level before reaching the boss fights\n-The IDW artstyle helps to bring some style into the game\n\nCons:\n-The game feels unoptimized with some bugs present which might crash the game in some cases\n-No local-coop\n-Game is locked at 30FPS\n-False Advertisement with the devs claiming that they had to leave out local-coop to imply to keep the 60FPS target\n-Boss fights can drag on to a point where it can over stay its welcome\n-While there are some decent gameplay mechanics, with all 4 turtles going at it either playing by yourself or online, everything turns out to be too much of a mess to keep up on whats going on to a point where theres almost no thought to the gameplay\n-A number of the missions are just too tedious to do\n-Estimated playthough is to be around 4-6 hours\n\n\n\n\nVertict: I give this game is a big NO recommendation to this game. Simply put: avoid this title. Its not worth spending the $40 price tag ( or even half price for that matter ) for a title that runs worse than Korra. Ontop of the uninspiring gameplay excecution and how the game is unoptimized, Platinum Games should be ashamed of the false advertisement about the 60FPS. Your money is better spend on any other Platinum Game title available on Steam. I would go as far as to say that even Korra tops over this game. With that said, I dont fully blame Platinum Games since most of their titles had much higher standards and are more well recieved. Hopefully they can completely drop Activision as their publisher and move on to a better company that will allow Platinum to put more development time on their future titles instead of just rushing out as a sort of quick cash grab.","May 24","false","2.0"," 321 of 423 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","321","423","8","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DocMedusa/recommended/338400/","DocMedusa","VERY fast doggo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DocMedusa/","408 products in account","I really want to like TMNT:MiM. It's made by Platinum, it's a turtles game, it has freaking ARMAGON in it. So why is this not a recommendation?\n\nCombat feels...weird.\n\nYou're always accompanied by three AI controlled turtles, who are always fully involved in all combat. This makes fighting in general very unorganised and chaotic. The enemy AI has four targets to randomly pick from, targets you might be trying to attack get knocked away by another turtle, and generally I can't really tell whether I'm really contributing a lot since everything is just chaos.\n\nCombat itself incentivises the use of your special abilities and discourages actual light/heavy attack combos. All the specials give you a ton of iFrames, do heavy damage and attack several foes at once. Your normal attacks on the other hand are disproportionately weaker, rarely ever stagger anything, have odd hitboxes and generally lack "oomph" to feel satisfying. I felt like I'm supposed to chain burst all my specials and then try to get a parry/back attack in while I wait for the specials to go off cooldown again. That being said, the dodge/parry/block system is great and feels very rewarding while being not too strong due to the "dizzy bar".\n\nBoss fights suffer a lot from the chaotic combat system. I only fought Bebop and Armagon, but both pretty much ignored me and only targeted my allies, leaving me free to give them a nice back massage with Donny's staff. Until the other turtles got KO'd and I had to actually pay attention for a minute or two, then they respawned. And this cycle is inevitable, since their AI does not seem to move out of the red death-telegraphs, ever. On top of this, the bosses are so-so. Bebop felt nice and unique, with a couple of interesting attacks that required me to employ adequate counter measures, like coverding the floor in explosives so I had to carefully pick a safe gap between the explosions or climb up on some balconies. But Armagon is a terribly shallow one-trick-pony. Obviously I can not comment on the other bosses. I would probably like them a lot more if there was the option to be permanently alone and not have the boss' attention taken away by my endlessly respawning fodder-friends.\n\nLevel design reminds me a whole lot of No More Heroes. In both NMH and TMNT:MiM you roam a sort of open map and do little "side jobs" or events until you unlock the right to attend a boss fight. Here, you're beating up small groups of enemies, collecting loot on a timer, destroy rampaging cars or try to survive for a set amount of time against infinite respawns. Most of these events felt alright and they didn't repeat in the two levels I played, but they weren't particularly thrilling either. With the boss battles falling kind of flat, I can't really let this game get away with the tedium-foreplay like NMH, though.\n\nOn the positive side, optimisation is amazing. My toaster-esque old laptop runs this game really nicely at medium settings without significant performance problems, and it looks pretty alright (if you like the art style of course). The frame lock is inconvenient, but for me it's not the absolute gamebreaker everyone and their dog seem to perceive nowadays. The four turtles don't play like carbon copies, but they're not vastly different either. They convey their intended character through chatter and cutscenes nicely, although Mikey being the bottom joke in absolutely every single cutscene I've seen gets old fast. Combat controls feel decent, but as I said, gameplay itself is chaotic and burst-oriented. The level up system seems to offer some replayability, as do the three initial +1 unlockable difficulty settings.\n\n\nSadly, steam reviews are binary. I'd much rather give TMNT:MiM a "give it a try and refund if combat doesn't click for you" than a thumbs down. It's not a bad game in my opinion, but it doesn't provide the kind of gameplay I was looking for.","May 24","false","1.4"," 167 of 222 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","167","222","5","2"

The elements adapted from the original are fine, but the core mechanics feel rushed and unpolished.\n\nSpeaking of a disappointment...errrrr\nI love Platinum Games, I love TMNT, I tried to love this one, but I just can't.\n\nI love Bayonetta. Bayonetta is the type of game that looks totally chaotic during every single battle, but everything are still managable and under the players' control, and all the rewards gained from skilled play go right to the players themselves. That's the reason why traditional action games are so addictive for the players who are willing to spend some extra time to dig into the game: we, as players, are achiving everything, and it feels like it.\n\nIn the case of TMNT:MiM, everything still looks chaotic but...not really under my control. When my AI allies just run right into the crowds of enemies, I hardly stand a chance to pull of even a single complete set of combo without missing one or two slashes, then everything ends when you haven't even figured out what is going on on the screen. While the dodge system is still a thing this time around, the reward couldn't justify the precision demanded to pull it off. Enemy's attack indicators(both visual and sound) are inconsistent and difficult to read especially in the middle of a chaotic battle, and the camera angle can even make it worse in some indoor sequences.\n\nSomething new for Platinum action games are implemented in this game for sure, like the open world design, but the idea overall is poorly executed and the set pieces just simply doesn't work with each other. I appreciate the art direction they have taken, but the environment of the levels doesn't have a lot of variety by each one of themselves, and they can feel bland and samey over time easily since you often have to spend some time explore around these levels. The quests are usually series of fetch quests, which I wouldn't even bother to talk about.\n\nThis game is far away from those actually demanding traditional action game titles, so 30fps is totally playable. However, with this level of graphical technologies implemented, this level of performance just couldn't be justified, despite the fact that the team mentioned that it would be targeting 60fps on all platforms. The fps is still capped even you turn off v-sync is straight up stupid.\n\nWhat bugs me the most is the prerendered cutscenes. They look no better than the actual gameplay from a technical perspective which means they can totally be replaced by real-time rendering, and the cutscenes themselves have constant noticeable frame dips. Such level of unpolishedness just couldn't justify its price tag.\n\nBut there are still some upsides: the writing is still what you can expect from TMNT, the characters are there, and the facial expressions of the turtles during the cutscenes are really impressive.","May 24","false","5.9"," 68 of 107 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","68","107","3","0"

Actual combat is fun enough, and probably way better with other people. The combat system  feels like a watered-down version of God Hand. It makes ense I guess. There are now 4 players in the game instead of just the player you're controlling, so a lot of stuff is going on.\n\nBut I just want to touch on a few negatives real quick with the game:\n\nThere's no local co-op.\n\nLeel design is pretty bad. At times, I wasn't sure where I was even supposed to go. Even so, the levels don't offer anything really interesting. I think it would've made more sense to have the game be 2D instead. Each level feels like you just walk around looking for guys to beat up until the game tells you a boss is coming.\n\nAnd then there's some weird issue with the game menu. Everytime I would change the game resolution or a few other display options, my game would lock up. I'd hit ctr + alt + delete and the game wold unfreeze. But this was a consistent problem.\n\nOh, I was also getting some weird graphical glitch in the game. On the left side of my screen I would have a vertical line running down the side. I think it had something to do with me changing the game to full screen, but the game not completely realizing this.\n\n- The game is not bad. It just should be way better than it is. Combat is fun, and probably a blast with friends.

The levels are seriously bad, expecially the sewer ones. You eventually reach the stage boss which is the fun part, I guess.<\nWell, ok, I had fun with the Megakrang stage. But still.\n\n- Difficulty balance is very bad. If you enjoy playing on hard like I do, this game is gonna get tediously annoying and completely not fun by the time the only enemies are rock soldiers. In fact, all difficulty does is increasing enemy HP, decreasing yours, and giving you 1 less continue. Which is fine, mind you, it's just not cool when it's designed so poorly that it will take you forever to kill a bunch of rock soldiers in a quest on a later stage on hard mode.\nYou might argue you need to level up to play hard mode, but that's not it.\n\n- Music is just bad, boring, repetitive. It gets kinda exciting during boss fights, but that's it.\n\n- Ok what the heck is wrong with the character design? haha, with the exception of raphael, every turtle's face makes you wanna punch them. Just look at Donatello's face, he has that round nose thing that just kills the mood.\n\nConclusion: I am a TMNT fan (who isn't?) but this game feels lazy and rushed. If the stages were actually good, and the missions any fun, and if it was designed/balanced properly, then it would've been a good game.

I played online just so I could write a review about it, because I really enjoyed it.\n\nAt first, I was baffled at how this game could receive such mixed reviews, but the more I thought about it, the more it makes sense. That's not to say I think it's a bad game, I personally think it's great, but I also think it depends on a player's personal preference to see whether or not they'd enjoy it.\n\nThe simple beauty in Mutants in Manhattan is that it's little else than what it claims to be; a love letter to die hard TMNT fans. That being said, it's probably going to be much more enjoyable to that kind of audience rather than to just any gamer who could be more or less indifferent to the turtles.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Very enjoyable to those who liked the great old SNES TMNT games like Turtles in Time and Tournament Fighters\n+ Fun, challenging gameplay and boss fights\n+ Sandbox-esque areas for each level with randomly generated mission assortments that increase replay value\n+ Introduces fun elements previously unseen in past Turtles games\n+ Some pretty nice music in a good number of parts in the game\n+ Pick and customize whichever turtle you like at practically all times\n+ Many things that will please Turtles fans of any kind, especially rewarding for longtime/devoted ones\n\nCons:\n\n- Not for those who place exaggerated importance in graphics (I'd recommend using CPUCores if it really bothers you that much)\n- No local multiplayer\n- There's so much pizza in the game you'll go insane with hunger and place an order for delivery that'll hit your wallet harder than a Steam summer sale\n\nIn summary, Mutants in Manhattan is, ironically, a lot like a distinct type of pizza; some people love it, some people hate it, and everyone has a different opinion about it.\n\nMy recommendation in the end is this;\n\nIf you're a gamer looking for a fun time, but aren't necessarily crazy about Turtles, carefully consider it, check out gameplay videos and maybe see if one of your friends has it and will let you check it out.\n\nIf you're a TMNT fan, it's a strongly encouraged buy; you could always just refund it if you end up not liking it.\n\nEither way, if nothing else, it's a much better game than the only other TMNT experience currently on Steam (Out of the Shadows).","May 25","true","0.1"," 58 of 95 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","58","95","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrastikmeasure/recommended/338400/","thedrastikmeasure","Draul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedrastikmeasure/","3252 products in account","Product received for free\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Mutants in Manhattan is the newest action game by PlatinumGames. Through the years PlatinumGames has made a lot of these 3D beat-em ups. Most of their games are very similar to one another and Mutants In Manhattan is really no different... Sort of. The one thing I can never figure out is how they go from making Bayonetta to making something like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Mutants in Manhattan. It isn't just the style or IP in question it is the quality.  Last year we had Transformers Devastation and it was a pretty decent game. The action was fun and kind of flowed together. This year however we have Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Mutants in Manhattan and things are so much they same... that they aren't... Let me explain.\n\n\n\nWith every Platinum Games, game you have the heavy action game with combos, dodging, jumping, parrying, blocking, and consumables.  EVERY SINGLE game by Platinum is like that. They all also have some sort of character progression be it skills, new abilities, or items. None of that changes in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Mutants in Manhattan. However the problem is the combat doesn't really flow all that well together, and it isn't nearly as fun to watch.  In Transformers Devastation you have giant robots using big weapons and yet somehow they manage to feel faster, and move better than the NINJA Turtles do. Yes, Turtles, but... Ninjas ? Eh, maybe I should focus on the turtle part, but anyone who has ever watched TMNT knows that they are more Ninja than turtle... Well that and pizza loving maniacs.\n\n\n\nOn the very first mission it is a semi open world level where you can move around the map, fight foot ninja's and explore. There are a few collectibles to grab but ultimately your using your T'Glass to find the mission targets and defeat them to trigger the Boss Encounter. The first boss being Bebop. Now I was playing on Normal and I am pretty use to Platinum Games so I am no slouch when it comes to combat. Yet Bebop has 7 bars of health! SEVEN! It takes freaking forever to beat him. I'm not really dying. It isn't difficult. It is just bland. After about three health bars it just gets old.\n\n\n\nThen you realize right from the start you can skip around missions in any order. Right from the very beginning. So when I was playing with twitch partner ReclaimJoey we went from Bebop to Shredder. From the first boss to the last one. To get to shredder we did this 15 minute elevator ride where we fought the same 3 or 4 mobs then finally got to the tower to fight Shredder himself. He was easier than Bebop was.  Seemingly that you don't need any real progression to fight any boss. Ultimately making the entire progression system rather pointless. We would have beaten Shredder to if not for having lost connection while playing. Then the kicker there is when I got disconnected it sent him to a continue screen without warning and it happened so fast he ended up pushing do not continue or cancel. Thus if we wanted to fight Shredder again we would have to do that very boring 15 minute elevator ride all over again.\n\n\n\nThe music for the game got so extremely repetitive I would rather have jabbed screwdrivers into my hear lobes than having to listen to the music again. Now the dialogue isn't to bad, and honestly might be the best part of the game. They managed to capture the essence of every Turtle and villain very well in the game. It very much reminded me of the ORIGINAL TMNT cartoon back when i was a kid.\n\n\n\nThe game as I mentioned does have online co-op. I did the first mission with Bebop two or three times and never really had any issue. However once I tried playing with friends then the connection issues began. Which I mean it worked about 70% of the time which is more than I can say for the last TMNT game that came to steam. Then finally we have something a lot of gamers hate. They decided lets lock the games frame rate to 30 fps. WHY?! I mean sure It doesn't bother me all that much because for several years my hardware didn't let me play games for more than 30 fps anyway. However with the new technology there is no reason to do that so I would love to hear some sort of explanation on why devs still do this.\n\n\n\nI was very excited for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Mutants in Manhattan because it brought me some nostalgia from when I was a child. I was a huge TMNT fan. I had the van they drove, all the action figures and play sets. My friends and I would set up this elaborate play sessions. It was amazing. The cartoon was amazing, however the game... just let down after let down. I have never really felt so disappointed with a video game until I played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Mutants in Manhattan. I think, no I KNOW Platinum could have done better. Just look at Bayonetta 2.  Hell even The Legend of Korra was a good game. Heads and tails better than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Mutants in Manhattan, and Korra was like 15$ at launch. So there is no way in hell can I recommend Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Mutants in Manhattan to anyone at the price of 39.99. This is a 15$ game at best and even then I am not to sure.\n\n\n\nPros:\nCaptures the Essence of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Franchise\nCo-op\nDouble Team Combos\n\nCons:\nMusic is annoying\nCombat is repetitive\nBosses are way to long\nGraphics are not all that great\nLocked 30FPS\nOVERPRICED\n\nDraul gives Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Mutants in Manhattan a Drastik Measure 4 out of 10 (40)\n\nwww.TheDrastikMeasure.com","May 27","false","2.3"," 47 of 76 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","47","76","3","2"

But the gameplay itself has all the depth of a parking lot puddle.\n\nThis combat system, first of all. Even Korra had more complexity. You have your light attack mash string, your heavy attack mash string, and maybe, MAYBE one or two others that you can get by switching over (XXYY, YYXX) midway through. That's it. No pause-based combos to reward players who don't mash, no charge modifiers, no nothing. Normally I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that this was it, since some action games wall off their attack variety behind upgrades and grinding (Plat is usually better than this, typically only walling off utility special moves, but that's neither here nor there), but this game doesn't. ALL it has is upgradable Ninjutsu. The game doesn't even have a combo list of any kind, that's how ludicrously simple it is.\n\nAnd, really, it makes sense. Every attack in the game with any interesting properties is available on that Ninjutsu radial, with an associated cooldown, and that's as far as they thought it through. There's no forward-forward attack to close gaps or PKP string alternation to get a quick knockback; you don't have to THINK about your attacks at all. If you want to gap close, you press whatever button combo you assigned "gap close" to, and then wait until you want to use it again. There's no variety, no style, no room for player creativity. You just MASH. Mash mash mash mash mash.\n\nBut honestly, that's to be expected, because the game has an even MORE glaring flaw, which is the AI. It cannot be disabled; all four turtles are on the field at all times. That means that at any time, there are 3 Very-Easy-Automatic-tier Mommy Mode AIs playing the game, and they basically play it for you. Stand back in Shuriken Aim mode and toss pot shots off your infinite ammo and marvel as the enemies swarm the AIs, the AIs fight back, and the cycle repeats itself. If you ever find yourself unlucky enough to be sideswiped by a wayward enemy and killed, don't worry, the AIs will arrive at your side and revive you. Again and again and again. I'm rapidly coming to conclude that the only way to LOSE this game is to get so bored of it you quit, and that's playing on HARD mode FFS.\n\nI even tried setting up a private room in Multiplayer as a lone turtle, hoping that maybe this (even if it cost me switching mechanics) would grant me some reprieve from the AI, but no. The only part of the game I honestly enjoyed was the very beginning of the tutorial, before the game spawns the AIs to teach you how to use them. It's just you and Leo and an enemy in a sewer, and you get a taste of what this game might have been once upon a time.\n\nAnyway. So we have this game. It has no combat depth and no room for style, and an AI that always goes All Out (you can tell it to Wait, or to Protect, or to Follow, but because the AI logic automatically defends itself when enemies are in range, and enemies are ALWAYS in range in an encounter scenario, it essentially amounts to the same thing whenever there are enemies around). Basically the objective of the game is to race the AI to the encounter, mash on some buttons, and hopefully not notice that the keys you're pressing don't really have any sort of impact on enemy behavior one way or the other. If the enemy is flashing red, your attacks fail automatically, which is supposed to be an incentive to dodge, but you never bother to get good at the dodge mechanic because the game has no rhythm and there's no room to be defensive or to play with the type of ebb and flow that makes Platinum games so magical... If you try to wait for a window, the AI will swoop in and wreck your fun, so it's like "why even bother?"\n\nIt's as if the game tells you "forgot how to mash? Don't worry, I'll mash for you!"\n\nHideki Kamiya pioneered anti-mashing mechanics in his action games. The timed combo presses in DMC, the charge modifiers and dodge offset in Bayonetta, Witch Time (or Focus in TD), these mechanics all taught the player to press when stuff needed pressing. To develop a sense of rhythm and purpose behind every action, rather than just void the warranty on their X and Y buttons. This game pisses all over that legacy of intelligent action game design and becomes bottom-barrel nonsense. Even Korra had more depth, at least its parry-counter-QTE system demanded SOME amount of timing and attention.\n\nThe saddest part is that there's a glimmer of something good there. There's the fact that every turtle has a rising-uppercut attack for juggle starting by light-attacking right as they jump. There's the brilliant (if cooldown-timer-tainted) dodge/block just charge combination mechanic, which enables you to essentially hold down the dodge's i-frames at a slow-motion move speed, and rewards you with a parry if you RELEASE dodge right as an enemy attack hits (so you have two separate windows; tap dodge right as it hits to back attack, release dodge right as it hits to parry). There's the grappling hook item. There's the surprisingly fluid movement mechanics that really do make the combat more interesting in open arenas... There's even the MGR-style semi-stealth elements, which combine with the movement mechanics to reward flipping roof to roof around enemies to start the fight behind them.\n\nI don't know what happened. Whatever poor unsung intern came up with THOSE mechanics should be asked to direct the next ActiPlat tie-in, maybe he could live up to the amazing legacy left by Saito with Transformers. This game takes everything that wasn't good about Korra and makes it worse, and discards every glimmer of interesting mechanics at its heart. I don't know if it's the fault of Eiro Shirahama, or Activision meddling, or if it's just a question of time and financial constraints, or what, but this game is a big, fat, wet nothing.\n\nIf you're considering this game because you're a fan of Platinum's work, and you're looking for a tide-me-over until Nier or Scalebound is released, look elsewhere, this is a trainwreck. If you're only in this as a fan of TMNT... save your money for something with couch co-op.","May 25","false","0.8"," 40 of 64 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","40","64","0","0"

You cant really fail a level unless you try to do bad. Now coming from someone who thinks games now a days hold your hands too much, you may disagree, but everytime a character is knocked out they instantly get replaced by the next turtle and while that character is out you just have to wait for them for about 10-20 seconds to respawn. Only when all 4 turtles are out at the same time will be the only time you can fail.\n\nThe combat is ok but it gets really repetative. The problem with combat is that they focused all of it in this lame ninjitsu stuff that act as special abilitys you can use and have really long cooldown times. Honestly I would have rather had more combos added to each character than this ninjitsu stuff. Having only 2 different attacks and 4 lame special moves makes this game get old real fast.\n\nThen there's the locked 30FPS that should have been 60FPS especially for a cartoony looking game such as this. There's really no good reason for this to not be 60FPS it just baffles me.\n\nIt just doesnt feel fun. Im kinda dissapointed. I had high hopes and this game let me down.

I'll start by saying the game itself is not bad, though the first level I was getting annoyed at the cc lock in some scenarios. If 2k had made this game using borderlands engine and physex, this game would look quite nice. While the art style is not ugly, it just could have been better if they had put a bit more effort into it.\nThe 30fps lock although not making the game unplayable, is just downright rude, and when companies undertake projects like this there should be strict regulation when it comes to PC games, as I didn't spend 3k on a pc to play these sorts of games on 30fps.\nThe combat in tmnt is also fast pace which is quite nice when you just want to hack and slash, but it lacks depth, keeping in mind I'm only a short way through. It has a bit of a JRPG style to it as which seems unnecessary and odd.\n\nTo sum it up this game is not terrible, though far from what it could be. Activision has insulted everyone and although I will keep playing it because I have nothing else to do, I hope they know what they have done, and even though nothing will happen because of it, I wish there were laws implemented into the gaming community to stop this. It's just a poor display and should not go unpunished in some form. It is also unacceptable for companies to give a release for a finished game when it is not actually finished, on the premiss that they will further patch and develope the game and this is okay because it will be fixed eventually. It is not okay, it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because by the time they fix it, people have already finished and moved on with the game. I'd give the game a 5/10 and Activision a 0/10 for effort, but they got their money so they will simply laugh it off.

And after I completed the game, this is what I felt afterwards:\n\nConflicted.\n\nI have a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game. Why? Here's why:\n\nAs a guy that loves to cause chaos in certain games or be in the centre of chaos, this is way too much. Too much goes on and it is hard to keep track of it all.\n\nThe controls on this are wierd. Like with every hit with a nunchuck, bo-staff, sai blades and katanas, I don't feel the impact of them. The guard button doesn't do this much justice as it also serves as a dodge and counter. But running, grinding and gliding feel decent plus the boss battles are the most enjoyable you'll be able to get out of this game.\n\nThe voice acting makes me feel like I'm watching some type of spin on the series, which is nice. Although, hearing the turtles thank each other and say their one-liners (which are very few) gets tiring as hell.\n\nI haven't tried the multiplayer since I was slightly intimidated by it thinking that I would jump into a very hard game, but I would have liked to try this with friends.\n\nThe characters look great with the cell-shaded style that Transformers Devastation had but the levels aren't that interesting. You got your typical city, sewer and krang alien hidey-hole levels to go through. There's also these 'side-quests' you have to do to reach the boss of each stage and they range from fighting a group of enemies, finding a hideout, defusing bombs and downloading intel, which is fine and all if it wasn't for the fact that there is so much of them.\n\n\n\nOverall, I give this a 7/10. It's alright as a beat-em up and a Platinum game. I would recommend waiting until a price drop on this (or if you have a console) buy a pre-owned copy of the game. But if you want a pure Platinumgames experience, buy either Bayonetta, Anarchy Reigns, MGR Revengeance or even Transformers Devastation.

You can get special moves and upgrade them, but they usually only have real application in boss fights, which are just huge health sponges that knock you out in two or three proper hits, at which point the turtles either enter a loop in which they get brought back, receive a single hit and need to be revived or they're out of comission for a minute until they get full health back.\n\nIf you got another three friends all willing to buy this forty dollar game then maybe it's worth it for the multiplayer, but the single player story mode was disappointing and made me regret purchasing this at full price.","May 25","false","3.7"," 21 of 37 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","21","37","0","0"

Back to a simpler time, when all we needed to get by was to have the ability to drop a few coins into a machine, pick our favourite turtle, and mash buttons like there's no tomorrow. We had fun, standing around the cabinet, kicking seven shades of Hell out of Rocksteady, Bebop and the like. And it was good.\n\nFast forward to 2016. And we're presented with this. And by God, it's pretty damn good.\n\nCan you pick your turtle? Check.\nCan you play with your friends? Check.\nIs it fun? Oh Man, check that box with enthusiasm.\n\nYou're given a relatively large sandbox-esque area in each stage, to complete "missions." These can vary from just blatently kicking the crap out of everything, to defending set items, such as (no lie) a pizza truck. Keep going until the Big Bad Guy shows up. The stages themselves can be traversed in anyway you see fit. Remember when you used to see the boys jumping across rooftops? Yeah, you can do that. You can grind on rails and power lines to get around faster too, just avoid getting (shell) shocked!\n\nCombat is fluid and fun, with the ability to customise each turtle's special moves for maximum efficiency. Wanna have one that's purely defense? Go nuts. You want all out damage? By all means, go right ahead!\n\nI paid Steam store price for this. So far, I haven't been disappointed. Voice work is on point, the game looks amazing in the IDW comic book style.

With all the negative reviews it's receiving I'm not entirely sure what people were expecting of it. It's typical Platinum fare with an emphasis on combat though admittedly it's a little lacking in depth compared to their previous titles, but to me it represents a modernisation of the classic beat 'em up genre which is where it delivers completely, this is the kind of game I would have pumped coins into back in the days of arcades only to return to play week after week.\n\nThe presentation in Mutants In Manhattan is amazing, the turtles have never looked better and Platinum have clearly taken time to incorporate characters and lore from all of the various TMNT series, though the game clearly takes most of it's cues from the IDW run which is to it's benefit as I consider that to be the best iteration of the turtles yet. The boss battles are fun though I would like to have seen more of them, it would have been great to go up against Alopex or The Rat King but the bosses we do get are represented perfectly, especially Bebop and Rocksteady. Perhaps my only real problem with the game is the lack of Casey Jones as he's always been my favourite character and it would have been a blast to have him fighting alongside the turtles and indulging some playful banter with Raph and April.\n\nAll in all Mutants In Manhattan is a great little game if you take it for what it is. If you're a fan of old school beat 'em ups you can't really go wrong, consider it is as a modern version of Turtle's In Time and you'll definitely have a blast with it.","June 3","true","9.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Rinse repeat.....rating 8 out of 10\n\nMultiplayer - You want to play this multiplayer that is the main focus.....more players the more fun. 8 out of 10\n\nSound - It feels and sounds like an arcade game.... 10 out of 10.....\n\nQuality - It runs smooth even if its locked at 30 and everyone I play with on Steam and Xbox one seems to love the game...there are minor glitches but it happens once in a blue moon. 10 out of 10\n\nStory - Meh for this being the IDW team with Palladium was hoping for a lot more....its a decent story but the same reused story feel from City fall arch in Mirage and the IDW and tv show of Turtles....almost every turtleverse has this where Shredder teams up with the Krang and they throw the city into war.....basically causing major distractions promising other criminals certain areas or items while they open a portal for the Krang to come invade and mutate the earth into another Dimension X suitable for the Ultroms who decided they are superior to everything and are their own hive species called the Krang....so meh 6 out of 10....they could have really had some cool moments with April Casey and Splinter but Casey is only spoken of....April is more of a side line 911 operator from the sewers letting you know different crimes or stats of your teammates nearby and Splinter is great in the cinematics but kind of creepy in the game over screens and seems like he is too lazy to aid his sons outside when the city is at war.\n\n\nMore Detail is listed below in more of a written review than a quick summary\n\n\nSo for the people who were looking at the trailers then making horrible reviews is because they wanted a bayonetta or Transformers type game which I do admit is fun but from what I saw in my own eyes was a homage to the original arcade and the old snes/genesis games. The defusing of the bomb feels like its straight out of Turtles in time at points, The action feels exactly like an arcade game from the 1980s with team up moves that do over the top explosions or animations, each turtle has their own special move as well.\n\nLeonardo has Turtle time which slows time down for all but the turtles...making you able to do mass damage.\n\nDonatello has Pizza Party or something like that....its basically healing circle but with 4 pizzas for every player and you throw it up healing or ressing them.\n\nRaphael is the one who gets the stealth...which comes in handy a lot causing confusion and take down damage\n\nand finally Mikey gets Cheerleader which refreshes all those special moves for all but Mikey.\n\nI love using Mikey and attaching Healing Circle, Turbo Time, and Combo Smasher.\n\nIf you do turtle time and then the other three almost back to back it makes a heck of a combo from healing, fast slashing, and cheering in less than a min which gives your team a massive boost and you invincibility to any damage when performing anything but Turbo and Healing.\n\nIf you and another do any of those moves together as in two different or even the same moves you make a combo turtle move smashing your shells together to do an explosion or dancing as a group to make all the enemies start dancing ect ect.\n\nWhen you level up the move it makes it a tad bit stronger but mostly the cool down is where those things are at....the higher the level the much less it takes to reuse.\n\nAlso the orbs in the game are kind of like the old pizza collecting during levels. The more orbs you collect the more free items from pizza, collectibles, and other weapons you get. This also raises your rank as well for the level as a group making s rank a whole lot easier on the harder levels...use turrets when you see them cause some enemies are only able to take damage when you break their attack with a counter and some explode if carrying bombs...\n\nMy suggestion for players is if you wanted a more modern version of the arcade co-op hack and slash which felt like X-Men or TMNT from the 1980s this is a perfect game for it....if looking for something to be overly cinematic with strategy on specific obvious points than learning how the enemy moves which sometimes feels Wingbat random then probably want to avoid this or at least the difficultly of Hard and up.\n","May 29","true","29.9"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

It's alright but very flawed.\n\nThe graphics are alright.  It's the same cell shaded look that was very pervasive in Transformers: Devastation and it lent itself pretty well to the action and allowed for very easy identification of what was out of bounds.\n\nThe turtles designs were somewhat disorienting at first with them looking more anime than I'm used to especially since it doesn't really look like the nickelodeon version but rather the current comic versions of the turtles.  As with the last PC ninja  turtle brawler April herself is an adult this time around.  Krangs' robot body in this game kinda lacks the oomph that the 80's Krang had with it's doofy robot body.  In fact in this game it kinda look generic.  Now he does have a second one that looks way cooler but that's endgame.\n\nThe partner A.I. is probably some of the best I have come across in this kind of game.  The other turtles when not being controlled by another player can handle themselves pretty well and need little saving from the player.  They will do things like use whatever super abilities that you have given them consitently along with combo with each other when possible.  They will also prioritize reviving fallen teammates so if one goes down, one of the other remaining turtles will break off from the battle and attempt to revive them.  I think they even use items that they have picked up along the way at appropriate times too such as healing items and mobile turrets.\n\nThe controls aren't bad at all and seem to be a slightlier simple version of what you had in Transformers.  That being said unlike that game you can't change the primary weapons that each turtle has but instead you can equip them with a variety of different super abilities.  A neat thing about this is that the super abilities can be leveled up and when they are it isn't leveled up only for the character that upgraded it but leveled up for whoever has it equipped.  So if leo and don have a level 1 ability and leo upgrades it to two then it will also be level two for don.\n\nAs far as the soundtrack goes.  Well it's kinda bland in a lot of places.  It feels generic and not really distinctive especially in certain stages such as the subway.\n\nI guess it's time to get into the some of the negatives of this game.\nLet's start thing off with the campaign mission or co-op:\nIn single player mode you can only start with the first stage and the others unlock as you progress through the game.  Now if you want to go back to an earlier stage you can but the level select shows all the stages in the game whether you unlocked them or not so now you have high chance of spoiling yourself on what's to come even if you don't want to.\n\nIn co-op it's even worse since all stages are unlocked from the get go and everytime you do complete a stage you have to use the level select to select the next stage since it always reverts to the first stage for some reason.  But the problem here is that it's entirely possible to just jump right to the final battle without even doing a single stage just after you bought the game.\n\nAnother bad point is that you can't even experience the games story in it's entirety in co-op mode.  The story related cutscenes that do show up in co-op mode are the ones that are in the stages themselves.  Heck once you beat the last boss you don't even get any resolution to the game.  Once the last stage related cutscene plays you get dumped back into the lobby.  No ending custscene no credits just the lobby.  So if you want to play the game for it's story and actually see it fully along with the games credits then the only way to do that is through story mode which is the single player campaign.\n\nThe game does have different difficulty settings with very hard being locked out unless you beat the game on hard.  However that can be bypassed by simply loading in multiplayer because along with every stage being unlocked from the start you get access to all the dificulties too.  Even Very Hard which is only locked out in single player.  So if you don't really care about non-level cutscenes and such and just want to play the game on Very Hard without doing it on Hard first then you can load in multiplayer start the game with just yourself and boom now you can.\n\nThe levels feel way shorter than they really are but they can also feel bland especially the sewer levels where at one point I forgot I was in a future sewer level because it looked exactly like the first sewer level and even had the same overall objective.\n\nThere are secret boss fight in the game but to get to those you just have to wail on the stage boss quick enough for the secret boss to show up.  Which was kind of disappointing I was hoping that it was an exploration thing that required you to explore the level in order to find them.  The secret bosses themselves aren't really that secret.  What they are is just the boss of the next stage coming in to help the regular boss.  You are not going to be fighting optional bosses.\n\nAs for the fights themselves. Depending on difficulty every boss will have the same amount of health bars.  For instance on my playthrough they all had seven.  If you managed to trigger the secret boss to show the secret boss had two and they make the fight exponentially tougher.  Overall though if done right you could end up in a fight having to deplete a total of nine healthbars to finish the grueling battle.  They all feel very samey until the last two.\n\nAll said this game could have been better that what we got.  I'll give that at least it's multiplayer works which is more than I can say about out of the shadows and playing with friends is fun and makes the game easier but then you would be missing story elements and the actual end of the game.\n\nOverall as I stated earlier it's a decent but flawed game with Transformers: Devastation being the better game.\nI hope this review helped you and would reccomend just getting the game when it goes on sale if you want to give it a try.","May 30","true","8.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

I'm use to long fights from some past games, but I do see why people would think them a tad bit long in comparason to fights of turtle games past. The difficulty curve can swing a bit wide at times from rather high, to rather low but does reward some decent timing and pattern learning like the ye old boss fights past.\n\nThere's special abilities to swap between your turtles, join in team attacks which is nice to see come back again to co op gaming, charms to give you various abilities like explosive throwing stars, and a bunch of items you can collect the usual gem type items to buy from Splinter in game by diving down obviously marked manholes along the way.\n\nCombat feels a bit loose, but tight enough that you can time some of those counters and jump on a bosses back. Stealth kills could've been a bit more fancy once in a while, but you get in and get the job done when they're not ready for you. When the fight is on, different patterns of light and heavy are the name of the game classic walk around beat em up style for a chunk of it and each turtle has his own style that make each their own in combat. And you are very much still a threat at range with throwing stars and those above spoken about special moves, four that have cool down times, and can be jumped in on by a friend to up the power for an all the more flashy move are very much present and welcome.\n\nArt is nice, I dig the soundtrack, particularly some of the metal tunes durring boss fights, dialog feels right, the venture though not always the best of level design still has some good ones, certainly feeling at home for the turtles with the variety of the streets with grindable railings, roof tops above, even higher sky scrapers, down in the sewers where you can water slide with the current in many of them and swing off of posts, so on and so forth. Art works out for this game plenty better than the last one and of coarse there is what I felt Platinum's Transformer game needed.\n\nCo op with your friends.\n\nToo me that's a high selling point and though not all of you out there can work an arcade like mine, or even find one near by, but I do believe in the meeting new people and bonding with friends as you get together and whip some baddies kind of experience. There should be more of it again and though it's not absolutly gone from gaming, I feel it should be all the more pressed. This game I feel does that more than just a little reasonably well. I saw a couple bugs on the day one release, but it doesn't feel like a regular thing and much of it feels patched up for the most part. Even when they were present, they were more comical for the moment than forever game breaking.\n\nHonestly one player, you can do it, but we know what most came here for other than the turtles brand. The best of the turtles has always been with a friend when it comes to the games, and if they made this one one player, it would've been a crying shame. I'm still really scratching my head about Transformers and their decesion to keep it one player. I mean a huge chunk of the dialog is about the bots communicating together and even doing combat shoulder to shoulder. Why in the HELL would I not be able to bring my friends in on that?!\n\nStill think Transformers should be upgraded for co op. The kind of game it is just kinda begs for it.\n\nBack on the turtles though, it's not the greatest ever made, but it's a posative entry. Combat feel wierd? So does anything you play for the first time, and the hold R or whatever button you assign to do a cool lil shell spin as a block that can be timmed for a last minute rewarding block, released at just the right time for a chance to grab on the enemy, or even not sure what the timing will be so spinning to buffer into or out of a bad situation with a ballancing mechanic that will dizzy you if you run out.... I think it works just fine and makes sense!\n\nAgain it's not the greatest ever made, but other than perhaps the fact by cranking some of the visuals up with filters it can actually make the experience look worse, I don't have much to complain about here. It works, the turtles have varried moves but not severely lacking to be well off on their own, things still reward for sticking together, team move moves are nice and bond building, I can understand some gripes but I can't see voting it down. At least not on my behalf, and so I shant. It may not be something you play through over and over, but some indeed might as there is, as said, things to collect and try out. It's just a good solid game that released at a lower price because I feel Platnimum games made tittles put in a good fair effort and ask for a pretty fair price for it.\n\nIn short, it's a fun time, and I'm always a supporter of a game that likes to put people together for a fun romp and builds from there, and that's what this is. A fun romp with friends. It's enough to keep you at least through one run. If it's tag is too much, get it on sale. I feel it's not only worth it if you score it all the lower, it's either way just one tittle I believes desrves not to be over looked. I've seen much much worse, and at the end of the day I had real fun with it, and it let me do that with others to get my social time in along with my baddies beatings, and did it without breaking bugs to remain fun, it's done it's job.\n\nCan't make everyone happy, but not everyone is so very open minded either.\n\nNut shell meets half shell, A turtles game done well and certainly more so than recent entries past.","June 3","true","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game looked great from what I could tell, but when I got in and started playing it, I was disapointed.  I do think I will purchase it when it get's cheaper.  It was fun to play as the turtles, but there is two parts that were lacking for me, the combat, and the story.\n\nJust a head's up, I did not finish the game.  I admit I only got a few levels in.  I wanted to play more, but I decided to watch a playthough before I decided if I was going to refund or not.  While I feel that my experience with playing + watching the video's gave me a good idea of the game, there may be a little I missed because of it.\n\nFor combat,  you just go in and mash buttons while only fighting a few mobs at a time.  While boss battles could be challenging, most of your time was spent just mashing till you saw the boss was making an attack, press dodge (which made you invicible it felt like) and the proceed to mash again.  When you are out of life, just avoid the fight while one of your turtle buddies picks you up with an instant revive.\n\nIf you did loose a fight, it was more because of a lucky attack that finished all four turtles at once.  This game felt like a game I would hand to my niece and nephew and tell them to have fun.  They could start mashing buttons and be amazed by the awesome things the semi-intended.\n\nFrom what I could tell, the story was very disconected.  Each level had its own story that didn't seem to connect to any of the other levels.  After you beat the first level, you could play the next five in any order and finish with the last three.  Even in the levels, it was a few mini missions then the boss would be up to something and you would go fight him.\n\nOverall, I feel like this game is a series of "demo games."  Each level would have made a perfect demo for a much larger game.  I will contenue to watch this game and see if they add more in, or wait for it's price to drop to finish it.","May 25","false","1.9"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

The closest Platinum game I can compare this to is Wonderful 101/Legend of Korra, since switching between each turtle is like switching styles/bending.  You just happen to have everyone fighting together at the same time.\n\nIs the game combo heavy?  Not really. Each turtle has a different moveset, but knowing when to dodge and backattack helps more than doing long combo streams.  You'll mainly be switching between turtles to setup jiutsu (HEALING CIRCLE, PIZZA PARTY, COMBO ATTACK, and attack specific to each Turtle is my usual Load out).\n\nThe biggest advice I can give is upgrade your Jiutsus and Talismans.  Don't buy every Jiutsu, just try to max out the ones you use the most, then experiment with other techniques.\n\nHard difficulty adds the random chance of double boss encounters.  Example being Rocksteady jumping into the fight with Bebop once you reach a certain point into Bebops health.\n\nI notice a lot of negative reviews.  I was about to do the same, but once you level up a bit the game opens up.  The enemies become more varied and can take a full combo, and using Double co-op Jitsus can be pretty fun (Michaelangelo's dance special freezes all enemies into disco poses for one hit kills).\n\nThe game isn't perfect, but its still not the worst Turtle game I've played (which would be the TURTLES IN TIME 2.5D Remake).\n\n","May 29","true","10.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That said, I'd wait for a sale.\n\nAs is clear by the mixed reviews, this isn't a perfect game. Level design leaves something to be desired and the occasional bug creeps in. Those looking for super tight combat will be disappointed because the fights are frenetic with lots of enemies on screen at once which makes skillful play difficult at times. All of that aside though, there are also things to love and a lot of fun to be had as long as you temper your expectations.\n\nThe core single player game involves rotating between the 4 turtles and utilizing their cooldown timer special ninjutsu moves in strategic and complimentary ways. If you approach this is a straight up action game and try to stay with one turtle all off the time, you'll find that it is extremely difficult and frustrating.\n\nOn the topic of the special moves, you acquire more throughout the game and they are all upgradeable. Getting familiar with the upgrade system is essential to maximize fun and over time your turtles get more and more awesome as their skill sets get more spectacular.\n\nAs far as the common complaints you read about the 30 FPS and the short campaign... the game looks great and oozes style, and the 9 stages in the game are meant to be played more than once. There's a bit of a grind element as you earn Battle Points to buy more ninjutsu and upgrade existing ones. I've played some of the stages at least a half dozen times now to earn more BP and also find the collectible comic book covers.\n\nAbout the collectible covers, they are the Kevin Eastman drawn cover variants (for his fan club subscribers) of the current IDW comic and issues 1-50 are represented.\n\nThe game has flaws but this is honestly the best Turtles game in years.

With all the review bombing you'd expect less, but it seems most of the people giving this game bad reviews are whiny babies that either suck at games, aren't putting any effort in to playing it, or have that stupid 60FPS master race taboo. There is nothing wrong with a 30FPS game. Get over it.\n\nTalking more about the game, there's some things I'd like to touch on.\n\nCombat - It's Platinum Games. It's a beat em up. Same as pretty much all their games are. You go in to a mission, you beat stuff up. If you expect more than that, you're in the wrong genre. Easy & Normal is a faceroll, if you want excitement out of this game, Hard mode at least, or in the best scenario, get a couple friends and play Very Hard. You don't need a whole team, even one or two buddies is enough if you play smart. You get specials and such you can blast enemies with, and the turtles have some pretty incredible synergies. i.e - Raphaels Stealth + Leos Time Stop, or Mikeys Combo Attack + any AoE can wipe whole groups pretty well.\n\nDodging / Parrying / Grappling - There's so many ways to avoid damage for a reason, if you play the game on a real difficulty setting, you actually have to use these. Sometimes getting tagged means instant death if you're not wearing a Willpower charm, so if you want to tackle Hard / Very Hard, you have to learn how to stay alive. You can't just faceroll. You have to dodge, counter, and sometimes just plain run away to win a fight. You know, like a Ninja. Go figure.\n\nThe AI - I heard a lot of people complaining about the AI, about them doing their jobs fighting and such, and I have to say. What? I've beaten Hard mode alone, and the AI fight perfectly fine. They deal damage, they're pretty good at staying alive, the only thing they lack in is revival speed, but you can jack them out with Competitive Eater charms and then that aspect is null. The AI aren't meant to carry you. You have to learn to play the game yourself, habibi.\n\nContent - This is the only thing kinda lacking for me, there's nine stages / bosses, there's a secret boss in most stages, but it's usually one of the other bosses showing up to complicate the fight. Which is all fine and good, I would just like more. Rat King, Rahzar, Chrome Dome, War,  maybe some Shredder variants like Cyber Shredder. I want more bosses to fight, cause the game is fun.\n\nCharms - Regarding the charm system, it is a little frustrating at times. Kid of like Monster Hunter Tri. The charms you get drop from either items or strong enemies, but you can't really reliable fix them. You just get randomly placed skills. It'd be nice if the charm system worked in a way that you could fuse charms together to sort of customize your own charm. Say, you have a level 3 charm, it'd be nice to be able to fuse 3 other level 3 charms in to that one that have strength up or summat on it, to be able to place the strength up on to the host charm.\n\nTL;DR - All in all, the game is fine. Maybe not worth $60 in its current state, but no where near as bad as people make it sound. Don't let the negative reviews stop you from playing it if you want to. Keep an eye out for a nice sale, try to get some buddies, and rock it up. So far, I don't regret buying it at full price. I've had a lot of good times playing with friends.","May 30","true","48.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It's not a bad game I honestly believe that, even if my card carrying TMNT fan club would suggest some biased. It just never lives up to the potential seen in it, and ultimetly, that potential makes it's failures all the worse.\nAs a license game, the turtles have faired alot better then other franchises in transition from page to screen to controller. Back in the hands of Konami in the 80's to mid 2000's they had a string of succesful brawlers and puzzel games. But as the games moved over to Ubisoft with the 2007 film, and more recently Activision, the results have been more stale.\nSo the latest installment starts out as a breath of fresh air, An updated brawler, in some open enviroments, you can run around and light attack heavy attack your enemies, and come across missions to protect the city. There's a decent supply in Enemy variation, with your standard soldiers, bomb throwers, grapplers and pro's offering at least some variety in attacks. Missions vary from protections, defeact all the enemies, stealth attacks and retrieve the item, Not alot of variety, but plenty of games have less. Complete enough of these, you'll find the location of the boss, and you do battle, where you'll need to make heavy use of your Ninjitsu skills and backing up the other turtles to clean out the health bars.\nThe game play feels good, especially if you can get use to the block/dodge system. But there are times when instead of throwing some tougher enemies at you, the just throw dozens of enemies, crowding the screen and littering the enviroment with area attacks, and it soon makes the game a chore.\nThe Story and Character designs are influecned by the current IDW comic series, and it feels like elements have been taken not just from that, but inspiration from the current Nickelodeon tv series as well. The story is disposable unfortunatly, merely a way to frame the next fight, or explain why you are where you are. The voice acting is a mixed bag, With Raphiel sounding particuarly horrible.\n\nLike i said, it's not a bad game, it's not a great game that you might hope for, it's slightly better then mediocre. It's not terribly long, but it probably could have been better if it were a little shorter, with a little more polish put into its enciroments and combat, and maybe a little cheaper. If you see it on sale, it's could be a steal, but at full price, it's a dissapointment. A Dissapointment i'm going to go back to.","May 29","true","8.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The game consists of your choice of the 4 turtles and their special weapon selections that go with it coupled with some special abilities that can be leveled up as you go along. The game is mission based and each mission you can expect to last between 15 to 30 minutes to play.\nThe Graphics are an interesting Hand-drawn art style that I actually found interesting and just different enough to have a somewhat unique feel to it, however it is still a very basic graphics style and not very inspiring. It almost feels like they were attempting to look artsy so they wouldn’t have to invest a lot of time into the graphics of the game, which is a shame. It’s always a letdown when you see movie license games done in a lackluster fashion."\n\nThis game is very stereotypical of a Movie License game and an example of a very poor PC Port.

Genuinely some of the most fun I've had in a multiplayer action game in ages. If you enjoyed the SNES TMNT "Turtles In Time" game at all then you will have an absolute blast with this game, it's like 3D 3rd person Turtles in Time on steroids. It may be a bit of a beat-em-up at heart, but while not quite as complex as games like Devil May Cry, it is still way more complex than your run of the mill beat-em-up. Tons of moves, skill unlocks/progression, team-up co-op combos, parkour, etc. Instead of trying to convince people who may be questioning its depth or quality based on some of the other reviews, I will just list all the random gameplay/combat features I can think of off the top of my head and let you decide for yourself:\n\nlight attacks, heavy attacks, aerial attacks, combo's, aerial juggling, many ninjutsu super moves per character, team attacks (multiple turtles doing a move together), awesome and engaging boss fights, tons of skill unlocks/upgrades/progression, using the enivornment in combat (spinning off lamp posts, picking up stuff and throwing it, hijacking enemy turrets, etc), dodge, block, parry, counter attacks, predator mode (with takedowns), ranged attacks (with crosshair zoom), distinct moves/feel between the characters, "turtle burst" mode w/ teamates, combast/use items, parkour, climbing buildings, grinding rails, gliding off buildings/ledges, gorgeous combat animations, 4-player online coop (whole game is playeable this way), built in voice chat, full controller support (including steam controller), amusing cutscenes, lots of pizza.\n\nThe difficulty seems pretty reasonable too. I have played and beaten many other action games (devil may cry series, other platinum games, etc), and even after completing the entire tutorial both myself and all of my party members got knocked out multiple times on Normal difficulty in the first mission alone (many of my teamates had a much higher level than me too). I played the second mission the following day on normal difficulty with a full party of randoms and we had to attempt the boss multiple times. When you die you can respawn after a while by playing an amusing pizza eating minigame back at "the lair, but if it happens too much you will all get crap scores a the end and therefore get less battle points towards upgrades. Also, if everyone gets knocked out then you have to restart from the last checkpoint.\n\nGame ran smooth as silk for me. Yes it is currenty locked at 30 fps (as of launch day), but it is a smooth and conisistant 30 and looks great. I honestly would not have even noticed this if I hadn't seen so many people complaining. Played with random people and have yet to experience any lag issues, even in one game where everyone was speaking a foreign language.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun coop action experience. Great for quick pickup and play with friends.","May 25","true","2.8"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

Very much so.\n\nPROS\n-Visual aesthetics akin to that of the comic books and are well represented here\n-Lot's of things to collect.\n-Light RPG aspects to the game to equip your tutrle with loadouts and special moves to which you can upgrade.\n-Boss battles are engaging*\n-Co-op play\n-Not too long ( logged in 5 hours on normal gameplay first playthrough) but also long enough for replayability\n-different difficulties offer different things ( hardest difficulty changes up some boss fights)\n\n\nCONS\n-Your A.I teamates: While they can be good MOST of the time, sometimes just doesn't know what to do with itself and kind of makes some bonehead descisions, like running off to fight enemies when your downed, or run into an object and rub up against it instead of getting on said thing, or while fighting a boss not use any of their specials. Overall it is fine, but once in a while, some of the A.I choices will get to you.\n\n-30FPS lock: Now for me myself it doesn't bother me, but to some this can be an issue. Does it make the game unplayable? Not in the slightest, game still runs at a farely good rate. No slow downs during heavy combat,\n\n-*Boss Battles: While they are engaging, they are also just extremely punishing as well. If your A.I or teamates arn't co-ordinated to dodge everything perfectly all the time ( they won't be) you will likely die, a lot. Mostly due to how unforgiving the boss fights can be with their speed and attacks which are stronger than you by a WIDE margin. There really is no point to get that 4th pizza health upgrade when the boss can one shot you with his attacks already, and this is on normal!\n\nGeneral Opinion\n-Combat. While I find it fine, very simular to the beat em ups that konami made back when they had the license, I feel like they could have had a bit more depth to the combos. It's simple and works well for the game but it's no Bayonetta type combat that platinum is capable of doing. Which really shows during boss fights how a bit more complexity could work.\n\nOverall however it DOESN'T make the game less fun but would have been nice to add some kind of combat combo system per turtle and not just the co-op turtle combos.\n\n-Lack of extra stuffs: Would have been nice to unlock an arcade mode version of the game and maybe the ability to unlock some costumes instead of them just being DLC, but thats a minor thing to me.\n\n\nOverall, dispite its shortcomings, this is the best TMNT game we have seen in a long while. Hopefully Platinum can make another one and improve on some of the things that need to be addressed.  7.5/10","May 25","true","14.0"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","7","20","0","1"

It reminds me a lot of the previous Platinum games Transformers title.\nThis game reminds me why I love TMNT, and why I enjoy the IDW version of the comics.\nafter about three hours of streaming, one friend decided to buy it and join me.\nThat's when the fun really started. I enjoyed it alone, but with a friend, it's a blast.\nI was expecting something similar to Turtles in time, but this wasn't quite there. but in a good, surprising way.\n\nPros:\nThe music was pretty catchy and amusing.\nThey tried to capture the humor that we know from TMNT and succeeded more often than not.\nFamiliar faces look great with a fresh coat of paint.\nTense boss fights.\nA great mix of semi-randomly generated mission modes add a little variety and replay value.\nA good 4 player co-op experience with just enough gameplay to be beaten in a single afternoon, arcade style.\nStylish, customizable combat system adds personal touches and preferences without making any one character overpowered.\n\nCons:\nThe Ai is ruthless in the sense that if you start on normal mode, it's a walk in the park until about three missions in, then you'll feel like you're doing no damage whatsoever.\nIf you play alone, prepare to have your partner AI pop it's attacks and skills at the worst moments.\nYou get to see characters like Armaggon and a nod to Rat King. but no Baxter, Casey, Mutagen Man, Mondo, Metal Head, Chrome Dome or other series staples.\nThe story is short with about the same number of levels as an SNES cart.\nNo Local Co-op was a huge dealbreaker.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed myself, and I'll be playing more of this in the near future. the combat takes some getting used to, but the over the top art style and ranking system made the game more enjoyable for me and my friends to compete and try to outperform each other. it's a fair price for 40 usd. but unless you're a diehard turtles fan who loves beat-em-ups. you might want to wait and see if this goes on sale during the steam summer sale later in June.\n\nif you need someone to play with, look me up,\nCowabunga, dudes.","May 24","true","19.5"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

The combat is VERY simple, so if you're coming in expecting depth, this would not be the game for you. The more sandbox type gameplay (while not even holding a candle to the freedom of Spiderman 2) and controller response is a huge improvement over OOtS; If you liked or were close to liking that game, this one is likely a good pick for you. Personally, I'm a big fan of both the pacing of this game and the banter between the brothers, which I found charming and entertaining.\n\nWhat I gather? This is a button mashing party game meant for groups of friends and TMNT fans such as myself (especially fans of the IDW comics, who may get more out of both the designs and the various characters that show up throughout the stages). If you're not in these categories, either wait for the price tag to drop or skip this one altogether. Overall, I enjoyed it.

For people that have worries; it's certainly better than TMNT:Out of the Shadows! It has more stages, enemies, variety, bosses and more playtime. Just don't expect a AAA title, even though the price tag tries to give you this "feeling"! But it's definitely a really good TMNT game compared to the other few turtles games which came out on the market. I also have to admit that I am biased when it's about turtles. Especially on the games of the franchise, because you just don't get many. If you do not have the expectations that you have on other titles, then you will be happy with TMNT:Mutants in Manhattan.\n\nPros:\n+ great 4-player coop\n+ great comic look animations\n+ very good atmosphere\n+ very good controls\n+ okay sounds & ost\n+ okay graphics\n+ okay story\n+ smooth multiplayer\n+ reminds on the old turtles games\n\nCons:\n- the bad main menu music\n- camera should center automatically\n- 30fps lock\n\nBuy it if you are a turtles fan.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonlajoie/recommended/338400/","jonlajoie","mcdonalds wifi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonlajoie/","159 products in account","What can I say, the Ninja Turtles are a classic. The majority of the downvoted reviews trashing this game are from people with less than or equal to 2.5 hours. So, they're mainly judging it based off of the fact that it's 30fps locked.\n\nI do, however, agree that 40$ is a bit too much for what this game gives us. It IS rather short, but it's incredibly fun once you get through Bebop and Rocksteady (sorry, they were rather boring compared to the other bosses). The game mechanics are fairly easy to get used to, though you may need to pause here and there to remember (if you have a goldfish memory like me. It took me half the game to remember how to throw damn shurikans).\n\nThe story? Well, it is what it is given the *ahem* "work" put into this. It DOES feel a little rushed, and April gets pretty annoying along the way. I feel as though a lot of the weapons in Splinters store don't do any good unless you really know how to use them the right way. I also wish I could've carried more of them with me, instead of having only four backpack slots. Ah well, it was still fun trying to decide what would work best against the bosses (89% of the time my guesses were way off and my weapons of choice did nil to them, rip).\n\nThe "Story" Mode, aka the Single Player Mode, isn't that fun. For myself, I was still getting my butt handed to me in what should've been considered the "easy" mode, and ofc the bots hogged all the glory. Then I decided to strictly go with Co-Op. Let me tell you, the Co-Op makes this game a whole lot more fun!! (save for the "waiting for player" tid bits due to connections issues for players. that got a wee bit annoying). I've met some really awesome people thus far in Co-Op, some really great teammates!\n\nA few of them even sat through my insufferable commentating, bless their souls. My most favourite boss fight was with the Mega Krang. It was probably the most challenging, and the most frustrating, and of course, the most fun. I incapped probably a million times, but I was SO determined to defeat him. After Mega Krang, came Shredder, and compared to MK, Shredder was so easy to beat, it was really anti-climactic.\n\nFrom the moment of the successfull installation, my game ran as smooth as a newborn baby's butt. I didn't experience lag except for when I faced those rock guys with the giant hammers that swung them around like a drunken Thor. That was it, and I have yet to experience a crash, or any real horrible fps mishap.\n\nThis game isn't perfect, by any means. But it has its charming moments, and it's pretty hilarious too (not just from Mikey's comments on situations). The lines can get pretty cheesy, which is always fun. There's a lot left unanswered, and it could use some little tweaks here and there. Such as the mic issues. There's no real option to have the mic set at a "push-to-talk", so there will be people with open mics that are of incredibly horrible quality and you can hear everything going on... I ran into quite a few people like that, and it gave me a raging headache. Also, it would be nice to implement some sort of chat system for the co-op, so we can communicate better, especially for people who don't own mics.\n\nDon't go into this game expecting some spectacular, inctricate, deep story that will have you questioning life. It's a mash-em-up, beat-em-up game. Very EXP crunching too if you wanna go that way. There are plenty of achievements and emblems to obtain if you happen to get bored of just mindlessly swinging your weapons around. My advice is to play Co-Op and never look back. It's definitely a blast.\n\nAnd I would recommend this game in a heart beat. But not at the current price. Lower it to 15$ (20 at the most). Wait for it to be on sale, or don't. It's your choice.\n\nI made mine, and I don't regret it.","May 25","true","14.0"," 9 of 27 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","9","27","0","1"

I highly recommend th is game, especially those who like ninja turtles.\n\n*note*  The game is currently 30fps locked.  Even though in an interview the devs said the game was going to be 60fps.  I'm hoping this issue will be remedied soon.  BUT the game is still very much playable and enjoyable at 30 fps.\n\nThe fighting mechanics are solid and fluid for the most part, you have your typical light attack, heavy attack, special moves,  and dodge.  You can play one of the 4 turtles.  In singleplayer you can switch turtles on the fly, but in multiplayer you are locked into one.  Each one has their own unique set of attacks.  Special attacks can be purchased with points and upgraded to reduce their cooldowns.\n\nThe stages consist of random missions where you disarm bombs, find an item, move item from point A to B, and defend.  Then after doing a few missions you fight a boss.  The boss fights are farily challenging, for the most part they are just punching bags, but as their health gets lower they start going into a rage and deal more damage and do more attacks.  So just mashing the attack button won't help, you have to actively dodge attacks.\n\nThe online multiplayer is good, I had no lag at all, although there were pauses of "waiting for player" due to connection not being good which did get annoying after a bit.\n\nThe story mode is short, takes about 4-5 hours to beat.  The replayability comes from the fighting mechanics.  Like I stated earlier it is very satisfying and fun.  You can pick any level, go in, and start bashing on enemies for days.  Also you can upgrade skills and to do so you have to earn points in the levels, so fighting and skill upgrading go hand-in-hand.\n\nFrom an hours to price ratio, you'll break even.  The price is a bit on the higher end, I would wait for a little sale because the content can get fairly repetitive if you're not into this genre.\n\nI hope this review was helpful.","May 24","true","19.5"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","8","25","0","0"

What you have here is one of the best TMNT games since Turtles in Time.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles™: Mutants in Manhattan takes players into a cel-shaded TMNT world.  The story is an original story penned by IDW Comic’s TMNT author, Tom Waltz. What's that mean? It means it's canon.\n\nThe game stays true to the source material and all the turtles feel like their personalities are where they're supposed to be. Plus there's no Boo-ya Ka-shaws.\n\nThe combat controls work splendedly, even with a mouse and keyboard. Animations are fluid and team combination attacks feel awesome when they're pulled off. The voice acting, the music, everything is pretty much spot on. All that and more caught me completely off-guard as I expected nothing from another TMNT game. I expected I'd refund this game after playing it for an hour but I can't wait to dive in some more.\n\nPlayers can level up, gain new skills, customize said skills and create a spec that matches their playing style. This also means that you'll be replaying the game over and over again to progress your character, but don't worry. The big bosses at Platinum know what's up. Stages up until the boss fight have several different events that are randomly presented to the player. What this means that each play through you do will be a different experience every time.\n\nNostalgia-goggles aside this is a solid game and a must buy for any action game or RPG game fan alike.","May 24","true","3.3"," 8 of 26 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","8","26","0","0"

It's not impossible, but doing them solo with AI turtle brothers doesn't seem... great.\n\nIt's cel-shaded graphics but that's nothing to write home about.  I'd say that it works because this game doesn't take itself very serious at all, and the cartoon look probably helps it at the end of the day.\n\nNOWHERE on the Game Description does it mention 60 FPS, so if you bought it and you don't see it.... surprise surprise.  30 FPS didn't ruin the game for me, but then I've never seen the advantage of 60 in the first place so I'm probably biased in that regard.\n\nThere isn't any local co-op, but at the same time I'm not really sure how they could incorporate that into a game of this style.  The levels are so big that if they had done this split-screen style it would only confuse the players who tried the mode.  With as much chaos on the screen as you see, I'll defend this game for not wanting to keep it local despite it being an unfortunate circumstance.\n\nThe game "can" feel overwhelming with the big fights, but my answer to this is the lock-on feature.  You can defeat an enemy, lock-on, and head towards your next victim.  It definitely simplifies things, and the T-Scan feature in this game lets you know where to go for the next objective with ease.\n\nI feel like the type of player that wants to mindlessly mash the attack buttons might only find this game enjoyable with the Easy and "maybe" Normal mode, but when it comes to hard and above, you'll need coordination and dodging to win the fights which I can appreciate.\n\nThe missions are pretty meh, all-in-all.  You're on a map, and missions pop up.  Do so many to reach the boss, and while the journey to the boss isn't exactly enthralling the boss fights themselves "do" add some enjoyment.  Dodging attacks and AOE's and using your abilities to make sure the team can thrive certainly adds to the experience, as well as the classic characters that you love to beat up on!\n\nIt isn't the BEST game, but then the 40 dollar price tag "should" give you a hint as to what to expect out of it.  Perhaps it isn't filled with as much content as one would expect, but if you want to turn your brain off and just kick back to clobber some Foot Clan, I'd pick this baby up.\n\nFINAL SCORE:  7.5 / 10","May 25","true","3.6"," 6 of 22 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","6","22","0","0"

It doesn't bother me, usually I'm all gung-ho about wanting unlocked framerates and whatnot. But it's more than tolerable here. Also I have experienced zero performance issues.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, I'm one of the fortunate people that has multiple friends with gaming PCs. So they are all able to run it and play along side me. The whole Couch Co-op argument is garbage in my mind, the camera just couldn't support that with how everyone runs around freely. They would have to lock it to a main area, which wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable.\n\nThe game is short, as expected coming away from Transformers: Devastation. However, it's a hack-and-slash, beat em' up type of game, so the replayabilty is based on how much you enjoy the combat and want to play higher difficulties. In my case, it's very high. I'm almost done with a Normal run through with my friends, and we will progress to higher difficulties after that.\n\nThe storyline obviously isn't great, but the way I saw this game was like a trip to the arcade to play the TMNT sidescroller. I totally get that vibe here just mashing and bashing the ever living hell out of the enemies.\n\nCustomization options are fairly solid for what it's worth. Me and my friends all play different styles, which the game allows for with the customization.

This is a hack and slash beat em up type of game. The levels have mini quests that are randomly generated so the chances that you replay the sequence for a level exactly the same is slim. This helps keep replaying a mission fun and rewarding. The boss battles are a gem, each has their own fighting style and some amazing battle music. You will have to learn each boss moves in order to know when to properly dodge and when to attack. At around 30% health each boss goes into a rage mode and gets an extremem speed upgrade as well as some new moves. Thats when you and your friends go into panic mode and do your best to survive. This game is truly best played with a group of friends.\n\n","May 24","true","17.3"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"

I wasn't expecting to control all four turtles, but I can say it's definitely a different mechanic that makes this game unique. Also the art style is pretty cool and the story so far is good. Like all Platinum games, there's a bit of a learning curve but once you get your dodges and counters working, you can pull off some pretty satisfying combos.\n\nAll that being said, it isn't a perfect game. Sometimes the difficulty spikes up at random intervals, and it could be hard to focus with so much action on the screen.\nAlso at times, I feel the enemies can be a bit overwhelming.\nNot a deal breaker though, if anything, just increases the challenge a bit.\n\nI don't even care for the 30fps deal, game is still fine.\n\nHaven't tried online yet, but I'm sure it would be lots of fun.\n\nOverall I'd say I'm satisfied with this game.

Ok let's get that fact out. Will it get fixed? I Don't know. Do I care? Not personally no.\n\nSo what is the GAME actually? Not sure. It keeps throwing random crap at you and feels like anything can happen at times. Bosses randomly jump in to help during other bosses boss fights, Devil Triggers get popped, plasma sentries get constructed. It's a giant puddle of what the hell is going on you don't really have time to think about really. You do some stuff and then a boss gets fought and they're super awesome bosses. What about the mechanics of the game?\n\nOk look - it's basically exactly what a modern version of a retro Konami Turtles arcade game would be like if it were released right now by a competent publisher and it is just that. The combat is simplified but tests your reflexes, co-op tactics are encouraged and a lot of quarter munching tactics are employed by antagonists. It can be super easy or ouch. Like really way too hard, but hey it's up to you and what you wanna do. There's a progression that mixes things up adding stuff like upgrade-able levels of bullet-time various special attacks from TMNT Tournament Fighters, Godhand Reels, Super attacks from Anarchy Reigns and Viewtiful Joe. You can add charms that do stuff like regenerating health or increase drop rates ala Transformers. There's some rail grinding and civil safety involved.\n\nHow about multiplayer? Well no local. Not sure how that'd work really anyway. Also it's ALWAYS in multiplayer just the AI handles when no other humans are present they do a good job for the most part. Something truly wondrous about this game is the fact that there is so much crazy ♥♥♥♥ happening all the time and no a single hiccup at all, even the tiniest bit when we played 3 player online. Also I was streaming to three different sites at the time. I don't know how they managed it. Here is the stream in it's entirety if you wanna check that out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI_oRS0tesg\n\nSo you skipped all the above text and went to this line? Ok.\n\nLook if you want a game that is literally a modern take on the old-thyme black & white arcade talkies Konami put out in the good-ol' days and you don't mind it being littered with both references and mechanics from the litany of games both Platinum and Clover put out (including but NOT limited to: Viewtiful Joe, Godhand, Okami, Vanquish, Bayonetta, Metal Gear Rising, Transformers, Anarchy Reigns, Madworld) you're gonna have to try this. Anyone else? There are better games right now, like unimaginably good games even at this price range. If you have those then this is a distant priority but DO NOT overlook it it's super fun.","May 25","true","15.4"," 7 of 28 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","7","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feenie/recommended/338400/","Feenie","GuiltyCheese","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feenie/","210 products in account","The main problem with this review section is that - well - most of you guys expected it to be some perfect love-letter to the Turtles games of old.\n\nWhich is incredibly close-minded in my eyes.\n\nNo game is perfect. Not one. And this game is no different. If you were expecting a perfect experience that caters to your every needs, despite being shown countless trailers and gameplay clips, then you probably need to go see a doctor.\n\nThat aside, the game is fun. Mindless, beat-em-up, fun. The combat, whilst being very basic and lacking any depth, is a much welcomed improvement over Out of the Shadows' "Arkham was a good game lets copy it and make good game ours too :):)" mindset. All the turtles actually feel different, and the shared ability system (Ninjutsu) allows for you to switch between Turtles whenever you want without feeling stilted by lack of progression. Too often in Out of the Shadows would I switch to Raph because Mikey died and find he was level -30 with 0 health. My only gripe is that the parrying system is a little unclear with normal enemies. Bosses are fine because they take up your attention, but normal enemies often come in hordes. That being said, it actually requires some level of skill to use correctly, unlike Out of the Shadows.\n\nFor me and my friends, the game runs smoothly. We only had one crash in the 6 hours we played, which for launch day is impressive in my eyes (considering games like Black Ops III or Fallout 4 and how unoptimized they were). Speaking of optimization, I'm not sure what people are complaining about? Sure, we were promised 60FPS, but the game runs perfectly fine at 30. Even though my computer is catered towards gaming, Black Ops III and Fallout 4 both brough about major issued in terms of playablilty. This game? Zilch. Nada.\n\nSure, framedrops during cutscenes. Whatever. Wanna know what it drops to? 25-29FPS. How ♥♥♥♥ing disgraceful am I right? How can I possibly watch this and not play it therefore not having it affect the gameplay or my enjoyability of the game at a few lowered frames.\n\nOh, wait.\n\nAdditionally, the open-world exploration is very enjoyable imo. Sure, it's no Spiderman 2 or Prototype, but it's something! People are complaining about it being really lacklustre and the levels being mostly hallways but - if you really wanted a hallway simulator with no variety whatsoever then go play Out of the Shadows. At least this game mixes it up.\n\nOh and, if you couldn't tell, I'm very sour about Out of the Shadows.\n\nAll that being said, Co-op is definitely the way to go when playing this game. And, well, WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING GUYS? It's a turtles game. You know, that beloved series that was always about teamwork and brotherly ties? Of course it's going to be heavily favouring Co-Op play. Sure the lack of couch co-op is a little unfortunate but, how would it work? The game would be nigh unplayable and barely enjoyable. You would hardly be able to see where you were going. Think about it, guys.The Single Player isn't even bad. You just need to play a bit more strategically to account for the (sometimes questionable) AI. And anyway, Co-Op is a blast!\n\nTake it from me - if you're running ahead of everyone else to the next objective, and then complaining because you  got utterly annihilated by an ambush of enemies - that's on you. Not the game. This game favour co-operation.\n\nAll in all, I'd say it's worth a buy. But only if you actively enjoy these types of games or are seeking to maybe get into them - as well as having some mates to have a blast with. I don't understand why people buy games and then review them negatively when they know before going into it that it's not their cup-of-tea. That's like a die-hard, hates action and shooting and PvP RPG player diving right into Call of Duty and then calling it out for not being their thing. Again, what were you expecting?\n\nIt might not be the high-octane exploration sandbox extraveganza game you were wanting - but it's a step in the right direction. If you're a fan of the Turtles and short, simple yet incredibly entertaining beat-em-ups, give it a go!","May 25","true","30.1"," 11 of 37 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","11","37","0","0"

It is not an open world but a cluster with collectables. I recommend it especially with co-op play.\n\nIt is apparent from a replay how small and limited the game scope is. It's an arcade game. There aren't a lot of activities can be done within the level. The level starts and you battle through hord(s) of enemies, beat them and then the next objective appears. beat all objectives and the boss is shown. Strangely when that happen all foes disappear, leaving you nothing to do but scouring the landscape. as previously mentioned, it's not big. And you collect orbs and several items which can be helpful in your boss battle. Beat the level, get evaluated, watch the cutscene and "on to the next level".\nIt's still early for me to give the game my final judgement.

It really captures the Classic 90's Turtles feel.  Voice acting is on point and the humor is classic Turtles.\n\nIf you're a Turtles in Time fan like me, you'll enjoy this game.  It really feels like an old school beat'm up but with an in-depth modern combat system.  It also has quite a few enemy throwbacks to the old school arcade game, like shoulder charging Rock dudes and Bolas slinging Foot ninjas!\n\nThe stages are fairly well designed and diverse, ranging from more open exploration stages to linear progressive stages.  There is also a random objective system before you reach the stages's Boss Phase, so each playthrough is a little different.\n\nThe game has a pretty straitforward leveling system that allows you to customize your Turtles skills and abilities.  Simple, intuitive, and gives the game some variety so you can mix up your playsyle.\n\nOne of my favorite parts about this game is that it is Co-op centric.  The way you can synergize with the other players is well designed and makes it a lot of fun to coordinate with your friends online.  The single player in the game if fun, but you really won't get the full experience unless you play co-op.  Also if you play on the harder difficulties the bosses become significantly more difficult and the bots won't be able to keep up as well; and if the Secret boss appears, forget about it.  So you really want to team up with some other players.\n\nA must play for Turtle fans.","June 5","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
