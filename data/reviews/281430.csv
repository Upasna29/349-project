The game was originally released in 1999 and it has actually gotten worse since then.  The game starts with an error message about needing to insert an imaginary game CD and if you don't put a music CD in, the game will have no background music of any kind.\n\nAside from technical issues, the game isn't fun.  The world isn't open, it is a series of small rooms that are traversed by clicking red arrows to change zones.  The map is intrusive and the exploration feels jerky.  The monsters don't drop fun loot like other dungeon crawlers and gold is nearly useless.\n\nThere is no character progression because there are no levels and experience.  Your character gains stats through potions found on the ground.  There are only 2 weapon types and 1 armor type so all of the equipment is boring.  There is no gratification in killing mobs because there is no chance of that magical item you have been hunting for.\n\nWith a thin plot, no music, no character progression, no interesting loot, and poor navigation, I can't recommend this game even at less than $3.","March 13, 2014","false","0.9"," 200 of 251 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","200","251","0","11"

Maybe that’s why it was called Satanica in Germany. Satanica, that’s more like it.\nIt came out during a time where everyone was waiting for Diablo II and every game that shared similar traits was quickly dismissed as a clone. Clans got slaughtered by the press, they hated the non-scrolling, square rooms with clearly marked exits and the static, pre-rendered graphics.\n\nWell. I love them to death. All these wonderful shades of brown, grey and black. Almost every room/bit uniquely rendered. A sense of total bleakness without bragging about it. And then puzzles, like, proper puzzles that you would find in classic point-and-click adventure games. Kicking a door in with an axe, setting spellbooks on fire in a chimney to destroy them.\nI'm playing the game with some kind of weak elf character, something I normally don’t do, as I prefer babarians or warriors, as they don’t die so easily.\nI really recommend the elf class, it ramps up the difficulty and changes the gameplay, because you really don’t have a lot of HP, and potions are rare, so suddenly every health point counts.\nWell, you quicksave, enter a new room and a bunch of enemies start to attack you, which often means instant death or unacceptable HP loss - so you quickly reload, which only takes a fraction of seconds and try again, which creates nice “I can do this better!”-loops reminding me of Hotline Miami.\nIn Diablo II, when I lost HP, I never really knew why, and it didn’t matter, as you could heal yourself without problems.\n\nNext thing: Clans doesn’t give you experience points for killing enemies. I partly think this is because the developer didn’t have the funds to properly balance and test an EXP system. But on the other hand, it is SO bold to take away from players what they desire the most: watching numbers grow.\nInstead, you level up by finding items, and avoiding fights (via teleporters) is often encouraged. Also, enemies often start fighting each other, which always gives games a sense of realism…\n\n(All of this makes me also want to play the next game they did, it’s called Dragonfire - The Well of Souls and contains the playable character class DUCK. Also, you set out to fight an evil princess. What’s not to love? Needless to say, that one got killed by the gaming press, too.)","August 21, 2014","true","17.2"," 55 of 67 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","55","67","3","0"

It IS a clunky old hack and slash with a VERY HEAVY dose of "logic" puzzles. Diablo was neither clunky nor Old (for it's time) and had very little to do with puzzles.\nThis has TONS of little zones many of which are empty and whose only purpose seems to be to confuse you about where you are. (The "map" feature solves that.) Some things are EASY to figure out (like crossing the stream) others (like opening the gate with barrels) are a PIA.\nIf you LIKE puzzles, get it. If you don't... don't waste your money because you WILL have to solve some tough ones to move on. There are NO "work-arounds.". (Thankfully it is VERY cheap, so it is only a minor rip-off if you don't.)","March 14, 2014","false","2.3"," 71 of 95 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","71","95","0","1"

A nice dungeon crawler with pre-rendere graphics and divided in rooms. It's nothing like Diablo, the most similar game I can think of is the good old "The Immortal" on dos\Sega Megadrive.\nEvery item in the levels is placed there by design, every room is unique, puzzles aren't difficult but some are not obvious either, it plays more like a combat heavy adventure game.\nCharacters have a lot of funny one-liners, there are many puzzles even if at the moment are all really simple to solve and... *drumrolls*\nYou can play it in co-op and it works flawlessy!\n\nOne player needs to host, the others can join via ip. The lan option doesn't seem to work but you can play locally if you choose "internet" and use your lan ip address. You can chat with T key or give orders like "go north" etc using the cursor keys.\nThere is also a pdf manual included with the game (from your steam library page select Clans then click "manual"), read it for some useful hints and funny bits.\n\nCombat is quite bad, playing with the elf you'll find yourself to spam magic and then run the f*ck away from enemies while mana recharges, going in silly circles around them. But I really cannot say i'm not having fun, it's just very old school. Would have been a very great game with a more elaborated combat system.\n\nPS The forest at the beginning is enchanted, that's why the map doesn't work there, it repeats endlessy if you don't take the right path, it's not a bug ;)","December 26, 2014","true","5.1"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","24","30","0","0"

After playing for a while i managed to complie a list of good and bad points which i shall list, i shall point out the flaws and leave the good bits to the end to leave this review on a happier note;\n\nTheir doesn't seem to be any stratergy involved. There are three warrior classes and the "elf" class which is the wizard. and while i enjoy the idea of different fighting styles, there is the Warrior, the Barbarian and the dwarf, which is less cliche more boring when selecting a character, people who prefere long range only have one class and that is the elf class.\n\nThe lack of items. The game seems to try and make it out that there is challenge when really its just unfair, you get two lives and they go quickly as you get surrounded by more and more enemies, i got down to about half health when i encontered a mini boss. I thought he was some form of boss as he was hiding behind the statue so he got the first hit, and he did the most damage out of all the other monsters I fought, this lead to my death and i respawned and killed him, this rbought be down to four hit points left and he dropped a potion which brought me up to 11, i was thent asked to clear out a cottage (so my first real quest) where i found myself swarmed with no healing of any kind and i died again losing my last life and going back to the main menu.\n\nThe controls. The controls for moving are straight forward but attacking is the right mouse button which is odd and i was not told this so i had taken a few hits before i figured it out, there are interactable items within the game but there is little to no clue apart from a slight light up of the item. weapons do not have any sort of indication as to whats better or what it requires, there is an axe for example which requires two hands, i didnt know this untill i saw that i didn't have my sheild equipped anymore. There are also items in the game world that dont seem to have any use, left clicking (which is used for moving and item management) does nothing and the right mouse button swings your weapon.\n\nthe writing: this is a minor point but the spelling and wording could use some work it isnt bad but it doesnt scream "in your face bioware"\n\nNow onto the good points which im pleased to say, what this game does well it does -very- well so lets get started:\n\nSound. The music and sound effects are brilliant and you get the right atmosphere that some games simply cannot achieve.\n\nIntroduction. the opening introduction is fully voiced (and voiced quite well i will add) and gives a very retro feel which made me feel quite excited to play this game.\n\nFunction. The game downlaoded quickly, had no problems getting it to run, and it ran smoothly with no obvious bugs or glitches, it seems this was a main focus of their time and it shows.\n\n\nso i have listed three bad points (not counting the spelling and writing becuase what do you expect from a hack and slash diablo clone?") and three good points so its time to give my final verdict.....\n\nI would -not- recommend this game on its own merits.","May 18, 2014","false","0.1"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","26","38","0","1"

There isn't much variety in loot, if you happen to get loot, and there is no experience or leveling up system. You go room to room, facing a few monsters every couple of rooms. This might sound terrible, but to me, it's actually great. It simplifies the gameplay to a more casual level, one where you don't have to spend 30 minutes picking weapons or armor and can immediately explore. The graphics can be a bit bleak or bland, but every room is uniquely rendered which can make you really appreciate the work that was put in. The monsters can definitely be challenging at times, but the dialogue and general gameplay is awesome in my opinion. In a half-serious way, atleast. If you're looking for a serious game where you can dive into a deep and intense storyline, look elsewhere. But if a fun little hack-n-slash with cheesy dialogue that can be played for 15 minutes at a time sounds like your cup of tea, then I suggest investing in the game. 6/10","December 21, 2014","true","11.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

Much like those early clones, Clans has degenerated over the last 15 years, which is why I can't recommend it.

Some of the criticisms that people bring up in negative reviews are valid, but in my mind, I have to take context into consideration. First, the game is way more basic and no-frills than Diablo II. You essentially get what you pay for. Secondly, this game was published in '99. Yes, Diablo II was only released about a year later, but many changes occured between 99 and 2000 in terms of capabilities. Notwithstanding, it is important to consider budget, target audience, developmental capabilities, time constraints, and a host of other possible reasons this game doesn't stack up to, say, Diablo II. For .29 cents I'm not going to complain about the quality of this game.

I feel I gave it a fair shot - some old games take some getting used to - but it just didn't grow on me.\n\nWhen you start the game, there's a message that asks you to put in the game CD. Seeing as how this is a digital copy, that is not possible to do, so you're just kind've left without music. While it doesn't bother me personally as the music is probably awful, this may be a major turn-off for other players and doesn't start the "epic adventure" out very well.\n\nThe enviroment is made up of static rooms - large red arrows indicate where the next rooms are. You can activate a map to see all of the rooms and areas you may not have explored yet, but it pretty much covers the screen, and I didn't find any way to change the opacity, size or location of the map. While I'm fine with doing things the old fashioned way and just remembering what rooms are important, it's really inconvenient, and other games in the genre have executed a simple map function much better than this.\n\nThe art isn't bad, but it is extremely similar to....well, Diablo. It's mediocre, doesn't stand out in the genre.\n\nThe one-liners....mein gott. They're cheesey and annoying. The story is thin, unimaginative.\n\nThe loot is what I'd call few and far between. You can walk into a room, fight 5 skeletons guarding a chest, and open the chest to find nothing inside. You sometimes run into an old woman that gives you mana/health pots and a wizard (who you save at the very beginning) that hands you some special item once in a blue moon.\n\nThere's no skill set or any real system for character progression. You can rarely get better armor, weapons, and some consumables that give you stats. Because this system is rather insufficient, repeatedly getting empty rooms full of enemies doesn't get easier. I'm not saying we should get rid of challenging fights, but the difficulty curve is a little steep.\n\nIf they intended this to be a semi-successful knock-off to fill in the space between Diablo and Diablo II, it failed. There are other games in this genre that have aged better - don't spend your money on this one.","August 22, 2015","false","1.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The map is divided in small isometric areas (rooms) and you move from one to another by clicking on the red arrows at the edge of each area.\nThe rooms/areas can contain enemy mobs, treasure, npcs...or nothing at all.\nThese areas form a sort of maze that you have to explore in order to find treasure, key items....or a fast death.\nThere are puzzles that have to be solved in order to advance, and these puzzles are quite nice, a little bit in the style of point and click adventures.\nSurprisingly the graphics look nice because of the decent filter (scanlines), something that is rare nowadays when it comes to re-releases of old games.\nThe game is very tough at least in the begining, but you can save anytime.\nIt was an odd game when it was released 15 years ago and its an odd one now, you have to burn the music from the game folder on a CD and have that CD inserted for the game to use the music. Quite a pain by today's standards, but the neat gadget is that you can use any music Cd and the game will use the music from it.\nThis game is not bad at all especially for the price. If you can look past the antiquated controls and interface and past the harsh difficulty level, you have a nice old-style rpg with a rather unique concept.\nMatter of taste of course, but i was pleasantly surprised by this title.\n","March 13, 2014","true","2.7"," 19 of 51 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","19","51","0","0"

Love old-school games, so the age of this game, 1999, is not relevent. :f2_happy:\n\nI was a beta-tester on several old-school games, having an eye for such games. I also did tech and hint support. With the responsibilities of hint support, I played many of the earlier, early to mid-80's, games which most, if not all, other fellow employees had no experience. Some of those earlier games kinda bit it as far as being good games.\n\nI have played MANY games from other companies. Many were good to great, quite a few were awful. I have played some of those not-so-good games seeing that they were just that after playing for a short span of time. Continuing to play some of those, I backed up my initial impressions.\n\nAs far as what I had seen of this game was extreme small grids for the character to traverse. There are limited number of grids to a location, and approx 1/2 in a "random" pattern giving the impression of a large area.\n\nAnd, using the age of this game, 1999, this is pitiful when compared to other games definitely from that time period and earlier. Just to put a comple games up for inspection: Ultima VI (1990), VII (1992-3), and VIII (1994) -- each with completely separate game-engines; Baldur Gate I (1998) and II (2000) -- same game-engine; the two Crusader non-FPS shooter-games (1995-6) -- same engine; more I could look up if I was so inclined.\n\nThe games listed above were either top-down (U6) or isometric (the remainder) game-engines. None of these games relied on grids similar to what Clans used. Yes, Baldur Gate games used seperate areas but in a more playable format.\n\nCombat is OKAAAY, but should be better, again looking at the age of the game. One problem with combat, the availability of health potions.\n\nIf you want further reasons why I dislike this game for your edification, ask. :happycthulhu:","March 13, 2014","false","0.4"," 37 of 105 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","37","105","0","10"
