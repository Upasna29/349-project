"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Avetixz/recommended/11280/","Avetixz","Avetixz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Avetixz/","192 products in account","Penguins Arena: Sedna's World is a penguin themed first-person shooter intended for children, developed by Frogames[www.frogames.com] in December 2008. It's a multiplayer game where players try to knock each other off of an iceberg and into the water. There are four different game modes and each map contains five different temporary weapons or powerups that give the player an advantage. The maps are all very small, thus the rounds are really quick and furious.\n\nThe online multiplayer of this game is practically dead and the artificial intelligence is not very good, often the opponent just falls off the cliff by himself or he just won't let go and the round goes on forever. If you want to buy this game, I would recommend you to get some friends to play it with you, if you play alone you probably won't have much fun. Also the game is pretty repetitive due to the similarity of the maps and the game modes, so it might get boring after a few rounds.\n\nStill it's overall a fun game with cute graphics. It's nothing special, but it has a basic and easily understandable gameplay and the powerups enhance the fun. There's even a map editor, which I really like. You can download it here[www.frogames.com] or download custom maps created by other users here[www.frogames.com]. Even though the game was released five years ago, the developers recently announced an upcoming update, so let's see what the future holds.\n\nPenguins Arena: Sedna's World is great if you want a short-term fun game to play with friends and nothing too serious. Also it's a nice alternative for children to the many violent first-person shooters. The game is only available in a bundle, which is in my opinion not worth the price if you'll only buy it for this game, but if you can get it on sale it's worth a shot.","February 10, 2014","true","4.2"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/11280/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nPenguins Arena: Sedna's World is the kind of game that will almost instantly bring back memories to old school 90's gamers, and despite the fact that the game's appeal is as childish as it can be, that's what makes it even more interesting and nostalgic. There is no story here, Penguins Arena is pure arcade, and even though the days of minimalistic maps and limited abilities are long gone, this is the kind of game that still manages to keep you entertained for a while even in the absence of modern day game concepts. Getting into the game is easy, pressing only a few buttons in order to choose your preferred game mode and set the number of players, and after that you're pretty much good to go. The game's main attraction comes in the form of Teams mode, where up to each player takes control of an entire team of six penguins, allowing you to respawn if you die as long as you still have remaining penguins on your team. Aside from that you also have the Duels mode, where instead of having six penguins you only have one and the last one standing is the indisputable winner and the unlimited mode which is basically classic with an infinite number of penguins. All modes can be played against the AI, but the real fun comes in multiplayer where you can play against your friends or random people on the internet, and if you're really into bringing that 90's gaming feeling back entirely, the game can also be played using LAN Connection. As easy it is to set up games, as hard it is to control them; there's no option to switch the mode or map once you have started the match, so each time you have a sudden change of heart and want to replay a previous map in order to take revenge on your friends, you have to quit your current session and set up a new one, which can prove to be quite annoying, especially if you're doing this with friends and you want to spice up things a bit often.\nRating: 4.5\n\nGameplay\nPenguins Arena: Sedna's World's gameplay mechanics might not be the most refined or innovative out there, after all it's a game about penguins shooting snowballs at each other, and even that simple mechanic has problems working properly sometimes, but that barely bothered me at all. The point of the entire game is to eliminate the enemy penguins by pushing them outside the map; each snowball you land correctly will push your targeted enemy a bit backwards, leaving enemies standing on the edge of the map highly vulnerable. As for why would anyone stand on the edge of the map, well most of the maps are small, so standing in the center might not always be an option and also when you are engaging in four player multiplayer there will be more penguins surrounding you than you can count, so you will always get pushed around, making falling off the platform at some point inevitable. There's a cooldown of a few seconds for shooting snowballs, so pressing the left mouse button non-stop isn't the way to go here, so in theory calculating your throws and using power-ups wisely should ensure your victory; of course that isn't the case for most matches, as some explosions have questionable outcomes, lag will often make you miss shots that should have landed in the enemy penguin and the AI will prove to be more destructive than helpful, but even with all those issues the game still manages to be fun and make you want to take revenge on your friends in the next match instead of rage quitting and that pretty much describes 90's LAN Games magic unlike anything else. Power-ups are the biggest game changer and even though there are only four of them, making you wish that there were at least a few more to give the game a little bit more variety, those that are there have a significant impact on the game, with the Mine pushing enemies further than a snowball normally would, the dynamite fish that once placed down will explode and send anyone around it flying, the fish crate that changes your snowballs to more powerful fish for a few throws and the egg that makes you invulnerable to enemy attacks for a few seconds.\nRating: 5\n\nGraphics\nThere is no good way to say this: as the game feels and plays like a 90s LAN arcade, it looks like one of those as well; the overall graphics are bad, but what is even worse is the repetition of environmental items, moving from one map to another is no big deal as they all look and feel the same and the only thing that differentiates one from another is the position of certain objects on that map. On top of that the number of maps available barely hits 10, as some of them feel way too similar one to another and playing for a few hours in 5 minutes matches will make it feel like they were repeating even faster. As for the visual effects, most of them are absent at all and the ones that are there look like everything else, brought back from a 90's - early 2000's PlayStation 2 game.\nRating: 3.5\n\nAudio\nThe sounds that the penguins make might seem funny and cute at first, but once you hear them over and over again they become boring, because quite frankly they're the same for every situation you'll ever come across. Audio effects are just as bad as the visuals, with sounds missing modern notions such as tonality or pitch, but just as any LAN Arcade game you will probably play this one with your music in the background; that is probably the best way to go since the soundtrack is just as annoying, with the same song playing over and over again until you eventually grow tired of it and stop noticing it at all.\nRating: 3.5\n\nExtras\nEven with all the fun it proves to be once you get past the game's flaws, considering the small amount of maps and modes available, it is impossible not to get bored after a few hours and even though the game does have achievements for the hunters out there, those shouldn't take more than 3 hours to complete.\nRating: 3\n\nVerdict\nLet's be honest, Penguin's Arena: Sedna's World is not a good game, in fact it's a pretty bad one from every aspect, but it's fun and as long as you can find some friends to share that fun with you, this will prove to be a good investment in exchange for a few hours of arcade gaming.\nRating: 3.9\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Penguins Arena: Sedna's World at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=248[/h1]","May 10, 2014","true","4.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

You, as a race, must decide which tribe has the right to live; all WILL perish - at least one may survive.\nSnowball fight for your life.\n\nThere is a decent pool of maps. Some of them have dynamic elements (i.e. a glacier that slowly melts and breaks apart in pieces); several of them have vents that you can ride into the sky to better appreciate the diversity (and for tactical breaks).\nThere are pickups scattered around the map: FishBomb that throws all penguins out of its radius, EssenceOfIce that grants you resistance to knockback, FullFishNet that allows you to shoot more rapidly, etc.\n\n\nThe gameplay is pretty fast-paced considering the artstyle and your standard fire-rate. I'm fairly certain that when I first played this game last year, it didn't have the intro video from which I summarized the story - turned the game from a "cutesy casual FPS" to a gritty FPS that won't offend most sensibilities.\n\nYou must lead your target more often than not. Playing against the AI, I have had (and watched) several minute long Duels (one penguin from two teams versing each other, after all others have fallen) simply because the enemy is very adept in dodging and easing into advantageous positions (that tug-o-war - pushing each other around, trying to get a shot off when they're close to the edge); indeed, so wily, I have thought to myself "What terrible hit detection!" False, the snowballs just grazed them (or went between body and fin) and I was just ready for the fight to be done with.\n\nIt seems the AI is able to maneuver in the air far better than you. Maybe you have to be moving in a direction before you get knocked away to stand a better chance at landing back on the island? - I have watched countless enemies get thrown incredible distances into the air over the ocean, just to watch them miraculously work their way back to the island. I get thrown as they did, I'm barely able to get half the distance back to the island.\nAlso, sometimes when hitting the opponent - and you know you hit them because their eyes grew wide - they barely budge (if at all), whereas you get thrown across the arena after every hit you take. I guess they got caught on the ground...?\nThat EssenceOfIce totally renders the AI invulnerable to attacks - if you pick it up, at times it apparently only (slightly) reduces but doesn't nullify knockback from enemy hits.\n\nOther than the previous paragraph and the inability to pick your team (when you CAN customize your penguin) - and, of course, the insatiable desire for MOAR WEAPONS AND MAPS - I've nothing negative to say about Penguins Arena.\nIt's an FPS (with online multiplayer) - popular(, very).\nIt's cartoony - appropriate for all.\nIt's still being supported by the devs - us gamers are obligated to reward such good practice.\nBuy the game.","May 31, 2015","true","1.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dustyblue/recommended/11280/","dustyblue","DustyBlue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dustyblue/","2247 products in account","This game has the strategic depth of League of Legends and Starcraft combined, with the fast-paced first-person action of Quake. This game should be played in tournaments and have live broadcasts and streams, not any of those other games.\n\nIt also reminds me of Bomberman for some reason. And Club Penguin, for the obvious resemblence to Club Penguin. I give this game a 9.8 out of 10.\n\nI took a 0.1 off the score because it could use more customization options for your penguin. I want him to have a neon green afro, but the stupid developers didn't even bother to think that players would want that. They totally missed out on pleasing the neon green afro demographic. Maybe that's why this game isn't so popular. But it should be, because you can use clown fish as a projectile weapon. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you, Quake railgun; you're outclassed as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• now.\n\nI took another 0.1 off the score because the story sucks. Yeah, I know. The subtitle "Sedna's World" is totally unnecessary. Sedna is just this penguin god that is in the intro video. The intro video that you can only see if you manually click to watch it from the main menu. And it's only like 20 seconds long, and not compelling in any way.\n\nAnd it's just, like, the icebergs dried up from pollution and heat and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, and the penguins didn't know what to do. And then Sedna the penguin god shows up and tells them some cryptic ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with a grammar error at the end, saying really vague stuff that can be interpretted into anything. So the penguins interpretted it and apparently came to an actual conclusion. The caption afterward is like "The penguins reflected on Sedna's words. They knew what to do now...". Which is apparently kill the penguins that are a different color than you. Yup. Penguin racism. And they kill each other by throwing snow balls at the other penguins so hard that they fall off the iceberg. And they drown, I guess, because they get deaded when that happens. So that is the extended lore of Penguins Arena. As if a competitive multiplayer game about penguins knocking each other off icerbergs using snowballs needed any kind of backstory. Well, Penguins Arena gave it a shot. They missed that shot, but they gave it a shot. They tried. For 20-ish seconds, they tried. And that is admirable. Nonetheless, I, as an occasional professional amateur reviewer, feel that I must be objective about my critique and take 0.1 points off the score.\n\nPenguins Arena, folks. A near-perfect game. Here's hoping for Penguins Arena 2: The Arctic Civil War: Rebellion: Resurrection Revelations: Judgment Day: The Return of Jafar.","May 2, 2013","true","4.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

It's basically a more casual version of the 3D Worms games, only with penguins instead of worms, where the objective is to throw your opponents out of the stage by throwing snowballs at them. It allows up to four teams, and there's a few different power ups scattered through the maps.\n\nIt also offers different gamemodes; a team deathmatch mode, where the last team standing wins, a duel mode, where each team has a set number of "lives" and a single member, an unlimited mode, and a custom map mode, which is just like team deathmatch.\n\nAs I mentioned above, it's similar to Worms, not only in the gameplay, but in artistic style as well. Unlike Worms however, this game doesn't feature terrain destruction or heavy weaponry, the most "dangerous" weapons are a huge mine that simply pushes your opponents back, and a fish with a dynamite stick coming out of its mouth.\n\nStill, it's somewhat fun to play, although a bit frustrating at times, since the terrain is very slippery.","May 27, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You throw snowballs at the other penguins to knock them into the shark-infested water.  The ground is slippery, because you're penguins on an iceberg.  You have a little bit of control when knocked into the air, but you can't fly, because you're penguins on an iceberg... is this sinking in yet?\n\nThe art and animation is amateurish, but the gameplay is as fun and family-friendly as an actual big snowball fight.  In addition, when I had an issue getting the game running (they apparently switched publishers and old keys didn't carry over), one of the developers helped me directly.  That would almost warrant a positive review by itself: he impressed me with his speed and committment to getting the game running in my particular environment.  These guys - and it's just the 3 of them - were at the forefront of the wave of indie games we now see on Steam and elsewhere.","December 10, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You play as a penguin throwing snowballs and other, slightly different colored penguins trying to push them off an iceberg and into the shark infested waters below. The maps are fairly varied with some being big arenas with lots of trees covering the edges making them long and sometimes frustrating to end and others being so tiny that a single explosion will throw half the players into the murky depths. Some of the maps even have collapsing glaciers that makes the play area smaller the longer the game drags on.\n\nThere is no health for the Penguins your only weapons are the slow firing snowball and your rather weak punch. Your 3rd weapon, which is both the best and the most risky, is yourself. By running and jumping you can pick up speed and by hitting other penguins transferring that speed into them sending them flying with incredible force. Of course, if you miss or get hit when moving that fast you'll often end up killing yourself. You can also pick up various power-ups on the map ranging for a brief invulnerability to snowballs to a small supply of rapid fire fish or an exploding fish that functions much as a grenade.\n\nGraphically and musically the game is nothing impressive and there is no storyline, no voice-acting or really anything other than your basic deathmatch. The few different modes available only really allow you to change the number of teams in the match and whether or not your additional lives should run around as bots, fighting until you die and take them over, or simply be additional respawns that can't get themselves killed.\n\nAlthough Penguins Arena is a fun little multi-player game it suffers from a number of rather major faults. The lack of any additional modes means that it gets repetitive within a couple of games and the lack of anyone else playing it online means it's only really fun when you can manage to gather a bunch of friends to play with, the bots available in single-player are simply not up to par.\n\nAll in all, not a game I'd recommend you get unless you plan to get it with a couple of friends so you have someone to play with and even then I doubt you will get through many matches before the repetitive nature of the game forces you to stop and go find a better alternative.","May 15, 2013","false","35.7"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","21","41","0","3"

A quick peek at the options menu already shows you what to expect. Atrocious pixelated and bug riddled options, often without a label or a clear effect, empty drop-down menus. Oh boy, you are all in for some delicious treats with this one. Penguins Arena, we might as well take a look at this multiplayer based game. Not that anyone is playing this, but hey, there are Bots as well, what a delight. So you are in a team of penguins, fighting other penguins, on a hideously textured iceberg by trying to hit them with snowballs in order to kick them off into the water. Last time I checked my biology lectures from university, penguins were quite competent swimmers, but these coloured ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• must have skimmed some evolutionary steps I guess. Safe to say, I got motion sick in about three minutes of gameplay, had to move away from the PC for about twenty minutes to avoid throwing up, which sums up my opinion quite nicely about Penguin Arena.","August 27, 2015","false","0.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","5"

Your mission is to eliminate the other team(s) by knocking them into the water by using snowballs (your default weapon) and other power ups.\nThe graphics are decent and the gameplay is quite addictive but it seems to get repeatitive when you play with bots.
