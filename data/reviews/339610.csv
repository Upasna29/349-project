This game is truly satisfying if you're a competition junky. You don't even have to like sport games to enjoy this game.  The gameplay and game mechanics all work well, untill that point where you hit level 24. As a beginner, I started out playing against other noobs and various pro players that had their smurf accounts in the rookie/major league. I had some epic losses, epic victories, various intense close point games that went into second overtime.\n\nEventually, I managed to get to level 25 with a 76% win percentage overall, I felt like a solid player that played his role ( PF ) well. In good matches, I'd block about every shot, bad matches I'd let a few slide.   All the fun in the game stopped though when I entered the  Pro League.\n\nMatch after match, you get to play against level 50 characters that not only have the most ridiculous skills that you could think, they also have so much experience that not in another 1000 matches could you hope to destroy them. They also have, in almost EVERY case, dropped over 200-300 euros on cash shop roulette style items that grant bonus stats, cards and card upgrades that grant..bonus stats, extra skill slots, etc.  You name it.\n\nSo in quick summary. You might love the game in the beginning, you might think you're a genius rookie player destroying the alt characters of pros. But once you actually get to the pro league, prepare to bend over and take it, over and over again untill you yourself are level 44-50 and have unlocked all the skills + slots. Surely by that time, you would also have dropped atleast 60 euros on the game.","April 9, 2015","false","42.5"," 193 of 246 people (78%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","78","193","246","30","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/channel_onion/recommended/339610/","channel_onion","Oseous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/channel_onion/","47 products in account","Bear with me as this is my first game review on Steam:\n\nPros:\n- Great customization (Skills, Freestyle variability, Clothing, Stat allocation)\n- Requires teamwork (Heavy)\n- Crew matches (Like GvG in MMORPGs)\n- Easy to pick up, Hard to master\n\nCons:\n- Community can be toxic (Will explain more later)\n- You can pay for stats\n- Fluid gameplay relies heavily on latency (ping)\n\nFreestyle2 is a great Multiplayer Online 3v3 Streetball game that pleases my thirst for basketball games.\nIt is very easy to pick up (You only use direction keys + 4 basic keys + 2 or 3 more for specific skills),\nbut hard to master.\n\nIt relies moderately on basketball knowledge, such as actual basketball tactics like Pick and Roll, which can be executed in the right situation. To win, you will have to try your best to fulfill your one of five (C, PF, SF, SG, PG) position's purpose.\n\nPositions and their roles are generalized in FreeStyle2, although adventurous stat allocation may lead to fun and creative plays (like improving 3 pointers success rate on C or PFs).\n\nC: Rebounding and blocking, setting up plays under the paint\nPF: Similar to C, but takes an offensive role\nSF: All-rounder (Dunk, rebound, middle jumper, 3s)\nSG: Also an all-rounder with heavier emphasis on 3s\nPG: Playmaker (Passing and loose ball grabbing)\n\nPlaying the position that fits you and doing it right comes with a great rewarding feeling.\nAlso, there are many team compositions which are strong, but you will run into hell lot of weird ones online (Triple Cs)\n\nIf you aren't good at what your position is supposed to be doing by Major (past level 11), you will most likely be dealt with offensive words, telling you that you suck and that you should quit.\n\nThe playerbase isn't large enough to have the greatest matchmaking system and tiers - and this is why sometimes you will face teams that will totally ♥♥♥♥ on your face. Knowing your position and having individual skills is very important in this game and when a single teammate is not pulling their own weight, it shows definitely.\n\nI highly suggest trying each of the 5 positions before moving onto Major (level 11+)\n\nYou can pay for extra stats (btw you can also do this for free, but not as much).\nDoes it help? Yeah, I guess.\nDoes it win games? Maybe - it makes minimal difference.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nLet's say a player purchased items and also obtained cards to improve his 3 pointers.\nIf you are guarding him perfectly, he won't score any 3 pointers.\nIf you don't and give him open shots on 3s, you should really blame yourself.\n\nTeamwork (Strategy, Individual talent, knowing how each other reacts in certain situations) is much much much much holy freaking so much more important and impactful than stats.\n\nGamekiss will be adding controller support very soon, and I am so excited for that!\n\nGive this game a try. If you like working as a team and enjoy basketball in general, you will love it!","April 8, 2015","true","30.0"," 133 of 171 people (78%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","78","133","171","13","1"

I had like 100+ hours on it creating new accounts to earn 150k points. Bought 500 Gkash for the event.\n\nI was able to feel satisfied with how my character looks and plays. But as soon as I reach level 24. No one would play with you. If there is, they will call you NOOB throughout the whole game. Then use a microphone and harass you throughout.\n\nCommunity sucks! People are jerks~! There are some who would play with you but for the most part everyone is a jerk.\n\nDownfall of this game is how jerks high level people or seasoned people are and it really sets me back.\n\nGoodluck to this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/b_1o1/recommended/339610/","b_1o1","Binh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/b_1o1/","2 products in account","I've been playing Freestyle for 7 long years. Since I was 12 years old, Freestyle has been my favorite game.\nIt has been with me throughout all my teenage years, and I don't regret a thing.\n\nEver since it first came out in 2006 (published by Activision), the game has had issues maintaining a good population due to lack of advertising and support from the foreign developers (JCE).\n\nThat's all hopefully going to change now that it has been released on Steam. It's a shame how we had to wait so many years for this because this is one of the most competitive games in the world.\n\nEverybody who plays this game strives to ultimately be the best, and it's a team game so you have to find 2 other players who share the same mindset as you and want to be the best just as bad as you are.\n\nA lot of this game consists of managing egos of not only your rivals, but your teammates also.\nThere is only one ball in the game of basketball, and scoring is only one part of it.\nYou have to have a good overall team that can not only score, but rebound, defend, block, steal, and pass at the right times.\n\nThis game is all about customization and making your player unique. There is a big item shop in the game that allows you to buy headgear,tops,bottoms, shoes, and accesories to make your baller look unique.\n\nThere are also Freestyles that allow you to change basic animations like dunks and shots so you can turn your simple one handed dunk in to a crazy 360 between the legs dunk!\n\nThen you have your skills. Skills are new animations and upgrades you unlock through leveling your character.\nSkills are the most important part of the game since they give really useful animations like diving for the ball or fading away.\n\nWhen you first start the game and you go in to Rookies, you will be playing versus new players such as yourself who are also learning the game and it will be a cake walk for those who learn faster than others.\n\nBeware though, there is a huge learning curve when you reach the big leagues (PRO Channel).\nPeople do NOT like losing in Pros because it will result in their win % going down and the person that beat you having proof of them beating you.\n\nI was never a guy to make many friends on this game, in fact I made a lot more enemies than I did friends and I am very hated but my advice to you new players is, make some friends before you reach Pros.\n\nTry your hardest to communicate and socialize, post on the forums. MAKE FRIENDS. You do not want to be that "random" "unknown" person in Pros because nobody knows you and you will be kicked out of teams that have good players when you try to join because they simply don't know you.\n\nYou will be stuck on the "Noob Treadmill". That means you will be stuck playing only with players who are really bad and don't care who they play with, and other unknown players like you are which means you will lose A LOT and people will never see you as good.\n\nSo make friends before you get to pros! Get your name out there.\nIf you pick up this game and decide you like it and you're either a PG,PF,or C then you can add my character in game, I will help you. My IGN is: Zarry\n\nSo yeah, that is it for my long review and although my time on this game is coming to an end, I am happy it is finally getting the exposure it deserves because I know theres a kid out there right now maybe even reading this whos 12 or 13 years old that will fall in love with this game and aspire to be the very best player just like I did.\n\nGood look in the pros, newbs.","April 1, 2015","true","84.5"," 139 of 213 people (65%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","65","139","213","23","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yurop64/recommended/339610/","Yurop64","The Donald","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yurop64/","48 products in account","Bear in mind that this review comes from a person who used to play Freestyle 1 a lot of years ago. I've played in Thailand servers, in Gamekiss (NA) servers, in 4Game (Russian) servers and my country always had a big community in this game because we are big on basketball. There will be a lot of comparing\n\nBefore my rant, remember: I HATE BASKETBALL.\nYes, I hate basketball. I've played this game for so long (the Freestyle 1 version) even though I hate basketball. You know why? Because this game is super fun even if you don't know anything about basketball. There is constant action, it's super rewarding to block, rebound and when you hit a 3-pointer, it's the best feeling ever.\n\nFreestyle 1 was actually rather bad.\nIt was full P2W, clothes that give attributes were all costing money, the OP moves that were difficult to block were all expensive and you HAD to buy them with real life money. There were serveral exploits like when you receive a pass, you get a speedboost. Exploiting that, you could always step back faster than your opponent and make yourself unblockable. Level system was awful, you only got your real position at level 15 and the grind to 45 (max level) was like the whole game. High level people could do anything and everything so you had to block them every time because they would hit every shot. You know why that was awful? That's right, the speed boost exploit.\n\nFreestyle 2 possibly improves every mechanic that existsted in FSSB1.\nSkills costs like 3k at the start, meanwhile you get like 50k points at the start by registering, eliminating the grinding element of the game.\nFreestyles (Skills that only makes your shot/dunk different, making it harder to be blocked) can now be used only once or twice per game because you have to meet the requirements to do them. However, once you do them, it's garanteed points, so I think that's a nice touch.\nYou choose freestyles on your own, instead of them spinning in the exact same order for the whole game.\nMusic is constantly playing in game, making you feel in action. Also, the soundtrack makes you super pumped, while you can also configure it\nFSSB1 Games were all the same: PFs/Cs rebound, pass it to SGs and they shoot 3points OR PFs just dunking and you can't block them because they have paid for the awesome almost unblockable dunks. In FSSB2, or at least in early stages of FSSB2, it won't be like this. SGs can be blocked easily, there are way more rebound patterns for rebounders to learn, etc.\nBigger skill variety\nCan be played with a controller. I haven't tried it yet, but I think it might be really fun\nAwesome rewarding system, making you feel progressing, most daily quests  aren't considered grinding and there are constant events. You also constantly get items and a lot of points, also making the game not P2W\nEVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE BASKETBALL, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS GAME\n\nIt's super rewarding. I watched a streamer play it with friends in front of 13k thousand viewers yesterday and he had a blast, meanwhile not even knowing that you can't shoot while you are getting defended by someone. He still had fun, I saw the excitement in his eyes meanwhile he was watching whether  the ball will go into the basket or not.  ALSO, IT'S SUPER FUN TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS\n\nEven if you dislike basketball, dislike sports games like I do, you might still have a blast. It might still be super fun for you, or at least fun for 3-10 hours. You have nothing to lose, it's  free to play. Grab some friends, put your game pants and gunnars and go play it! This game is awesome and the devs definitely stepped up their game, adding new elements and improving  the old ones.\n\n\n\n\n","April 12, 2015","true","6.8"," 44 of 57 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","44","57","6","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joeyabuki4/recommended/339610/","joeyabuki4","Good Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joeyabuki4/","109 products in account","Having played this game for quite some time this is how I feel about it:\n\nPositive:\n+ It's fun: Seriously, the game is really fun.\n+ Has a nice mixture of simplicity and complexity: The game is easy to get into, the controllers are kind of basic but it has a high skill cap, it's hard to master them.\n+ Character Costumization: It's really nice.\n+ The game has tons of features to keep you entertained: Bingo, My Ball, Freestyles, Challenges, etc.\n+ It's rewarding to play: The achievement system combined with Bingo, My Ball, Freestyles, etc. makes you feel like a winner even when you're losing, so there's some reward in actually playing the game, even if you're not that good at it and just like playing it for the sake of having fun.\n+ MVP: MVP rewards the player that contributes more for the team instead of the one that just scores all the time. Maybe it could be a bit more balanced, but it's nice to see the game reward team play.\n\nOfcourse there are negative points too.\n\nNegative:\n- Paying actually makes you better: Or atleast makes you seem like you are. Paid characters, like Ginger, for example, WILL punish you if you make a mistake, they are deadly because of the bonus they are given. Maybe in higher levels of gameplay that becomes less noticeable, but in lower levels it's really noticeable, they barely miss. And also there are skill slots unlockable by paying, and that gives more options to people that pay to unlock them, giving them an advantage over free plays. I'll put this on capslock: THE GAME IS NOT FULLY PAY TO WIN. That's not what I'm saying here! What I'm saying is the feeling that I got, that if you're a free player and paying against a paid character in a similar player skill level it's more likeable that he will easily punish your mistakes thanks to the character he has than you are likely to punish is, since you don't have as much stats and special bonus as he has.\n- Matchmaking is... weird: I dont know how matchmaking works on this game, but more than a few times I got to play against players that you could see by the skills they were using that they were atleast 10 levels above the players on my team. And I also felt the reverse on some games, that I was being matched with people levels below. Most of the time it felt fine, but I think it was like 80/20, so I thought it would be worth to mention.\n- Menus: Menus can be a bit confusing for newer players, since they are presented with a huge BOOM of stuff.\n- Clarity: The game isn't very clear on some stuff. For example, I had to go google for quite a bit of time why I couldn't level any stat after putting 5 points into it and the game doesn't tell you what keys to use on your controller, so even if it supports it, it's kind of better to play on the keyboard. That kind of stuff.\n\nOverall it's a good and fun game. I recommend it, even if you don't like basketball that much, give it a shot and try to bring your friends to play it with you, only makes it more fun. I'm curious to see the game evolve, since It's kind of new, from what I've read.","May 12, 2015","true","94.5"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","41","52","2","3"

When it comes to BallingIsLife™ this game still deserves the award of being fun and even if you don't like sport games, this is still an enjoyable game due to the mechanics of it and animation which I find humorous. Game was my childhood and I'm still playing it.\n\nPros:\nEasy to learn\nFun to play\nLots of clothes and customizations\nLots of skills\nToy system is interesting to play around for stats\nStill feels like the old free style games\nDunking on people feels amazing!\nTournaments\nGrowing community\n\nCons:\nPay to win *Debatable*\nLots of foreign people play so teamwork is hard to communicate\nServers are a little unbalance from level caps\nLots of people sliding due to the lag of the server\n\nReasons why I say pay to win is debatable is because I have accounts that have never touched a single cent from my wallet, and overall I am still able to win games, on my main accounts I have 85% win rates on them and played over thousands of games with them, My personal opinion it really depends on your skill level and how you play the game, because when you're playing the game, you'll see that anyone can shoot and make baskets, or defend and block shots, its really how well you play with your team and how good your offense and defense is. Overall good game, I enjoy it and Its free, so play the game.","April 2, 2015","true","86.6"," 46 of 68 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","46","68","7","0"

Post game rewards and leveling up keeps you playing and grinding through the game. Just remember that if you want the best experience , team up with 2 of your buddies and it will be a lot more fun and enjoyable to play :)\n\nOverall: If your looking for a realistic basketball simulation - don't bother, It's not NBA 2K, but if your looking for a fun, grindy,arcady team game - try it out.","April 29, 2015","true","10.3"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","30","40","2","0"

If you enjoy the game, I recommend learning the basics of team-play if you want to advance any further: passing, rotating, defense, etc... like i said, it's not all just shoot shoot shoot steal steal steal...\n\nAbout the community... this game is sadly filled with a lot of kids who talks a lot of trash and have big egos... It's like high school all over again... everyone has their own "cliques" that they play with and will kick anyone else out (sadly, sometimes I don't blame this type of behavior because a lot of players don't bother to learn the game correctly so they become a liability to the team, therefore leading to no one wanting to play with them). I don't suggest you visit the forums of this game, especially on the gamekiss website, it's so toxic...\n\nOverall, I like the FSB series... but the horrible community and lack of competent players/teammates can make it frustrating for newcomers... If you have friends who are willing to go through the ups/downs of the game with you, I think FSB can be very enjoyable experience...","April 5, 2015","true","219.0"," 48 of 73 people (66%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","66","48","73","9","0"

I only experience small amounts of latency issues that really changed the tide of the match but it was rare.\n\nMy true gripe with the game is the balancing as you level up, not so much the balance once you're at the top of level and have unlocked all the skills and attributes. During the first few levels on the beginner server, the game is fun but it's ruined by ball hogs and people who don't understand the sport or the game at all. I think out of 50+ Matches I had in the beginner server, very very few of the matches were competitive. Either your team stomped the other team or your team got stomped because you were paired up with people who didnt understand the fundamentals to the game (would try to do half court shots with a C, SG's would just stay under the rim for a rebound) But the games that were closer in score were actually really fun. Once you're fresh out of the beginner server, thats when the game gets even worse, you still have people who don't understand the game at all but not only that, you are matched up against people who have unlocked very strong skills that you don't have access to until you grind out several dozen matches. These skills literally make the player exponentionally overpowered compared to the skills you have when you are a fresh level 12 (Alley-Oop spam, Back Step dribble, etc.) So you have to endure through these matches because more often then not, you will be paired up with people still learning the game and have no idea how to play against teams that are already overpowered so they resort to afk exp farming. That alone is abused like heck, people just matches just to afk and get the match experience because they know they will most likely lose to higher level players.\n\nI'd love to recommend the game because it can be really fun, but it just gets worse until you get to much higher level and everyone balances out and the game becomes more skill based. But enduring the grind of the early levels coupled with players that don't understand the game and the afk farm, just ruins it all for me.","April 13, 2015","false","27.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Gamers who have experience in NBA 2K series would find this extremely easy to play.\nAs for the characters, they are very cute and fierce. (I like Grace of Noble lol)\n\nThe downside is, it is very slow to load at the start of the game and at the start and end of every game. It lags occasionally.\nAnother downside is not everybody is speaking English, people usually prefer speaking their own language but I don't think that there's a language barrier, though. They prefer Filipino, Thai, Indonesian language and etc. (I am talking about the Asian server here) Sometimes it is an issue for them if you are from different country and their own native bad words are all around the shout-out area. Not a big deal, though, because the community is somewhat friendly too.\nAs for customization, there are a vast number of equipments that you can use but you cannot remove the default equipment of your character for some reason. like for instance, the armband defaults.\nAnother thing I don't like is the special characters are so expensive but I think it's okay because they are called special for a reason.\n\nI want Girls Generation (SNSD) characters to be released in the Steam version of the game too.","April 12, 2015","true","56.4"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","14","20","4","0"

Basically theres 3 "tiers" "leagues" for competive mode, which is the main event of this game, allthough you can play with and vs AI. I recommend AI-Game-Mode but the competive mode, the main dish so to say, sucks. I will explain. 1. This game is PAY 2 WIN, At first you might not see it directly but in later game you notice it is. The 3 Tiers are Rookie, Major and Pro. Rookie League: Either real noobs like you and me, with different outcome and so on. +Pro's with their new characters. In Rookie League some of them say stuff like "OMG OMG WORST SF EVER" "LEARN TO PLAY!" and many many harsh things. They dont bother to explain what exactly you did wrong and so on.  Even if you are C and they are SG and you dont manage to rebound EVERY ball, just maybe 50-60% it can happen easily that they start to flame. In Rookie League. Without asking your level or experience. Without explaining, without giving help.  If you manage to hit lvl 12 quick, which is easy done, the heat is on. Major League. If you mess up here, be prepared to see many censored lines^^\n\nNext thing: Even on EU Server, you see many many Russians. And they as unfriendly as a drunk russian could be.\n\nIf you dont want to sink lots of cash into the game, dont have many friends you can form a crew with and learn together with and as good as allways play together or have a thick fur or dont plan to play further than Rookie or Major League, stay away from this game. Call a friend. Play ball in RL. You might not dunk, but you might be able to end the next guy who flames you without reason or explanation.

But not when you created a new level 1 character and being called noob. Nevertheless, you'll level up eventually, so it's not really a problem to me. For the gameplay, it's smooth and good-looking. The graphic is weird but it does give you a fresh feeling, like, you know, first time playing a game that is made in Korea. Despite the community is a little bit bad, but, just stay strong and ignore them, like you're deaf or something. It's not a big deal, but the big deal is dealing with yourself. It's F**KING HARD to ignore them, and I've played this game for 700+ hours, you know how much pain I've gone through. But it's really fun, trust me. If you're a fan of basketball, or you love to play basketball but never had the chance to play it, it's a good game. And it becomes addictive when you play it for a several hours. So, for those who want to play it(after reading my review), please do play it with your friends, because everyone there is your rival. Only some of them are friendly(just like me), so I'll see you on the court. My name is qpJackqp in-game. Now here is the rating:\nAudio:7/10\nGraphic:7/10\nGameplay:9/10(because some player afk)*I assume you guys know what is "afk"\nCommunity:6/10\nOverall:8/10\n*Also, I spent RM120 on this game, LOL","April 20","true","940.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Absolutely NOT !!\n\nIt is simply a PAY-To-WIN  game. Let me elaborate rather briefly.\n\n1) You can purchase skill slots to constantly have an upper hand, therefore no matter how uber l33t your opponents are, you have more options.\n\n2) You can purchase special game characters that have higher stats by default, so a special PF will always beat common Center under the rim. You will cap your rebound, they will still out-jump you etc.\n\n3) You can purchase cards that will make your character un-blockable.\n\nBONUS: The majority of players are from Turkey / Russia, two countries located mainly Asia whose players absolutely love playing in the EU server, despite there are 2 asian servers. This means ridiculous lag to players based in the EU.\n\nYou will happily play the game at first and in the first 20-30 levels you will just give this the benefit of the doubt; then by the time you have learned the game you realise it's futile.\n\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME !!","August 1, 2015","false","195.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","2"

It always has been ever since it was created with Sierra, I been playing FS for a very long time. However, I will not be putting this as a negative review since I still play this game and will always play it. I just love FS. Don't my cons scare you, however take it in consideration since it's true. If you don't believe me play FS 2 for about 25 hours and then tell me what you see.\n\nNow here is the pro and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Fun game when you have respectful players\n\nCons:\n- P2W: Pay to Win, which is very true. For example: When you buy a special character, you get a bonus stats when you create them. So if you were a PF, you would get a bonus like 5+ or something like that.\n- LAGGY, most of the players are from other countries playing on the US server. When you ask them why they don't play on theirs, they say something like "Nobody is on the server, blah blah"\n- There are some good clothes in the game, however if you want to add attributes to them you can but they only last like 30 days or so. It wasn't like in FS, where some clothes you could pay to add attributs and it stays with you forever.\n- The freestyles are random and you never get to choose which ones you want like in FS. For example, if I wanted miller time for my SG, I would have to get Freestlye tickets and play the random sh*t hoping I could get it.\n- Most people don't know how to play at all, and also there is a lot of holders when it's the last 20 seconds.\n- The last thing, its a god damn PAY TO WIN.\n\nSo, if you want to win a lot, you either do two things: First, pay money to get special characters, etc. Blah blah. Two: practice a lot and learn to PASS the ball, and use teamwork. I prefer the second option since in this game, it is easy to beat the special characters. And it's called TEAMWORK!!!","November 18, 2015","true","271.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"

Make the game more realistic and add some more physics and allow me to be able to block a dunk. There is also way too much to the game yet way too little, and what I mean by that, is there are stat cards and free styles and "magic" clothes that would give you the edge in a match. Just have normal basketball, that's all you need. Too little, basically what I said before, to where there aren't any game modes, and just there isn't much customization either, unless you wanna be a dragon helmeted nba player or a humongous black Jonas Brother.

It's not like I hate it, nor did I have a terrible experience playing it. Sadly it just doesn't really add up to an enjoyable game.\n\nLet's break this down quickly:\n\nPROS-\n\n- Cool Idea.  3v3 Online Basketball? Check.\n- Graphics are decent (Aside from horribly clunky animation)\n\nCONS-\n\n- No controller support.... in a sports game? In 2015?\n- No way of remapping keys. (Hope you like arrow key movement.)\n- OMG the music gets repetitive, and it never.stops.playing.\n- Doesn't feel like a basketball game, just a twitchy "be in the right place and press the right button at the right time" sim.\n- Pay to Win\n- No full court options.\n- Twichy Clitchy Clunky Character animations when playing. (Just look at the gameplay videos)\n- User Interface is confusing at best\n- No character creation, just customizing existing characters.\n\n\nI wanted to like this game, I really did. I love basketball, and the thought of a F2P online basketball MMO where you play as a single player sounded awesome.\nSadly after playing the game for about an hour and just closed it and uninstalled. This is NOT the game for you if you have a sports game itch wanting to be scratched. The gameplay basically consists of keeping your character as close the the opponents as possible and then pressing the appropriate button of steal or block at the right time. That's defense. Offense is basically just the opposite, but your steal and block buttons change to pass and shoot. Simple enough, the controls seem streamlined, although awkward. Only one problem... you can't change them. At all. No remapping, no controller support... wtf.\nIn game your character feels very sluggish when moving... even when you hit your dash key he moves forward about a head's width. Really. The half court isn't bad, but I'd love to see at least an OPTION for full court play. (though with the slow, clunky characters it'd take forever to traverse.) After playing 2 games I wanted to punch the person who made the music. It becomes obnoxious very quickly. There's about 3 songs, that just loop...\n\nAll in all I can't say I enjoyed playing this. It doesn't feel like a basketball game, and it's shortcomings, especially the controls, really kill it. (Some people may argue you can use third party programs to make a controller work with the game, but that does NOT excuse the game for not having any controller or remapping capability itself.)\n\nTLDR:\n\nIf you want to play a fun basketball game, go play something else.\n","April 2, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yeah, that's a skill and you don't have it equipped!\n\n-Community sucks ♥♥♥. They just ♥♥♥♥♥, moan, and act really rude. Nobody wants to help.\n\n-Worst tutorials i've ever seen. It teaches you how to move and shoot the ball. Seems easy, right? Well you get in game and lets say go for a dunk. All of a sudden you see a guy fly from across the court and knock you down mid air like he's ♥♥♥♥ing superman. I still don't know how people were screening.

You open a room and stay with it open forever without starting any game).\n- No "click a button" Auto-Matchmaking to avoid room problems.\n- It seems like there's low playerbase some times.\n- A bunch of P2W stuff that you need to get better.\n- Menus are a little confusing for new players but you'll get used to it.\n- Should have a better introduction.\n- Servers have problems, be sure you play on your closest region or you'll find yourself DCing or having lag problems.\n\n*Overall it's really fun but difficult to get good at and understand how the game and systems work, give it a try!","August 31, 2015","true","11.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

The mechanics is way different & more fluent/realistic.\n\nI didn't start alone though. I called a few friends to come & play with me, next thing you know, we enjoyed the game so much, we made our first max level. So after hitting max level, i made a new position & repeated that process til i made every position to 50.

I can't find a grasp on how the shooting gauge works. The MC is God awfully annoying, since all he says is "nice pass!" "oh you sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!". Community is filled with stuck up tight-wads with too much bullplop in their ears. Megaphones (an all out broadcast to the server) usually says something from xXx__BALLisLIFE__xXx "heh rekt u #@$# pretty easily step up your game". I find these rather disparaging comments annoying.\n\nThe rookie channel is, as a commenter said before, filled with pros, as people could not merge their old accounts onto Steam. Articles of clothing are merely for looks, which really shows if someone has easy access to their parents' credit card number. Rookie channel, again, has some people failing a layup or easily shooting half-court threes with no trouble. The game lags a bit, sometimes characters and the ball spazzing out, or having characters that are nowhere near the ball all of a sudden having it.\n\nThe community, as said, is a bunch of stuck up tight-wads. Some people ball hog and just keep dunking. Others can't read English, as when you need to go for 3's, they keep making layups. Like what the crud bro.\n\nThe swearing filter has a really low bar. Words like "crap", "crud", "wtf", and even IDK has DK censored into i**, assuming dk is short for "♥♥♥♥". That really throws me off about this game.\n\nTo summarize, a stuck up community, poorly optimized gameplay, really harsh swearing filter, spazzy characters and items. Also, don't forget really crappy random drops. Keep pulling blank cards. Continuing: megaphone abuse, and the somehow hated cell-shaded art. I really adore cell shading, so this game is looks nice. Then again, I haven't optimized it for my computer yet. Yet.\n\nOverall, game gets like a 2.5 out of 5 stars. Give it a whirl. If it's not your thing, then uninstall it. That's what I'll be doing.","April 5, 2015","false","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IllegalAmigos/recommended/339610/","IllegalAmigos","Oliver Hart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IllegalAmigos/","193 products in account","*Update April 17th*\nSome of the problems I explained previously have been addressed, this is one of the few games I've seen where the developers actually do care about the community. They've added more servers, they divided the character levels to balance the skill range, and they have been making constant improvements to the game.\n\nThe main reason I am rating this game down is due to the AWFUL community that has no business playing this game, let alone any competitive multiplayer games. This game is just as realistic if not more than NBA 2K15, which is a downfall due to the fact most people who get this game thinks it looks cute and its free, I'm going to take a shot in the dark and say most of the people who play this game are 5-12, I have a hard time believing 95% of human beings who encounter this game are mentally challenged.\n\nThat's not the only thing wrong with this game, there is also characters and items you can buy in the cash shop to get a huge attribute and skill boost over your opponents. I don't mind this for the most part, because you still have to be good at the game to utilize it properly. Basically if you're average and go this route you'll be great, but most people I've came across that have these perks are bad at the game.\n\nI'm not saying avoid this game, I'm just saying at least go into this with SOME knowledge of how to play basketball and be selfless, you will not win a 3v3 pickup game by yourself period. When you are able to find a decent teammate or two and everything clicks together its amazing, but as stated before that's very rare. This game is a ton of fun, and there is a lot of depth and excitement to everything they implemented.\n\nI won't give this game a thumbs up until they enable some kind of performance ranking system based on individual skill, similar to DotA. Seriously, something needs to be done about these bad players. I'm almost in the Pro league and I still encounter these players frequently.\n\nOne last sidenote, my main character is a Center so that also adds to the stress level due to it being the hardest position to play by far. Every game I have to guard 2 people, get every rebound, set screens to get my teammates open shots, do a majority of the scoring, protect the paint and even the perimeter at times, and obviously block shots. It's a tall order man.","April 12, 2015","true","72.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had a splendid time playing this game with my friends the other day until... the 8th of April, 2015, 3:30 P.M. PST. Once I logged in to play this wonderful game, I retrieved my gifts and coupons. Afterwards, I went to buy some clothing to look swagggy. To test the clothing in-game, I went into a Co-op room. From there, I moved around and TRIED to shoot. From out of nowhere, I could not shoot. I kept pressing AND holding D, but all my character did were pump fakes (was playing as Shooting Guard). I was greatly upset. As an attempt to fix this problem, I played as another character. Unfortunately, I still couldn't shoot. My final attempt of fixing the problem was to reinstall the game. Once finished, I logged in and tried again. I had my hopes up, but Freestyle 2: Street Basketball disappointed me. I still could not shoot. Please, developers of this game, fix my problem and reignite my dreams. Thank you.

No one should ever talk ♥♥♥♥ about this glorious, godly game. This game deserves a 10/10 especially in the support, options, and spelling department(do they have a spelling department?). Please, rate 11/10 and play game all day everyday. Definitely no BS and no fail mechanics like good-ping-to-rebound, late blocking, bs blocks, or bs shots. NONE OF THIS IS IN THE GAME. DEFINITELY ALL BASKETBALL MECHANICS ARE LEGIT. THERE ARE DEFINITELY NO HACKERS IN THIS GAME...\n\nLegit Review(02/03/16):\nAfter playing this game for 10 months, it is safe to say that the company who runs this game is complete garbage. They do not care about the community at all, and would rather look for the game to turn into a gambling simulator than a fun basketball game. They do not care about hackers, and let them roam free. I would definitely be hesitant about picking this game up, but I will still recommend it because I still enjoy it very much. For other folks who are starting out... meh.\n\nTl;dr:\nGame is an arcadey-basketball game.
