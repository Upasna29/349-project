The reason I bought this game was because I was going through one of those "I have hundreds of games but nothing to play" phases on my day off. It honestly took me by surprise, and I quickly got addicted.\n\nFarm for your Life seems to have been put together by ideas from other games.\n-You have the farming aspect which is similar to that of Harvest moon and runic frontier. The farming is the bread and butter of the game, as you can imagine by taking a look at the title.  You have some land, you clear it, plow it, barter for seeds, sow them, water them, and occassionally sprinkle some fertilizer to keep the plants from dying.\n\n-You have your restaurant, which is really the feature that caught me. You serve dishes made with your produce at the restaurant. Instead of getting paid in game currency or something, you barter with your clients and can actually choose what you want from their inventory (which is pretty awesome when you desperately need more of a specific supply). As you expand your farm, you can upgrade your restaurant to accommodate more people and expand the range of dishes you serve. Also, to learn any dish, you must first purchase it from the peddler, go to the oven, and play fruit ninja with the ingredients. The better you do, the faster you can cook that particular dish.\n\n-You then have zombies. When night falls, zombies pop out from paths at the edge of the map and walk ever slowly towards your farm and restaurant to destroy it. Like Plants vs Zombies, you will end up using your crops to kill them by throwing it at them. You can also use items you bartered for in your restaurant to create defensive turrets like a corn cannon to cover one side of the map while you fight in the other.\n\nThis all seems like a lot to do, and it is, specially when your farm and restaurant are heavily upgraded. But you recieve NPC help in exchange for shelter and a daily meal. They pop up as you expand.\n\nThe story overall was decent, but not much different than endless. It could use a few more tweeks.\n\nI would give the game a 9/10. With a little more indepth story and some more content, it would be perfect.","October 28, 2014","true","18.0"," 97 of 105 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","97","105","2","0"

To optimize recepies you can play a sort of Fruit Ninja-style minigame At night you go solo against zombies with nothing but veggie-powered defenses and your throwing arm to protect yourself.\n\nAfter you get enough employees you can start exploring the woods for some helpful items and additional building materials. You might even argue in favor of this game being compared to Animal Crossing or The Sims in some aspects, though those games are not as goal-oriented.\n\nWhen you've completed the campaign's tutorial, if you find the story boring or short you can switch to Endless Mode. Arguably the more enjoyable mode.\n\nThe depth of this game will sneak up on you.","June 16, 2014","true","8.5"," 81 of 105 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","81","105","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JSJohansen/recommended/266390/","JSJohansen","J.S. Johansen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JSJohansen/","1978 products in account","Intro\n\nJust like my friend Kilbur said in his review. Why is this game fun?!\nIts too fun. I started it and can't stop. I have plans for today and I should sleep, but I can't.\nI'll post spoilers ALL the way at the BOTTOM because some features of the game come after the tutorial, and exactly what those features are kinda take away from the pleasant surprise, but still for those who don't care and just want to know, I'll post a complete list at the bottom, of as much as I've found so far.\n\nThe game has a simple premise, you have a farm, you maintain it, plant whatever you want, pick apples from trees, chop down trees and smash rocks; nothing special right? Boy was I wrong.\n\n\n\nThe game\n\nI started the game, made my character (surprising amount of customization options! Resembling the character creation of a modern RPG game - more options than anything I've seen in this genre.)\n\nThe tutorial is excellent and easy to follow for absolutely anyone, this game is very casual friendly, more so than the standard casual game. I wasn't exactly paying attention and still managed to get everything, even ignoring dialogue.\n\nAfter the tutorial concluded and I was fixing up my farm from scratch, I was having a good time. Buying stuff from the merchant in the small town the farm is located in. Started planting corn and potatos, and harvested them one by one, I managed to ignore the "upgrades" npc, and although it would have been great to have that crate to put stuff in instead of taking one corn at a time, it was still fun, not tedius.\n\nMaintaining the farm is relaxing, you don't stand still watching over your corn like a hawk while they dry up or something, it takes a long time before anything gets close to dying/destroyed. You are also able to hire npc's to do work for you (think permanent companions) but instead of paying them in cash, all you need to do is make them breakfast every morning. While my npc friend was watering, harvesting etc I was having fun with another huge feature that I really didn't expect.\n\nWhile you have the farm, you can also make food for traveling npcs. You start out with two recieps and instead of just clicking on an icon and "learning" it instantly, you get to play a mini-game that reminded me of fruit ninja or whatever its called. You cut flying corn and tomatoes and try to get them to drop into the pot, depending on the time, you get 1-3 stars. For those who don't like this though, there's a skip button in the bottom right corner.\n\nAfter you've done this ONCE, you just need to select the receipt out of the list of known receipts and just gather the ingredients needed from the storage beside you. Yet another aspect of the game which does not at all feel tedious! I've tried Diner Town and the likes but wasn't a big fan of that type of game, also, whenever I play anything that strikes me as casual, I'm not really in the mood for mouse clicking spam styled gaming.\n\nDon't get me wrong though! There's still tons to do, its just not twitch-left-click-precise-adrenaline-pumping type of game, thank god. There is no artificial difficulty making up for lack of content. Another thing I loved was that the people I didn't serve/couldn't serve don't get a floating angry face over their head and attempt to ruin my happy little resturaunt. Instead they just leave, those that do get served/a spot on the table(s) stay there until they get their food, there is no annoying stress factor.\n\nInfact the player could easily balance both things alone, although why anyone would choose to ignore the npc companions is beyond me, it's still possible for those that would want to.\n\nIf you need some wood, stone or just want to wander around. There are multiple entrances into forests etc, where you walk around avoiding those zombies that get too close, while you get some resources etc. The things you gather are shown on the top of the HUD, so your screen isn't filled up with loot a la arpg/dungeon crawl games. I haven't reviewed a game in this amount of depth for a very, very long time. Especially not like this, as - while writing this - I am desperately trying not to alt-tab back because I know if I do, I'll never get this review done.\n\n\n\nSummery (tl;dr and/or oh-god-why-look-at-all-these-words)\n\nGame is a surprising amount of fun\n\nFeatures:\n*Character Creation - Lots of visual options easily comparable to actual RPGs\n*Farming - Put down fences, grow some crops, milking cows, hiring workers\n*Resturaunt - Serve food, features a fruit-ninja-esque mini-game too! (mine looks more like a soup kitchen right now)\n*Adventure - wander through forests and other areas in search of stuff\n*Lite-Combat - Grab your corn, potatoes, tomatoes or whatever you have available and throw them at enemies/zombies\n*Upgrades - Buy other crops, better equipment, features a small tech-tree to buy and upgrade facilities, also a laboratory","June 16, 2014","true","9.5"," 44 of 62 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","44","62","0","0"

People will pay you and stay until they are served, taking up spaces in the restaurant instead, so you can't get any more customers until they are gone.\n\nThe game is controlled entirely with the mouse from an isometrical perspective. It clearly is inspired by games such as Harvest Moon or its clones without however reaching that depth. There are two relevant options at the start of a game - campaign or free play, zombies attack at night or not. If you choose the campaign mode you start with practically nothing, and can build up your farm relatively freely. The ultimate goal then is to survive the zombie apocalypse. If you choose to be attacked at night, you must waste your resources on defeating zombies or they plunder your farm.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game, as said above, is controlled with the mouse entirely. The controls are 95 percent fine, but if you have the shovel selected you can very easily destroy your plants by accident. You can select four tools, but with the exception of the shovel they are used automatically without being selected anyway. In your farm and restaurant level, you build up the farm while in the forest level you can collect wood and stone which are needed for buildings and stone as ammunition for the slingshot weapon. Every resource except coins can also be used for trading. Coins seem to be only a tutorial leftover without any real use.\n\nThe farming is done by planting seeds, watering plants and fertilizing them every now and then. Talking to plants makes them grow faster, but the effect seems limited, probably to one growth boost per individual harvest. Seeds are very expensive but only expire if you don't take care of them. If they are watered and fertilized - water is for free while fertilizer costs a small amount of resources equal to one harvest or two for corns - before the meters drop to zero, the plants last forever, so you make a profit sooner than later.\n\nThe restaurant must be built first with your wood and other resources, then guests will visit it to eat something. You can buy various recipes at the merchant for high prices, but they eventually amortise. The guy in front of it allows you to buy improvements and other useful tools. After a while - probably depending on how many recipes you have - several other people join you and automatically cook or farm. The help is very welcome since the AI works very fast. However, it once messed really up for me, resulting in plants being not watered, etc.\nYou can have chickens and cows but they take a long time to produce eggs and milk and eat a lot, so you will need to grow wheat and grass for them. As far as I see, they won't die even with few food but won't produce resources then.\n\nAt night you get attacked by zombies if you chose so in the settings. You should turn this off since it is just annoying. Zombies take several resources to be defeated and give no benefits. They destroy your fences pretty quickly as well, so later several weapon systems are a must, which - you guessed it - also eat a lot of resources. Slingshots take stone and seem pretty fine, but you need many then. Corn cannons are also fine, but eat a lot of corn. At first it is fun but if you need to defend against 5 or 6 zombies every night it becomes just annoying. Just turn it off before you start the game, unless you enjoy survival things.\n\nLogic error: The zombies in the forest attack you - you must avoid them to keep your resources. The zombies in the farm steal only your resources and maybe destroy your things (I didn't test that).\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are the usual casual cuteness style. Positive is that you can customize how your character should look either at the start of the game or later by entering your house - which is the only purpose of your house.\n\nSound:\nThe sound is fine, it is nothing spectacular but also not disturbing.\n\nAchievements:\nSeveral achievements are bugged, as far as I read. This diminishes the value of an otherwise enjoyable game.\n\nRecommended:\nSince the developer seems to have given up the game in a state with a few bugs left, it is worth getting in a sale or - like now at IndieRoyale - in a bundle. The price of 8,99€ would be okay for the length, but not for the gameplay and support. I recommend waiting for a 70p off or more sale if you miss the bundle.","August 7, 2014","true","8.7"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","2"

Otherwise, a cute quick game to play.\n\nEdit: With more hours of the game going by, I can see why many people on Big Fish find it annoying. 1. You REALLY cannot go back 1 star for meals. 2.

At first glance it looks like nothing special but i quickly realized the amount of care that was put into this game. Althought very short, the game has lots of replay value, like most games with farming as a theme.\n\nAnd would you believe it? The game keeps getting and update every now and again. (as in, every couple months or years) Which may sound infrequent, but considering the dev team is 2 people that develop the game in their spare time, the game is finished (no early access bull****) and the amount of bugs is very small anyways.\n\nGraphically, the game looks cartoony and childish, despite being the zombie theme there are no elements of horror or gore in it, that is not to say that the game can't give you a bit of a startle when scavanging in the forest. Those familiar with Harvest Moon will feel confortable with graphics in here.\n\nThe music while it's good and relaxing there are only a couple tracks which will wear off quickly. And, this is personal opinion, but the music gives me the vibe of christian music, idk, it sounds to me like something i would expect to hear on a church.\n\nAll in all, for 5 bucks you won't get it better than this...

I definitely feel like i can cut that time in half now that I know what to do and how to do it all in the game. Very little in the game is explained unfortunately, but it doesn't ruin too much of the experience as you can always google some of the answers. More than half of the achievements don't get unlocked for some reason, but who cares about that. There are some very minor detailing issues which could have been fixed but instead were overlooked, again, nothing worth complaining about though. Character customization feels a little bit weak and everything available in the customization minus hats and glasses, you see in the game on NPCs, but at least you have some customizing options which is nice. The game is much better played using the keyboard to move the map around cuz side scrolling gets irritating as the GUI prevents the scrolling. The some of the recipes training is annoyingly difficult to get 3 stars (fastest cook time) but at least once you get the stars, it's permanent unless you get even more stars, and 1 star is simple and easy to get... just take your time and get it done. The helpers do a pretty good job with the restaurant and farm, but there are still things they cannot do, like cut grass, milk the cows, make the deal with the customers, and they sometimes glitch in an annoying way where they pick up and drop something about a dozen times while they wait for more work, they also put the basket down in weird places making you have to search for them every time you want to use them. Since I muted the music cuz I tend to play for many hours at a time and music usually becomes repetitive and annoying (no idea if this one's any good though), the game ends up really lacking in sound effects... like when I throw the potion at zombies, no sound, you never hear birds and wild life in the background, etc... still not game breaking though. In this game, there is always too much to do and never enough time to do it which really keeps your mind sucked into the game trying to rush into everything and you can easily spend several hours into the game without even realizing it. The ending of the game was a little disappointing and too simplified as you basically cure the old man and he thanks you in a bubble text and the end credits appear. Also, the game froze after the end credits during loading (at 86%), probably bringing me back to game menu? Other than that, the game is very stable, plays fine on my gaming rig without having to hack the game apart in order to force it to work like some EA and Rockstar games out there...\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who is into farming and time consuming games. Zombies are optional as you can disable them. Endless mode is also available if you prefer to play without an ending. I didn't play the game for the story and neither will you, but the gameplay by itself is definitely worth the money. I would suggest waiting for a sale though as I doubt those minor issues mentioned will ever be fixed and the way I see it, "why hand a developer 100% of the money when he only delivered 90% of the game?"","June 18, 2014","true","11.6"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","20","32","0","1"

The zombies sometimes walk right through the fence even though there's no opening. People sometimes get stuck at the tables even after they've been served and never leave. Taking up a spot. And the part where you learn the recipes.  The food zips over a pot and you have to chop it and have it land in the pot.  It rarely does and it flies by really fast.  I love fruit ninja and I can hardly complete most of the recipes to get the food into the pot.\n\nAlso you can assign workers to work in the kitchen.  They get stuck running in place.  At one point all three of them wandered off to the corner of the map and were stuck running in place against the river.

Not great due to some bugs that make it fail to load so make sure you save before you talk to a quest NPC or before you go into the woods or your home.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/266390/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","Farm for Your Life is a fantastic game if you are looking for a little bit of everything - the hybrid genres and gameplay make for a unique and charming take on classic elements that are already very popular on their own. This was a perfect game that I got in a bundle, especially considering that I had already recently played many fun tower-defense games (like Tower Wars) and great restaurant managemen games like Cook, Serve Delicious; and Dead Hungry Diner. This game mixes mechanics from those games very well.\n\nIf you like farming (agriculture, AND also RPG/dungeon-style grinding), restaurant management, the zombie theme, tower defense, and bartering systems, then you will really love this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are good, the cute character models and graphics remind me a lot of the Mii avatars you can make on the Wii (or your avatars in Xbox Live), with large heads and small bodies. The character customization is limited, but still has a decent variety. The music and sounds are good and match the semi-casual (the game can get brutally difficult if you let it) and (at times) relaxing gameplay.\n\nThe controls are easy to learn and the tutorial quickly covers the basics of the game, however, balancing everything there is to do in the game can get overwhelming at times. The learning curve is moderate to difficult, depending on your experience with the different genres present in the game - and especially your ability to juggle different priorities. There is a "peaceful" farming-only mode (no enemy zombies), and if you are not interested in that extra hazard, I suggest you give that a try. Personally, I really believe there is already a lot to do in the game, but I picked the story mode and welcome the added challenge. The story is decent, but many things are left unsaid and you may end up having to consult a guide if you do not understand what to do.\n\nIn regards to the actual gameplay, there is a lot of things to do, and each aspect of the game really appeals to me for different reasons.\n\nAs a farmer, you can dig areas to plant with your shovel, harvest wood/rocks with your axe/hammer, and use your sickle to collect grass (that you plant), among other things. Be advised, you cannot use these tools to attack zombies. Your plants have two requirements for life: water and health. You are given a blue watering can that can nourish up to 4 plants before you need to refill it - 2 red watering cans are available at the store and can be used to water significantly more plants. For maintaining health, you can use fertilizer on applicable plants - I am fairly certain that doing this will restore a plant's health to full regardless of how low you let it get.\n\nWhen you harvest plants, you can only hold one item at a time, however, building a crate will allow you to carry up to 4 items.\n\nYou also have a kitchen service, and customers will come starting from late morning/early afternoon until the evening (there is a clock that will show you the time splits). These customers will ask for different food/drinks from you, and you can accept/decline, as well as negotiate the terms of the trade. This is one of my most favorite parts, because I have recently gotten into Steam trading and really enjoy it. You can haggle pretty well, and you will also notice that your ability to lowball will increase as you progress through the game (because different plants have different values). You can even trade for plates and cups and use them at the store (extremely high value). Upgrades to your kitchen (and farm) are available here. Examples include more tables, tents (to attract and house helpers), and sprinklers (very useful).\n\nThere is a store that provides different recipes and plant seeds - these will expand as you progress through the game. It is almost impossible (if not completely) to haggle with the shopkeeper. There is a good feedback system that will tell you "x more required" for each item you hover over when trying to achieve a balanced trade.\n\nHelps will become available as you progress, and you can assign them to either help with farming or in your kitchen. You must also feed them every early morning before they will work.\n\nTo learn recipes, you must do a short mini-game that is a lot like Fruit Ninja - you use the mouse to "slice" the correct ingredients into a pot. You can achieve 1 to 3 stars, and having the max amount will allow you to cook much the item much faster.\n\nYou can wander into the forest at any time for rocks and wood, however, zombies are roaming all over the place. If you are touched by one, you will lose all of your collected materials by half. I've noticed that there is a short window after being hit by a zombie where you will be ignored by all zombies. This part can be very annoying, especially if you get trapped by a horde.\n\nAt night, zombies will sometimes try to attack your farm. During this part, you can try to herd them by arranging your fences like a maze. There are also turrets you can purchase from the kitchen, each doing significantly more damage than the last. At first, you will most likely be defending your farm by throwing any food items at the zombies.\n\nAdmittedly, the AI is not the best, as your helpers will most times prioritize picking up ripe plants versus watering ones that are about to die. I've also noticed that your character will sometimes pick up a plant instead of watering it (happens infrequently).\n\nThe game is appropriately challenging and really tests your planning and priotizing skills - do I attend to my farm or my customers first? Expanding takes a lot of work and effot, as it is very easy to become overwhelmed. I once spent an entire day just working on my farm and ignored all customers. You also unlock chickens and cows later on, adding even more variety to the gameplay.\n\nOverall, if you like any of the themes mentioned in the beginning, you should definitely give this game a try. There is even an endless mode that allows you to really unleash your inner farmer. The game may be slow in the beginning, but it quickly picks up in a short amount of time.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","August 14, 2014","true","5.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

But then the issues start cropping up.\n\nFirst off it's very buggy. The NPC's pathing is terrible and they can get stuck indefinitely making them literally useless. Often they just stand there and pick up and put down items continuously. Gathering resources from the forest is just frustrating and not fun at all; there's just too many zombies and they seem to always know where you are but you can only see them when they're close. They move slowly, but a lot of times you'll lose everything you collected in unfair ways. The controls are a bit clunkly as well.\n\nThe game doesn't explain things very well. It feels random when the NPCs come by and it takes too long for them to show up as if they were just trying to pad the game knowing the actual content is very minimal. Yet despite this, it uses up more resources on your computer than you would think for a game like this.\n\nIt's not exactly a bad game, though. If the problems above did not exist, it would be significantly more enjoyable.","May 30","false","6.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I would classify this game as non violent because when the zombies "attack" you, you just get into a slapfight and are left dizzy at the end (and depending on whether you are in the forest or not as to whether your gathered resources halve). On the farm zombies, go for your crops, not the people and are capable of destrying a farm pretty quickly if you don't fend them off. On the whole they're more annoying than they are threatening, I turned them off after a few nights because I was getting bored of throwing my vegetables at them or building resource chewing defences to throw at them. The meat of the game is in the restaraunt part of the game, you barter meals and goods for parts and seeds and feed the people, once a deal is made, they won't leave until they are fed, so you won't have to worry about them getting mad or anything.\n\nTLDR: Addictive, very shallow, pick it up cheap in a sale.","December 23, 2014","true","30.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, the game manages to combine two things i like to do the most in survival games (Minecraft, 7D2D, ...), namely: Harvest resources and take care of other survivors by providing food and shelter. The trade aspect in this game was rather surprising and the cooking minigame is fun the few times it appears. If you want a perfect playthrough you can expect about 10 hours total; A fast playthrough can easily be done in under 5 hours. Overall i was surprised that when i started this game for the first time and after a while checked the clock, several hours had passed - so i can only recommend this if you get it for under 5$ and want to hit zombies with corn cobs while feeding people in your restaurant and getting the next upgrade for your farm from that greedy merchant whilst running around to make sure your plants don't dry up. Also, your farm hands expect bed & (warm) breakfast.

After that it's just a boring mess though.\n\nTL;DR:\n+ Character customisation is very basic and quite limited but there's a couple of interesting options to make.\n+ The art style for the game is interesting and it's quite well done. It doesn't interest me personally, though.\n+ Nice concept for a game.\n+ Fruit ninja style minigame is fairly fun because of the physics but it's also quite pointless.\n\n- Has quite a lot of game breaking glitches.\n- Expensive at full price (or anything less than a heavy discount) for the amount of content that's here.\n- Very repetitive and slow gameplay which has you standing around a lot doing nothing for a lot of the time.\n- The trading system in the game is unbalanced. Items such as seeds that you need at the start are so expensive that it takes around half an hour just to buy one seed.\n- The english in the game is atrocious. It's obviously not the developers' first language so it's acceptable, but hardly one sentence in the game is spelt or worded correctly.\n-  The single music track in the game isn't anything special and is quite repetitive.\n\n\n\nThe first time I played the game, the first 20 minutes went alright, i'd finished the tutorial and I got onto the main game. Then I exited the game and came back to it, and my save file had somehow become corrupted and the game had saved me at the last section of the tutorial but some of the main characters were invisible so I couldn't actually progress.\n\nAfter I started the game a second time, I got onto the actual main part of the game and honestly, it's just boring.\n\nThere's 3 "sections" to the game; Collect ingredients (apparently mostly by farming), restraunt simulator where you serve customers, and then a fruit ninja minigame.\nThe fruit ninja game from what I could tell was alright but completely pointless and too difficult because the recipes required you to chop so many ingredients in 10 seconds which didn't even appear on time for you to chop them up, nevermind to add them into the bowl as well. You get a star rating but if you had anything more than 10 seconds (which was impossible to get anyway), you only got 1 star for the dish, and it seemed to have no impact on the dish.\n\nUnless i'm missing something, the game is ridiculously slow. There's not really any sense of direction in the game after you start serving customers in the restraunt, You "trade" with customers and they give you an order of what they want to eat, and then sit at the tables eternally. I had a customer sitting at the restraunt taking up space for 3 days because I had to wait for the ingredients to grow for what she wanted to eat.\n\nThe controls are awkward. I don't think there's a way to actually drop items from your basket without actually using them up or adding them into your chest.  Double clicking seemed to be involved a lot and it didn't seem to always work.\n\n"combat" is horrible. I'm not sure why it was included because it doesn't actually fit in with the game and the zombies don't even really pose as a threat. It's just annoying to have to find something to throw at the zombies when they appear, and for the first hour of the game it seemed to be only one zombie a night that would appear.\n\nThere's a trading system in place which allows you to barter for items. But the items that you have to actually buy are so costly that I found myself giving away pretty much all of what I had just to be able to aquire a single seed.\n\nAlso, the customers at the restraunt will ask you to cook them things that you haven't even unlocked yet, and if you accept you'll have to have them wait until you've actually unlocked it, and then wait even longer so that you actually have the ingredients to cook it.\n\nThere looked to be some sort of exploration aspect to the game but I haven't gotten that far because the game hasn't actually asked me to explore for any reason yet.","November 23, 2014","false","1.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","1"

It is similar to other farming games such as Harvest Moon and Farmville although fairly more simple farming mechanics. Also this game has a twist to its play style that includes towers to defend your farm from hordes of zombies. This game can be played in a more relaxed form focused on the farming aspect or you can play it the normal way and fight for your farm which provides more playtime and more challenge. The game is featured in a top down veiw with fairly decent graphics, well rounded and well done. The game sounds are fairly basic, music is decent but plays in loop. Gameplay is slow to start, very hard to get your farm going but once things get going it can be hard to keep up with, but makes for a fun exciting challenge. I actually enjoyed this game more then i thought i would. I wouldn't suggest this for players who can't stand repetitive gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ch0colatemilk/recommended/266390/","ch0colatemilk","niX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ch0colatemilk/","502 products in account","Farm for your Life is a simple point and click farming/restaurant simulator. It's a mix of Cook, Serve, Delicious! and Harvest Moon. It's polished, but also very simplistic so that anybody can play. It's oddly addicting, although it's also very repetitive. If you're a fan of simple mind numbing repetition than this is a game for you. If you're a fan of simulation, this might also be for you.\n\nFEATURES Story Mode is very short, but there is also an Endless Mode that will allow to you play until the end of eternity.\n\nCharacters are customizable whenever you want, however you want at any time. You can go in between genders and there are countless possibilities.\n\nThe main objectives are to grow crops, raise animals, build a successful restaurant, cook and serve food, gather materials and help a mad scientist cure the 'zombie' problem. Oh, did I mention that there are zombies? You also have to build an array of weapons and defense mechanisms (like fences) to keep the zombies off of your land!\nPOSITIVESEasy to play for anybody regardless of how experienced a gamer they are. Easy to follow tutorial that explains anything you'll need to know, and you only have to use the mouse! Very easy to get into and very easy to come back to at any time. Relatively speaking, the game itself also has a very easy difficulty level. The achievements are also pretty easy to obtain.\n\nHours of mind numbing fun. Seriously. Although repetitive, there is enough to do that you don't feel as if you're always doing the same thing, even though there's only a few things that actually need doing.\n\nNo DLC or add ons of any kind. What you pay for is what you get. The game also has no bugs that I've come across and runs very smoothly.\nNEGATIVES The game has a 'peaceful' mode, but it doesn't actually exist. Zombies will raid your game at night even if you've selected the 'peaceful' game mode. There doesn't seem to be a fix for this in story or endless mode yet.\n\nMany of the achievements are bugged, despite a recent patch from the developers. At this point, it seems as if it's going to be forever bugged... so that's really a bummer.\n\nThe developers seem to be largely finished with the game, so any bugs, compatibility issues, etc that come up may not be fixed. The recent patch that they did, despite their best efforts, didn't seem to change anything at all. I have yet to find much wrong with the game besides the bugged achievements, but other players may be experiencing issues with little to no technical support.\n\nRepetition. I put this in the positives as well, but it's a double edged sword. Eventually you're going to get bored, or you'll have done absolutely everything that your farm will be so damn self sufficient that you'll hardly need to play. Also, for those who don't like repetition, this will obviously be a huge minus because that's most of the game's mechanics. I definitely recommend giving this a try. I would give it a solid 8/10. I've played it over and over again for hours and have enjoyed coming back to it every time.","September 3, 2014","true","17.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Back to nature and magical melody were amazing games when it comes to this genre, and I've not seen the like since.  Although this game doesn't do as much, it does scratch that itch, as well as throwing in new interesting combinations to cover what it lacks.\n\nThe game is good,  it is a rather harvest moon, mixed with a bit of diner dash (only good), with a little fruit ninja thrown in for taste.  I like it, and depending on how long the game is, it just might make one of my favorites list.  Out of my 1000 some games, only about 20 have made that distinction.  I've only played the first 2 hours, but as it stands now,  I'm having fun.\n\n---After finishing the game---\nIt is a little lacking.  Sadly there weren't enough upgrades for me to enjoy, and your building never gets restored to any kind of glory.  Also the direction is poor.  I would never think to dig up in certain areas, all over the place for golden gear.  I would think someone would tell me about this, but no I had to look it up.   I wanted more,  but it seems to lack a lot of content.  a blend of diner dash and harvest moon, I guess it means less of each.   So it was ok for a few hours.

When the game properly begins you will have to plant crops and chop wood and mine stone so you can build and make various things from recipes to catapults to heed off zombies.\n\nIn conclusion the game is very basic but even if it is also a little buggy is a very enjoyable experience and I throughly enjoyed my 2 hours of playing so far so I give it an 8/10 for being fun, interesting and sort of unique.\n\nYouTube Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efP99nJ5aiE","November 2, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing truly worth remarking upon.\n\nIt's a decent little game, if a bit short. I think I did a pretty good job of covering all the side-quests and everything you can possibly do in 10 hours. Bits of it are incredibly unclear, like what causes someone to move into a tent, but for the most part it is very straight forward and easy to understand.\n\nAs described, it's an odd mix of diner dash, farming, and tower defense, but I couldn't help but find myself wishing for more of the character of Don't Starve or deeper mechanics from any of the builder games.\n\nAt 10 hour max, I think it makes sense at $4, but I generally don't spend $1/hr on most games. A little bit of fleshing out the content, the characters, or the story would go a long way to changing my review, but I doubt that it will ever truly be remarkable.","January 4","false","9.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Don't waste your money.\n\nLong version: This review is based entirely on some of the key features which are listed, so get ready for a rant.\n\n"Combining elements from farming, tower defense and time management genres" - now I agree with 2 out of 3 of these points. Because this game is literally Farmville, Plants vs Zombies and Fruit Ninja smashed into one - and considering the price for this really unoriginal idea, it's much much cheaper to find and play all of these separately. So really, this game isn't claiming anything new - especially when it wears the zombie apocalypse t-shirt.\n\nNow this really could be forgiven if it redeemed itself through the story or the characters or the graphics. On all three of these points it fails miserably; the story and characters are non-existent, each person that gets hired or visits the restraunt you own is literally a robot that has decent AI but has nothing compelling about their characters despite looking different from the rest. The models are unique enough to give some sort of personality, but when absolutely none is given, it completely destroys what little story there is. It is literally a point A to point B step by step proceedure and despite clocking in a fair amount of hours I don't feel like I'm progressing or enjoying any moments that I wanted to or expected to.\n\n"Protect your farm by building mazes and towers. Our zombies are vicious vegetarians!" ... So? This is a very particular problem that desperately needs addressing because there are no stakes. All that happens when zombies 'invade' your farm at night is that they eat your produce. Obviously you don't really want this as the food is literally the only way you can progress, but you need to attack them with your produce anyway, and additionally - these are zombies! Zombies eat brains not food like us, that's the one fundemental thing that zombies do - eat people! Vegetarian zombies aren't zombies, they're just rude vegans! And it would be slightly more interesting and tense if they went to your AI partners; it would be slightly more interesting and tense if they went for your customers waiting for food that you didn't have the produce for - but they just ignore them! They just go straight for the produce! So what? I can just grow more, why do I need to waste food to protect the food that I'm wasting! That makes no sense!\n\n"Original soundtrack" Yep. You can count that as a key feature of this unoriginal, boring mess of a game. It has it's own original sountrack. Oh yes, and when they say that - they mean one song that plays during the day over and over again until your ears start bleeding. One song isn't a "soundtrack" guys! And the effects are about as generic as you can get as well.\n\nSo no, I can't reccomend this. I wouldn't reccomend this game to a brick wall. I'd prefer actual zombies to gnaw on their balloon heads until they explode, which would be a million times more interesting. Hell - I'd prefer staring at the brick wall that I'd reccomend this for, at least it'd give me time to rethink how on Earth I managed to think that this would be a good game to buy with my hard earned money. Why people are giving it good ratings and are calling it one of the best games ever completely baffles me - it's unoriginal and isn't a game that belongs in 2014. I'd expect this POS to be around ten years ago, but nowadays?! No way!","July 1, 2014","false","8.9"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

But it looks fine for a four dollar game (I got it on special).\n\nYou build and upgrade your farm and restaurant using resources gained from your farm, found through foraging, trading and in exchange for serving customers at your restaurant. You can explore the forest outside the central area but I didn’t venture out there much in the time that I played.\n\nJuggling farm and restaurant management can be challenging. But after an hour or two in I’ve only been approached by two Zombies. The main problem is I encountered a bug. That made it so that I only had one usable plate in my restaurant. I couldn’t prepare the next customer’s order until the last customer had finished their meal and the plate was washed. So I couldn’t keep up with demand and customers were leaving.\n\nI like it. I’d have to be pretty stubborn to keep playing if the plate bug is persisted. I’d say it’s worth the price if they at least fox that bug.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","June 22, 2014","true","6.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I was enticed by the idea of micromanaging plant growth with tower defense and a silly art style. As it is, I could only squeeze out about 30 min, and I had had enough.\n\nBugs, bugs, bugs GALORE! I failed the turtorial missions about 5-6 times due to the game breaking under bugs. The main character freezing, the controls freezing, UI bugs (pop ups that never went away, also freezing or pop ups that never show up; leaving you to guess what you do next), people that get stuck, people that run through walls and typos....omg the typos. I think the writers/editors should go back to 3rd grade where we learn this thing called "proof-reading". Jackfilms's "YGS" series on youtube would evicerate this game. No kidding: there was typo in almost EVERY SINGLE TEXT BOX. I don't care if:\n\n-English wasn't your first language\n-Budget\n-Time constraints\n\nIf 50% of the dialogue in this game isn't grammatcially correct, that's not acceptable in a full release! Fix the bugs! Fix the typos! FIX ANYTHING!!\n\nThe idea is you use various tools and abilities to grow plants and use them as weapons. I didn't get far enough to see how it actually works because the developer(s) p***ed off the ice goddess Shiva who froze everything and cursed the land to be invested with bugs while screwing up the language to create the grand Promised Land for Grammar Nazis.\n\nThere is no denying it. There is no excuse, explanation, theory or otherwise: the game is a massive cash grab. Unplayable, untolerable. One word review: broken. 0/10\n\nI should have taken the $9.99 and threw it to my dogs.

And it's a combination that works. Both DD and HM are all about time management, so they go incredibly well together. At its best, Farm for your Life demands that you wisely alternate between farm work and serving people at the restaurant to try to maximize efficiency. It can be a thrilling game that really makes you feel that every second counts.\n\nMy biggest criticism of the game are the elements that undermine the time management aspect. Time doesn't pass in the forest, so you can essentially get infinite wood if you're patient enough. For a while I was having an exciting time trying to finish my work early so I could grab some wood but when I realized that I can get wood any time it made the tension disappear. Also, the game allows you to recruit workers who unfortunately make the game almost completely automated. After hiring workers (followed shortly by finishing the story) I immediately lost interest and will probably never pick this up again.\n\nSo, my experience with this game was a rollercoaster. There was a sweet spot for a few hours where I absolutely loved this game, but ironically after I bought all the upgrades I hated it. Ultimately, it was a good experience, and more than likely is an excellent choice for most casual gamers.","January 23, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bon appetit, Farm for your life is served.\n\nFarm for your life is a sweet little gem of a game that takes the elements of a few classic games (referenced above) and somehow manages to pull it off.\nYou begin your life on a pretty sweet looking farm in the middle of the cutest little Zombie apocalypse ever, lose it all to a storm and refurbish it all from the ground up.\n\nPlant your crops, harvest and rennovate a restaurant that caters to other survivors that will trade you goods for food, allowing you to upgrade and improve.  Reinforce the farm, build corn cannons, slingshots and pumpkin catapults to fend off the hungry (and cute) undead.  Attract survivors to live on your steading and help out with the tasks you assign to them.\n\nFarm for your life is a regular jack of all trades, yet master of none.  For what it is, it pulls it off brilliantly and delivers hours of enjoyment.  There's something here for the casual and not so casual gamer.\n\nThe game isn't without it's faults here and there, but nothing that can't be easily overlooked (especially for the price of the game + bagging it during the Halloween sale).  The farm itself isn't huge, the buildings and upgrades are pre-determined in their positioning, removing most of the customizable options for those that would be seeking it.  Some of the dialogue in English has been misspelled due to translation (which is a tiny complaint, owing to the fact that it's like 98% fine.)   The most amusing translation error is that "Grass" is labeled as "Gras."\nWhen altering your character's appearance at the house, it has a tendency to randomly alter beard/hair colour (which is easily fixed by going back into the house and selecting the colour you intended.)\nFull plates of food/beverages can get stuck on the tables in the restaurant and become non-interactive at times, which I've only noticed happening when I've set my character to perform a task that a worker suddenly attempts to perform at the same time.   This is easily fixed by saving, exiting to the main menu and returning to the game.\n\nNothing game breaking that I've run into, yet.  The flaws really do feel so minor to me that I don't even notice unless I'm forced to recall them (like writing a review).\n\nIt's hard not to love a game that pays homage to existing classics and owns up to in the achievements.  One of the real winning points for me was that I noticed you have the option to play the game without zombies in it.  My girl's very phobic of zombies, yet loves games like this.  It was great to know she could play without having to worry about that, which turned out it wouldn't be a problem anyways.\nThe zombies in this game are adorable, they don't even eat people.  They're vegetarian zombies that bust down your fences to eat your crops.  There's not a gun in sight, you defeat them by lobbing corn husks at their heads, or letting your automated defenses finish them off for you.\n\nA concept that might seem a little blasphemous to viscera chomping, plague spreading, Romero-esque zombies that I've been a fan of all my days.  But, jeez... just look at em!\n\nFarm for your life is triumphant!   Stop reading and buy it already!","November 4, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really love this game.\n\nIt has a very intuitive farm - make food - fight zombies setup which is mind blowingly addictive, at least for me (a self-professed lover of casual games and farm games). I bought it and promptly spent eight hours playing it, no breaks, until I beat it.\n\nI then played it again. I'm now playing it a third time, but trying to not use the vendor (except for recipes and fertilizer).\n\nI do wish it were a little longer. Maybe it could have an expansion? But I would absolutely plunk down $15 for the game again, even with its shortness.\n\nAnd a big thank you to the developers for how completely glitch free it's been. A lot of indie games & casual games have frustrating bugs that might or might not get fixed later, but on this one I didn't run into a single issue.","November 17, 2014","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first, I didn't think it would be all that fun. Then 4 hours past. Then 2 more.\n\nIt combines Fruit Ninja, Cooking mama, Don't starve and farm sim all together.  It blends nicely with all of them\n\nHowever, there is some things that need to be changed.....\n\n\n1) Wood. People that come to eat your food should have wood as one of the things in their inventory. If you are able to feed them, you shouldn't have to risk your life in the woods to get 3 wood and run before zombies eat your face.\n\n2) EVERYTHING should be worth something. You start out with a watering can. You can't sell it, even after you upgrade it to the red one (Holds twice as much water). So you are stuck with it or give it away.\n\n3) Coins should be common. Common currency. I can see scrap metal being some sort of currency, but why have the player start out with some for story, then it never to be seen again?\n\n4) You should be able to attack zombies in the woods. You have an axe, sythe, shovel and hammer! But yet you get into slap fights that end up with half the things you gathered on the floor.\n\n5) There should be one or two more available spots for helpers. 3 is great, but eventually you need a lot more help on the farm and resturant...\n\n6) Helpers should be able to go into the woods and get wood. Would help out with #1\n\n7) It would be nice to be able to destroy a fully grown plant to get the seeds back but no yeild. That way you can rebuild after learning new things, but instead you lose it all...\n\nAll together, its a fun little game. Best to get it on sale.\n\n7/10.","January 1, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, you can not do anything about the zombies in the forest,  They are very annoying, and will forever keep me from completing this game.  I read somewhere that the designer of the game likes them the way they are, so that's probably not going to change.  Also, Endless Mode isn't, eventually, the store owner will run out of seeds and fertilizer, and the game will slowly run down.  Peaceful mode also isn't, zombies will continue to wander in out of the forest anyway.  Other than those small bugs, the game is a fun little farming sim, and the helpers and restaurant are a good way to spend a gaming afternoon.","July 26, 2014","true","47.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Zombies, an unexplained event...yeah.  Right down to it, it is a farm, cooking, running simulator.  Farm, harvest, cook, look for resources, and set up a few defenses to stop the zombies.  Not much more to do.\n\nPros:\nEasy to play.  No learning curve.\nGraphics are bright, very geared for younger gamers.\nIts cheap, but i would still buy it on a sale.\n\nCons:\nIts geared for younger gamers.\nThe control response is shockingly annoying\nStory mode is about six hours, it does allow you to play on afterwards, but...\nAfter story mode your only real objective is to find the golden tools.\nThe zombies don't hurt you, but they take your resources.\n\nOverall, it feels like Sesame Street helped develop it.  Only kept my attention for a few minutes at a time.  Dont get me wrong, it really had a lot of potential, they just gave up.  Only reason i played for so long was because Playfire payed me.\n\nWho wants it?\nPeople that like farming sims, kids, or the really casual gamer looking for a few minutes to kill.\nI recommend it simply because of the effort put in to it, and the ease for which a child can play it\n","July 2, 2014","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes. Yes, they are. Farm for your life is a funny harvest moon like farm simulator combined with a zombie apocalypse game. Add in a cute story and cute characters and you got yourself a pretty decent game.\n\nThis game reminds me a lot of Harvest Moon and if you are a Harvest Moon addict, like myself, then this game is an excellent way to get your Harvest Moon fix if a new game isn't out yet. It has farming, zombie hunting, mining..what more could you ask for? Well...I have some ideas in mind.\n\nWhile going through the storymode they do cover a lot of ground but after a certain point they stop telling you what to do. Which is fine when ended correctly but it just suddenly stops and you are left clueless as to what you are supposed to do. This is right at the beginning. They don't tell you how to properly fight zombies, they don't tell you what goals you are supposed to achieve...You just have a farm and pure confusion. Once you figure out to do then you are smooth sailing but it is something that should have been incorporated into the game. Instead you have to go out of your way and figure it out yourself.\n\nSo to sum it all up...\n\nPros: Cute characters and graphics. Pretty decent character cusomization. Cute story. Almost a Harvest Moon look a like without a dating aspect. Zombies. Pretty straight forward.\n\nCons: Costs $10. No demo. After a certain point you are left to your own devices when there should be more information given to you.\n\nOverall it is a pretty good game and I would definitely recommend it to someone who needs to get their Harvest Moon fix. But I kind of wished there was a demo I could have tried out and I think that 10$ is a little steep for this game. But if you like Harvest Moon mixed with zombies then this game will be right up your alley.","March 8, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it's a combination that works. Both DD and HM are all about time management, so they go incredibly well together. At its best, Farm for your Life demands that you wisely alternate between farm work and serving people at the restaurant to try to maximize efficiency. It can be a thrilling game that really makes you feel that every second counts.\n\nMy biggest criticism of the game are the elements that undermine the time management aspect. Time doesn't pass in the forest, so you can essentially get infinite wood if you're patient enough. For a while I was having an exciting time trying to finish my work early so I could grab some wood but when I realized that I can get wood any time it made the tension disappear. Also, the game allows you to recruit workers who unfortunately make the game almost completely automated. After hiring workers (followed shortly by finishing the story) I immediately lost interest and will probably never pick this up again.\n\nSo, my experience with this game was a rollercoaster. There was a sweet spot for a few hours where I absolutely loved this game, but ironically after I bought all the upgrades I hated it. Ultimately, it was a good experience, and more than likely is an excellent choice for most casual gamers.","January 23, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good how it is a plant and grow stuff and run your own little restaurant.","November 29, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game freezes during a particular cut scene in the tutorial and the game crashes. From reading comments, I\'m not the only person who has had this issue, and I cannot find anywhere that a fix is coming anytime soon. Can\'t recommend it until it actually can run on the systems it claims it can run on...","May 31","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fun in its core concept but it is SOOO buggy.  I can\'t quit out without having to ctrl-alt-delt.  There is constant issues with zombies running past your fences and completly ignoring defenses.  a lot of the achievements are very unclear or completly bugged out.  The game was fun and the only way id recommend it is get it on sale like i did otherwise it\'s not even worth its $10 price tag.\n\nIt was fun for a few hours and could have been a really awesome game if the developers had actually fixed its bugginess. 7/10 gameplay\n4/10 overall because of all the bugs","June 1","false","9.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

After that, one can always continue in "freeplay" mode.\n\nReplay value seems limited, as is the content. No procedurally generated world, which makes replays seem all alike.\n\nA few bugs here an there, nothing major though:\nCustomers sitting on each others' laps, dishes occasionally getting stuck and being hard to remove. Not a big deal, most of these are self-clearing when the restaurant runs out of customers during nights. Saving and re-loading the game cleared all these issues too.\nMob pathfinding sometimes ignoring fences. Re-building fences "in one go" solved that for me though. Might also be related to mobs being "locked out" and thus destroying fences because they find no other way.\nIssues I've seen in other people's reviews that I have not encountered:\nPerformance issues: None for me, and I'm on an outdated Windows7 platform. Not exactly a super gaming PC, and the game runs just fine - even in later "freeplay" stages.\nCrash issues: None for me. Have played the game for about 20 hours now, and not a single crash.\nBottom line:\nFun game.\nBought it on sale for 4€, and would do that again.","June 6","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
