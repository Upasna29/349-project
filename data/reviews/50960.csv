It also suffers from lack of mini-game variation and a non-endless mode after finishing the story.\nThe price is also way off (10 bucks) and these games never go on sale.\nOnly buy it if you really need your Hidden Object fix, and there is nothing left you haven't already played.","January 2, 2014","true","3.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"
