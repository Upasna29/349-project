Making puzzles feel fresh is difficult in this genre so bravo, developers.\nThe hidden object puzzles are relatively sparse and therefore easy, but the game isn't exactly overflowing with them so it breaks the game up nicely.\nI had absolutely no interest in the storyline whatsoever until the ending scene, which was a shame as it was a really intruiging ending!\nThe character models gave me a bit of a chuckle with their wandering eyes, but I thought they looked good. The game looks quite nice as well, no complaints about the graphics.\nAn effort was made with the voice acting, I've heard better and I've heard worse but it's nice when the effort has been put in to at least include voice acting.\nNot so fun bitsThe UI in this game had me so salty, because if you click too close to the bottom of the screen on your inventory, it'll take you back a scene. I don't know why this annoys me so much in HOGs but it just felt like a simple oversight.\nI found most of the plot and game progression to be almost nonsensical - I'd be staring at the screen trying to use items and the one that made the least sense is the one I'd need. This made the game feel a bit comedic? I don't know if it was intentional.\nMy big bug bear with this game was the poor English. I have no problem with translated games that are made in another language, I'm just glad to get to play another hidden object game, but some of the phrasing in the text and tooltips either makes no sense or has been translated badly. I doubt this will bother most people but I just think that attention to small detail like that makes a big difference.\nTL:DR - it's an alright HOG. I prefer the Frankenstein game from Jetdog as it feels like a fully fledged HOG, but this feels like a tablet port at times. Again, the price is fair for the game time (which is quite short unless you get stuck on one of the harder puzzles). It has achievements but they didn't pop up for me until I exited the game, so don't panic if you don't see them straight away! If you have a bit of money in your Steam wallet and want a relaxed game to play for a couple hours, this is the one.\nThanks for reading!","October 23, 2015","true","2.4"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

But Dracula's Legacy fair a bit better than Sinister City in gameplay wise.\n\nGame Visual/Audio\nThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're okay. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\nThere are two different game difficulty modes to choose from: Easy and Advanced.\n\nThere are sixteen different achievements to be earned from the game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements that needs to be completed before they can be obtained. The achievements are rewarded after exiting the game.\n\nThe inventory panel doesn't have an option to have it lock in place. But it does slides up and down.\n\nAll of the hidden object scenes consists of traditional word lists. Some of them do require little or no interaction.\n\nMost of the puzzles in the game are rather simple and easy to solve without much difficulty for some.\n\nMiscellaneous\nThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts, there's a bit of plot holes in the storyline, which breeds a bit of confusion in the player's mind. As it was mentioned before Dracula's Legacy fair a bit better than Sinister City in gameplay wise. But there isn't much of replayability nor its' story rememberable. I would recommend this game but not at full price.","November 7, 2015","true","3.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Dracula’s Legacy fits nicely into this categorisation.\n\nThe first thing anyone will notice about this game is the art. I could throw around a few adjectives, but it really is stunning. Both the 2D and 3D art is gorgeous and there are tons of cinematics throughout the game.\n\nThe second thing that will be obvious is that the voice acting is beyond salvation. Although it fits well with the almost non-existent, paper-thin story that more or less boils down to finding a suitable weapon to kill the current monster blocking the path (in a rather violent way for a HOG, I might add). Still, I have to give it to the game: at least it is super easy and doesn’t wear out its welcome with its barely two-hour length, which fits nice along the super cheap price.","April 3","true","3.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

But even so I get the feeling like this particular game was designed for someone recovering from a tragic brain injury.

The amount of details they put in the environment are truly a sign of respect to the gamers and I've since fell in love with JetDog Studio. They did a great job in their arts that representing the sense of location and giving us great environments that are memorable.\n+ Sweet Soundtracks.

Some are old concept with new presentation while some seems new as I've not seen it anywhere else. From the difficulty of Easy to Hard, I've only shamefully skipped one puzzle that I couldn't solve, but the one difficult puzzle that almost frustrate me is I think the best puzzle in the game.\n\n* Story is simple.

Being contacted by a spirit, you're going to find the story behind the town you're visiting and about vampires.\n\nI admit that I was expecting at one moment in the plot to see the protagonist being revealed as the daughter of some powerful creature but unfortunately for me, the developers kept some secrets, hoping for a sequel. Yet, the main plot is solid. The game is called Dracula's Legacy anyway, that's probably why I thought that I will know who the heroin was really.\n\nIf you're used to these developers, you'll remember Frankenstein: Master of Death, Alchemy Mysteries: Prague Legends or Sinister City in the same genre. So you're used to their style. But weirdly enough, this game has another style in game. I found it more cartoonish, save for the cutscenes. Also, I found easier to navigate in the scenes as when you're done with a chapter, the places you just explored are locked.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is the standard one: hidden objects, puzzles.... and slowness. I found the game very very slow: for your inventory to show, the cursor.... And there is a bug that made exit a lot the game until I looked into the walkthrough to be quick. Indeed, in a puzzle, I had to place shapes to cover and apparently, it doesn't support a lot of clicks, as I couldn't click anything after apart moving the mouse.\n\nThe HO scenes are always beginning with three hidden items and one that can be found easily. Given the fact that some must be solved by a puzzle, it's not easy to finish it under 30 sec for an achievement.\n\nI'm quite mixed about this game but I'm still giving it a thumb up as I've enjoyed it, perhaps not quite like I wanted.","November 30, 2015","true","3.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Like why would I need a watering can to put gas in the tank? Because I didn't, I needed to make a funnel. Or I was looking for a comb as instructed, when the actual object in the scene was a hairbrush. The hidden object scenes ended up being like "click everything, it has to be one of these." The puzzles weren't much better. If I had to describe them with one word, it would be "tedious." And there was way too much running back and forth searching for items I remembered seeing before, but couldn't pick up then, because "of course you can't pick up the shotgun now, you haven't found any shells yet."\n\nUsually I try not to skip stuff, but in this one I ended up skipping quite a few puzzles, because I just wanted the game to end. Could have skipped the ending as well, because it explained nothing. I'm all for stories were everything it not spelled out for you, but this game really had no ending, it just stopped. If I have to find something positive, it could be that I got the achievement for Expert mode, although I'm quite certain I selected Casual when I started the game.\n\nI can't really recommend this, except if you get it really cheap and are willing to go through an inordinate amount of the typical game mechanics silliness present in this type of games.

It's actually better than some of the HOG's (Hidden Object Games) put out by Artifex Mundi and their associates.  The graphics are quite clean and clear.  The story isn't complex or very long but then again there is something to be said for games that keep it simple and focused.  The HO scenes are particularly better than those of Artifex Mundi.  I love Artifex Mundi and have most of their games.  However, while their graphics are usually top notch I've always felt the HO scenes themselves were given sub-par treatment.\n\nI'm becoming impressed with Jetdog Studios.  Besides being developers themselves, they have in rapid succession been producing a stable of decent developers, Zoom Out Games (12 Labours of Hercules series), Fineway Studios (Frankenstein: Master of Death), CorePunch Gamestudio (Among the Heavens) and now IndeePop (Dracula's Legacy).\n\nI'll certainly be on the lookout for more games from them and their associates.

Active zones are light up if pointed at, effectively showing how huge the clickable area is - while this is not a real negative, it takes away the precision from the game, resulting in much less actions / screen, and puzzles are also affected: instead of a hold and turn rotating puzzle, you need to click on the parts, because that's easier to do with touchscreen.\nThere are several problems with the game's english - having typos (they / there, can or can't) to the point of it was calling a half plastic glass a watering can (wasn't even used for that purpose, it was a funnel), a tool handle was called a broomstick, achievements asking for completing a game on expert while in the game the harder difficulty is called advanced mode.\nWhile these doesn't affect the game, it reflects some of the care,attention  and (maybe the lack of?) money the game got.\nSpeaking about money: I'm pretty sure they had budget problems during the creation of the game. The full cinematic parts are done relatively well. Not outstanding, but pretty nice for HOGs.  But at the same time, the quality of ingame animation hit rockbottom after a point. At the start of the game you crack a wall with a pickaxe - the pickaxe is swinging, like you're moving it above your shoulder. Pretty nice.  Later on fumigation of bees is the fumigator floating up to the beenest, and not even a single puff. They just disappear. Using a diving mask to go underwater?  Mask floating to the water, then it's accessible in a way that you can just move underwater. Birds flying like in the infamous Birdemic movie. Items not even being rotated when used - keys floating to locks while pointing to the other direction, and things like this.\n\nSo in short:\n- The usual vampire story, nothing of interest\n- Supereasy interaction, which results in oversimplification\n- Really nice stills (environment, characters) and cutscenes, but terrible item-interaction animations\n- Questionable english at many points\n\nIf you want a good hidden object game to get into the genre, avoid this game.

I wouldn't drink it, even if I'm thirsty."). It's a mixed bag all told, but even then I'd almost recommend it if not for the bugs. OH GOOD GRAVY, THE BUGS! Roughly 2 hours of my counted playing time was actually spent trying to solve a puzzle that, it turns out, is hopelessly bugged. For some players, such as my self, the game is ultimately unplayable and unbeatable after a certain point because of such bugs. And there are MANY of them. It's even acknowledged in the official forums, and the general response from the playerbase has been "Yeah, it sucks. Oh well. You get what you pay for..." The publishers? They're silent on the matter -- but  they can't respond fast enough when forum-users try to talk about a walkthrough (THAT little discussion needs to be silenced, apparently!). I'm told the game is unfortunately short, but I wouldn't know -- the bugs bar the way.\n\nEDIT: After reinstalling a few times, I finally got past (most) of the bugs. The game IS absurdly short; the puzzles are generally terrible, largely unrelated to what's going on in the game; if Dracula has anything to do with it, it's not something that is ever mentioned in the game itself -- they seem to have just assumed "Dracula" is the same as "vampire"; and good gravy will you get sick of hearing that things are locked and require keys. After this, I feel like I could help summon Gozer the Gozerian because I am the KEYMASTER. Oh, and the bad translations only get worse as the game wends towards its fizzle of a conclusion. Definitely not recommended -- get their fairy tale games instead.

It's not the most extravagant or difficult thing I've ever played, but it has its own charm.\n\nSome of the puzzles were terribly repetitive and predictable, but overall it was amusing.\n\nSet things up for a sequel, so I'd be curious about the continuation of the story.\n\nIf you're looking for something casual, and not too taxing, I'd say go for it.

It even has a voice over to some characters.  The animation in the videos are sort of meh - some of the characters has their mouth closed when u hear them talking.\n\nThere are some minigames - u have to do - in order to collect more of those collectables.\n\nYou can play on easy or advanced mode. But the game is quite easy already. (im playing this on advanced mode)\n\nIf you are totally done in a certain area, then there is no way possible to go back. Since there is nothing to achieve. Which makes the game even more easier to find the collectables.\n\nI think it is quite a short game which is disappointing.\n\nIll give this a 6/10","December 1, 2015","true","6.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So, I started playing this myself. After a few minutes something caught my wife's eye. Suddenly she was over my shoulder playing backseat driver. This somehow transitioned to her taking my seat when I went to the bathroom.\n\nEverything is laid out real well, nice colours so hard to miss objects if you are truly looking. Runs smooth.\n\nThe point is, my wife plays, nothing. Well Bejeweled and a few other puzzle games on her DS. So to take the reigns so quickly and follow through - something is done right.\n\nA few hours later she finished it and was very happy. (I went back the next day to get the missing two achievements.) She wanted to play "more". Well sadly this is the only game of the series (that I know of) - So I introduced her to a few others.\n\nIn the last 24 hrs shes played through Sinister City and Samantha Swift.  Shes currently playing Evil Pumpkin but she doesnt quite like that one but shes determined to get through it.\n\nWhat this means for me? Well no PC gaming but Ive been playing through the story of Battlefield Hardline on my XB1, so there's that.","November 13, 2015","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It contained to few simple hidden-object puzzles and the other puzzle types usually didn't have any decent instructions.\n\nPros:\n- Very few objects are repeated, Many hidden object games use the same objects over and over, this one didn't suffer from that.\n- Easy to follow story.\n- Fast recharging hint system if you need it.\n- Stean Acheivments and trading Cards\n- Low Price\n- The Artwork for the game was pleasent enough to enjoy.\n\nCons:\n- Too few Hidden-Object puzzles.\n- No fast travel which I've come to expect from Jet Dogs games of this type.\n- Poor instructions on Non-hidden-object puzzles.\n- Lots of back tracking\n- While the story was easy to follow it was pretty poorly written.\n- No replayablity easy to get all of the acheivments in the first run in around or under 4 hours.\n\nOverall I have to give this game a lower score than most of their games and would rate it at about a 5 out of 10, It isn't terrible but it just isn't very satisfying as a hidden-object game. If you really need something to play for cheap get it otherwise pick up a better one.\n","January 28","false","4.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Even at full price in Steam, this game will only cost you 2.99€. As most of the hidden object games, the plot is rather predictable and most puzzles are not too difficult. This is ok for casual gamers, but experienced folks should go for expert mode from the start. Dracula's legacy has above par production values (backgrounds, video & sound). Only negative remark is that moving backwards between backgrounds was rather cumbersome as moving the pointer at the bottom of the screen resulted in the inventory popping up. All in all, a very decent hidden object game! If you are new to this genre, Dracula's Legacy will give you an excellent introduction to the genre.\n\nScore: 7/10\n\nPro:\n+ nice graphics\n+ excellent quality/price at 2.99€ (can be found even cheaper in bundles)\n\nContra:\n- achievements bug: they only pop up when you leave the game.\n- no game save function\n- rather short: max 4 hours in expert mode","April 30","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The plot was B-movie at best, and I actually found Sinister City more enjoyable than this - at least I got some laughs out of that one!  The ending of Dracula's Legacy makes very little sense to me, but then much of the game was illogical anyway in my opinion.\n\nI didn't experience any real bugs although there were times when an area would continue sparkling after I was done with it, making me think I had to go back and do something else there.  There is no journal or notebook, as you might find in some other games, to remind you what your objectives are.  However, the game does move you on to new areas once you pass a certain point and doesn't allow you to go back, so at least you're not wandering aimlessly around every previous scene looking for items.\n\nI got it very cheap in the Hallowe'en sale, but I still don't recommend it.  It was not the cheesy fun I expected, but more slap-your-forehead illogical and frustrating.  I got through it, but I won't play it again - I feel like the majority of it was a waste of my time and I could have been doing something much more fun, like watching paint dry.\n","November 8, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Long story short; you spend just as much time confused, but you spend it staring blankly at the three screens you've clicked on every pixel of, instead of ten screens worth of stuff you've half-examined.\n\n* They went with a "sleek" interface that keeps trying to minimize while I'm trying to use it.  The mouse controls are also painfully floaty and imprecise -- it's as if the hitboxes for small items are the size of a full quarter of the screen, but are placed so imprecisely that clicking directly on the thing you can see won't do it.  Symptoms of a bad mobile port maybe?\n* The puzzles are more linear :  IE, at any given point, only one or possibly two puzzles are available for you to do, and you must do them to unlock the next set of one to two puzzles.  In other games, there were four or five areas full of puzzles available at any given time, and completing any one of them would add another one to the list.  The more linear design makes it easy to get stuck in this game, and in at least one place, the hint system is wrong about what to do next.  It thinks I have an item I can't get yet, and won't give me hints on getting that item (I need a valve to put fuel into a gas can : it keeps telling me to put fuel into the car).\n* Similarly, most screens / things to click on have exactly one item of use.  When you click on it, the item goes to your inventory and the screen closes and you can't open it again.  It's a little jarring, and reminds me that I am trying to accomplish a linear, pre-set series of events, rather than exploring an actual location or story with any degree of freedom.\n* Puzzles are less...creative, or make less sense, than previous installments.  In the first townlike area, there are no less than six things that require funny-shaped keys. Surely some of these could have been replaced with something less blatantly "collect item to continue"...?\n* The story is about the same quality as previous installments, so I'm a little interested, but the writing is improving -- which is taking it out of that uncanny valley where everything is campy and hilarious, where Sinister City firmly dwells.  The end reunites protagonist and love interest, but answers nothing about her history.  Pretty clearly setting up a sequel.\n* Plague Mysteries had a beautiful map interface, where it would list every room you had access to, //every interactable screen in that room//, //whether you've seen each one or not//, and //whether there was anything to do there//.  All games of this genre should have that, and I think I need to update my review of that game with more praises.  Sinister City had a basic map, for travel around the town.  In this game, maps are entirely absent.  Although : When you don't need to return to a group of rooms, it will lock them off completely so you have fewer options to blindly search through.  That keeps gameplay more focused.","December 3, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have my reasons for calling it above average.\nThe puzzles were fun, music was great, story... was mostly on par.\nI mean, I got hooked, don't me wrong... I just don't like the cliff hanger ending. There better be a second game coming, that's all I'm gonna type on that.\n\nCompared to other hidden object games I've played, it's not the best, but still a nice play to enjoy and to pass the time. No problems or glitches. Like all HO games, there's a lot of backtracking.\nThe puzzles were challenging most of the time.\n\nBut... to be honest, the HO game didn't have many Hidden Object Search games in it. Honestly you'd look for a key, look for the hidden object then go to a bag of fountain and just click, click, and click. That's the reason why I don't see it as one of the best HO games made since there's barely any hidden obkects to find. It's mostly a point and click on an object and drag it here to open this door and click here again to do soemthing else.\n*shrug*\nThat may just be me. I don't know, maybe I've been playing too many Artifex Mundi HO games.\n\nBut other than that, the story is great and captivating. The music is beautiful, especially when you are looking for hiden objects. The sounds ESPECIALLY are extremely on par and help you get immersed into the game, especially when a monster is around.\nAgain, the ending didn't settle well with me. There was no big confrontation, nothin'. All that hype and immersion to just get a little peanut of an ending... AND WITH A CLIFFHANGER AT THAT!\nBut, I'm hooked and am waiting for a second game to follow through and hopefully improve on those small problems.\n\nGet this game and hope for a sequel.\n\nHappy Gaming!","November 21, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot was B-movie at best, and I actually found Sinister City more enjoyable than this - at least I got some laughs out of that one!  The ending of Dracula's Legacy makes very little sense to me, but then much of the game was illogical anyway in my opinion.\n\nI didn't experience any real bugs although there were times when an area would continue sparkling after I was done with it, making me think I had to go back and do something else there.  There is no journal or notebook, as you might find in some other games, to remind you what your objectives are.  However, the game does move you on to new areas once you pass a certain point and doesn't allow you to go back, so at least you're not wandering aimlessly around every previous scene looking for items.\n\nI got it very cheap in the Hallowe'en sale, but I still don't recommend it.  It was not the cheesy fun I expected, but more slap-your-forehead illogical and frustrating.  I got through it, but I won't play it again - I feel like the majority of it was a waste of my time and I could have been doing something much more fun, like watching paint dry.\n","November 8, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A LOT. And so I bestow upon myself the authority to say that this HO game is below par.\n\nThere is a distinct lack of logic in this particular game, barring the fact that it is supernatural-themed, I'm talking common sense knowledge. Barging into a store and threatening the store owner with a shotgun kind of common sense. There are so many aspects that just seem rushed, like they didn't quite know how to move the player to the next area in any better way. And some of the puzzles are just impossible to figure out because the instructions are horrendous. Also, very few of the puzzles are, in fact, hidden object scenes, which is most unsatisfying.\n\nThat aside, it is a very pretty game and since I got this one on sale, I can't say it was really a waste of money.

I have never visited Dracula's crypt before that is under some random icy fountain in a courtyard...in an abandoned village that has only two locals...with some twin vampires that are sleeping...and a deaf beast that is sometimes bigger than the houses on the empty streets.\nSo all in all:\nArt and animation: not that great\nSoundtrack: Lake soundtrack was like a soft-porn tune from the 80's, otherwise good\nPuzzles: My biggest issue here. They were either boring and easy, or I could not get what the game wanted from me. There were cool puzzles. Easy puzzles. Boring puzzles. Illogical puzzles. Odd puzzles. Puzzles-puzzles. Big puzzles. Little puzzles.\nProgression difficulty: not challenging at all and sometimes you had to do lots of illogical things to progress. You would not normally guess what to do. It is fantasy of course, but my protagonist was a human in a human world with human tools. (and I won't spoil the "TWIST". Yes. There is a twist. Can you guess what?)\n\nSorry, I cannot recommend this game : (\nIt is not that bad, but far from good and I have played much better games of this genre.","November 16, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The riddles are not very difficult and very obvious though, that is why I said in between.\n\nThe Hidden Object scenes sometimes take a little while and so do a few of the mini games because it is just moving pieces around until it matches and not really something to get your brain moving.\n\nThe Soundtrack is suitable for the ambiente of the game and the 2D Art is everything else then disappointing. Not state of the art for the latter but very good.\n\nAll around for only 3 bucks you get roughly 3 hours of game time, aint bad for that kind of genre.

Long story short; you spend just as much time confused, but you spend it staring blankly at the three screens you've clicked on every pixel of, instead of ten screens worth of stuff you've half-examined.\n\n* They went with a "sleek" interface that keeps trying to minimize while I'm trying to use it.  The mouse controls are also painfully floaty and imprecise -- it's as if the hitboxes for small items are the size of a full quarter of the screen, but are placed so imprecisely that clicking directly on the thing you can see won't do it.  Symptoms of a bad mobile port maybe?\n* The puzzles are more linear :  IE, at any given point, only one or possibly two puzzles are available for you to do, and you must do them to unlock the next set of one to two puzzles.  In other games, there were four or five areas full of puzzles available at any given time, and completing any one of them would add another one to the list.  The more linear design makes it easy to get stuck in this game, and in at least one place, the hint system is wrong about what to do next.  It thinks I have an item I can't get yet, and won't give me hints on getting that item (I need a valve to put fuel into a gas can : it keeps telling me to put fuel into the car).\n* Similarly, most screens / things to click on have exactly one item of use.  When you click on it, the item goes to your inventory and the screen closes and you can't open it again.  It's a little jarring, and reminds me that I am trying to accomplish a linear, pre-set series of events, rather than exploring an actual location or story with any degree of freedom.\n* Puzzles are less...creative, or make less sense, than previous installments.  In the first townlike area, there are no less than six things that require funny-shaped keys. Surely some of these could have been replaced with something less blatantly "collect item to continue"...?\n* The story is about the same quality as previous installments, so I'm a little interested, but the writing is improving -- which is taking it out of that uncanny valley where everything is campy and hilarious, where Sinister City firmly dwells.  The end reunites protagonist and love interest, but answers nothing about her history.  Pretty clearly setting up a sequel.\n* Plague Mysteries had a beautiful map interface, where it would list every room you had access to, //every interactable screen in that room//, //whether you've seen each one or not//, and //whether there was anything to do there//.  All games of this genre should have that, and I think I need to update my review of that game with more praises.  Sinister City had a basic map, for travel around the town.  In this game, maps are entirely absent.  Although : When you don't need to return to a group of rooms, it will lock them off completely so you have fewer options to blindly search through.  That keeps gameplay more focused.","December 3, 2015","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
