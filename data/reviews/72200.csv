"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ancienteclipse/recommended/72200/","ancienteclipse","Gahooligan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ancienteclipse/","198 products in account","When I say that I'd reccomend this game it's only to a small niche of people. Because I happen to fall in the niche I rather liked Universe Sandbox, though I can see where many people woud not. Universe Sandbox is pretty self explanatory in the title, its a astrophysics sandbox in which you can create and destroy solar systems, galaxys, or even galaxy clusters (if your computer is beefy enough) Many stats and attributes are tracked as you simulate the astral dance of heavenly bodies.\n\nThings like density, spin, velocity, mass, and heat are all tracked and simulated to give you the most realistic expierience possible. Unfortunately, it doesnt get very realistic. My biggest gripe I would suppose is the physics. The game uses Eular math, or if you have a processing power Runge Kata. But eventually stable orbits will do someting completely random, sending a few planets and stars on random vectors straight out if your little "pitri dish". This doesnt bother me too much because it mostly only happens when it comes to simulating galaxies. On the solar system level it does quite well and it has enough options to accomodate nearly any computer's processing power. That is, if you can navigate the menus.\n\nTheres lots of options and statistics for every celestial body and you can edit every fascet. the problem is, this creates a very confusing series of menus, with confusing abbreviations and volcabulary if you're not already familiar with scientific notation and units of measurement. If the menus were a bit more friendly I think it would open up this game to alot more people. The actual simulation field can be a bother to wrangle too. I found it sometimes likes to snap focus to nearly every other celestial body but the one I want to focus on. The "searchbar" at the top ended up being my best friend.\n\nIf youre like me, and you can wrangle the menus and put up with the sometimes sketchy simulation, it truely is a universe at your fingertips. This simulator will only take you as far as your imagination (or processor) will take you. Binary systems, rings around Earth -- have you ever wondered what it would look like if the earth had a ring then the moon crashed through it?  The possiblities are more or less limitless, given your computer can handle the math. If youre into astronomy, physics or just enjoy space to any degree, this game is worth checking out.\n\nWithout an actual objectives or things to accomplish, this game falls short of actually being a game. It would be better described as an app. This one probably isnt right for the masses, but just right for the armchair astronomer in me.","November 26, 2013","true","16.0"," 364 of 395 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","364","395","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/72200/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","Universe Sandbox is exactly what its name implies: a place for you to play around with astronomical bodies and see how changing various things will effect the macro-universe. I think it is one of the most unique and awesome titles on Steam. It is well put together, the physics in the game accurately demonstrate real-life laws, and the recent update that puts you directly into a tutorial the first time you start the game really helps you figure out the, at first intimidating amount of, options that you can play around with.\n\nWhether for work, play, or educational purposes, Universe Sandbox is an excellent title that I don't think any Steam account should lack. If you have *any* interest, even a minute amount, in astronomy, physics, or even if you ever wondered what would happen to Saturn's rings if Neptune flew too close, you need to have this game. It's very relaxing to play with, and the the engine is extremely deep - allowing you to truly let your imagination run wild.\n\nThe GUI is clean and efficient, and the pre-built simulations and environments are extremely well put together and fun to play with.  Some examples include:\n\n*Environments:*\nOur Solar System\nLocal Galaxies\nEarth & Moon\nSaturn & Moons\n\n*Physics Playgrounds:*\nSmall Scale Gravity\nFloating Moons\nGalaxy Collision\n\nBuy now, build your own galaxy or satellite system, and watch what happens as time passes and you introduce variables into the equation.\n\n*Bonus:* You can smash an asteroid into Earth to see what would happen, awesome for those bad days at the office.","July 12, 2013","true","5.3"," 185 of 202 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","185","202","0","0"

It's really more of a toy – the virtual equivalent of a configurable orrery, except hugely more complex than any mechanical system.That complexity is one of the key attractions that Universe Sandbox possesses. Using the vast range of variables and tools at your disposal you can create some enormously convoluted displays of physics, bending cosmic laws to your will out of nothing more than a desire to see pretty patterns form on your screen.There are a series of example experiments to help ease you into the level of curiosity that Universe Sandbox requires – each one acting as a tutorial – but the real fun lies in creating your own simulations. The camera is a little fiddly at times, but my biggest complaint is that the simulator doesn’t come with any sound or music. While I appreciate that’s realistic, given the lack of orchestras in the vacuum of space, it would have been nice to have some ambient music quietly twinkling away in the background.Still, it’s hard to get too dissatisfied with Universe Sandbox when you factor in both the fact that it’s a one-man labour of love and that it’s available at a bargain price. If nothing else it offers something uniquely interesting and fun, which is quick to inspire imagination and creativity, even if it lacks the educational aspect that you might expect.","July 22, 2014","true","152.0"," 121 of 135 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","121","135","0","3"

That's the end of the positive.\n\nThe programming relies on too many crutches and flat out amature hacks which leaves the program barely stable.  A brief search online easily shows the sheer volume of people having problems.  Despite this, there will be NO fixes as the dev and his team are too busy working on an all new version to SELL you again!\n\nThis leads to the next problem.  The dev and his team.  From late 2011 through 2012, a free copy of the next version was promised to anyone who had purchased this version.  Opening themselves to a class-action, the dev and his team have publicly announced that they will not honor their promises.  In effect they have LIED and made money off of that lie.\n\n(Shame on you Steam for allowing this.  Shame on all of you appologists for defending this kind of behavior.)\n\nBetween the hack job that this game is and the disreputable behavior,  I strongly recommend that you avoid this dev!\n\nUnless of course you're the type that likes to pay for a defective product that won't be fixed and being lied to..","August 14, 2014","false","3.3"," 88 of 139 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","88","139","6","3"

I can't recall a single game that allows you to manipulate gravity and time so easily, though this is wasted on me. Smashing things into other things is fun c: But I digress. Universe Sandbox is a great simulator, but is it a game? You need a good deal of imagination to get any more than a few hours of fun out of this, because there are very few game mechanics involved. Can you increase the mass of the Sun and watch the effect on the solar system? Indeed! Does this do anything? Not really, it just shows you what happens.\n\nIf you think you'd enjoy exploring some of the finer orbital mechanics that KSP never taught you, then you might like Universe Sandbox. I'm recommending it because it's a pretty damn good simulation, but it isn't for everyone. Aside from the few tutorials demonstrating things you could do, it's mostly... well, a sandbox! That means there's almost no reward from dumping hours into the game other than satisfying curiosity that couldn't be soothed elsewhere.","December 4, 2013","true","0.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

Even if you have the full solar system model running in the sim, eventually Mercury will slingshot itself towards Andromeda Galaxy because, and I'm assuming here, it's actually an alien spaceship and it was performing an orbital maneuver in order to speed up (hello, Rama). That was sarcasm by the way.\n\nAnyway, In a game like this one there should be at least the ability to create your own stars/planets, and not just select pre-existing ones, a bigger variety of space objects would be welcome.\nYou should have the ability to see the internal structure of each celestial body, just like in some of the App Store apps like StarWalk or SolarWalk. This isn't 1996, there should be many many MANY more options, including the ability to see every single man-made satellite or mission, also all of the satellites currently in orbit and proper models for them in addition to real photos/maps of each planet and star, not just links to wikipedia.\n\nAs always, metacritic gives this an unfairly high score. Make no mistake, this sim is a huge disappointment. The selling point of this game is realism and the gravitational model is broken, making this piece of software as useless as a helicopter in outer space.","January 27, 2014","false","15.4"," 49 of 89 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","49","89","0","9"

It's exactly what it says it is, a sandbox on a universal scale, but to be used for teaching and experimentation purposes far more than simply to entertain (though perhaps some may find enjoyment over manipulating galaxies). It does an excellent job at what it attempts, but is hard to recommend to anyone but the most avid space lover for its dry and overly open ended nature.\n\nIf you're still unclear what US actually is, you can think of it as playing god with stars and planets in a galaxy of your own design. You're given complete free reign over every aspect of your universe and all that's within it, allowing you to create scenarios that could never occur in reality but nonetheless I'm sure many have wondered what would look like (for example: what if the earth was the size of the sun). It's an intriguing idea with nearly limitless options, but I have to take issue with US for doing a poor job catering to anyone but those who already posses a keen understanding of the cosmos and a fascination with what they hold. Aside from a few tutorial sections that show you a few possible things you can do, you're left to create your own fun, which for some (myself included) doesn't go much farther than shooting a dozen planet size footballs into the sun and seeing what comes of it.\n\nI can't recommend Universe Sandbox to many, but it's not because it's bad or too much along the lines of taking an astronomy class. It knows what it is and gives you all the tools you could want to fool around in a galaxy, testing possible outcomes or teaching others about what exists in the vastness of space, but it will only ever appeal to a niche audience of astrophysicists and those that simply have a deep love of space. It's a tool that gives back whatever you put into it, the problem is just knowing how to use it.","June 21, 2014","false","1.2"," 86 of 160 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","86","160","2","6"

The only downside is that it may not be for everyone and may not be too much of an attention-grabber to everyone. It's a very nice experimental simulator for those who are interested in astronomy or just want to kill some time early in the morning.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/recommended/72200/","ErickaUnlimited","💝💝ErickaUnlimited💝💝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/","777 products in account","Overview\nUniverse Sandbox is a gravity and space simulator with a heavy focus on player control, interaction and experimentation. The game allows for scale simulations of our galaxy, planets, stars, moons and those of any number of known galaxies as well. There aren't too many limitations with the game, as it has gone through several revisions over many, many years. Universe Sandbox first started out as an educational project back in or around 1993 by a single developer named Dan Dixon. The project then went through two revisions before version 2.1 was released on Steam in May of 2010 for sale.\n\nThe game itself doesn't have a beginning, middle or end. There is no story to tell, no narration to follow, but that doesn't leave it feeling hollow. Universe Sandbox gives you the tools and abilities to craft your own universe, make your own planets and create something that is really all your own...or collide them together and watch them explode for the sheer reason that you can. The game leaves those decisions up to you.\n\nNot everyone will enjoy this game. I feel that it is a very niche title that might cater to those who enjoy simulation experiments, math, space enthusiasts, or those that just have an appreciation of taking something anyway from a game that is more than just fun. I originally picked up Universe Sandbox because I love space related games and I'd love to have a method to simulate what I've learned and continue to read about on my own.\n\nThe meat of Universe Sandbox is based on what you make of it. When you first start, you'll be greeted by a tutorial that will show you various aspects of the game, where to go and what you can do. The tutorial felt a little minimal and I felt like it lacked depth. There are pre-defined simulations with objectives that you can play to help familiarize yourself with the UI and I felt those helped a lot. However, the overall presentation could use some polish.\n\nWhen it comes to actually building solar systems, crashing planets, exploding suns and or freezing the earth (take that global warming! ^_-) or any of the numerous godlike powers it's enjoyable, but I felt like it was lacking in...something. It's hard to say what that feeling was and I honestly couldn't tell you still, but building creations on a galaxy scale still felt marginal in scope. I remember building my own galaxy with planets, stars, a sun, whatever I felt it needed and when I was done, I was done. I wasn't really sure where I went from there; compare it to a model airplane. Once my model was finished, I had nothing to do. I could do another, but the outcome was the same.\n\nI wanted a model airplane I could touch; I wanted something tangible. However, Universe Sandbox is not tangible. I cannot pick it up off the shelf and admire it. That, most of all, was what I felt the game was missing. It lacked purpose. Would I recommended it? Yes, absolutely, but only to those who know what you're getting. As I mentioned earlier in this review, I feel the game caters to a small audience. Some players will hate it, some will love it and some will fall somewhere in the middle like I did.\n\n\nPros\nCustomization - There's an infinite amount of ways to change your simulation. Your limit is your imagination.\nTutorials - There's quite a few to help get you use to the UI and how the game functions, especially for those that don't have a lot of knowledge with space-related terms.\nYou learn. Whether it be about the physical properties of our universe or the math behind the science, you'll come away with something new.\nCons\nThe UI can be rather clunky when setting up experiments or simulations (other than pre-developed ones)\nAchievements - They are odd and will require a guide to unlock some of them. One is purely ridiculous, which requires you to run the game for an entire year (total, not in one sitting). Good luck! .-.\nThere is no music. Some may prefer that, but I didn't care for the silence. There is no sound in space, but I felt there should have been in the game.\n\nOverall, I like Universe Sandbox. It won't tug at your heart strings, nor give you a story to tell your friends. There is no plot, there are no boss fights, no method in which to level up; there's just you, gravity and the infinite possibilities in your mind.

You can also toggle different colors to represent things in the universe like acceleration/velocity, mass, etc (the planetary bodies will trail different colors depending on what you select). Reflecting the realities of space, there is no sound or music, however, I didn't really mind (playing my own is perfectly fine).\n\nThe controls are simple, you just click on the variety of options available; however, understanding what each option can do may take some time to fully appreciate. The learning curve is minimal to moderate - the numerous options may itimidate people who do not understand basic physics (since this is a physics simulator in space), but the video tutorials are very helpful in getting you familiarized with each functions. There is also a list of fun things to do in the sidebar, which will offer you a step-by-step blueprint of how to achieve things like adding planetary rings to the Earth's moon and seeing how gravity effects it (very nice visuals if you try this out).\n\nOf course, one of the first things I did while trying this out was to increase Earth's velocity and force it out of orbit - hurtling through space and turning black from freezing over. You can add moons or asteroids, turn things into black holes, and manipulate factors like velocity, mass, etc. I tried dropping moons into Earth, however, it appears to make the planet larger (as if it absorbs them). I do not know how to crash them into each other yet (or if that's even possible). With the large amount of variables you can manipulate, there is good number of things you can do and experiment with in the vastness of space.\n\nOverall, if you have the least bit of interest in physics and/or space, then you should definitely give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","September 21, 2014","true","1.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You may not get the usual youtube-fodder-laughter-inducing effects from this as with other "simulation" games (although you may if you enjoy destroying universe while laughing evilly). I certainly can't comment the physics as I don't have the competency to do so, but I have some expectancy of visual detail not fulfilled by the engine. Visual effects are pretty bland. UI is pretty cluttery and need some time to familiarize with. It does have high level of complexity, it keep tracks of many parameters, such as velocity, mass, density, and temperature, and did a great job simulating it.\n\nIn conclusion, Universe Sandbox falls more on an educational tool than a game, it even has in-game wikipedia browser. It is enjoyable for space nerds like me, and a good education tool, though I suggest to wait for its more awesome sequel.","August 29, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A nice feature is that instead of going to the "Add tool" or stop the simulation (time) is that you can add bodies (shoot them out with velocity if you'd like) or alter the mass/luminosity/etc. in real time. There are a few bugs such as X-, Y- & Z-axles disappearing and the game crashing during load.\n\nNOTE: To see how gamma rays simulate you will need a rather hefty computer. Simulating a solar system is fine, but rays are not a very good idea to try.. unless you've got a 4770K, R9 290 & 8GB DDR3.

In a normal work of astrophysicist you'd have to program all this stuff by yourself - here you have everything what you need - models, integrator and visualisation tool.\n\nBut honestly this is not for everyone. Of course it is fun to throw asteroid into earth, change the Sun into a black hole or compare sizes of nearby stars. I'd say it's about 20 minutes of fun. After that this tool would be thrown away and never run again.\n\nI'd say this tool is dedicated for people really interested in math and astrophysics. You really need an idea what you want to simulate and spend some time to work on the initial conditions. For me a real fun was to see what happens to predefined rings of Saturns, when you insert Earth-mass moon on an elongated orbit. Amazing how the rings transform - I even saw some kind of density waves there. I feel that some very complicated differential equations must make the physics there.\n\nSome people complain that when you speed up you get unrealiable results. Of course. Unfortunately implemented integrator is not very sophisticated and loses accuracy quickly. This is why you have accuracy measure available. When you get into yellow or red domain you are no longer watching physics but numerical artifacts. This can be entertaining too. But if you want realiable results you will have to wait a long time depending on the complexity of the problem. Patience is a must in any computer modelling.\n\nTo sumarize - you really need to know what you are doing to have fun from this program.","January 14, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In this game, you can spend a lot of time and it does not bother, because variations in changes in the location of your galaxy are endless, you can arbitrarily adjust the planets, comets.\nYes what there to speak, even the stars at the center of galaxies.

It's a utility program that should be reclassified as Software now that Steam has a separate area for that. It's a simulation program for our solar system and the greater universe. It is essentially an educational tool, once part of the now-defunct Steam For Schools programme.\n\nNot having any entertainment value on a platform that was once purely for entertainment, the developer resorted to adding achievements and using them as part of Steam's summer 2011 event. This meant many people started "playing" it, however other achievements are famous for being the most ridiculous on Steam, including starting the program 10,000 times and leaving it running for an actual real-time YEAR.\n\nThough they have since acknowledged these achievements as a mistake, the developer has refused to remove them but instead uses all the topics complaining about them (which are by far the most-discussed topics for the program both on the Steam forums and the developers' own forum) to advertise the game's follow-up in poor taste. And that's before remembering that this follow-up was originally promised to be a free update to owners of this program but now costs twice as much again.\n\nIn short: Not a game, not fun, and a great way to ruin your achievement stats. If you joined Steam after 2011 and weren't caught out by this game, avoid it now at all costs.","January 17","false","2.4"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","16","33","0","4"

Given, you can change the individual properties of the presets if you really want to, but that quickly becomes an exercise in numbers and is far from as much fun as it is advertised as.\n\nAnother strong negative point of the sim is its accuracy/speed. The simulation is neither accurate nor speedy, and you will very quickly end up with horrendous frame rates and/or woefully inaccurate trajectories that would make any 1st year physics student cringe. Yes, I have a fast processor, no it doesn't help.\n\nDefinitely not recommended, you'd better spend your money on something that is either more useful or more fun.","December 22, 2013","false","2.1"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","2"

Even just running the Earth and Moon scenario where you have literally TWO BODIES to deal with, the program slows and dies.  It's already crashed several times and I haven't even had the game for an hour.  As others mention, the controls and layout aren't very smooth, and if time is sped up the objects just go flying off.  It is nothing like the trailer.  Once the game starts to crash, there is no recovery, the controls become inverted if they respond at all.  The zoom feature seems broken as well which makes the program even more difficult to operate.  Trying to change angles or move throughout is supposed to be what the whole game is about to get a visual and it can't even do this smoothly.\n\nThis game isn't finished, it needs some serious bug fixes.  It's an interesting idea that is being poorly executed.","December 24, 2013","false","0.7"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","2"

A good solar system builder would give you a little more freedom and creative options. I bought this game thinking it would allow you to edit planets atmosphere colors and material makeup and interesting things like that, instead it gives you predesigned planets, like Earth and Mars. The physics work quite well and its pretty cool to watch stars eat each other but It gets boring in minutes. One major issue is that the game lacks a soundtrack. There is no noise in the game that I know of. I got so bothered by the lack of sound that I had to play some Operation Ivy afterwards to get my head straight. Currently, I am waiting for my refund and  will drop my money on a game like Deus Ex or some other classic game like that. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR TIME.\n\n-Edit. If it's on sale, for a very low price, go for it.

Because that's this game -- it is what it is: a space sandbox sim.  So why not a "thumbs up" then, you ask?  Well, you COULD pay $10 for this game...or you COULD instead download NASA/JPL's Eyes On The Solar System app for FREE (and which is very similar to, and just as good as, Universe Sandbox).  While Universe Sandbox might offer more functions/options, Eyes On The Solar System seems to win in the scientific accuracy department and also has better visuals.  So, to sum up, it's not that Universe Sandbox is terrible; It's just that it's not that great for $10, when comparable programs are available for no charge.  I couldn't honestly recommend that someone spend money on this.","November 21, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/4freedom/recommended/72200/","4freedom","Ѕσjδμгиеr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/4freedom/","378 products in account","As others have noted, this simulator cannot even simulate correctly.  The devs are sloppy coders who don't know how to do proper bounds checking, as evidenced by objects randomly flying off into space if the simulation is sped up.   You would think that they would have detected this and fixed it by now, but none such is the case.  Careless and sloppy.\n\nI wouldn't even recommend this as a tutorial for grade school kids, either, because of the inaccurate and unpredictable results when tweaking parameters (which is supposed to be 99% of the usefulness of this program in the first place).\n\nWhat's more, the devs have decided to add an "atmospheric warming due to CO2 level"  parameter to their new version.  In order for this to be credible, the mathematical model employed would need to be disclosed (which I seriously doubt will  happen).\n\nBut, regardless of whether they do, they have decided to go against 50,000+ scientists who are on record as stating that human-produced CO2 is NOT the cause of global warming. It is a hoax promulgated by NWO globalists and their sock puppets like Al Gore.   There is overwhelming evidence to the contrary now -- which is that climate cycles are simply linked to solar cycles.\n\nSo, I am disappointed that Dan Dixon and his ragtag team of devs have chosen to subscribe to the non-scientific, mainstream media propaganda, which is funded by the globalists, with the intention of hoodwinking the world into thinking that a global carbon tax is necessary to "save" the planet.   They are doing a terrible disservice to young people by reinforcing the brainwashing in this regard.\n\nAnd it is for this reason that I will permanently boycott all future products from this company.\n\n(Note: Acquired via a bundle)","September 7, 2014","false","24.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

For those who want to be shooting or flying about in a spaceship, this really isn't what you're looking for.\n\nFor the few pounds that I paid for it in the sale it is well worth the spend, and can provide hours of gameplay, despite becomming a little dull at times. The game is simply what you make of it; a more creative player will certainly find this more enjoyable since the content is generated from the unlimited number of scenarios that you can create. For those who aren't so imagniative, the game provides a good sample of ready-made scenarios and oddities to explore.\n\nAs for the playability of the game, some of the menus can be confusing, and so I would reccomend taking the tutorial! The 'camera' controls are easy to use and have the adequate range of movement and precision necessary to be intuitive.\n\nTLDR:\nGood for sciencey people, has excellent controls and a wide range of things to do! It's a game but also useful for learning!\nBad for those who want an action packed game with explosions etc.","February 12, 2014","true","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can create moons, rings, planets, suns, blackholes, explode objects, change mass, velocity and a edit some more relevant statistics and watch chaos unfold, but I actually found it behaving oddly sometimes and my experience didn't go much farther than experimenting odd scenarios before getting bored.\n\nAlso beware Achievement hunters/completists, there's at least 2 achievments that are absurdly hard to get, one is execute the game 10 000 times and another one that is run the game for 1 year, that's roughly 8760 hours! Not being able to get the achivement and be able to enjoy other games in less than 1 year is really bothering me.\n\nIn short, this isn't much of a game, there's no objectives or goals, just experimentation, this isn't for everyone and I'm sure there may be a target audience for this but while interesting for the novelty, my feelings are, if given the chance to go back in time, I wouldn't pay for it again, and as such, I don't recommend this "game".","March 5, 2014","false","1.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","7"

Planets really don't take damage unless there is a direct collision or you use god powers to explode them directly.\n\nGravity behaves in a cartoonish way and the math is off in a comedic fashion. For example if you drop a copy of Jupiter with no velocity and just let the sun pull it in, it won't ever hit the sun. It will speed in then sling shot past and exit the solar system at something like a quarter the speed of light. Nothing was influencing it to make it miss to one side or the other, it just can't hit the broad side of a barn when the part is the one pulling it in.\n\nAdditionally when Jupiter zips past the sun at a distance that would make even kissing cousins object, Jupiter loses no mass. Jupiter passes within close enough distance that it should either be ignited or at least stripped of large portions of it's gassy mass and instead it rockets out the other side at speeds that should cause massive damage as well, and continues on unhindered. A few millenia later it will return and do the exact same thing.\n\nIt is surprisingly difficult to get anything to behave reasonably here.","April 18","false","4.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Buyer beware.","January 27, 2014","false","2.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The other thing that put me off about the game was the achievements, as someone who enjoys collecting achievements the idea of starting up this game 10,000 times was off putting.

I'm not sure how accurate the simulation is as opposed to something like Celestia (a freeware astronomy sim), though Universe Sandbox does seem to offer more options.\n\nMy one gripe is that the simulations just become too inaccurate too quickly. This is space we're talking about, so stuff happens really slowly, given the fact that we're operating on a cosmic scale, and cranking up the speed of the simulation lowers the accuracy in order for it to run properly and not at a sluggish pace. I'd love an option to let the software actually run the simulation at a high speed but with plenty of sub-steps in the calculation to get an accurate simulation and just let the program bake the simulation into an animation over time in order to have real-time playback, although you'd lose the ability to make changes on the fly. I don't know if I'd have paid 10$ / €, but I got it in a Humble Bundle for 0.33€ and yeah, I can't complain there.","August 7, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am sure you could figure it out from any number of science text-books, or you could watch the dire consequences for yourself in this game.\n\nIf that level of annihilation makes you uncomfortable, perhaps creating your own solar system from scratch might interest you more.\n\nUniverse Sandbox is a toy more than a game.

Maybe this should be labelled as software instead of game.\n\nThe good:\n+ Great visualisation of many calestial phenomenon.\n+ Fun way to study astronomy and astrophysics.\n\nThe bad:\n- Use of Euler algorithm and RK4. Euler algorithm have way too large error accumulation while RK4 is too slow. I would rather use Numerov algorithm. It is very much faster.\n- Crash on random basis.\n- No idea if it is just me, there is no sound or music and it is pretty boring.\n\nThis review will be updated as I use them more.

That's amazing. Watching millions of years go by as fast as seconds, it gives me a brief moment of relief; A brief moment where I feel like I'm exploring eternity and not just stuck on a material-minded spec in infinity.\n\nFew games make me emotional, but the grand scope of our world and just the insane idea that through technology I can at least experience and taste but a miniscule amount of it: That made it worth the purchase ten times over for me.\n\nThis isn't as much a game or a simulation as an experience really. You won't be sinking hundreds of hours into it, but those few hours you do will make you somber and tranquil if you have any depth and longing for exploration and the universe.\n\nIf not, meh you can always have fun throwing starts into eachother.","September 24, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Change the mass of a planet, alter the speed, send a giant tea cup hurtling toward Jupiter, maybe place a black monolith on Europa...witness the collision of two galaxies, of find out what happens if the sun becomes a black hole.","January 30, 2013","true","56.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Galactic collisions are on the other hand more fun than real simulations (which is totally understandable) as well as physics of really fast and dense bodies. The game simply ignores relativity, and it is pretty sad. I hope this will be improved in next version. However,  this game is really woth of money and is a must for everyone who is into astronomy.","December 25, 2013","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
