I played the 1st one, out of desperation - it was the only game I had installed on my PC that I hadn't clocked, and that was unlocked - didn't need an online key for - in a week where I had no internet. It was fine, passable. It had it's flaws, but it was passable.\n\nThis particular installation, however, I am sorry that it is not. I liked the corny story of the first one - except for the ending where you get killed by a freaking mushroom in a cutscene thing . That part of the story was meant to be corny irony, but they didn't really pull it off.\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are much better, and the maidens really are something to look at now. Thumbs up for that.\n\nCons:\n\nThey took everything that worked in v1, and messeed with it.\n\nThere is tons of back-and-forth in these missions, they are less linear - where you would be transported to an area with a defined goal in the first, now you have to keep going back to places you have already visited repeatedly to unock a tiny bit more of the map at a time, usually by talking to some guy and doing something with the last guy so that you can talk to the next guy. I got tedious at about the point that I quit.\n\nThe control scheme is ruined. It's harder to navigate. This is merely a side-effect of...\n\nThey changed the camera angle. Now you can rotate the camera, but you can see less (the camera is too close) with a more isometric / top down view, you feel really restricted after playing the previous game. It's painful.\n\nThe story is long winded and drawn out. With the first it was always just action action action - back to base to heal - teleport to some more bad guys - Now it's go back to the other side of the map, talk to some girl, got tot eh other side of the map, talk to some other girl, steal her chicken, go to the other side of the map, hug some trees, go to the other side of the map, cook the chicken, go to the other side of the map, talk to some girl and give her the cooked chicken, go to the middle of the map, talk to some girl to join your party, go back to the tree hugging place, talk to some girl... Oh goody! a mission!\n\nI only discovered halfway through the 1st game that there are a limited number of potions in the world... that is to say, once you have bought the shop (wizard) out, that's it, you can't get any more. I discovered this just in time to really start conserving them for the invetible boss-battle. So glad I did. If i'd had none, at the final boss I'd have needed to have replayed the entire game again, conserving health as best I could. That would'a happened, sure. Same messed up scheme here.\n\nOH THIS IT THE WORST PART: The battles where you have to protect some NPC - So you get into a fight, right? (yeah, finally). but you gotta take this gimp with you that you have no control over. He is an idiot, too. He rushes in headlong in some random direction, and if you don't keep up with him, he'll go in 1v6 Solo, and die:Game Over -Try Agia. If you do keep up with him, he'll rush in and try and play meatshield so you gotta take out the guys he's fighting. but as soon as you do, he will rush straght for the next batch. Remember that some of your strongest guys in your party are very slow (can move very few tiles per turn) and the more you protect him (kill the guys doing damage to him) the further from your best characters he runs, making it harder and harder to fight these... Oh he's dead:Game Over - Try Again. That is of course presuming that you can follow him at all - when he starts goig for it, you don't even always know where he runs off to - the fight may be over several screen-widths, and you may be trying to move one of the slower characters up toward the battle when it's won, so he rushes off on his own, you don't even see where he goes, so you run foward to find him only for him to have doubled back and gone the other way... on his own...   This wouldn't be quite so bad if it didn't swicth between a free-roam mode when out of combat and a turn-based mode when in combat. I can't be bothered explaining why, except that he can get into trouble faster than you can get to him. Yay.\n\nThat's pretty much all that I can think of at the moment, but the combination of drivel, tedious and unexciting mini-missions, restricted camera views, and scuicidal NPC's in battles are what broke it for me.","July 9, 2014","false","0.1"," 92 of 121 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","92","121","3","3"

If you enjoyed the first, I think you will really like this one as well; it carries with it pretty much everything you may have liked and in fact improves upon the graphics, adds fully voiced dialogue (which I thought was surprisingly well done), familiar as well as new characters, new and more abilities and accessories, and lots of new places to explore and monsters to battle. Really the only thing I thought was a downgrade was that the camera feels zoomed in closer, but it is still manageable and you can rotate it freely at least.

As a sequel it's just too unpolished.  It should have been an improvement on the first game.  I don't think it was.\n\nThe path finding is awful.  Sometimes I find the hero bouncing around between his own teammates instead of moving.  It happens enough to be annoying.  Uncontrolled members run off in the opposite direction and start combats.  There's no way you can stop them.\n\nMore annoying, however, is the lack or direction and description in quests.  The quest journal is unorganized and minimalistic at best.  Some people might prefer seeking out and talking to every single NPC again when trying to advance the story line.  I don't.   So this might just be personal preference, but there are a few quests that don't even tell you where to go.  In others the area is named incorrectly.  I searched several areas before I found the right one.\n\nIt's probably better the second time through.  I might try it again now that I know where to go.\n\nIf you are really a fan of the first game you'll probably still like it.  I have to give it a thumbs down, though, as a disappointment.","December 29, 2014","false","28.2"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

One, being I never heard of it and second I might have not tired it out. But it is very well worth the money and it is even better if it is on sale. This is the best game I brought so far for only 2 bucks. I am very happy. The only thing I really don't like is that there is no mini map. The dungeons are easy to navigate through but in were the princess is, it is a bit confusing on where you have been or not and it does suck that there is no way points to tell you really where to go or start with first. But I guess you just got to read them and pay attention to the people you talk to and what they say and you should be fine. I really recommend the game especially for people who love rpgs. I love rpgs and this one of them I like so far.","August 5, 2014","true","41.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

One has to admit though that the turn-based battles may be too easy at times, but what keeps up the enjoment I had, were nice colorful characters and the fun the game made of popular RPG themse (e.g."heroes amnesia"). Of course, a lot more fun is there for those who played the first one, but after all I think it can be enjoyed on it's own.\n\n","January 18, 2012","true","20.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Only downsize in this particular title is the suffering gameplay which makes this game kinda nervebreaking with that damn revolting camera.\nGrotesque tactics 2 does what it predecessor did better and funnier. For me it was worth the 2 euros i spent buying it. One of the most funny games i have even seen and played.

So many bugs and cheap humor all of them has but somehow the first game was a big favorite of mine after playing it a bit more. Second game in the series has voiceover and better graphics but generally the same clunky graphics engine and nasty camera that require some setup to be more bearable. The whole works.\n\nSo did i mention the game is buggy? terrible humour? So many bad things... But somehow it just works. Or doesn't. This game is definitely not for everyone. The anti-hero emo...sorry. 'goth' guy who is always out of luck and has more blue balls than Link with Zelda. And lets not forget his entourage of more or less unstable people that is the bread and butter of this game. Many dumb and hilarious moments in the game when team members comment on things they encounter. Weird characters. ex. Angelina with her angel wings and  pink dresses and moments of rage are just legendary. And Holy Avatar with his maidens. Annoying characters no doubt but as the same people are seen in many games it just puts a smile on your face to see all the same dumb things repeat themselves. Repeat a clichee and it becomes funny.\n\nAnd then there is combat and adventure too. But that is a weaker part. This is also the part that people mostly judge the game on. Perhaps that is good for them but i choose to judge this by the avkward hilarity of it.  This game would be just so worth nothing without the characters that flesh it out.  For me the long combat stretches in dungeons are a pain as i just want to see what weird happens next. And things do happen and for that i like this game. Combat itself is bearable - especially after you learn some talents but as pointed out the early game is just terrible. A big weakness to this type of game. Overcome that and you got a pretty decent game in front of you.","March 5","true","16.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

But, there is no reason to buy it. There are so many enjoyable moments but there are too many flaws to sustain the experience. There are bugs. There are crashes. The crash report has bugs and fails. The camera is bad. The controls are bad. Sometimes you can open the inventory while walking and other times you cannot and there doesn't seem to be much reason why you can or can't. It just sort of works or doesn't. There are other examples as such but I will not belabor. The gameplay is really good. I'm playing on easy to get all of the achievements which makes the game relaxing and whimsical. It's also nice to know that there are games where you can get all achievements without 1,000 hours of getting slaughtered over and over. Even on easy I feel fairly challenged at times but not all the time. The humor is fairly immature but consistently so throughout the game. I really enjoy playing the game but there are just too many issues with it that I cannot recommend somebody else spend money. I recommend you play it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/h2o2/recommended/46570/","h2o2","Dihy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/h2o2/","1051 products in account","I own about 95% of the Meridian 4 catalog, and picked up GT: Evil Heroes during that package. I later purchased GT2: Dungeons and Donuts during a sale.\nThe Background\n\nGT1 and GT2 share the premise of the player taking control of a moody sap (Drake) who overcomes personal challenges to become The Hero That Saves The World. The game is largely a parody of main-stream RPGs, with characters often throwing out asides and references to other games. The jokes are campy and are mostly of low-brow humor; some would say the designers are mocking how sexualized female characters are in other games, some would say the designers are part of the problem.\nCharacters\n\nThroughout the games, you get the opportunity to recruit new party members with different skillsets, for example:\nAngelina: Healer\n"The Semi-Divine Holy Avatar Himself": 2 handed swordsman.\nCandy: Archer\nEach character has a relatively well fleshed out back story, as there is a LOT of dialogue to read. In GT2 they have actual voice actors to play each character.\nSkills\n\nIn GT1, skills are tied to your player level. Your character has an additional skill titled "Obsession", which is kind of an automatic passive attack with unique abilities.\nEx: Holy Avatar's obsession is the ability to talk everyone everyone to sleep in a 3x3 radius. Including your party members.\nIn GT2, skills are tied to your "Talent Tree" (which is not very well explained).\nWhen you max a bottom tier Talent, it unlocks your 3rd skill. A second tier talent unlocks your 4th skill, and a 5th tier talent unlocks your "ultimate".\nAdditionally, GT2 skills have a timer, so you can't use them every turn. Your Obsession meter (more like an ultimate meter), builds up to allow you to cast the Ultimate skill.\nThe ultimate skills in GT2 are actually pretty useful, with one of them doing massive AOE damage which is needed later in the game when there are seriously 20 monsters in a room.\nThe Problems\n\nThe camera is terrible. It frequently locks onto random locations, and you have to reset the Follow toggle to return to your character. You might even feel sick from it. The Bloom doesn't help either, and may be part of the problem in inducing motion sickness in players. There is extreme camera smoothing in both games.\nCharacters frequently get stuck. If I have a party member that stands in a doorway, and I try to talk to a NPC outside of that door way, I cannot pass through. My character will choose to run into the party member, and constantly try to move past. The controls are locked and I cannot disable the "queuing" of the talk command. To fix this I had to use the cheat console to teleport Drake to the NPC. This happened at least 30 or 40 times.\nIn GT1 there is a major gamebreaking glitch where the Holy Avatar would be completely disabled during a battle. The battle round timer would still be enabled, and you would be stuck in an infinite loop. This required a reload of an earlier save file to fix.\nIn GT2 the quest journal offers only Italicized and Normal text views. It is unclear if a quest is Completed, In Progress, or Not Completable. That last detail is interesting, there are at least 5 quests in GT2 that if completed, disable your ability to complete other quests. Some of my quests that were "completed" still remained in the journal, while some that were incomplete just disappeared.\nGT2 lacks progression logic. Finding your next mission requires you to talk to just about every NPC to figure out what you're doing next. The need to do so is not tracked in the quest log. There is also no notification that informs you to talk to a NPC. If you surf the Steam or Gamefaqs forums, many players ask "WTH do I do next?" And the answer is usually "Talk to everyone". This was not as big of a problem in GT1 as the maps were not as large.\nFinal Comments\n\nI eventually used the cheats "goto//god//healall" to complete both games. "Healall" resets the movement tracker so you can move from one end of a map to the opposite end in one turn. This made progressing through the (really boring and tedious) fights much quicker. Even then, it still took about 10 hours to finish GT2 because of all the walking and talking you're required to do. I would estimate that GT2 would take over 30 hours without cheating. And let me tell you the 10 second ending is not worth the effort[1] .\nHumblebrag: This post here is more comprehensive than anything you'll find online. Nobody wants to write a walkthrough or a guide for these games because GT sucks. If you're stuck on a mission/quest, leave a post and I'll see if I remember how I did it.","January 2","false","13.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

Won't list them all here, if you are curious feel free to check my review of the first one. Funny and moronic how they didn't fix any of the original problems, and all the poor design choices are there. The tiny camera that can't pan out but this time instead changes from in/out to going straight overhead and in a different directional plane at a certain point, which I've never seen before and may be the dumbest thing every. The middle mouse button can be used to manipulate camera, which is the crappiest button ever. My favorite thing I noticed was how mechanics don't even work properly This is a grid based game, so at one point I was fighting 4 guys and I lured them back into a corridor where only 1 grid was possible to move so the first one would block the rest and I'd fight one at a time, quite smart I might say. And I know the person blocking the others exists because it happened to me in the first game when I was trying to attack someone my guy was blocking the way. Well somehow even though there was one square, their guys WALKED PAST THE GUY BLOCKING THEM and surrounded me somehow.....dumb. The single greatest part was when I tried walking past one of them to get out of there, I COULDN'T MOVE BECAUSE THEY WERE TAKING UP THE SQUARE I WANTED TO MOVE PAST.......I honestly have no logic or reasoning available to justify how the computer can break a part of grid based RPGs and then the very next turn the same rules do not apply for me. It's also great how the game never saves in an area so if you suddenly die you lose all progress. But for that terrible instance listed above it shows how much this developer screws up basic mechanics. There is a reason 90% of developer "heads up" games have mixed or negative reviews on steam, they don't correct mistakes and won't listen to the community.

On the other, it often comes off as clumsy and the gameplay reflects roughly the same.  There are many times where luck is valued more than skill, so regular saves are a must.\n\nI still have fun with these titles, but only in small bursts. If you enjoy parody games and you’re willing to put up with some seriously clumsy, flimsy design, these games may be right for you.

The sequel is somehow more uninspired and monotonous than the original, and this time with the added thrill of bugs galore.  I consistently got stuck in combat because my character had no more action points left, but wasn't allowed to end his turn.  Saving and reloading fixes the problem (though you may have to do it 3-4 times before it works), so it's not a game breaker, but it's irritating.  Don't waste your time on this game.","December 27, 2013","false","20.0"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","1"

What the game lacks in quality and gameplay it tries to make in gags and details and story. I like the concept and could enjoy the game... if it would work for me.\n\nTurns out, many people have problems with bugs - pity there is no demo to try before buy. For me the game is unplayable, even restart from the beginning does not help. And the game is not SO good to justify hours spent on workarounds.","December 25, 2013","false","6.4"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","1"

Plenty of tranlations gone wrong or missing (this was coded with german text). AI of your companions get's them killed a lot as they walk ahead of you.\nLess skills and tactics compared to the first game.\nNot a bad game, but stays way behind it's potential and predecessor.","January 23, 2014","false","19.5"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

It is terrible.  In attempt to be humorous they took whatever "heart" the last game had and pooped all over it.  The end chapter is glitchy.  Artwork is improved music is somewhat improved.  They made some changes to leveling up and special abilities.  But.  Who cares.  Play the first one.  Don't bother with this one.","May 16, 2012","false","26.3"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"
