No realistic crap, no Call of Duty or Battlefield-type "take cover or die" realism.  This is a BALLS-OUT bad@ss old school FPS.  Did you like (the original) Wolfenstein, Doom, Quake, and Duke Nukem 3D?  If you answered yes to any of these: Buy ths game.  Now.\n\nNow to the uninformed, Serious Sam The First Encounter is a FPS bullet hell with swarms of enemies, no cover, but plenty of bombs.  Just collect guns and shoot, shoot, shoot!!!!  The physics are wonderful and the enemies look hideous and hilarious simultaneously.  Plenty of blood and guts, many enemies, and a ton of weapons (I forgot how many, I'm sure the store page says).\n\nAnd don't forget Sam Stone's comments.  I think he was Duke Nukem's cousin.  Maybe nephew.  Maybe both.\n\nA+ in my book.  I'm a fan of old school bad@ssery, but if you're not, the game may not be for you.

Pure 100% action packed mother♥♥♥♥ing balls to the ♥♥♥♥ing wall holy ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm getting my ♥♥♥ kicked fun.\n\nWhat is Serious Sam The First Encounter? It's an old-school First Person Shooter, you shoot things, pretty simple stuff, right? Well, the thing about Serious Sam is that it does it so well, all you really need in a game like this is shooting. None of that modern military shooter garbage where it pretends to be "realistic" or "tactical" and it takes itself too seriously. Ironically, Serious Sam doesn't take itself seriously at all, it's fairly ridiculous actually. Non of that two weapon limit crap and health regeneration that seems to be the norm nowadays, this game is seriously bat-♥♥♥♥ insane cranked up to eleven.\n\nSo why is the game so good? It's fun, for one thing. It's you against a horde of enemies, you shoot everything that moves and it's extremely satisfying to do so. You have a wide arsenal of weapons to help you take on the extreme amounts of enemies flying at you constantly. Each weapon is so finely crafted and balanced to suit each situation in the game and you'll learn over time to know what weapon to use when and on what enemies. You can't just stick with the same weapon because you also have to worry about ammo conservation and it might not work as well as other weapons depending on what situation you're in. You'll slowly but surely adapt to the idea of switching weapons constantly and you better, or you'll get your ♥♥♥ kicked.\n\nThe insane variety of weapons you get is ludicrous, and you can carry them all at once. You got your shotguns, minigun, rocket and grenade launchers, laser gun, ♥♥♥♥ING CANNON and more. The game also gives you these weapons at a nice pace as you progress through the game. You'll need every single weapon because this game isn't easy, you will always be attacked by tons of enemies and you'll need to use whatever you have. As for the enemies, there's a very large variety of them as well, and some of the enemy designs are fairly amusing; like headless screaming suicide bombers called "Kamikazes", scorpions with chainguns, reptilian creatures that throw homing balls at you and many more.\n\nThe level design is nothing more than serviceable, which isn't a bad thing, it does its job, the enemy placement is occasionally very well and the game has nice pacing. You can also look for secrets which are fairly well placed actually, secrets help you out by rewarding your exploration with health and ammo. But what I like about the level design the most is that it isn't the maze-like level design of some other old-school and classic FPSs, THANK GOD (yeah, I'm talking to you, Doom 2!). All I want in a game like this is to shoot the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of everything that moves and I don't want to spend time figuring out where I'm supposed to go. Occasionally mid-way or at the end of a level you'll be fighting a boss, and these aren't just bosses, they're the size of a building, they're massive and very fun to fight, some of which you will later encounter as regular enemies once you've defeated them.\n\nThe game also has a storyline, rather forgettable and it's nothing more than a setting for the game but the intro to the game sums it up very nicely. Humankind uncovers some advanced technology from another race, eventually they are attacked by aliens and at the point of being entirely doomed, they send Sam "Serious" Stone, a hero wounded countless times but never defeated, through an artifact called "The Time Lock"; which has the power to send a single person back in time, so Sam is sent thousands of years back in time when humankind had a fighting chance to defeat Mental, the evil bad guy who is responsible for all this mess; and thus Sam fights his way through Mental's horde and whatnot. The Protagonist is likeable and quite awesome though.\n\nThe game also has multiplayer. STAY FAR AWAY, besides the fact that the multiplayer is dead, deathmatch is so incredibly unbalanced and pointless. There's also co-op, and it's up to 16 players which is kind of awesome but in my opinion, this game shines the most in singleplayer.\n\nIt's also not a bad looker, while the graphical fidelity isn't incredible, it still has some nice textures and shadow effects, modeling is good but the animations are a bit meh. The game is also very colorful, even though it takes place in Egypt which is always great. Also, the soundtrack is fantastic, it fits the game very well. I also have to mention the excellent sound design in this game. If you listen closely, you can hear the enemies that you are about to encounter and each enemy has its own sound, so you know what to prepare for when you're about to enter a new area or a room. And when you are surrounded by enemies, you'll know which direction they are coming from because you can hear them very well no matter which direction (if you're using headphones, of course).\n\nIn conclusion, if you're into the golden age of FPS, then you've probably already played this game, if you haven't though; definitely be sure to give it a try. I'd go as far as to say that this is probably the best game to start with for people new to the FPS genre. And as a remake, this is just as good if not better than the original version.","October 25, 2014","true","20.1"," 53 of 56 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","53","56","3","0"

Having never played the original off which this re-skin is based I though why not try something old-school when I saw this included in the Serious Sam bundle deal during sale time (although to be perfectly honest I was never much into FPS even when they were old-school). This HD remake gives the visuals a pleasant modern day look as we venture forth with the wisecracking Sam as he tries to annihilate the alien invasion single-handedly whose sole purpose for coming to planet Earth is for the extinction of humanity.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346517497\nI found the game to be rather fun for the first few levels but then it just got insanely difficult as more and more enemies re-spawned making it rather difficult to make steady progress. This rinse and repeat style of gameplay eventually had me pretty bored to tears to be totally honest (one can only take so many assaults before it becomes passé) and deep frustration began to settle in. That is until I decided to cheat just to get to the end of the game as I was fast approaching a point of just giving up on the title completely.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346517782\nIf you like your old-school first person shooters this should be right up your alley (and add + 2 to the score of course) but for those not so ingrained in the genre be prepared for some annoyances. I recommend it lightly and for those with a curiosity in some on-the-rails fun to keep an eye out for it when it comes on sale as you can usually get quite the nice bundle deal with more than just this game attached to it.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","May 3, 2014","true","10.7"," 63 of 82 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","63","82","0","4"

The result was Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter, which also marked the debut of third Serious Engine. (Apparently they wanted to erase the memory of SS2 so much that they released the remake before Serious Sam 3: BFE was finished.)\n\nThe finished product is mostly just a facelift on the original game, where the goal is still the same: use shotguns, rockets, cannons, and everything else in the vast arsenal to kill your way through a seemingly never-ending flood of monsters in ancient Egypt, all in order to stop an alien warlord called Mental before he eradicates humanity in the far future. All while finding silly little secrets and listening to the corniest one-liners any action hero ever spoken.\nThere are a few minor tweaks here and there: some new level secrets, rebalanced difficulty (easiest settings don’t reduce enemy health that much), and a few modified enemy spawn compositions or locations. They are not too large to make new players feel they don’t get the original experience, but enough to give something even for the veterans.\n\nThe graphical update is surprisingly humble. CroTeam touched the levels with respect, only making sure they were up to 2009’s standards, without adding unnecessary effects or any flashy things. This may come off as bad news for those who are used to FPS games being all about grandiose visuals and on-rails gameplay, but great news for those who want to know what makes these games so good but don’t want to go old-school in the graphical department.","January 25","true","16.3"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","24","27","2","0"

Easily one of my favorite FPS from the Quake era.  Maybe it has something to do with its large single player maps and it's Ancient Egypt theme. This is a very pretty HD remake and I can't wait to play through it again on modern hardware.  When it was first released in 2001 the whole community was sort of in awe at how such a good looking game (at the time) was priced at only $20...well, at least I was.  While Quake was headed in the Arena direction, Sam stayed true to the single player experience.  Secrets scattered throughout all the levels, hordes of monsters spawning in front of you, and lots of tongue in cheek humor.

They are very good games, especial from an independent gaming company. When I heard that my original favorites were coming back, but with improved graphics, I was happy! The game play is mostly the same, there are a few changes to enemy AI, cut scenes, and weapons, some are good, but some are disappointing. It has the same weapons, enemies, and music and sound effects!\n\nOverall, I think the Second Encounter of the HD versions is a better choice, because it contains the First Encounter in it as well, you just don't see the intro, which is a little important if you want to follow the storyline.

This first person shooter is based in the future where the world is about to be destroyed by the monster Mental. All hope is lost until we discover that the way to defeat these monsters can be traced from our past. Further research reveals that humanity has discovered an ancient race the Sirians who had also fought and lost to Mental's might. Humanity finds the ancient Sirian technology known as the Time-Lock which can allow one person to traverse time and space. Our protagonist Sam, who may be very serious, is a champion, a hero, and a legend for humanity. Fighting off every alien he encounters to the end Sam, a true warrior, is given the ultimate task. To use the Time-Lock to travel back in time and to defeat Mental while he is busy dealing with the Sirians.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nSerious Sam is revitalized in HD with a stunning thirteen levels (plus an additional two secret levels) digitally remastered and designed to meet the demand of modern day consumers. The graphics are not going to be anything like your blockbuster games, but that’s because the original was produced in 2001 and this is just a remastering. But the game looks rather clean and plays incredibly well. This game not only has secret levels, but is filled with little secrets for the avid gamer. Mysteries abound and things to find Serious Sam leaves you without want.\n\nResult:\nI played Serious Sam: The First Encounter only a little bit when it was released in 2001. Then purchased it recently because it was on sale. Not being an avid fan of the series I can definitely say this game is a fun purchase even if you never really played the original. There are an abundance of crazy enemies, a wacky story (that makes you keep wondering where all the humans are), awesome weapons, fun boss fights, and lots of crazy items. This game not only challenges you in combat making you feel like a hero, but also puts you to the test by throwing puzzles all over the place. The game requires you to solve puzzles, complete challenges, and defeat enemies in order to progress. The levels are long, the campaign is long, the game is a blast, it’s a must buy. If you like puzzles, you like first person shooters, you want nostalgia, or you just like to be a hero then this is the game for you.\n\nPros:\n+Incredibly fast paced combat\n+Puzzles in every level\n+Secret levels and many secrets within each level.\n+Lots of fun an interesting enemies\n+An abundance of bosses\n+Crazy amount of fun weapons to shoot about\n+Digitally remastered and in 1080p\n+Fun and gripping story that mixes reality with fantasy\n\nCons:\n-There is a limit to the amount fo auto-saves, you will lose older auto-saves in order for new ones to save, but don't worry you can just continually make saves yourself (I had over 200 by the end of the campaign).\n-The sensitivity can randomly spark (meaning it just shoots up and your character can suddenly turn with only the slightest mouse movement facing you the wrong way).","March 3, 2014","true","21.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Things can get rather hectic when you get further into the game with all kinds of different enemies swarming after you but with the wide array of weapons you have available, you'll be able to smash through them with no problems.\n\nMy favourite weapon has to be the Canon, you literally fire a huge canon ball and it just wrecks anything and everything in its path. There is a co-op option available, as well as high scores on each level which makes the longevity of this title larger than most.\n\nDefinitely one of my favourites now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cream-of-Plenty/recommended/41000/","Cream-of-Plenty","Cream-of-Plenty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cream-of-Plenty/","187 products in account","DISCLAIMER:  I played Serious Sam HD: TFE inside of Serious Sam HD: TSE, so I've logged more time than Steam would suggest.\n\nThe first two Serious Sam games were pretty novel when they were first released.  As Sam, players ran through massive levels, fighting similarly massive groups of (often massive) enemies.  It wasn't exactly the most radical idea on paper, but it was executed on a  scale that was previously unheard of in FPS games.  Levels often had over a thousand enemies, with fights pitting hundreds of opponents against the player simultaneously; a few enemies were even larger than entire maps in other FPS games.\n\nSince then, several of the games Serious Sam has (inevitably) been compared to have caught up to Sam's scope--for instance, there are countless Doom "slaughter" WADs that will throw hundreds or thousands of enemies at you.  But whereas most of Doom's arsenal was never really intended to contend with thousands of enemies, Sam's was built from the ground up with mass extinction in mind, and its bestiary was designed for enormous arena battles.\n\nWeapons are your primary means of interacting with the world in an FPS and, in the case of Serious Sam, the arsenal is especially rock solid.  You begin with the typical pistol(s) and combat knife, but it isn't long before you're fielding double-barreled shotguns, miniguns, laser rifles, and even an enormous cannon.  Virtually every firearm fills a niche and will find ample usage--especially on higher difficulties.  Rockets might travel further to snipe distant stationary targets, but the grenade launcher can charge up significantly faster projectiles and shoot around corners; the laser gun doles out tremendous damage up front, but its projectiles take time to travel through the air; the minigun's hitscan shots can mow down faraway crowds, but its ever-so-slight wind-up is a liability in close quarters.\n\nThe guns generally feel great to use, as well.  With an appropriate thunderclap, the double-barreled shotgun reduces Kleer to bone fragments; the SBC Cannon's VW Bug-sized shots blast through enemies like so many bowling pins and wipe swathes of the battlefield clean.\n\nEnemies are well-designed, too.  Unlike later installments in the Serious Sam series, TFE and TSE don't make the mistake of having numerous hitscan enemies.  Rather, most opponents produce a variety of physical projectiles--some follow you, some scatter, some cut through the air in small volleys, and some lazily fly towards their target--that can be seen and dodged.  That one factor is crucial because it means that dodging can keep you alive even when fighting a hundred foes.  Indeed, Serious Sam almost feels like a sort of "bullethell"-FPS at times, and by encouraging fancy footwork over taking cover, the game maintains a higher degree of momentum than many modern FPS games.  The sheer variety of enemies can be a refreshing change of pace from the standard/heavy/sniper trifecta that so many FPS games like to focus on nowadays.\n\nThen there are the levels:  They're huge, and they're especially gorgeous in the HD versions.  While TFE focuses exclusively on an Egyptian-themed mapset, it still includes some beautful setpieces including sprawling palaces, moody moonlit stretches, and Oases.  It certainly doesn't hold a candle to TSE's greater variety, but it does its best.  The maps are packed full of secrets--some obvious and some devious--as well as easter eggs and entire hidden levels.  If you're a completionist, be prepared to spend a lot of time hunting down some of these secrets.\n\nGiven the size and scale of eveything, one of Serious Sam's biggest selling points is (perhaps unsurprsingly) its co-op support.  Up to 16 players can take on the campaign(s) in TFE and TSE, with a wide variety of player skins to choose from.  You've never really experienced everything a classic FPS has to offer until you're bunnyhopping across massive sand dunes, gunning down waves with half a dozen other players who look like cyborgs, neon cowboys, and Santa Claus.  In fact, there are several different co-op modes including a "Coin-Op Co-Op" arcade-style points/lives system that helps strike a nice balance between players having infinite lives and the level being over for a player the moment they die.\n\nHonestly, I played countless hours of the original TFE and TSE years ago and I still feel that I got my money's worth with the HD remakes.  While they run on earlier versions of the Serious Sam 3 engine than Serious Sam: BFE, they're still perfectly capable of squeezing out some fantastic graphics.  And if you're planning to run TFE HD on an older computer, the sheer number of graphics options will let you tweak everything until it's just right.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd happily recommend TFE HD to anybody who has enjoyed Serious Sam in the past, who is interested in taking a breather from modern FPS's, or who is simply interested in exploring what is now widely considered a "Classic FPS".","April 14","true","13.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","11","11","3","6"

Serious Sam First Encounter HD will be a good buy for both new players wondering what the deal is with this thing and why everyone likes it, and the older gamers who remember the originals. It is as true to the original as it can get, with a few improvements.\n\nStorywise, it's nothing to write home over. It's a fairly standard story for a game that relies more on its gameplay than on captivating you with word words and more words. Aliens happened, they're after you, you're in acient Egypt and you have guns. Good luck!\nThere is more to it, if you take the time to read into the story there are just enough flavourful blurbs and explanations around that you can read to figure out where your enemies came from, and parts of the storyline, though it isn't something that will carry you through the game, it's more like an extra.\nThe true power of Serious Sam is in the gameplay, with excellent level design, guns that are satisfying to use, and a very high skill ceiling allowing you to feel like a god laying down devastation on hordes of enemies, moving fast enough to dodge almost all of their fire (Since all but a few enemies use projectiles, this means you can dodge nearly everything with enough practice) yet not too fast to become unmanagable. This, along with plentiful secrets, and a game that won't just say 'no' and throw up an invisible wall if you move slighly off the beaten path means that Serious Sam has an excellent grasp the concept of what great games are about- Freedom\n\nFreedom to choose your own tactics (And most are valid as well! No need to gimp yourself)\nFreedom to move as you please\nFreedom to explore the levels and find all the secrets\nAnd the freedom to handle any encounter in the way you want to.\n\nAlong with this, Egypt as pictured is a somewhat unique setting for an FPS game, with a lot of it lending itself for interesting levels and impressive scenery. The enemies you face are unique and mostly iconic as well, with the beheaded bomber and kleer skeleton being some of the more known enemies. In addition, Serious Sam has a great sense of humour, and you can play with a friend, two friends, or a whole army of friends.\n\nIf you're interested in a great FPS game, this is a game for you.","January 26, 2015","true","7.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

One of the original kings of the FPS genre, Serious Sam does a lot of things right, with a few things wrong, and suffers a tad from being a bit of an old title.\n\nOn the upside, the map sizes in this game are huge, providing a great open-world, fast-paced FPS adventure.  The voice-acting is nicely done with the expected humour and satirical remarks.  The design and layout of the levels are great, and very well-planned and make the game flow very well, but the downside to this game thing, is that if you manage to play for a long stint of time, the game manages to blend it's levels together and it starts to feel a little stale.\n\nNothing about this game is really amazing or innovative compared to todays FPS games, but it does manage to create an atmosphere of non-stop action from start to finish.  There's always something to shoot around every corner, some new tactic to come up with, new enemies to fight and new weapons to pick up.  The old-school secret areas are also a great touch to the game providing secret weapons, armor, health pickups or maybe getting a weapon earlier than you would otherwise.\n\nThe boss fights are pretty fun and in general the game is still really fun, the added benefit of the HD remaster in graphical fidelity and a few new features (autosave, etc...) really gets Sam back in the game.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes new or old FPS games, just give it a try, you might like it.","October 29, 2015","true","6.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/41000/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a remake of Serious Sam: The First Encounter, as you could guess. It was released in 2009 by Croteam and was also known as the first game to use Serious Engine 3. And yep, as serious as ever.\nIt also came out on X360 through Xbox Live service. The only difference that I am aware of is that it had multiplayer only up to 4 players and aim assist.\n\nMultiplayer community seems to be dead. Okay, maybe not completely, I did get into some match once at one day. But in other times server list is completely empty. And it makes sense, since Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter has Fusion feature which means that owners of SSHD:TFE get to have Egypt levels to be ported into that game. So instead most of people play in SSHD:TSE.\n\nPremise of original Serious Sam is that Sam Stone is sent into past into Egypt to try to stop the Mental forces before they destroy the Earth. And to do this he would need to pass many levels that have sections designed to serve as arenas to lock players inside. You didn't have as much exploration as in Doom or whatever Quake clone game. Instead it was more focused in pacing and tactical choices during combat itself, with encounters lasting few waves, as enemies keep pressuring you to move around. There were a lot of different enemy types and you had a lot of different specialized weapons, so you would have to choose correct gun for each sitatuation, prioritize targets and avoid all the different attacks. It's a classic!\n\nHD is surprisingly faithful to the original. I kinda expected it to change a lot of core gameplay, but Croteam is just a honest indie company and gave a game just a nice graphics upgrade. Gameplay is almost same and the awesome soundtrack is completely identical. It's quite nice! And yep, even included Karnak from demo version, just like original. No technology test though.\n\nAnd yea, it looks excellent, with much more natural looking desert and canyons. And if you take a careful look then you will see that some details that was just part of texture is now actual geometry, for example. Though, environment feels not fully finished, as inner places didn't get any additional details and some models seemed to have same textures quality, like statues, despite having more destruction phases. Just good nice new rendering with new light. Though I do wonder about some changes. For example, Alley of Spinxh levels is always at night and the third level of tomb has a fog changed from nice blue color to some dusty brown. As if Egypt doesn't have enough brown color with all sand.\n\nBut hey, look at all those great shiny weapons. And look at all the remade enemy models, now with ragdolls. Gore and weapons effects just got sexier, as you can now even gib part of enemies bodies, dismembering them, splitting apart, blowing head off with shotgun. It's awesome. Just look at the bull's death, where it would still slide around after being shot, leaving a trail of blood! And heavier enemies now can even be gibbed with a cannon, the heaviest weapon you have. The only strange thing is that Skeleton Kleers and Harpies are always gibbed upon death. For skeletons it looks good. But for harpies it looks strange, even gibs looks like just a few tiny chunks.\n\nIt also got some nice editing on gameplay. Some beheaded have a saw on their heads, giving them a melee attack. Bomberman looks fancy with that head on a spike, even. And heavy biomechanoids only shoot a single rocket when close to player, to let him have it easier, while it almost always was a certain death being very close to one in original. Kamikazes also seem to have smaller radius of explosion too. Flying gnaars seem to be more dangerous, not stopping when attacking. And weapons switch was made faster, which I approve. Though for some reason you can't walk anymore. Not that it ever was needed, just fancy.\nIf there is one thing I am most thankful the most is that new Netricsa messages notification is put somewhere to the side of a screen and doesn't grab your attention so you can ignore it easily. It was freaking annoying to be visually nagged by it everytime I killed each enemy types while playing custom maps in original.\n\nThough, not everything is going perfect and some cuts had to be made. Most noticeably is that some of obscure engine features of Serious Engine 1 weren't implented in Serious Engine 3. Due to this, all the gravity-changing shenagians had to be cut. To be honest, I don't miss them too much, in Serious Sam 1 they were used only as funny thing in a bunch of a secrets, plus once non-secret usage in a secret level. It probably costed more time to reimplent them for something so small. I mean, at least when Croteam was making the first Serious Sam they had plans to make it much bigger game, with futurustic levels which would abuse gravity features. Once they cut it all to be Egypt-only, well, it was pretty much funky leftover.\nIt also doesn't have mirror and sliding surface, which I remember used only once.\n\nThey also seemed to screw up weapon balance slightly. You see, minigun was made to shoot two times slower, but each bullet does two times damage and is supposed to consume two ammo. But it only consumes one. Result: There is no more reason to use Thompson and you effectively have two times more ammo for minigun than in original. Oh well.\nBut hey, at least Laser gun isn't glitched in HD. It would sometimes start shooting only at half-speed in original. So flaw taken, flaw given.\n\nAnd multiplayer is still awesome. Didn't get to cooperative, but I bet it's same spam, with same cutscene-skipping. And competetive part is awesome, still fast-paced. Although I noticed that rocket-jumping got nerfed and jumping off the slope doesn't give you additional height. But you are supposed to use knife to run fast and it still gets you in many places. And yep, still awesome arena-shooter which proves that you don't need some fancy strafejumping to be balanced and fast-paced.\nOh yea, and double shotgun in original was shooting at double speed. In HD it's same as in single-player/coop. Not sure what I think of it, but I think I like it this way. But maybe I need more experience with both ways.\n\nOh yea, and did you know that original The First Encounter was particulary embaressing due to having only a single DM level? Thankfully, HD added a bunch of them, even including Little Trouble from The Second Encounter. Hm, though HD multiplayer doesn't have scorematch mode, only fragmatch. But no one, absolutely no one, was playing scorematch in original anyway, so nah.\n\nOverall, not perfect, but damn excellent HD remake with a bit of balance editing, untouched core gameplay, some environment upgrade and great gore system.\nAnd yes, those who want to play Egypt levels in Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter have to have this game purchased.","April 16","true","16.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Serious Sam HD looks as good as the original did when it came out, but with modern graphics and standards. The gameplay is unchanged and as fun as ever.\n\nFor anybody unfamiliar with Serious Sam, this game is anything but serious. There is pretty much no dialogue and a bare minimum plot. But that's because this is a classic FPS when games involved a character running around with more firepower than an Armored Tank Division. Blast your way through crazy enemies with bullets, lasers, rockets, and...cannon balls.\n\nOne of the highlights of this game is the massive environment. While some maps are contained to the insides of buildings, lots of the game takes place outside in the deserts of Egypt and the maps are impressive. Not because there's a whole lot to see when running around a desert, but rather there's something majestic and awe inspiring to crest a dune and see a massive, ancient Egyptian city sprawled out before you.\n\nThis is a run and gun masterpiece and worth every penny.","May 8","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a lot about quick decisions, rather than pure endurance and conservation, which helps with the afore-mentionned frantic flow of the series.

Updated graphics, fun co-op, and a budget price tag join together to put this on any shooter fan's wish list.'\n\n'If you're looking to revisit the Serious Sam franchise, or looking to add to your collection, or even if you've never played it before in your life, it's hard not to recommend Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter.'\n\n'Eight years later, with the modern FPS riddled with faux-military obsessions and regenerating health, the game still feels reassuringly nostalgic. It's just a shame we weren't given a little bit more. With Serious Sam HD, Croteam prove it's possible to remake them just like they used to.'\n\n'Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a great purchase for both fans of the series and newcomers. Those who have grown up on modern shooters may find the primitive design and simplistic objectives a bit jarring, but the purity of the gameplay simply has to be respected.'","July 10, 2014","true","41.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This version has better graphics, and better yet, they didn't change a SINGLE thing that is important to the story.\n\nThis game has great weapons, great enemies, and when playing it, you will get great fun out of it.\n\nIt's even better if you play it with your friends: I picked up a 4 pack of the game for only €4,50 on the Steam Exploration Sale! If you can, buy this game for your friends, or convince your friends to buy this.\n\nThere's also a sequel to that: I don't have it on Steam, but I've played it.

What can I say? It's actually the follow-on story to Serious Sam 3!! This story starts exactly where 3 left off . Despite it's age, the game is pretty good! Graphics aren’t bad and the gameplay is lots of fun. Since this game came first, you can hardly criticise it for being too similar to Serious Sam 3, but I would definitely play Serious Sam 3 first. Not only will the story make more sense, but you might find those similarities make 3 a little dull. That would be a shame since 3 is definitely the better game. Anyway, this one is well worth the money. It’s an old-school shooter that fast and furious and lots of fun.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA — Beheaded Kamikaze screaming for no reason (Beheaded Kamikaze Reference) and die horribly violent death by killing yourself. How in hell do those Beheaded Kamikaze Bombers are able to scream without a head it's a paradox I say a Paradox, in reality don't think to hard or you'll find out the hard way what happens of thinking the unthinkble. In truth this is fun game and no kidding it is hard even when the difficulty setting is set pretty low mostly due to being bombarded by enemies after enemies. It’s nice seeing an old classic game become remastered but that is what a lot newer games are becoming nowadays remasters and remasters of 3 or 4 year old games which is pretty foolish and only made for quick and easy cash grab by greedy A-holes. This game has several weapons to choose from and variety of enemies to fight. It’s not a Call of Duty clone it’s more homage to old classics like Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein that pioneered the FPS genre in the first place. You may love it or hate it, but considering there’s just not many games made like this anymore.

There is a story to all that, but the game knows that who ever is playing it, wouldn't give a ♥♥♥♥. Well balanced enemies and near perfect weaponry. This game will have you juggling your weapons with skill, and dancing with monsters. Narowly avoid getting hit by missles by the skin of your teeth, then swith out your rocket launcher and blast the big dudes in style, while having enough time to finish the rest of the horde with your minigun. I'm talking a billion different monsters coming to get you all at once, ranging from 5ft to 500ft, no cover to hide behind, and a dozen different guns to use at your disposal. This is a game! Not any where will it give you onscreen instructions to hit a series of buttons in order to progress. It doesn't waist your time with having any award winning writers coming up some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story for the sake of having a sensible reason to things. This is for those who've spent countless hours on DOOM II, or spent there entire weekend allowance in the arcade. But, in all farness, the only real downside I have to say about this game is that it's basic gameplay may seem not quite as ingaging after a long period of time.

Gameplay, its a old school arena shooter, you go to a big area, and swarms of aliens, zombies and other stuff swarm in to kill you. Youre weapons are standard 90s FPS weapons, Shotgu, Lazer gun, minigun, rocket launcher and other awesome weapons. The canon is awesome, it shoots a giant canon ball that rolls over bad guys, its the "BFG" of the game. now lets talk about the graphics, this is the HD remake and wow, this game looks amazing. everything cranked up and they game looks almost photo-realistic. If i could find i con i really cant, maybe just some cheap moments here and there but in general i really cant. Now this is HARD, seriously (Badoom-tis) you want to punch your monitor sometimes, but after playing throught it 2 or so times, i've gotten good. Over Serious Sam Is Awesome Game, If you dont have a PC that can run this then get "Serious Sam Classics: Revolution" its the original games combined in one game with widescreen support.

The one that takes what we see in most AAA games, like stealth and support characters, and tosses it out the window. It's a game you play when you just feel like massacering every living thing in sight. It's a very difficult game though, but it's what makes it more unique. However, it's gameplay is only hard because the game only sends the same units over and over in massive waves at you. The only reason it's hard is because it's difficult to avoid attacks when you're being hit from every possible direction.\n\nPros:\nOld fasion gameplay\nQuick to learn to play\nHD version has multiplayer and co-op campain up to 16 players\nInteresting weapons and enemys\nGood boss fights\n\nCons:\nVERY repetative gameplay, you'll get bored within an hour\nMaps aren't very intereting\nCopy/pasted areanas\nNot a lot of aesthetics, very dull and bland looks to the maps.\nThe same enemy, the Kleer Skeleton, is going to make up about 50% of your deaths.\n\nI give it about 7/10, passable, but wait until it's on a sale, and get some friends to play the game with you.","December 26, 2013","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The action is really fun, but keep in mind that this game has non existant single player mode, if you want to play single player you have to buy the 2nd encounter which i also have it and its amazing too. Lastly, this game is mostly about multiplayer where there are 2 modes co-op and deathmatch which both are really fun.\n\nP.S- in the 2nd encounter, the multi player is inactive, noone plays it.\nI recommend this, along with the 2nd encounter.","May 9","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The HD graphics look great, but there are many areas too big for nothing, so they look rather plain, and travelling across them is a pain, taking too much time. The story could have been better told in cinematic form rather than a large paragraph of text.\n\nI know this is an old game, but this was my personal opinion. It is a rather good game for an old one.\n\nMy Rating: 6/10\n\nIf you love old-school shooters, then this is definitely 9/10 for you.","January 13, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I swear it's like someone put something like this to try and force competition with everyone. I really don't see any story or why people seem to love this game so much.\n\nUpdate: going back and accepting I don't have the mad (or Serious) reflexes needed for this game I lowered the difficult from Serious and found I had a lot more fun with it and have advanced through many different temple stages, though difficulty still amps up quite high, especially with Kamakazis attacking you!\n\nHonestly though, this game is pure gold. I love it's humor, I love how it's never static where creatures spawn. If you try being smart like I try to be, you get attacked by that damn Kamakazis so I suggest headphones or decent speakers as you will need to listen for the "AAAAAHHHHH" before it's too late and you get blown to peices.\n\nThere are many things to love about this game with it's design and the design of some of the strange otherworldly creatures who see you as an immediate threat and attack you in their own ways, the monster logs making this more fun to learn about these creatures and where they come from.\n\nI highly recommend it to anyone who wants to play an old-school FPS. No school like the old school with FPSs imo. Especially on the PC where we've had classics like Doom and Wolfenstein back in the day that invented the genre.","August 31, 2013","true","4.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

However, this game has already earned a review in my opinion.\n\nAt first, I was not very impressed, and saw this as a fairly mediocre game. Simple enemies, not a whole lot going on, boring maps, and some okay-ish weapons. I was considering quitting there and just never going back.\n\nI am glad I didn't do this, however, and instead pushed on past the first few levels to find a very enjoyable experience. This game offers a challenge, while giving you the chance to massacre entire hordes of enemies at the same time. Going from a mediocre toss away, to a very entertaining barrage of gunfire.\n\nIs this game for everyone? No, I can easily see that there are things that would turn away most people, especially those that seek a truly realistic game. This game is not realistic whatsoever. This is a game where you can run around with a Thomspon that never has to reload, with 1,000 rounds, and just unload on everything in sight, while taking missiles and bombs to the head, without a care in the world, because you're some random guy in a T-shirt who decided one day that he felt like slaughtering an alien invasion.\n\nNone of the weapons in this game seem to be better than the others, each one has a purpose, and fits a different playstyle. Which adds a lot of fun to the game, as you experiment with different weapons, or combos, on different enemies, to find out what your favorite way of doing things is.\n\nIf you like games where it's all about the fun of shooting the heck out of everything in sight just because you can, and love the old school shooter style, BUY THIS GAME.\n\nIf you like games that focus on realism and dying after just a few hits, you may or may not like this game, but it'd be worth a try just to see if you like it.","June 11, 2014","true","7.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

If I didn't know it, I'd say my enemies were flat. (That's a good thing, trust me.)\n+Runs 60 FPS on every system I've tested on, no matter what the graphics settings were\n+Lots of customization in settings (Basically, you have the options to change what color/kind of blood you see, and how the atmosphere of the game looks like.)\n+Database system encourages researching enemies, and quickly identifies the foe you are fighting\n\nx Level design, it can be really good at times (Puzzles, mild parkour), but otherwise, it's straight and forward or it's an arena\nx Lots of difficulty settings, but they feel really poorly designed (I'm playing at normal, and it seems way harder than normal. I've played easy, and it's way too easy. There's at least 6 different difficulty setings. :B)\nx Saving! You can save, great right! Not really. So, in the game, you can press F6 to quickly save your game. Otherwise, if you die, you are set back to the start of the level. This sucks when you forget to save or are too busy getting blown up to save.\nx Sound quality. First off, Sam is hilarious. He says some super-generic puns that'd you'd expect from a cheesy action movie or Duke Nukem. But, the enemies sounds... Well, you got the Kamikaze who screams his a** off when he charges, Scorpion bosses sound like someone taking a sh**, and the Bone Horse-thingies are too loud. The game's music isn't that great, but you can't really mute it, because sounds play such an important role in knowing when you're going to be attacked\n\n-SUPER REPETITIVE, I kid you not. Combat doesn't change, it just gets harder because the enemies have more health, fire more bullets, or are more plenty in numbers. The combat is basically just jumping and shooting, avoiding enemy charges, or tearing down hoardes.\n-LEVEL DESIGN! (I know I said this already, but...) There's this one level that was just agony. You start off with your pistols and shotgun (Only the shotgun does good damage) and you have to go into a large field with enemies. Once you kill them all, you have to fight another wave. Then, another wave of harder enemies come. Then , you fight a boss. Then, another boss, and then another, much larger boss. Again, this all takes place in the SAME FIELD.\n-Plot doesn't justify the game. Why am I fighting? How did I get here? Why are these enemies spawning? Why are there so many? Why do they look the same? What am I looking for? Isn't there a much easier way? What do you mean I have to read about it? It'd be so much easier to explain if it took place in hell.\n\nIN CONCLUSION[/b]\n-Well worth the $1.50 I paid for both of the games\n-A lot like old games like DOOM or the original Serious Sam\n-You could probably get much more enjoyment from another game, but this game does have its perks\n-I'd say it's NOT worth the Steam price (14.99 for the first game, 30.00 for both.)\n-Good if you're looking for an easy-to-run game to pass the time","February 6, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

New levels have been added and technically a new weapon, The Grenade Launcher, but this weapon was originally featured in Serious Sam: The Second Encounter.\n\nThe Graphics have been enhanced to a certain degree that someone new to the Serious Sam franchise will be able to jump right into it. Basically everything in game received the HD treatment, Weapon texturing and enemy texturing has vastly improved. Sound effects and music are pretty much still the same however.\n\nGameplay is pretty much identical to the original iteration so nothing much has changed. However this comes to the first part that REALLY gets on my nerves with this game. Enemy spawns are damn near AWFUL. I lost count of how many times I died due to a Kamikaze spawning literally right on top of me. Enemy placement sometimes getting downright frustrating at times with for example Kleer Skeletons basically camping doorways and you get double "clawed" from two angles getting heavily damaged if not outright killed from such a attack. "Trap" Enemies are usually the work of lazy map designers. This same trap rule has been applied to ammo and health pickups as well adding on to the sentiment of being punished for picking up items which are supposed to help you.\n\nWhile the game was enjoyable there are many aspects which make it feel cheap and lazy. My recommendation is to either stick with the Original games or get Serious Sam 3.\n\nFinal Score: 65/100","November 7, 2015","false","24.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","4"

You only have to kill, you can't level up, there is no sense of rewarded-challenge- The difficulty level increases as more and more mobs appear in specifically hard spots where, to aim, you have to ignore all the melee attackers and guess what? melee will continue spawning until you kill those big mobs far away.\n\nIts a thumbs up what they did with the graphics, but it sucks that mods usage doesnt count for challenges, for example, What would be the problem with my steam badges if i choose to play as a Patrick Star (SpongeBob friend) character?\n\nIn conclusion:\n-Play only with friends with microphone\n-Dont rush\n-Dont play the whole game in one stand (is even more boring)\n-Buy only if you like shooters\n-Its very repetitive, and gets harder each 100 meters you walk\n-You are going to die a lot of times\n-You are going to curse some challenges\n\nWould i recommend it?\nOnly if you have lots of friends with microphone playing it at the same time AND/OR if you played it as a kid and you plan to play it again.","May 26","false","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There some very intense moments as you go through the game but if you've already played through serious sam 3 like me, you should have no real problems. Still, a good game as a part of the franchise which is the reason I bought the whole pack in the first place.","September 5, 2014","true","10.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They also say the HD graphics really don't add much, and you'll soon get bored of looking at the shiny finish on things. They report it is buggy.\n\nNot one glitch/bug did I 'encounter'. The high definition (HD) graphics literally stun. Hours I added to playing time adoring the rich textures and details, and amazing places. Often (after action had stopped,) I would unexpectedly pause in my tracks, and gasp at the visuals. (Woah.)\n\nIf I still had the original games and played them over lots and recently, maybe then the experience might not work.  However I think I gave my original copies to a charity shop to sell, many years ago. The game was fresher, and more captivating than I ever remember, now sumptuous from HD look.\n\nI say it's twice the the game impact of the original, that reviewers say was great.

The HD remakes of the First and Second encounters are an excellent way to get into the series if you never played the original from 2001.\n\nDiverse enemies, fun weapons, and plenty of one-liners. As a big fan of ancient Egyptian history too, the maps are very cool to run around in. After all these years, I keep coming back because it is one of the few FPS to still give me a satisfying challenge on Serious difficulty.\n\nHighly recommended, especially if you can pick it up for cheap during a sale.","May 15, 2015","true","31.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So this isn't about the game's age. Problem is this game failed as a shoot'em up, because of shooting feel. It feels  exactly like virtua cop 2 (gamer dinosaurs unite!) which is a very bad thing about fps games(not for arcade games). Just click and shoot, you can't feel any thing (hit or being hit). Like shooting clouds. By the way, I can speak about other annoying things like spawning enemies, similar levels etc. But i don't, cause it's useless. Everything about single player is coming short. And i think the devs probably know that, cause above the %80 achievements are about multiplayer deatmatches. And guess what, multiplayer is dead. Surprise(?) i don't think so. Well for the final i can say, if you like this game (or nostalgia) and have friends like yourself, you can buy it (on sale of course).  Otherwise i don't recommed it, even on sale. Especially new players, look for other games friends, this game was all about hype and hype was dead long ago.","October 9, 2015","false","17.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

The game itself is amazing, with every minute being filled with non-stop action and shooting. Best part is, there are no objectives. 1 mission for every level: Make it to the end! Now i should note, if you want to start at the very beginning, play Serious Sam 3: BFE first, (BFE = Before first encounter).\n\nThe achievements in this game are insane, and serious dififculty almost made me ♥♥♥♥ing quit this game. Even on normal this game is tough as nails, but very fun and enjoyable. Another thing i love are the secrets. The secrets are so useful and cool, that even sometimes are surprising because of how much effort are put into 1 mesely secret. Now one of the BEST parts about this game are the enviorments. The grassy and sandy enviroments are so amazing, each level has its own unique enviorment, from sandy egypt-styled enviorments to grassy enviorments, the enivorments are one of my favorite parts about this game! Just look at these enviorments!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545805986\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545805953\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=545805998\n\nEspecialy in the later levels, like Metropolis City. Hell, even the Sewer level didnt fail to give me a damn good level design!\n\nThere are 13 levels, (15 including the 2 secret levels), and each level is filled with monsters to gib and kill! There are also a lot of puzzles in this game too, mostly levers, pressure pads, etc, but these puzzles give the game a bit more to offer than just killing enemies. The 2 secret levels can be unlocked by doing certain things, but im not telling you how! :3\n\nNow i must say, the game did give me some glitches, not game breaking glitches but otherwise minor glitches that were still noticable. I also thought that sometimes even on Normal that some parts seemed like i was playing on Serious, but then i remembered that this is an old school shooter, and that this is what an old school shooter is all about: Shooting and killing! Overall, Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a blast to play! I highly reccommend it to anyone who loves a great old school shooter!\n\n~~~\nFinal Verdict:\n\n8.5/10: Amazing!\n\n~~~","June 23, 2014","true","125.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenGuy/recommended/41000/","GoldenGuy","GoldeFish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenGuy/","253 products in account","NOTE: This game is FUN HOWEVER, I just don't recomend it to people like me, who are looking for a frantic single player experiance. Dang I wish Steam had a "MEH" buttonIs this game bad? NO\nIs this game great? NO\nIs this game heavily flawed? YES\nDo I recomend it? Eh... I am going to have to go with "NO"\n\nWelcome to the world of Serious Sam, a strange world where you goal is to kill anything that moves. Sound fun? It is! A ton of unique diverse levels for your crazy brain to plow through. Tons of enemies and great satisfying levels make for what should be a phenomenal game! Why isn't it then? Simply put the levels have some of the worst design choices I have ever seen in any game I have ever played. Sure some points the levels can be a blast, like the first half of City of Memphis - Metropolis where you have to go around a city styled maze and collect the 4 scarabs while avoiding the waves upon waves of different enemies that are searching for you in the maze, and City of Memphis - Sewers with some original designs and very generous enemy placements which make for a unique intense experience. However, 2 MAJOR flaws bring what should be a great game quickly down to some of my least favorite games of all time.\n\nFirst MAJOR FLAW: Unfair Padding/ Poor Level Design:\n\nRed signs of these problems start to appear however once you start playing the second half of the level City of Memphis - Metropolis, there is a pit with spikes with a chaingun that is supposed to spawn across from it to signify that you should go over there, although the first time I did it, it didn't spawn. A bull comes barreling across the pit and of course in classic game fashion it saves right as it is about to hit you giving you exactly 1 second to respond once you load up the save which is a whole different can of worms. Once you cross the pit you hear more bulls, a few dozen come flying at you and it shouldn't be a problem until those freaking skeleton running things come running at you and guess what... there are well over 100 of them. Earlier I did say how waves and waves can be fun... but only in well designed arenas like the one previously mentioned. However at this part it is just a straight hallway leading to a double door where they are spawning.They even continue to spawn even when you get on top of their spawn point making them practically impossible without rare or even unfair luck. Prior to this the level Oasis is entirely padding. From the first part of the level with the outside madness of hundreds to enemies to the "boss encounter". Why is it in quotes? Because, frogs... They decided that whenever creating a game, if you want to pad a level over 8 minutes without putting in any effort is spawn hundreds of small enemies that kill you easily inside a small square room. GENIOUS! It's not that I am against difficult games, because I am not (just look at my achievement list that includes Cave Story + Blood Stained Sanctuary which is one of the HARDEST levels in video game history). This happens more than once throughout each levels, some more then others which makes the game very hard to enjoy. From what it seems, they took a lot of time designed the first part of a level (excluding everything in Oasis) and then just decided "Man I took way to long on that level and it's not even up to the adverage length! Lets spawn 1000000 enemies!" which is most unfortinute.\n\nSecond MAJOR FLAW: Enemy Spawning\n\nAs I stated above briefly whenever you get near where an enemy spawns it does regardless, making for a practically instant death. An example is in Oasis in the first room you have the ability  to grab health on the edge of the valley. Once you get over there, enemies have the ability to spawn and can spawn directly on top of you which lead you directly to death. This happens a lot of the time in the game and really bogs down the experience.\n\nConclusion\nAnd those are my main problems with the game. Does it make it terrible? No. Does it make it unenjoyable in every sense of the word? Yes. Unfortunately what Croteam fails to see is that when designing a level one should design it well and not but one hallway with a few hundred of the same enemies spammed to be sure to kill you artificially lengthening the level, and expecting a player to know where an enemy spawns before it spawns which leads to an almost instant death is just cruel. I did finish the Demo Level on Hard difficulty and I had a blast. But I played on the 5th level of this game on Normal and I felt like I was being killed just for the sake of padding. Again, NORMAL what most people start playing a game on. Overall I recommend this game for friends. But as it stands this is one of the most unenjoyable single player experiences on Steam.\n\nPros:\n+ Fantastic graphical style\n+ Fun setting and level styles\n+ Fun and uniquely satisfying weapons\n+ Fun and diverse enemies\n+ Fantastic Multiplayer\n\nCons:\n+ Absolutely atrocious level design\n+ Abysmal enemy spawning mechanic\n+ Very Very Poor singleplayer experience leading to no fun at all.\n\nOverall: 5.8/10 "Major flaws that bring what should be a great game down low"","February 16, 2015","false","6.0"," 14 of 34 people (41%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","41","14","34","6","2"

The graphics might be higher rez but the models & environments are chunky and texture work is unimpressive. Gameplay is way too finicky and reminds me Duke Nukem where each level has to be played perfectly just to survive. The main reasons I liked Quake & DOOM was because of the great sense of speed and freedom of movement. Meanwhile, SS takes the complete opposite approach with you crawling through levels and spending the majority of the game backpedaling while holding down M1. Tedious gameplay, bland graphics & sound, and boring map & game design round out this unnecessary "remake".

Lag-stuttery performance because of either poor coding, poor optimization, or both. This game has one area, egypt, and the second encounter is the exact same game with egypt in it but also a few more areas, so I basically got ripped off and did not need to buy the first encounter because it is useless. $2.50 wasted. Only a cult set of people enjoyed these turds back when they came out long ago and nowadays nobody really cares about them and for good reason. Giant, open, lifeless, contentless, boring, repeating, ugly, lonely levels are each entirely the same color (tan or green or whatever) with a few props and of course thousands of boring enemies with poor shooting mechanics from seemingly 1992. It is too bad the cool art direction of the enemies could not have been used for a better game because a few of the enemies are pretty cool.\n\nTake Doom, Quake, and Half-Life, take away every single thing that made them all so great, and you have this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ garbage of a game. One of the most generic, watered down fps games I've ever seen. It is not fun.\n\nThe weird thing is that the only decent game out of them all is Serious Sam 2 and Serious Sam DD XXL.

To summarise, the game's an arcade focused FPS where you success is driven by fast reflexes and ability to chain points. Besides some glossy modern day improvements cosmetically including: a new physics engine, gore, some destructable environments and DX9c quality visuals, this edition is no different now as it was nearly ten years ago from release. It's fairly upsetting, and actually the game's flow still never manages to be as fluid or smooth as I remembered from all those years ago. Perhaps Serious Sam HD's biggest fault lies in that it hasn't taken advantage of any major gameplay improvements made in it's sequels, like Serious Sam: The Next Encounter on Gamecube even. The presentation is fairly average with below average menu navigation and poor multiplayer lobby support. It's an easy game to run, and supports the Xbox 360 controller but this release is tough to endorse otherwise.","October 17, 2011","false","9.1"," 4 of 20 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","4","20","0","1"

The main character tries so hard to be Duke Nukem for no apparent raisen. Sam himself is an idiot amongst idiots. Every enemy you fight is just a faceless thing throwing itself at you in waves. The developers must have been really confused with character design for the enemies. They just toss in whatever random crap they can think of.

If you want to play the same game with better level design, better enemies, better weapons and a fantastic art design, play Painkiller Black, awesome fps. Avoid this game like the plague. Croteam, get better level designers and make your game actually playable, your game is ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThere's a reason why this game is on offer for cheap, because it is a serious pile of diarohea.

Painkiller did everything this series does 20 times better, no 200 times better.

Never really getting into the idea of playing games to beat them until 2007 or so. And I never got into old school shooters. That is, until the year the HD version of Serious Sam: TFE came out. I happened to stumble across a youtube video and thought it looked interesting. Played the demo, thought it seemed cool. Payed the $15-$20 it cost and then came magic. This is in my top 5 FPS games of all time and one of my personal favourite video games. This game introduced me to the old school FPS genre and it easily made me more interested in First Person Shooters in general. The classic version is pretty much just as good, but a lot of effort was done in the remake and the HD version gets rid of that one little texture annoyance from the classics, where looking around really fast made everything distorted from 0.2 milliseconds. Not as good as Doom or Quake, but I am just as nostalgic for it as those games, if not even more so. Just buy it, right now. Don't think about it, just do. If you're worried about the difficulty, very easy is hard to die on and playing in classic co-op, you have infinite spawns. So theres nothing to be worried about. This is also a very good game to introduce you to the old school genre. I hadn't done much with old school FPS (aside from beating 1-2 levels in Doom) and I learned a lot of techniques from this game. I never strafed much in games before and after the first 3 levels of this game I was dodging stuff left and right. It isn't for everyone, but even if you just want a fun game to play through with a friend for a little distraction, it offers that. Although, I might reccomend SSHD:TSE over this one, if you just want a quick game you can marathon with a buddy and then forget about. I however, think it is a downright classic.\n\nAKA: BUY THIS GAME","October 10, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What's that? You want to do it in large open beautiful spaces. You get both with Serious Sam. Most of the gameplay consists of you in a large area fighting endless hordes of enemies. It might sound boring to stay in an area for a long time but it's not. You'll fight so many tough guys that the weaker enemies will seem like allies since your only companion in the game is a text computer. Serious Sam also has great visuals. You can see tall buildings like you were as if you were seeing the San Jacinto Monument up close and personal. Music is also great too and kicks up when an enemy encounter occurs. Even if there are only a couple of boss fights the bosses are gigantic (as big as Godzilla).

None! Except for how sharp the graphics are and the amount of memory this game takes up. Hence if you must always have the best, go HD. But if you have a low end computer go with the classic. This is running and mindlessly gunning done right. This game never takes itself seriously and gives you thousands apon thousands of enemies to mowe down. All weapons have their pluses and minuses. The more powerful the weapon, the more splash damage it may have and the more likely you are to kill yourself with it but that's the fun balance it has. If not, the faster the powerful weapons eat through ammo in no time at all. The enemies in Serious Sam are crazy over the top. Headless running human bombs, oversized brain launching rockets walking mech. That sounds like a joke of an enemy until you are made into gibs by a rocket or two while that headless bomb is running up your backside trying to blow himself up along with you. The serious solution is simple, shoot everything and don't stand still doing it. Mindless shooting made fun as you mindlessly lose at day or two of your life. Serious Sam is a great way to blow off steam after a hard day. The game never gets too tuff and a twitchy trigger finger it the best solution in this game. Mindless fun that never takes itself seriously. I seriously recommend this game to anyone who has a bad day and want to get bad themselves. Have fun and blow stuff up for tomorrow is another work day...","November 17, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In certain respects, it is even harder than Serious Sam 3: BFE.  It entails blasting enemies level after level getting from point A to point B.  If you are a 'nit picky' guy or a mainstream FPS player, then you would be disappointed by the nostalgia.  The plot is esentially primarily written and, yes, it involves the Egyptians and aliens and, yes, the ideas are cliche/ farfetched.  Given that those same 'aliens and Egyptians' kind of mentality actually gives this game its own identity.  Most people complain about the game because they may not be reading the plot before completeing the level.  Here's why this game is harder than Serious Sam 3:  no sprinting, the enemies can block movement, the enemies block each other (a positive and a negative), the enemies will literally bounce off of structures (i.e. trees, corners, statues, etc.; this is especially prevalent with sirian werebulls, marsh hoppers, and kleers), the kamikazes appear to be faster in this game, as opposed to SS3:BFE but that may be due to the lack of sprinting, enemy ambushes will tend to surround you out of nowhere, you can't always go back for extra ammo, health and armor for most maps (if not all), and the Tommy gun uses the same ammo as the minigun.  Unfortunately, all of the Serious Sam games have an extremely small online community.  If you want to play multiplayer, then you better bring your friends because they may be the only ones who you will find to play with.","September 10, 2014","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What's that? You want to do it in large open beautiful spaces. You get both with Serious Sam. Most of the gameplay consists of you in a large area fighting endless hordes of enemies. It might sound boring to stay in an area for a long time but it's not. You'll fight so many tough guys that the weaker enemies will seem like allies since your only companion in the game is a text computer. Serious Sam also has great visuals. You can see tall buildings like you were as if you were seeing the San Jacinto Monument up close and personal. Music is also great too and kicks up when an enemy encounter occurs. Even if there are only a couple of boss fights the bosses are gigantic (as big as Godzilla).

That's not to say that it's a bad thing, on the contrary, it's a benefit. Serious Sam throws so much insanity, anger and general chaos at you that you're missing out if you don't have someone else to act as a human shield. Secrets are a lot easier to find, cooperation is fun and overall I'd say you should get it. Between the friendly fire, weapons and general adventure, it really is the more the merrier.\n\n\nThere are some cons though:\nBoss battles that'll catch you off guard and don't always make sense initially. (Trust me on this.)\nSecrets can sometimes be unfairly hidden or require a great deal of work or searching to find.\nEnemies warp in, they don't have proper spawns or doors they walk through.\nNo regenerating health. (Get good scrub, this ain't Call o' Duty.)\nThere is a secret level that you will go the entire game without seeing. You might be able to guess where the entrance is, but it's going to take a while to get to it. If you're good, you won't cop out and look it up online. Yes, that means you.\nThe last boss is just... insane. I won't spoil it for you, but you won't be ready for it.\n\nSo, that being said, I'd say get the game. Great with friends.

The big rushes are pure unadultered fun, with enemies coming in from every angle, really builds up your adrenaline even in single player. The weapons get more and more crazy as the game goes on, from the mundane (pump-action shotgun) to the insane (a handheld pirate's cannon, that you can charge up), they all serve a specific purpose and are useful even for the jobs they weren't meant for, yet all feel distinct.\n\nBuy it, play it with your friends, turn on teamkilling for added insanity.","September 11, 2011","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think I can make your decision a little easier. Short version is, get Serious Sam HD: TFE. Long version is, get Serious Sam HD: TFE, maggot. Better yet, get the TFE/TSE bundle. TFE is a game about Sam "Serious" Stone killing massive loads of alien creatures in ancient Egypt armed only with his wits. As well as a cannon, a chaingun, a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher, a laser gun, a tommy gun, a big knife, two shotguns, akimbo Colt .45s, and a neurally-implanted computer system. Because he didn't want to overdo it, you see. Logically, I can assume that this has already convinced you. Thus, I'll leave you with this advice: set your color options to "Vivid". Trust me on this.

But, not only you can blast off monsters in it, but it contains some puzzle that you kinda solve for yourself. Thankfully there are hints to know where they are and you just wen through it.\n\nThe monsters are a bit cheesy but there are some that are hilarious, especially with those kamikaze bombers, whose are headless and come and say "AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" and it explodes you up. Creepers from Minecraft won't touch that one.\n\nDespite the fact it is made by Croteam, I can honestly say that this game was good. I've haven't seen any international game publishers who can sucessfully made a good game out of it (though Japan makes ALOT of good games and some bad games). Thankfully there are no lolis and pedobears  in this game. LOL!\n\nOverall, good game! :)","July 12, 2011","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

But don't be fooled; your foes, though seemingly lacking both beauty and wisdom, are still capable of advanced and cunning tactics. Among those are spawning behind your back or right in your face, remaining immobile indefinitely in a shadowy corner waiting for you to walk into the room, or - when all else fails - running directly into gunfire in hopes that your supplies will vanish sooner than their ranks. Which will often prove a remarkably effective strategy.","October 3, 2011","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well now. It turns out that I need something slightly more than pure plotless twitch shooting; although this was mostly fun as hell and a definite boon for my twitch-aiming, some of the levels were stupidly difficult or just over-long, the boss fights were dull circle-strafes, and it basically outstayed its welcome. Still, what do you expect from the design for a game this old? It was OK. And thanks to the Steam sale I have all the sequels to play, too.

But, not only you can blast off monsters in it, but it contains some puzzle that you kinda solve for yourself. Thankfully there are hints to know where they are and you just wen through it.\n\nThe monsters are a bit cheesy but there are some that are hilarious, especially with those kamikaze bombers, whose are headless and come and say "AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" and it explodes you up. Creepers from Minecraft won't touch that one.\n\nDespite the fact it is made by Croteam, I can honestly say that this game was good. I've haven't seen any international game publishers who can sucessfully made a good game out of it (though Japan makes ALOT of good games and some bad games). Thankfully there are no lolis and pedobears  in this game. LOL!\n\nOverall, good game! :)","July 12, 2011","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

First, even though it was not developed in a time where graphics were at their best, its makers really managed to pull out the best of what the graphic can be at that time. Second, it is a fun game and killing hordes and hordes of enemies and dicovering secrets never becomes boring with every level presenting a new challenge and a new way to overcome it. Last but not least, the producers of this game gave a lot of time and effort in designing every level, with the areas looking amazing and well detailed.\nHowever there is a single flaw in this game. It is a bit predictable.\nAll in all, this game is a great game and one of my all time favourites.","June 15, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's Serious Sam for you. When it first came out it was something out of the ordinary. With a surprising success. Wandering through levels with some nice looking old egyptian architecture, you fight armys of monsters. This time, the word "army" is to be taken seriously, as you literally kill thousands of monsters from start to finish. A few simply "collect item" and "push switch" puzzles in between give some variety, but the big picture is just you, your gun and what you can shoot with it: EVERYTHING!\nSam himself is more or less a cheap copy of Duke Nukem, with a similiar rough voice (though not as cool sounding) and one liners, as well as some comedic relief and a few references to pop-culture.

That's okay by me because the original version of the game was incredibly fun and entertaining in the mindless way it would hurl hundreds of targets at you in different levels of insanity, all the while cracking wise about the silliness of the whole thing.  The whole game is a bit repetitive but part of the fun is seeing how many different ways the game can throw a flood of bad guys at you, and believe me when things get busy it's a riot of frenetic action.","December 21, 2010","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's not to say that it's a bad thing, on the contrary, it's a benefit. Serious Sam throws so much insanity, anger and general chaos at you that you're missing out if you don't have someone else to act as a human shield. Secrets are a lot easier to find, cooperation is fun and overall I'd say you should get it. Between the friendly fire, weapons and general adventure, it really is the more the merrier.\n\n\nThere are some cons though:\nBoss battles that'll catch you off guard and don't always make sense initially. (Trust me on this.)\nSecrets can sometimes be unfairly hidden or require a great deal of work or searching to find.\nEnemies warp in, they don't have proper spawns or doors they walk through.\nNo regenerating health. (Get good scrub, this ain't Call o' Duty.)\nThere is a secret level that you will go the entire game without seeing. You might be able to guess where the entrance is, but it's going to take a while to get to it. If you're good, you won't cop out and look it up online. Yes, that means you.\nThe last boss is just... insane. I won't spoil it for you, but you won't be ready for it.\n\nSo, that being said, I'd say get the game. Great with friends. Unless you don't have friends, in which case find some you sad, lonely depressant.\n","March 7, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Originally I completed these games on the console and I was excited to find out that there was more content in the PC version. These versions are a lot of fun on Normal difficulty but becomes horrifyingly difficult on Hard. There are two more difficulty modes I would never attempt. I highly recommend Serious Sam: First and Second Encounter, it's a satisfying Wave FPS with some comedy tossed in that gives the player a great feeling of progression and accomplishment on each playthrough. You can choose any levels already completed which is excellent for casual replay. Really this game is a classic for any library and if you haven't played it you are missing out.\n\nI believe the trick to enjoying the Serious Sam games is to set up keybindings for your weapons and learn them well as it will add alot of depth to gameplay.","March 9, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course there is pretty much no story, all you need to know are the basics, which are for some reason you need to find some things, and do some stuff, which requires you to kill a whole lot of things (easy enough!).  The best moments though are the prolonged fights and their difficulty levels.  This game has no problem throwing, 20,30,40,50+ enemeis at you at once and the best part is you know you've got the firepower to handle it and every fight gives you a sense of accomplishment because they throw lots of enemies of every type at you.

Never really getting into the idea of playing games to beat them until 2007 or so. And I never got into old school shooters. That is, until the year the HD version of Serious Sam: TFE came out. I happened to stumble across a youtube video and thought it looked interesting. Played the demo, thought it seemed cool. Payed the $15-$20 it cost and then came magic. This is in my top 5 FPS games of all time and one of my personal favourite video games. This game introduced me to the old school FPS genre and it easily made me more interested in First Person Shooters in general. The classic version is pretty much just as good, but a lot of effort was done in the remake and the HD version gets rid of that one little texture annoyance from the classics, where looking around really fast made everything distorted from 0.2 milliseconds. Not as good as Doom or Quake, but I am just as nostalgic for it as those games, if not even more so. Just buy it, right now. Don't think about it, just do. If you're worried about the difficulty, very easy is hard to die on and playing in classic co-op, you have infinite spawns. So theres nothing to be worried about. This is also a very good game to introduce you to the old school genre. I hadn't done much with old school FPS (aside from beating 1-2 levels in Doom) and I learned a lot of techniques from this game. I never strafed much in games before and after the first 3 levels of this game I was dodging stuff left and right. It isn't for everyone, but even if you just want a fun game to play through with a friend for a little distraction, it offers that. Although, I might reccomend SSHD:TSE over this one, if you just want a quick game you can marathon with a buddy and then forget about. I however, think it is a downright classic.\n\nAKA: BUY THIS GAME","October 10, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And then decided to make a game with incredibly serious enemies with a seriously smoking arsenal of serious weaponry. And while part of this is a joke, I'm also completely serious. It's a seriously solid game.\n\nEach enemy behaves differently (with there being a couple pallete swap enemies) and there's enough of them so that you'll be killing every non-boss enemy at least 50 times before the end of the game, so you'll know how they act, how to avoid their attacks, and how to kill them. This game counts on that because as time goes on, levels start getting longer and enemies become increasingly numerous and unforgiving. It reaches points where you're killing hundreds of enemies every level and they are literally everywhere. It's pretty awesome. Well, to a point.\n\nThe first half of the game is great, your weaponry slowly expands as do your rogue's gallery. You learn the purpose of how each weapon can be used effectively while exploring the scenary to get your hands on much needed ammo, health, and secret weaponry. But by the time you get to the Dunes about seven levels in, it starts becoming apparent that this game relishes in sending waves after waves after you. It's fun, but only for a while.\n\nLevels become larger and less confined to give you more space to work in and fit in more enemies, but repition also hits pretty hard with it. Serious Sam is definately the kind of game where you want to take breaks or risk tiring yourself out because once you make it to the Metropolis, the game starts becoming increasingly stale, despite the various landscapes and obstacles.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is still a fun carthatic hectic game (and you better save often...) but it just becomes really repetitive in a hurry and soon even amazingly fun things like spamming Cannonballs becomes the norm and your best bet for survival in battlefields that take minutes to cross.","June 30, 2015","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyway... Do you like FPS where you mindlessly kill hundreds of silly and random enemies? This is the game for you. Serious Sam HD also supports co-op and is much more enjoyable with friends (like most things), in fact this game is a blast to play with other people in general. Single player is there if you need it, but Co-op is the way to go.\n\nKeep in mind this is a classic FPS. It's all about running and gunning, no hiding, no regening health, lots of big and cool weapons, enemies that defy logic for the sake of being fun to fight.\n\nStrengths:\n-Classic FPS as stated above (This style of FPS was dead for quite a while, but is starting to come back.)\n-Lots of shooting, lots of cool weapons, lots of enemies, and the gameplay is seriously great and polished.\n-Awesome and mindless Co-op action for you and your friends\n-Secrets! Despite the lackluster level design, there are a lot of very clever and fun secrets to find.\n-Silly, pointless, and old school story (It's there if you want it, and doesn't get in the way when you don't)\n-Stupid one liners (You either love them or you don't)\n-Good difficulty settings, there is literally something for everybody here.\n\nWeaknesses:\n-Early stages are pretty boring, Serious Sam games generally take a bit of time to ramp up the serious.\n-Level design is very very basic and nothing to get excited about.\n-Graphically still a bit aged, but who plays sam for that?\n-The game is repetitive in general.

Saving the Earth of Ailens trying to take it over. And that's all the story you need, Sam is every single badass from the 80's rolled into one. Though not as ego induced as Duke Nukem, he still just as awesome. Every single one-liner will make you laugh (even out loud).\n\nGAMEPLAY: The gameplay of Serious Sam is like Duke Nukem 3D, see something, pump lead in it. But what makes Serious Sam differ from Duke Nukem is the enemies and how they work. In Serious Sam, enemies are more aggressive in nature and will come at you from every direction. While in Duke Nukem enemies stay in one place and wait for you to come. Serious Sam takes the FPS to the next level being tough as nails and it doesn't care if you're ready or not. It will throw everything at you.\n\nLEVELS: Levels are large and open, giving you more room to run around and avoid thousands of enemies. The most you'll see in TFE is deserts and some jungle areas, even though the visuals don't change the layoout does, Making every level feel different from one another.\n\nOverall I give Serious Sam a.... 9.8/10. Great levels, great gameplay, and a great main character. The only thing I would highly recommend is wait until the game's on sale. Because you can get TFE and TSE for only two dollars.","March 20","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Because that's about all you get here. This game is stupid, and I mean that in the most positive way possible. Forget physics puzzles, story, characters and using your brain - the main premise of this game is "shoot stuff".
