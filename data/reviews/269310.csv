It's good, it's fun and it works very well and is rewarding to play, I've had it for two years and have played 80 hours, I test out the game mechanics after every update and I see what's new to have.  So what's really depressing for me, and what makes me not recommend this game, is just the dissappointment that occurs month after month as this game's development chugs along\n\nThe main problem that is present is as a result of a small development team (it's understandable and I get it).  It's difficult to put out new updates for a game that has decreasing returns as it fades out of relevance as it's novelty begins to get lost.  But the difficult thing is to watch this game, remaining addictive and fun to play, truncate itself in most updates.  It's not satisfying to see features added but an equal amount are disabled or rendered irrelevant.  It's interesting to see and I'm always hopeful whenever it says, "update queued," for this game, because I'm eager to see real progress.  I've had a lot of fun with this game, a lot of time spent and a lot of good times had, and it's been very fun to see it grow and change.  But what is difficult is that there are too many half-heartedly implemented features, including the flow of the game; you can no longer escape the first city and thus get surrounded in your base by the most difficult and most abundant zombies, disabling your ability to play the game.\n\nSo yeah, this game could be fun for you if you buy it, but it'll be a while before it's all polished up and completed, so i don't recommend it now, but when it's finished and the game can be played in full with all its features fully realized, I'll recommend it then.  The description says set to release in 2016, so I've got hope, and I hope I'll be able to change this review very soon.\n\nP.S. (to the developers) Thanks for the work put into this game, it's a very nice and varied game, and it's quite enjoyable.  I hope you're able to finish it soon.  I don't want to sound unappreciative, I just want to be honest in how I'll actually recommend this game.","March 12","false","86.2"," 57 of 66 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","57","66","0","0"

For an early access game, it's pretty enjoyable. Very difficult at times. If you expect it to be like Toge's\nflash project "Infectonator", you'll be dissapointed. It has the same art style, but this game is much more than what the original flash game was. There's still some room for work here, but like I said..

It might even be worth your hard earned monies. But not at the price of 12.99. This is a 2 to 3 dollar game at best. I can easily, off the top of my head, list games that are in the same genre and beat this game hands down: Project Zomboid, Fort Zombie (even with all the bugginess), and rogue survivor. What I expected, from the description of this game, was Fort Zombie+UFO: Afterlight-lots of things due to it being alpha. What I got instead was essentially a more spiffy web browser game (even the graphics reinforce this notion of the game).\n\nPros:\n+Solid semi-fun mechanics\n\nCons:\n-No challenge (you don't even need turrets half the time and you would be hard pressed to lose any survivors)\n-Limited tech tree\n-Oversimplified mechanics (for a zombie game that's 12.99)\n-Unintriquing story\n-Pretty much no content that justifies the current price even for an alpha\n\nThis may all change as the devs continue to release material for the game. However, until they do I highly recommend those of you looking for a rogue zombie game to check out Project Zomboid, Rogue Survivor, and even Fort Zombie if you are considering this game. If you haven't played Rogue Survivor it is FREE to download and play, and it offers a good challenge for those who like games in the rogue genre. On the other hand, if you want a good rogue-like game that combines RPG, strategy, and tower defense there is also Dungeon of the Endless which is absolutely fantastic (and very challenging).\n\nMore in-depth analysis:\n\nI recently replayed this game. While the tone is much more apocalyptic many of the issues I had with the game haven't been addressed. Primarily, the issue of getting me hooked and wanting to continue to play the d*** thing. I'll divide this up into several sub-sections.\n\n1. Failures on the zombie survival game level.\n\nAgain, if you're looking for something to fill the void of being eatten alive by the undead (wait, what?) there are plenty of other titles out there. This game fails on this premise simply because supplies are too plentiful. It is too easy to acquire absolutely everything that you need to survive. Most zombie survival (and rogue-likes) turn every move into a time vs ammo vs hunger sort of mechanic. IE, if I engage that horde of zombies how much ammo do I waste to get the supplies they're guarding? That simply isn't the case here. The issue becomes simply one of finding enough food and resources, which are too plentiful. But that's partially due to design. Because you *have* to clear each level there is no room to design the levels around players making strategic decisions (rather than just tactical ones).\n\n2. Failures on the level of tower defense.\n\nThe towers/turrets are still just over-simplified fluff. I didn't get to (and I didn't want to either) play long enough to see if we see towers/turrets evolve. Are they even really necessary? Well, they could help someone who doesn't know how to manuever characters in the middle of combat. I could see that, but I still don't feel that we need them. At this point in time they're just feature creep.\n\n3. Semi-successful on the management side:\n\nWith getting rid of the rest period between fights we actually do see a useful element of management occuring, however this is undermined by the fact that the game is still way too easy. In a 1-2 hour play through I ended up with enough characters to both send out into the field and to research/build stuff (and I choose a 2 character start). If the devs manage to make the game challenging the current management part of the game might become more important and less feature creep.\n\n4. Still just a way too easy RPG tactical:\n\nWe still don't see the game improving to the point of really having much promise. It is mildly fun for a 1-3 hour play through (though boring to come back to). While the devs talk about a lot of exciting improvements none of the changes they're proposing will actually fix the main issue with the game: Making people want to (continue to) play it.\n\nI think what has to absolutely be addressed is either developing a decent story to make us want to play through the cities or to ratchet up the challenge (preferably both). The later of which doesn't necessarily have to come from overhauling combat, just rebalancing how players get resources. Specifically, redoing drops from zombies and forcing most of our resource gathering to be from scavenging the mission sites. This might make both turrets (as a way to deal with really difficult waves) and management (as a way to balance injured personel) more important and less feature creep-ish.","November 12, 2014","false","6.6"," 159 of 243 people (65%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","65","159","243","5","20"

I'm able to hold off a block at "Dangerous" level including a boss zombie with only 2 survivors with no problem at all. I now have something like 15,000 ammo and 300 supplies and an insane amount of weapons and building material. Also, I don't know about anyone else but I've never had the need to build turrets.\n\n- Going through blocks that you have already cleared is incredibly tedious... you're needed to hunt zombies in the building even though you have done it already? I don't see the point in having to do it a second time, especially if there's one zombie left and you're out on a wild goose chase to find it is pretty agrivating. Maybe after a random amount of days those blocks can become repopulated with zombies again?\n\n- I really dislike that you have to always return back to your HQ in order to save progress. I think there should be an option to set up camp at the block that you have just cleared, maybe have a limit per in-game day that you can do this.\n\n- I hate that you can switch equipment mid-clearing. It should be that the weapons that the survivors are already using to shoot zombies just stay that way until it's clear.\n\n- Just a glitch I've come across when clearing zombies in the merchant block. I headed to a merchant block that I had already cleared and found that there were two merchants?? I couldn't talk to the second one or anything, it was just his playermodel standing there. No guards, just the merchant.\n\n- It'd be great to see more variety/customisation in the survivors. Maybe like weapon specialisations, such as rifles or shotguns. Or even talent trees.\n\nAll this being said, the game is really good and would recommend playing this game, and any other Infectonator games, it's just a couple of things that I think could be improved.","March 18, 2015","true","18.6"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","38","45","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TosheSenshi/recommended/269310/","TosheSenshi","Sir PaperSamurai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TosheSenshi/","258 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSaw this at PAXAUS and bought after seeing its gameplay.\n\nMuch as this game still on its Alpha stage. It has proven its potency of a survivor/zombie/small-class management game.\n\nGameplay is simple and easy to understand. Mechanics of both base and 'before entering the building' phase is a still a little funky in a way. But difficulty in this has its own up and down depending on location you visits.\n\nOnly thing I feel stumped on is:\n- Does the base function on any other things? Besides Crafting/Research and Farming?\n- Do we get more Survivors? *Only managed to find one throughout three gameplays.*\n- Do we get any base upgrades like barricading the openings that are being spread out throughout the building?\n- Is there no chance of pausing the game while selecting of projects in the crafts/farming section? Or any sort of auto bump to next project selection.\n- Would there be an option to repair/replenish Armours/Items that have Durability?\n- Because there is no pause in Crafts/Farming Section and the day ends. It literally bumps you to the next day.\n- Are we not allowed to control our characters when Base is under attack?\n- When Characters got K.O in base. Is there no way to revive them without spending 500 Ammos on that? *Could be a chance of using a Med Kit if avaliable or spare a certain amount of supplies.*\n- Does Scott and Shiro have any use to the game at all? I see Scott has a Communication Device on the desk. And Shiro could be used to be sent out as a scaveanger hunt like bringing back random supplies or items?\n\nThe game is still fun despite of the stuff above. Difficulty is its key element, Survival on the other.\n\nWhat I hope to look for in its complete stage is that,\n- More Characters?\n- More Survivors to be recuited/saved/joining your base.\n- Chance of upgrading your base.\n- Maybe a storyline of such? *Might be asking too much. It is a survival game after all.*\n\n\nCheers, and happy slaying. :D","November 1, 2015","true","14.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

It might be true but it's pretty addictive and funny. Soon enough you'll noticed that you spend quite some time on it. With each update you see more and more stuf which brings more tweaks to the game, making it even more interesting.\n\nGame is quite simple. You fight zombies, look and scavenge for materials, upgrade your gear and your characters, explore town, fight bosses, find survivors, fix your car, get some fuel and travel to next town. Even if it sound quite boring at first you end up playing the game for few hours and only then you notice how much time you spent on this "simple" game. I myself ended up playing from the begining like about 30 times just because I didn't want to see my characters dead haha... After spending more time you notice that some areas become harder to deal with and you end up constantly healing your characters or trying to find a better strategy how to fight off zombies. Turrents, reminding you tower defence games, help you a bit but they need quite some supplies and they stay at that place, unless you dismantle then. Of course, no matter what you're doing zombies sometimes get to eat raw brains and you end up losing a character which might or might not be very important for you because of it's stats, gear and/or anything else :P\n\nI spent some time on this game and I'm pretty happy with it. After a while you notice that it might become more interesting with more stuf, but for that we need to wait for more updates. I really recomend playing this game even if only for a short time.","February 15, 2015","true","18.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","1"

I was excited for this early release and have not been disappointed. This game is simple, addictive, and (surprisingly) thought provoking.\n\nPros:\n-Weapon range\n-Character builds\n-Random events\n-Research system\n-Characters actually loose life when they don't eat\n-Weapon knockback feature\n-Replayability\n\nCons:\n-Reloads and/or heals not completing on level transitions\n-Map navigation makes portion of the game slow and tedious\n-Level length (would love to see some 3 or 4 transition buildings to add to difficulty)\n-Supply/Weapons are never obtained where they should be (gun store/police station never have any guns). Would be cool to know exactly where to expect to find certain types of items. Would make map navigation more strategic.\n-Supplies are maybe a little too scarce (while I realize this meant to be a zombie survival game, 2 to 0 supplies per building make it almost impossible to keep the basic 4 character team build from starving each round after a while). If you want to have more than four players to focus on research, forget about it. I very rarely keep more than 6 players on my team for this reason.\n-Not being able to walk and reload at the same time. increases difficutly, but not very realistic.\n\nBest Feature:\nThe "random events" system at the end of some levels is what completes the game for me. After a few hours, the game can become fairly stagnent. Difficulty increases, but if you get the hang of weapon combos (2 ar's, 1 shotgun, 1 melee) and creating choke points, you can breeze through most of the levels with little difficulty. And then, once the game starts to become mechanical and get boring, it throws an uncontrollable  wrench into your system: "You hear moaning behind the door...A zombie horde is onto you, you manage to get away but now all survivors make it." All of a sudden, you loose your best weapon, you loose your best player, and you have to completely reevaluate your approach.. Do I need to go find a merchant?. Do I need to go find a survivor?, etc.. BRILLIANT game mechanics to spice things up in a no-going-back zombie game.  I would love to see further development in this portion of the game.\n\nWorst Feature:\nMy biggest complaint about the game mechanics would have to be with the map navigation. As the cities get bigger, only being able to move to adjacent buildings makes the game progression very slow and tedious. At certain points in the game, you just want to move across the map quickly, especially when you have alreayd cleared 98% of it. It would be nice to be able to move to any building that you have already occupied, no matter where it is on the map or how far you are from it. This would expediate th e most tedious portion on the game and let you get into the core gameplay quicker.\n\n\nAll-in-all, a very good game. For the price, I would recommend it.","April 15, 2014","true","67.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

I couldent help but laugh as i found a lightsaber in a cardboard box in a mall. The controls and movement can get tricky or glitchy (when trying to scavenge "Sparkley" objects it would close out of the decision boxes, and the character) but it is fun. The permadeath was a nice feature so the pressure was on.

It makes the game unnecessarily tedious and it makes me want to stop playing for a while.\n\nTraveling back to base takes a long time (I'm not sure if it makes the game better or worse). To add to that, the same "Hunt Zeds" mini-game is necessary every time.\n\nThe game does feel a bit empty, but it's early access! It's expected.\n\nBut, don't let these minor issues I have with the game turn you away.\n\nIf you love RPG kind of games where you manage and command of up to four active characters and others waiting at base, this is a game for you! The way you upgrade your character both in arsenal and in ability reminds me of when I used to play with Lego mini-figures and gave them whatever new accessories in the unsorted bins. Sometimes it takes a while, but it's so satisfying giving your character new weapons and equipment.\n\nAnd you can't sit idle and let your team do nothing either. Every day your survivors consume supplies, and if you run out, your characters die. That's it! They are permanently dead. That brings me to one last thing that I don't like. I think that the perma-death feature should be optional, but you wouldn't get as good of an ending or something like that.\n\nAll in all I give this game a 6.5 or a 7.

Really a review wouldn't be best because the game is not done yet. I do like the fact that there is no pity for you, you die... that's it buddy. start over try again. I will say that aloccating one person to search and the other three do do the heavy work will get you through a match... the game is shaping up good. just needs a good story, the merchant should come around more often, and if you can get the dog later on in the game as a pet to help you in the matches it would be awesome!!!!! great job tho! Also it would be nice that after you complete a zone, and you want to go back a second time there are more stuff to search/better rewards so you don't waste your resources trying to complete a lvl 100 precent and run out of supplys!","April 15, 2014","true","11.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's got some depth to it, as you've got to scavenge supplies, ammo and food to stay alive. It's pretty harsh at first, atleast with a full group, as supplies can run dry faster than you'd like. But once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to survive for a longer period of time. It is a roguelike in the sense than you squad can die, and they will remain dead. You do have a small window of 10 seconds to revive them when they fall, though it may not always be the easiest thing to do since by then you'd probably be swarmed with zombies anyway.\nRepetative but ok retro music, sweet pixel art graphics, lousy crafting and item variation sadly, some replayability. Even thought it's got it's flaws, it manages to make me want to play some more.. But in short bursts.\n\nAlso the storepage needs an update, as all the screenshots are of a completely different version of the game (maybe even the flash version?). And the storepage claims to have Achievements and Trading Cards, none of which it has... which is rather iffy to my. I take that kind of stuff serious, misleading customers. It doesn't sit well with me.\n\nPR is not this games strongest boons, especially when I read there are people copying the entire game and selling it on IOS appStore.. Copyright claim perhaps? Anyway..\n\nFor what it is, I give it an 7/10 for now. It's a totally okay Z-survival micromanager. If it gets better, I'll re-review it.","November 2, 2014","true","3.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

The content is a little light (it just went early access after all) but the systems are all there and they're really strong. Fast-paced, tactical, addicting and rewarding. And hard as hell.\n\nA couple notes because I'm not sure where else to put them and I feel like constructive criticisms are an advantage of going public early:\nI think survivors should get XP from working on projects in the garage. Not as much as from a battle of course, but I think it makes more sense to have one person man the garage than have people constantly taking turns being the mechanic so they can rotate who gets XP.\nI know it's like a satire that the only girl in the game (not counting Zoey from L4D) is just called Blonde Girl and has no background of note, but until there are more girl survivors to choose from I think you should give her something compelling. Having survivors with backgrounds and proficiencies is always more interesting and I feel like you're alienating people by having the sole representation of females be a sexist joke.\nA little more time at the end of a round to finish scavenging would be good. It seems intentional to keep up the pace and difficulty, but it strays from real world logic a little too far for me. Maybe have a place you move to to complete the level instead having the survivors leave automatically?\n\nThat said, really fun game!

However resources are a little more limited than they need to be. It seems less like a challenge and more just kind of unfair.

The game starts the same way every time and you always have the same hq on the same spot in the map with the buildings varying slightly.\n\nThat being said it is still a very fun game especially for alpha and the tactical combat is pretty enjoyable.

Your save games aren't safe. They are randomly lost due to a bug with the game. I got to day 14 my first sucesful playthrough.\n\n2. It's easy to exploit this game by staying in one spot(Wherever a merchant is) and using the first two days to build the two farm upgrades. By doing this and endlessly farming gold and exp, then buying supplies,you create an endless loop of:\nKill\nbuy food\nkill\nbuy guns\nbuy food\nkill\nbuy food\n\nIf you don't exploit the game, it's really hard to survive...almost impossible with an odd diffuculty curve which randomly ranps up nearby locations to frantic and dangerous in the first 20 days. So with this, the bottom line is the game is either too hard or endless repetition of the same easy area. obviously there would be some grind,but it's far too excessive to make moving around fun,\n\ntl;dr: What you do on the first playthrough(before turning your computer/program off) is your limit and the game is either too hard or exploitable,\n\nWould this mean the game is bad or unplayable(in its current state)? No it's fun and an interesting yet challenging take on the zombie genre by actually creating a survival aspect without relying purely on tower defense.

For about a year and a half I loved Infectonator Survivors mainly because of its play-ability on my low-tier laptop. In 3 weeks, I will probably forget all about Infectonator and Toge Productions, as I will have a much better computer, and it will allow me to play better games. Infectonator Survivors is by no means outdated or outclassed by other prettier games, but it loses in responsiveness as an early access game that claims to be headed towards completion. When I say that I had a great time playing The Organ Trail, that is my genuine review of hours of satisfying gameplay of a retro game that has had someone's care and attention given into it's development. Respectively, for Infectonator Survivors, what I have taken away from many hours of gameplay is also drawn from various other aspects and small details that I've observed. The conclusion I've come to is that the developers do not care to fix the bugs, bad english, small details or mechanics. Honesty is a big part of success, but naturally people are afraid to face others objectively and they lie, just like how the developer who relays updates to players can't honestly say that updates actually take 3-4 weeks on average and continue to insist that they'll be back in 2 weeks with another update. Personally, this trend has made me have doubts in the back of my mind about how serious the developers are about  fulfilling the promises that they have set forth and even leaving their own mark on the game industry. I feel that the sheer heart that other developers have toward their games will outpace Toge; when you then add graphics and inspiration to a passionate developer, the disparity will become even more noticeable, until everyone notices that the developers behind Infectonator Survivors is not as responsive as other teams.","March 29","false","88.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I am a huge fan of Survivor Squad and this play like it. Survivor squad is a bit surperior though. Purely for the fact that you get alot more survivors, You can build bases and defend them.\n\nMy major complaints are this. I have never been higher than 4 survivors. The game just refuses to give me more. That's why I always play the convict and swat. They to my opinnion are the best.\n\nThe hazmats should have little to no hp. They are exploding zombies. The fact that they take a full turret and like 2 clips is way too much. They also make melee weapons useless on them. They explode on death which has resulted in me quiting and reloading many times. In my hoenst opinnion, they can keep the explosion. Thats what makes them dangerous but cut thier hp by atleast half.\n\nMy only other complain is the lack of supplies. If you play with 4 survivors. I can never find food to keep them all and it results in very quick deaths. Before anyone say "its the zombie apoc" I say "It's a game, Games don't play by logic"\n\nFor the +, It does require you to move your survivors and kite. I like that idea, A pause and order would be a nice feature but it not entirely required but would be a very huge + if they added that.\n\nall in all, Its an alpha.

Early Access games that charge money should be considered a finished game\n2. Content missing at time of review is still considered content missing, regardless of "promises to put it in"\n\nSimple enough, right? Let's move on to the review.\n\nI like this game. It has a particular charm that tugs at my nostalgia strings and panders to my every whim. A zombie survival game with a cool soundtrack, featuring old school stylistic visuals and RPG management elements. What the game does well, outweighs where the game is currently lacking. The most annoying feature for me is the inability to select multiple survivors for movement, you have to panstakingly move each survivor one at a time, and there is no pause hotkey button, although the game can be paused by clicking the options tab on the top right of the screen.\n\nI think more hotkeys ingame, for example a reload, heal and search hotkey, rather than having to click the appropriate tab when under attack. Although I like the idea of a randomised world, it can cause situations that are impossible for the player to rectify, for example - if you start next the game next to no trader and find no supplies in the tutorial map, your party will begin starving after the first day, which then makes the game very difficult, throw in the fact that you can only move to an adjacent building may cause issues when resupplying, unless you were lucky at the beginning. I also don't understand why I am given 3 mortars if I enable tutorial, but get nothing if I switch it off. The player should get consistant equipment before day 1, whether they want to on screen help or not. Also, a few events don't work properly (at time of writing) - such as the bandits attacking survivors, you offer help, you jot down on the map the location...the event ends. No bandits, no additional supplies, no extra map, nothing happens. Also, the character portraits of certain characters are not present, my researcher doesn't have a character portrait, just a black box. Some of these issues may be restricted to myself, but after playing through the game with and without the tutorial more than once, this is based off my experience.\n\nAlso, I've noticed the game doesn't like me right-clicking, makes the screeen freeze for split second. I also don't understand how easy the game becomes once you've acquired a level 3 weapon, like the SAW, I can literally let 1 survivor run through a map with just the SAW, letting me cover a minimum of 4 maps (well, not counting the builder because of his poor aiming ability).\n\nI believe a better tutorial would go a long way to making this game more enjoyable for people, but so far, I've enjoyed it.\n\nMost of the issues I have do seem to revolve around things that may be patched in the future, let's hope so, because so far, I've thoroughly enjoyed this experience with a few features missing (perks).","April 16, 2014","true","43.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

My only complaint is that it gets hard too fast and it has bad mouse controls. Still fine, but I think more work on pacing would help it alot.

I know about, and have loved Toge for their other Infectonator games, and I'm glad they are spicing it up more.

I am a huge fan of Survivor Squad and this play like it. Survivor squad is a bit surperior though. Purely for the fact that you get alot more survivors, You can build bases and defend them.\n\nMy major complaints are this. I have never been higher than 4 survivors. The game just refuses to give me more. That's why I always play the convict and swat. They to my opinnion are the best.\n\nThe hazmats should have little to no hp. They are exploding zombies. The fact that they take a full turret and like 2 clips is way too much. They also make melee weapons useless on them. They explode on death which has resulted in me quiting and reloading many times. In my hoenst opinnion, they can keep the explosion. Thats what makes them dangerous but cut thier hp by atleast half.\n\nMy only other complain is the lack of supplies. If you play with 4 survivors. I can never find food to keep them all and it results in very quick deaths. Before anyone say "its the zombie apoc" I say "It's a game, Games don't play by logic"\n\nFor the +, It does require you to move your survivors and kite. I like that idea, A pause and order would be a nice feature but it not entirely required but would be a very huge + if they added that.\n\nall in all, Its an alpha. It's still fun even if it has crushing difficulty.\nHow crushing?

There's just something about the game that makes you want to keep playing it. And that's what's been going on with me. I just can't stop playing it. It was a bit challenging at first, but I learned how everything works and now enjoy playing it a lot.\nSome ideas:\n\nThe materials that you collect in-game could be used for modifying weapons. Different attachments/customizations increase and/or decrease weapon stats. If possible, there should weapons and/or gears that can only be obtained by building them with materials. Each of those custom weapons should have something special about them. Like, for example, high damage, high fire rate, large magazine, etc. Or they could have a perk or effect, useful for dealing with zombies. Like "Slows down zombies," or "Chance to score critical hits on zombies," or "Slowly heals the Survivor holding this."\n\nAlso, on the missions menu/map, I'd be helpful if it just tells you where all the merchants, survivors, and bosses are located without having to be near them.\n\nIn-game, when a survivor(s) gets killed, you can search their body, just like sparkly objects, to obtain whatever weapon they were holding.\n\nI deeply thank Toge for making this game, and i hope they will improve Survivors and keep making more games.","July 19, 2014","true","53.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Click character 2, not realize that it didn't do anything, click movement destination, character 1 now walks to where character 2 should go.  Click back on character 1's destination.  Repeat until zombie wave comes and since it's a tower defense game and none of my people are in position, watch them die.

Even at this point of time, for an incomplete game, it's shaping up to be something special. Or at least, that's how I see it. I can understand why some wouldn't like this game but I guess it's an aquired taste of sorts. Still, I'd recommended it at least.\n\nIt's far from perfect though. There is the occassional bug. One I just found is when I started playing the game with team Left4Dead. Things were running ok till I fixed the car and traveled to the 2nd area of the city. While exploring area's, I found the "police officier" survivor along the way but when I checked another area with a "?" mark...well. My guess is that I was mean't to find a survivor during the "encounter/scout" phase but when the map panned to the right for the next area, I briefly saw Fransis running around like a found survivor then suddenly disappar off-screen. Not only was I handicapped to a team of three for that weird reason, it glitched the game when I made it back to HQ since the "auto-save" feature locked up mid-save on the status bar, forcing me to close the game.\n\nBad luck on my part perhaps but I guess the game gave me a survivor I already had and was in my active party for whatever reason. Probably not the best place to report glitches like these but I don't have access to proper forums for this.\n\nDespite this though, it is a good game. It just needs some more work but I'd give it time. To me, it'd be worth the wait for the full game.","May 1","true","24.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'll never know, I was too scared to find out... probably death... I always retreated early and got penalized for doing so by losing some of the supplies I had gained... yet another flawed and idiotic design to go with the rest of the game.\n\nIt's rogue like, so expect to have either great luck or terrible luck... if you have the latter, expect many restarts. I fixed the car twice and travelled to two different areas... nothing different from the first two... I think the game might be endless until you finally can no longer survive... so a game that never ends... lame.\n\nDeath is also perminent in this game, there is no way to revive your team mates if you leave them behind. You can only resuscitate them in a battle but if they die from starvation, that's it. Also if your entire team is wiped, your save file is erased and you must start from scratch again.\n\nI didn't really understand the crafting system either... you place your team on a work bench, then speed up time, wasting a couple days just to upgrade a turret or craft a shotgun... it's kind of ridiculous. Everything is a domino effect... you have to have ammo to progress the game and find food so you can survive all the while collecting components for upgrades so you can make your life easier. If you run out of any one of those things, the game is basically over.\n\nThe farming aspect of the game is really silly as well... it takes a full day just to harvest food and the amount of food you harvest is good enough for an entire day... so it just becomes redundant to even bother harvesting food... if the gains were better and you earned 6 supply or 8 supply for wasting a day harvesting, then you could get somewhere.\n\nYou can however upgrade your ability to catch food and even though it takes a day, you'll get a perminent +1 to supply per day that passes... thus securing survivability for a single team member... that makes more sense... There's just a lot of weird and quirky things with this game I didn't like. The HUD and interface is abysmal at best... it feels like a cell phone game.\n\nThe only redeeming quality of this game is that you get to play as the Left 4 Dead squad, which is what kept my appeal going, however this is offset by the inclusion of the highly obnoxious Pewdiepie and his girlfriend Cutiepie character which I rolled my eyes at and cringed at the sight of.\n\nEither way, it's early access and I doubt it's going to get any better really... so far the upgrades are basic and there's room for improvement on those, other than that I think the game is pretty much finished in terms of game play... you just keep doing the same monotonous boring thing over and over again until you either die or get fed up and uninstall it like I have...\n\nCheers.","June 16, 2015","false","1.9"," 16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","46","16","35","5","1"

I’m serious, 12 bucks for a flash game? That’s a little unreal. But I did anyways and I’ve enjoyed it ever since. So what do you get for 12 bucks? A doge meme reference. Yep. No cool new characters (despite saying, “Get them on Steam!” they’re still locked up.) No new weapons as far as I can see. No new maps. Just a new doge at your base camp. That does nothing. It’s just as ridiculously difficult as the online version and I’m hoping that Toge builds some actual steam content into the game to offset the cost. Otherwise, you’re just paying for a free game.\nThe game will scale in difficulty based on how many days you spend and how much stuff you research. The game doesn’t understand the difference between advanced weaponry and farming, so you’re better off getting the weapons upgraded first. Don’t bother trying to do it on your own; you’ll quickly learn you’ll need as many characters as possible to go on raids and do research. Also, since research doesn’t yield experience, get used to kicking out characters as you cycle through better ones.\nThe bottom line is, prepare for disappointment. And an overwhelming, crippling addiction. Seconds after you rage quit, you’ll be starting a new game.

Squandering supplies or fuel is death, and if one of your Survivors is killed, their weapon, equipment, levels and skills are lost with them. Every Survivor is an investment.\n\nYet things can go wrong so quickly, and without warning, that it feels unfair at times. Survivors can't reload and move at the same time, so prolonged waves of zombies all but require that someone take the fall. They can seldom be outran or outmaneuvered in the landscapes.\n\nIn addition, while the lack of anything other than autosaves makes the game seem unfair, punishing small mistakes with the abject loss of considerable time and effort by killing off your last, desperate survivors as their guns click dry and they find themselves faced with a horde, it doesn't offer enough opportunities to refill those numbers, and when your survivors are dead, there's no "game over" screen, it just returns you to your most recent base camp, and sits there. You have to exit the game yourself. As if being defeated isn't bad enough, you must exit the game manually, erase the save file that now contains nothing, and start over.\n\nThe game has potential, and I've enjoyed the previous Infectionator titles, but I feel this game has a sense of artificial difficulty that keeps nagging at me. If you give your survivors the best weapons, then they quickly run out of ammunition. Apparantely it costs more ammunition to reload a 30 round rifle than it does a 30 round submachinegun. If you give them more modest, economic weapons then they are swamped, crying out their lack of ammunition.\n\nThe roguelikes elements are extremely well done, the skills management is effective, and levelling up is just difficult enough to make each skill point seem valuable, yet I feel the game could do with a tweak in the difficulty curve, particularly given that there is only one city, and yet the maximum level of difficulty is not impossible to find in it.\n\nRecommended, but only for those with time, patience, and a voluminous vocabulary of colourful language.","November 4, 2014","true","44.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I had emailed the developer once yet I waited NEARLY A MONTH for an update. The game WILL NOT launch on the Linux client by default. I have yet to find a solution. I have waited for a LONG time for the new Infectonator to come out. I have waited about a year or two I forget the years. This is one of the few reasons I got the Steam client. This is the reason Steam got my money. It was well spent money. But not on this. It is a complete piece of trash on the Linux client. It launches to a black screen. The only thing avalible to me is the logo splash and a black screen. I leave you with this. A chance to redeem your 13 USD from a TERRIBLE game that the developer DOSEN'T SUPPORT even though he has the client avalivle on Linux.

The developers really listen to the community when adding features and even in the alpha stages they've made it completely playable with hardly any bugs. Not all features seemed to improve the game though. For example, when scavenging mode was introduced it really took away from the overall game play in my opinion as it takes way too long to find every single zed and usually you'll end up with one that you can't find at all causing frustration. Nevertheless I'm very surprised how underplayed and under reviewed 'Infectonator : Survivors' is.

It offers challenging gameplay, with many special zombies (eg. fat or hazmat suit zombies) which will make it very tough to survive.  Plus, whenever one of your survivors dies it's a premadeath.  Kind of harsh, but it makes you actually value your survivors' health and adds an adrenalin rush every time one of your survivors is about to die or you're trapped.  In my opinion, the map type where you have to explore is excellent; it has fog of war, making you search for supplies and zombies, and you never really know what's out there (plus since zombies are more spread apart it's much easier to not get overwhealmed by a wave).","September 2, 2014","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you were hoping to buy early access to an almost finished game than these aren't the droids your looking for.\n\nPros:\n♥Well designed 'toy' concept\n♥Can scavenge for parts and guns\n♥Good use of ammo as money and well ammo\n♥Level up system with stat points\n♥Variety of characters and guns\n♥You can see where they are trying to go in terms of design and it's good, just isn't there yet.\n\nCons:\n♦Crafting system is more like a 'research' system because it takes forever even with 4 guys helping. Seriously from a design standpoint this should be broken down into 2 seperate things and crafting should be more instaneous and item based. Researching should be more time and skill based. Example: I spent 1.5 days learning (researching) how to craft armor. Why does each additional armor take 1.5 days, why not just take my materials and make it instant?\n♦There are some tough spots that might kill you, but right now it's very 'grindy' without much tension. If you go play their ArmorGames flash version I think that version had better tension.\n♦Item variety is very meh, a gun is a gun is a gun\n♦Not much use for turrets if you play "right" until later levels\n\nTips as of v0.54: Start waves as a fast as you can, spam where the button appears even. This will help you build up 4000+ ammo. Don't wander too far from base, just go out 1-2 and then do 1-2 more buildings on your way back. Goto buildings with (!) above them, rescue the guy and then put him to work on the crafting table. Level up 4 guys as crafters and 4 guys as scavengers. Give lots of HP to the scavengers.\n\nHave fun and good luck.\n","April 27, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are strong enough or have enough survivors, you can do both in one day (3 guys fighting, 2 upgrading, ...). The tower-defense places grow stronger every day and there are merchants where you can buy weapons.

Its pretty hard, like FTL or Desktop Dungeons. There are some bugs (I can't save the game) and there are non-implemented features (perks) but the game runs smoothly.\n\nYou begin with a group of survivors equipped with weak weapons and every day you can choose between fighting through two tower-defense places or upgrading your equippment. If you are strong enough or have enough survivors, you can do both in one day (3 guys fighting, 2 upgrading, ...). The tower-defense places grow stronger every day and there are merchants where you can buy weapons.

If you were hoping to buy early access to an almost finished game than these aren't the droids your looking for.\n\nPros:\n♥Well designed 'toy' concept\n♥Can scavenge for parts and guns\n♥Good use of ammo as money and well ammo\n♥Level up system with stat points\n♥Variety of characters and guns\n♥You can see where they are trying to go in terms of design and it's good, just isn't there yet.\n\nCons:\n♦Crafting system is more like a 'research' system because it takes forever even with 4 guys helping. Seriously from a design standpoint this should be broken down into 2 seperate things and crafting should be more instaneous and item based. Researching should be more time and skill based. Example: I spent 1.5 days learning (researching) how to craft armor. Why does each additional armor take 1.5 days, why not just take my materials and make it instant?\n♦There are some tough spots that might kill you, but right now it's very 'grindy' without much tension. If you go play their ArmorGames flash version I think that version had better tension.\n♦Item variety is very meh, a gun is a gun is a gun\n♦Not much use for turrets if you play "right" until later levels\n\nTips as of v0.54: Start waves as a fast as you can, spam where the button appears even. This will help you build up 4000+ ammo. Don't wander too far from base, just go out 1-2 and then do 1-2 more buildings on your way back. Goto buildings with (!) above them, rescue the guy and then put him to work on the crafting table. Level up 4 guys as crafters and 4 guys as scavengers. Give lots of HP to the scavengers.\n\nHave fun and good luck.\n","April 27, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was complete a few months ago when I purchased it, and it's added a lot since then. It's simple to pick up and play, and it's tough to master (especially when you take a break for a month and come back to new game mechanics!) which is a great feature of this game. The developers are trying to get the updates out, and usually focusing on major, imperative facets.\n\nSlight things have happened since I purchased this game (not the least of which is an increase in the price!) so there are bugs to occasionally look out for, but they've been dutiful in weekly updates (it'll be bi-weekly now, but I don't see that as a problem) and even updating in-between when bugs are noticed.\n\nThe developers are taking notice of what the community wants and responding by prioritizing that, and actually returning the feedback with in-game changes!\n\nIt's a very complete game, despite there still being a lot to add.

For an early acess game, there is already so much in the game. Sure, after almost a day in game it could get a little slow, but anyone can make things a little more fun by using only melee weapons or playing as pewds. I love they way the scavange system works and how to find survivors. My only hope for the game is that there is eventually a multiplayer gamemode or multiplayer campaign. I would reccomend this game to anyone who like picking up a new game to play for 30 min-1 hr at a time. Happy hunting!","February 9","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm pretty sure if they took their time instead of just thinking it up and slapping it on there you probably would have got the game alot more attention... who knows.\n\nI have 10 things that would make the survival mode kick serious ♥♥♥!\n\n1.Add more weapons, instead of the piece of junk pistol\n2.Get rid of the unnecessary loot that you find in objects.Like jumper cables,batteries,tires etc.\n3.Add health packs and guns that come from killing more difficult enemies\n4.Add more characters\n5.Make the characters have special abilities\n6.Add an upgrade system that goes with the survival mode. Example lets say the weeker enemies are worth 5 points and the harder ones are worth 10 to 15 making the bosses worth alot more, with that make it like every 500 to 1000 points to be able to upgrade the character\n7.Add online gameplay\n8.Make different levels for survival mode in addition add a level editor so people have the abbility to create their own levels and play them online with their friends\n9.Add a sells person in a random spot to buy guns and other things from\n10. This is the big kicker! Add dual wield to some of the characters or all of them\n\n","March 5","true","145.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
