Checking my play time with a total of 26 minutes and affirming that I have seen all that this game has to offer me is a bit annoying, even though this has been distributed as a freeware. Let's see, shall we?\n\nYou are a young man named Jung, who is waiting to meet a young girl named Ai for a date. When she arrives, you'll make a brief and ultimately meaningless choice of how to pass your time with her, get presented a dryly arranged twist at the end and forced to live a "realization" of what is it that you are doing with your life... I must say that I'm not impressed. For the ones that would like to avoid spoilers, please skip the next paragraph, ‘cause I feel obliged to present my opinion on a good idea executed poorly.\n\nAi is actually AI: an artificial intelligence developed to imitate the likeness of a human being. The game aims to question the whole content of humanity and what would make a perception or existence human. It is a bold topic to pick and arrange a game about, and it could have been something genuinely interesting only with better writing - added some decent philosophical inclination at least - and better content - more character development and event interaction. There has been countless brilliantly arranged media focusing on this theme - including Niccol's S1m0ne and Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence, so I would certainly recommend at least making some ground research on the philosophical background of the issue brought into attention next time picking such a loaded subject for the developer.\n\nFor the visual novel genre, writing is everything. Cheesy art work and the lack of diversity in CG animations can be forgiven considering this is a first attempt at creating a game, but any subpar writing would cripple a visual novel to a degree of becoming boring, meaningless and tasteless. Dialogues and events shared between our two characters are nothing interesting or imaginative. Sentences, definitions and jokes stand to become dry and forced, making it impossible to humanize our characters to begin with. Sadly, that was the whole purpose of the plot. When you come to the end in 8-10 minutes and got hit by the revelation, you are left uninspired rather than surprised.\n\nAs for the gameplay, you are presented only one choice option: "where will be spending your day with Ai?" Regardless of your choice, you'll end up going through the contents of two of the choices and come to the predetermined end. So, in 15 minutes, you can say that you'll be seeing all there is to see in this game, and there is nothing you'd feel inclined to recheck about after the first playthrough anyhow. Backgrounds are thrown around stock pictures and the repetitive soundtrack is so genuinely annoying, you'd mute the second time its looping without a thought. Ai's character design is cute, but it feels bland and unimaginative with the lack of appropriate emotes and CG animations.\n\nBy the end, give it a try to satisfy your curiosity if you like. There is an optional DLC consisting of the soundtrack and artwork if you feel like supporting the developer too. I hope to see better games coming from this developer in the future with at least some better narrative, considering his choice of theme seems to be promising. As it is though, I cannot recommend Carpe Diem since it has nothing remotely interesting to offer.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 15","false","0.4"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","44","53","0","4"

Not heaps, but it was ok.\n\n\n-The story only went for around 7min's (i'm not the fastest reader, but i wouldn't say i'm a slow reader either, so i'm maybe average??), but i was entertained for those 7min's, & thats what matters. It even surprised me at the end, which is always a bonus.\n-If you look at the art/ graphics on the store page, you've pretty much seen the art/ graphics for the whole game. I think there were 4-5 different backgrounds, with each background showing the same character, who's only variety was when she'd open & close her mouth during dialogue, as well as the occasional blink. Oh, sorry, i forgot, her cheeks also get red at times.\n-The music was fine. Mellow piano playing, but for only 7min's, so i didn't get sick of it.\n\nSo, the game altogether was ok. Nothing blow-away spectacular, but all in all, a good experience. Maybe if it was longer, i wouldn't have liked it as much.\n\nAlso, i haven't mentioned, this VN was the maker's first effort & it's free, so i think you've got to allow for that as well. I'd rather make an average first game than a crappy one, & this isn't crappy (just average).\n\n5/10\n\n\n\n","December 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","1"

The style of writing is simple and nice, the story itself is cute and reminds of good romantic films and anime. I do like the main female character – Ai - and her relationships with the main male character. I also like the way they speak to each other – nonchalant and simple, like real boys and girls do. I would really like to have the same type of relationships with my beloved one (when I finally find him).\n\nUnfortunately, any other information about characters and plot will completely ruin the gaming experience for those who will read this review, because the end will provide you with an interesting twist.\n\nPlease, find a few minutes to play the game – it is worth it and will bring you some positive emotions.

Thanks, Lily.  :D )\n\nSo, someone I know on Steam recommended this game to me, so I thought I'd look into it.   Common consensus I heard was "It's short".   After looking some reviews to see if it's good or bad, I read about the ending being a bummer, but not the details...the achievement name hinted it though....\n\nFor a brief moment, I debated playing it, but ended up saying "What the heck" and booted it up.   Within 15 minutes of reading it legit, it was over.  After reading all 3 routes, I found my final counter was about 30-31 minutes.\n\nPROS:\nCute date scenarios (Kinda' funny too.   Nice sense of humor)\nA girl that acts like a nice friend/girlfriend  (Nice waifu)\nShort (If you want something that doesn't drag on and can be finished quickly)\n+1 achievement\nFree\n\nCONS:\nShort (If you wanted more than a single date, then you may be disappointed)\nThe conclusion is bittersweet  (  She doesn't exist...and never will exist.  It's sad when fictional characters are better than real people...*sigh*  )\nDepressing achievement name\n\nIf you want a cute visual novel to pass the time with or want an easy, quick 100%, then this game should be up your alley.   It also seems to help if you're feeling a little lonely.\n\n7.5/10   It's cute.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=567341851","December 2, 2015","true","0.5"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","0"

(they are all covered but this spoiler filter).\nThis game is a short 'n' free visual novel about a guy called "Jung" and his "virtual" girlfriend "Ai" it's some kind of artificial super-intelligence, they are in a date or something ... i can't tell you anything else about the story because it's too short already (it took me about 20 mins to complete it).\nHere is a small list about the good/bad about this visual novel:\n+ Deep story, it's too short but believe me, this is one of the rarest gorgeous and meaningful piece of art.\n+ The game have some simple & nice drawn backgrounds and characters (there is only Ai tbh xD) as you can see in the screenshots here on the store page.\n+ the game is such a rich emotional experiment, it's a mix of  joy, wonder, love, jealous, curiosity, hope, interest and  grief ...\n+ there is some choices that can effect the game progressing, but not the endings (i mean it will take you to different places/will give you different dialog, it's worth to play the game again to see what will change if you choose this or this or this ..)\n+ it's free!\n+ easy achievement - 100% for those who cares for this things.\n- i've never noticed this, and i don't consider it as a cons but some people may be annoyed by the repetitive (is it?) music, or the lake of backgrounds & the short story or even the simple graphics (i can't imaging that it's possible for anyone to notice this or being annoyed for a really simple thing like this, but who knows? i've seen some weird things in other reviews, not only in this game ..)\nAnyways, i do think that this is one of the best visual novels out there, plus the developer is offering it for free so everyone should give it a try! even if you don't like this genre or you've never tried games similar to this, it's really worth the 7-30 mins of your time, 8.5/10!\n*** Last but not least i really wished "Al" was real i really did .. just damn .. what an anding :/\ni've no idea what i'm doing with my life, do you?! ***","January 18","true","0.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","0"

Is it a person that has the same taste as you? How about the direct opposite? I prefer the opposite as it can be attractive by the way of learning from each other however it does require patience on both sides. Whatever your take, here arrives Ai, your date in this game named Carpe Diem. An appropriate title to say the least – seize the day. Or maybe it’s better to say YOLO – you pick. Nevertheless, that’s the entire point of this game – seize the day. Enjoy your time with Ai as you can take her to the park, mall or even the arcades in the style of a visual novel albeit a short one.\n\nSo my choice is I took her to the arcades (for obvious reasons) and yes Ai and I had a great time. We even ate afterwards and then watched the fireworks later that evening.\n\nBut as the title states, Carpe Diem, enjoy your time as the ending is quite a head spinner.\n\nSidenote: the game is free however if you like the game, support the developer and buy the DLC for 99c.

You have a day to enjoy your date and see the world from Jung's point-of-view.\n\nLength wise it is not the longest VN I have come across, Id hazard a guess to say it is in fact one of the shortest Ive read, but it doesn't need to be any longer, it tells its story well in the period of time needed, some maybe disappointed at its short length but overall I didn't have a problem with it, although yes it would have been nice if it had gone longer.\n\nThe art style is some what basic but this can be forgiven all things considered, though I will say Carper Diem has a certain charm to it.\n\nThe music while like the art is pretty basic, however I will say it does try to add to the atmosphere and does its job as best it can to complement the game.\n\nOverall Carper Diem is a well written piece of work; Visually its alright, music its average however its the ending that is what really sold it for me.\n\nI'll leave you with this, Carper Diem is a good read and will no doubt keep you interested throughout its duration, and its absolutely free if that's not a good reason to check it out I don't know what is....so why not give it a try.\n\n(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)","April 13","true","20.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

It all depends on the creator whether his work will flourish or stay where it is.\n\nCarpe Diem is a free short Visual Novel that tells the story of a man meeting up with his girlfriend (but is that really?). I don't want to further spoil the story, as it is only a short VN, and you will get there eventually.\n\nI am absolutely amazed at how a simple VN turns out to be so fulfilling.\n\nCarpe Diem tackles about reality, and how you incorporate illusion from reality itself.\n\nAnd most of all,it tackled one of the most controversial aspects of an AI, which is the Turing's Test.\n\n\nPros:\n- Nicely-drawn character and background\n- Simple background music that is pleasing to the ear\n- A direct-to-the-point story plot\n- Light humor that incorporates to the conversation between the MC and the other character\n\nCons:\n- Very short VN (It is, indeed)\n- The choices seemed unecessary for me, as they do not really divert from each other.\n- Some CG with the MC and the MC would be nice, especially in some events.\n\n\n\nCarpe Diem may be the first VN of the creator, but I can confidently say that he can go a long way if he continues making VNs. I bought the Extra Package DLC to support this author. So if you liked this VN, please buy it too!\n\n\n\nOverall I'd totally recommend this to those who likes VNs. It may also teach you how to start making VNs for yourself, too.","January 6","true","0.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

She and the main character seemed to have a dispute at the start for things seemed a little awkard, but as the game progressed i found that the two had a special bond that couldn't be broken no matter how hard they tried. I felt this through all the stages of the game until the end. To say the least the ending was special and really makes me think into what the main character feels and what leads him to do what he did.

Carpe Diem is one of these: a short free kinetic visual novel that tells us the simple story of a rather average date between a surprisingly mundane guy and a young woman who relies a little too much on her childish charm.\nWhen I say short, I mean it: depending on reading speed, the story lasts barely 10-20 minutes, including two “play throughs” to see the dialogue at all three locations.\nFor the most part, the best term I can come up with to describe the writing is ‘cute’. Not fluffy pink clouds everywhere cute, just a nice little story about telling the event of a day-long date, with some surprise at the end. Nothing fancy, but if you decide to install it, you probably won’t regret spending that few minutes of your life on Carpe Diem.","March 15","true","0.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It took me 20 minutes to run through six routes (each of the three routes, twice). It's short, simple, and to the point. If you're looking for a vast plot, a deeply branching storyline, this is not it. But Carpe Diem proves that a good visual novel--a good game--doesn't need to be superfluous or complicated to be good. It's an experience that's relatable, personal, it'll make you feel something inside. I'm sure that most people who are reviewing this game positively, myself included, are doing so for this experience. The story is a real piece of art (if you disagree, you try writing something so short and effective, it's not easy), and the overall integration of all the elements (writing, art, music, pacing) makes this a masterpiece in the VN genre.\n\nFor the cost of 20 minutes, it's certainly worth experiencing. I'd recommend it to anyone.\n\nOh, and the title (or rather the title screen) will make more sense to you after you've beaten the game once.","February 5","true","0.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Jung is a programmer by trade that is focused on his work (not unlike myself back in the 1990s when I was developing database applications for credit reporting customers).  Ai is the person whom he was dating in the story.  The name Ai is also an acronym for "artificial intelligence", as we find out at the end of the story.\n\nThe intent of the story as described in the "Background" is true to the description.  Getting priorities straight goes a long way in real life, not just in the dating scenes in this game.  For that, I would give this game an "A" for the storyline and intent.\n\nI loved the music the developers chose for this game, though I would have chosen different pieces for each of the three choices you get at the first menu.  For example, I would have chosen for the mall scene a piece music that was commonly heard in shopping malls over the past 50 years.\n\nOverall, I liked this game so much, it gives me an idea for a visual novel.\n\nOverall Rating:  "A"\n","May 21","true","0.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Its got consistent (but rather bland) art with not many expressions and basic transitions.\n\nThe music is appaling, two or three very short loops of crappy synthesised pianos which drill in my head. I had to turn the music off.\n\nThe writing is what makes a visual novel, and sadly the writing is average. Its not bad, but it does not excel in any way. The visual novel trope of having the main character monolouge things to himself that would be known knowledge to them is present here for some reason which begs the question why words were wasted on it, considering the story is very short and is trying to be very on point with its message. The story gets the message over, and has an interesting idea, but sadly it does not really do anything with it.\n\nAs I said, this is a good first time effort and as practice for developing VN's its a good start, but as a consumer I don't see a reason to recommend this to anyone as the story does not even ask any questions or engage the player in any way.","February 10","false","0.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The thing that holds this game up is the end, and whether you are impacted by it or not depends on how you live your life (literally) and if you think the girl is cute enough to be your waifu.\n\nI didn't hate it. If anything, I think it had a lot of potential that was missed. While I was not impacted by the end compared to others due to my life outlook and because I predicted it, I understand the message being sent, and I personally think the game leading up to that moment could be improved upon. The dialogue is awkward and stiff at times, and both Ai and Jung sounded the same dialogue wise. I think if this was focused on a bit more, a believable feeling could have been created to impact the ending more. The writing could have also been improved in terms of their interactions, but I put this second to more believable dialogue showcasing the characters more. I also think just more art variation could have helped with Ai. I understand this is free, but at least one other pose could have been helpful rather than facial expressions (of which only 3 are used).\n\nIt's short, and has a chance of impacting you. I say it doesn't hurt to check this out, but for me I can only see missed potential in areas to improve the ending's impact.","December 4, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

This game only took me around 15 minutes to complete. There is one three-way choice in the game, and the story has a twist ending.\n\nPros:\n+There's very little art in the game, but what's there looks very good\n+Entertaining dialogue\n+Save file support (although the game is so short you're not going to need it)\n+It's completely free\n+Linux port\n\nCons:\n-There are grammatical errors here and there. It's only 15 minutes worth of reading, so it seems like the author could have gone through the trouble to do some grammar checking.\n-The boyfriend seems like kind of a ♥♥♥♥ at the start of the game, although you do start to understand him better as the game goes on, making him more likeable.\n-The twist at the end was a little cheesy.\n-I experienced a bug where if I tried to take a Steam screenshot, then every single button I pressed after that would take a screenshot. I was playing the Linux version of the game.\n\nHonestly, the ending of this game felt a little silly to me. However, the art is nice and the dialogue is good.

I'd highly recommend you to play it, the experience is quite sad in the end and the little plot twist really hits your feels.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justcallmefad/recommended/423880/","justcallmefad","Fad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justcallmefad/","5609 products in account","I'm personally not much of a fan of kinetic novels, because they usually contain a single unbranching story.\nCarpe Diem, despite having only one ending, gives the player some choices (albeit not a lot) in the game that create some branches in the story.\nHowever, each of choices that the player is given sort of intertwine with each other.\nWhen replaying the game and picking a different option, you'll notice that certain dialogues are reused in the branch.\nThe story itself isn't very long. It probably wouldn't take you more than an hour to try all the different options in the game.\n\nI find the assets in the game to be somewhat bland. The musics in the game aren't very interesting to listen to and I actually even muted the background music after a bit of playing and decided to just fire up Steam Music Player to listen to my own collection of songs as I play the game.\nThe scenery backgrounds look kinda odd to me. They don't seem to match the art style that was used to draw the main female Character, Ai. I think they could use some polishing.\n\nAnother shortcoming that I found in the game is the UI. While the UI of the menu doesn't look that bad, the UI for the controls are hardly visible.\nWhen I first started the game, I was very confused that I couldn't find the UI for standard controls to Save, Quick Save, Skip, etc.\nI thought I was supposed to somehow know all the possible shortcuts on my own, but as it turns out, the game does have UI implemented, but it's virtually invisible.\nIt was so difficult to spot, that I actually found it by accident when I pressed random buttons on my controller and accidentally selected one of the control button displayed in the\nbottom right corner of the screen.\n\nOverall, it's not a particularly bad game, but it can definitely use some improvements.\nI think the most important thing to address is the disappointingly short story.\nAdditionally, aside from all the other issues that I've mentioned above, I'd like to see some other improvements, perhaps some animation for the transition? Or some improvements for Ai's character?\nI mean, I'd say she's pretty likable, but I also find her to be somewhat unpredictable based on her reactions to certain situations :P\n\nI have some very mixed feelings about the game and it's a bit difficult for me to decide whether this is a game that I'd recommend to people who enjoy visual novels in general.\nHowever, despite all the shortcomings that I've mentioned above, the game did leave some impression on me, mainly because of the twist at the end.\nEven though, it was somewhat spoiled because I saw the achievement (that has now been renamed to something else) before I played the game, the twist was still a bit unexpected as one wouldn't be able to tell the details from just the achievement's name.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys visual novels and wanting to play some, go ahead and give this one a shot. It's short, but hey it's also free :D","November 30, 2015","true","0.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","4"

Think of this game as a prototype and not as a real game yet.\nI support the developer, the ideia is good and etc. Still there was not enough time for me to get a relationship with the female character so the end didn't impact me that much.\nAnd i would for sure change the background music and the title screen music. It's so high pitched that it becomes annoying after a while, making you want to turn your volume down.\nSo if the developer can read this, i have 3 major points for you.\n1- The Music for sure is annoying and there's no good game without a good soundtrack, get a better midi sound library.\n2- Make us expierience more time with the girl we're supposed to be in love with, making us wanting her to be a real character.\n3- Read 1 and 2 and make this prototype into a reality.

As a fan of anime and manga I'd been looking at visual novels with some curiousity, and decided to give this one a go because it was free and had 'very positive' reviews. After playing, I can say that while this game only provides one choice and is relatively boring it's excellently composed. Jung's downcast demeanor, forlorn commentary, and the repeating piano loop playing in the background foreshadow the end of the game. "What am I doing with my life?" All of this combined with the author's lack of intent to expand upon this title lead me to believe that the true purpose of Carpe Diem is to teach you not to waste your time on visual novels and/or dating simulators, and that is something I can recommend.","December 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I reccomend Capre Diem.","December 4, 2015","true","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"

I must say this game challenges the idea of time itself, whether or not we are part of it or it is all just an illusion. The themes brought out raises several issues that we are experiencing in this current era,  it expounds on this issues and presents it in several creative metaphorical representations. This is also beautifully mixed with a great peaceful background soundtrack to emphasize  on the powerful emotions that you will  experiencing in the game. Do enjoy this game ! it is certainly a one of a kind game with great achievements as well. Overall a 8/10 for the gameplay and a 9/10 for the beautiful soundtrack.

I only decided to try this one as the trailer looked nice and the reviews were mostly positive.\n\nStory starts off with a guy (you) meeting his supposed girlfriend or love interest in the park. Tons of clicking through pointless conversation between them then follows.\n\nThey talk about things like rice balls, cooking, co-workers, and shopping, and other supremely mundane stuff. As one of the things I greatly abhor is small talk (I find it a waste of time - either get to the point or scram), I found myself quickly losing interest and patience.\n\nHowever, it turns out I still managed to finish this game. And that's because it lasted a mere total of 3 minutes.\n\nI couldn't really see the point of why this was made, frankly.\n\nThis was like a mash-up of the movie "Her" (2013) and "Uncanny" (2015). I would say, watch "Uncanny" instead.","January 15","false","0.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

First of all the reason this game is getting so much praise is because of all these damn weebs and another thing I noticed in a positive review for this game.\nA user stated that "Splendid visual novel, great music and storyline!". Reading this sentence I wanted to blow my damn brains out becuase well first of all the music is so so so bad. There is about a minute until the music ends then there is about a  1 second pause and music starts up again. However I was suprised that there was yet another song added at the end so props for that.\nAnother thing is that there is absolutely no substance to this game. I've counted about 5 differant facial expression changes on the "AI" character and it's a complete wase of time to play. I ended up finishing it in about 4-6 minutes. But the story is just the main character Jung (which you never get to see sadly) and AI talking about nothing, absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nothing. All for what? A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending that made every Weeaboo that played this game cry. Just a complete waste of time.\nAnd this visual novel isn't very visual. What I mean by this is that there are about 8 or so mediocre scenes that you get to stare at whilst you look at AI. Sounds fun right? Another thing is that there is no immersion. Honestly I love gameplay I love the feeling like i'm in the setting but this game doesn't even attempt to bring that to the table. It's your character and AI just talking about nothing in peticular with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looping soundtrack and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ backgrounds.\n\nCONCLUSIONI blame the damn weebs","December 4, 2015","false","0.3"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","53","17","32","8","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azba/recommended/423880/","Azba","Azba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azba/","663 products in account","Carpe Diem is pretty much exactly as it describes itself. It's a short VN with one non-critical decision and a pretty ok story and conclusion for its length. It won't take you more than 10 or so minutes to give it a look, and considering it's free and you're probably reading this on its store page, why not?\n\nPros:\n+Art is pretty good, even if there's not much to see.\n+Delivers a message you might pay $5+ to see from some other indie game, for free and with less pretension in less time!\n+Has a pretty fully fleshed out options menu for a 10 minute game. All your VN basics are there including saves and dialog skipping, skip only seen etc.\n+Multiple language support.\n+You can buy an extras pack DLC if you want to support the developer. It doesn't contain content locked out from the main game so you won't miss out on anything either.\n?Easy perfect game for your steam achievements collection.\n\nNeutral points:\n=I guessed the twist before I started the game.\n=The only choice in the game isn't too important since each route can lead to at least one of the other locations you can pick from eventually. You will miss a few scenes if you don't try them all though.\n=The music isn't great but I also didn't find it annoying.\n=No voice acting but I'd hardly expect that from a free game and let alone a dev's first VN.\n\nCons:\n-There's quite a few grammatical errors, at least in English. I cannot speak for the other languages available. UPDATE: Eyzi has corrected the mistakes I spotted.\n-The writing is a little stiff. Would have benefited from some creative writing techniques. It's not all bad though, both Jung and Ai have some character to them. Some.","December 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

The art style is certainly interesting, having almost a sort of retro vibe to it, which does a good job in enticing the reader. Though quite short, the actual story itself is enjoyable and carries itself well, containing a nice, calm ambiance (until the final few seconds). Combined with it's underlying themes of friendship along with technology, what we do with it and how it affects us just adds that much more to the overall experience.

Even though I have no lover, I push on. I look at my life's future and I await the day when I meet that one true person. Yes I've played dating sims before but more for learning how the wrong decisions can ruin relationships and learn the stories of the characters. I go out and I work at my job to keep my family happy. I may be in a place where I may not feel the happiest I could be but I cannot rush things. I still have a whole life ahead of me (as I write this at the age of 23).\n\nOnto the experience, as you can't call it a game due to the very short story. It does make those of you who sit at home and do nothing think. It makes you realise that there is more out in the world than just being indoors. There are people out there who you can talk to, befriend, become lovers with, and marry. While this can crush someones heart it can inspire them at the same time to change. The game says that you must not waste your time for if you do you may never be happy, thus the program crashing. Make the most of your time and go out and explore!\n\nHonestly....\n\nWhat are you doing with your life?","December 4, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a short VN with one non-critical decision and a pretty ok story and conclusion for its length. It won't take you more than 10 or so minutes to give it a look, and considering it's free and you're probably reading this on its store page, why not?\n\nPros:\n+Art is pretty good, even if there's not much to see.\n+Delivers a message you might pay $5+ to see from some other indie game, for free and with less pretension in less time!\n+Has a pretty fully fleshed out options menu for a 10 minute game. All your VN basics are there including saves and dialog skipping, skip only seen etc.\n+Multiple language support.\n+You can buy an extras pack DLC if you want to support the developer. It doesn't contain content locked out from the main game so you won't miss out on anything either.\n?Easy perfect game for your steam achievements collection.\n\nNeutral points:\n=I guessed the twist before I started the game.\n=The only choice in the game isn't too important since each route can lead to at least one of the other locations you can pick from eventually. You will miss a few scenes if you don't try them all though.\n=The music isn't great but I also didn't find it annoying.\n=No voice acting but I'd hardly expect that from a free game and let alone a dev's first VN.\n\nCons:\n-There's quite a few grammatical errors, at least in English. I cannot speak for the other languages available. UPDATE: Eyzi has corrected the mistakes I spotted.\n-The writing is a little stiff. Would have benefited from some creative writing techniques. It's not all bad though, both Jung and Ai have some character to them. Some.","December 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

While it is free It is extremely short. However, that is probably it's greatest strength. It's charming and lasts just long enough to be interested in the characters and not bore. Even with the story on the slowest Auto setting I managed to take all three routes within an hour while taking a snack break between each turn. That's right there are only 3 routes, each of which ends the same way. Each playthrough will follow the same general path. The twist at the end tho changed the way I thought about the story during my second and thrid play through.\n\nThe story and music were delightful. The only real complaint I have is that there isn't enough art. There are a total of 6 backrounds and you will spend most of that time looking at a slightly changing Ai. There are a few interesting parts to the story that I would have loved to see. For such a short story with such limited content this was a true missed opportunity. All in all I really enjoyed this first attempt and I look forward to how Eyzi, the developer, grows from here.","December 24, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will really enjoy it. It's short, it's free; you don't have any excuses. I can't tell you any reasons because it would spoil the whole game, so you will have to trust me here: you should deffinetively give it a chance.\n\n\nSpoiler-loaded review:Despite looking like a simple idea at first glance, the point is that it works. There could be 50000 visual novels that talk about seizing the day through the experiences of their characters, but only in this one the line that differences between the character and you is so thin that is dfficult to draw. This is not an inspiring pre-recorded message, it's a slap of reality aired live.\n\nThe problem is that the target audience of this game, the people who can synergize with it, is very narrow. The only people who will really catch the message are those fans of the visual novels, anime and manga that take their hobby a step further in a bad way.\n\nAnd yes, we could talk about that all this could have been executed in a better way; in the end what we've been reviewing until now its the idea per se, not the product offered here. The point is that it could seem that a better execution could have permitted that this game, this message, arrived to a wider audience, but I don't think so. The message this game wants to send us is very simple. You don't have to adorn it more because the public it aims for is rarely talked about this theme. A one on one conversation about this conflictive topic, from a position that usually inspires safety and comfort: it's the only thing you need to get this message through.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a niche piece, executed in a simplistic way (but let's no forget that this is the author's first work, Eyzi, who happens to be an indie developer that works by him/herself), but very interesting and that will surely work with a lot of people. Deffinetively very worth of checking out.\n\n\n!Disclaimer! This is my first visual novel and my first steam review, so I might be full of sh♥t. But my intention is that this review does justice to the game, the public and the author, so I will gladly appreciate any critique to it; thanks for reading.","February 17","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It makes you ask yourself what you really are doing with your pitiful and insginificant life. Who could have guessed that the character named AI was an actual AI in a computer game. I found myself connecting with her and then became emotionally unstable once I found out the truth. I spiraled into a deprtession turning to alcohol for the support that my beloved AI could not lend me since she was forever sealed away in the virtual world. I love AI and one day I will make her real so we can continue our life together at the mall buying gtx titans, spider keychains and slamming each other over the head due to our excessive tilt from street fighter at the arcade.","December 24, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

While it is free It is extremely short. However, that is probably it's greatest strength. It's charming and lasts just long enough to be interested in the characters and not bore. Even with the story on the slowest Auto setting I managed to take all three routes within an hour while taking a snack break between each turn. That's right there are only 3 routes, each of which ends the same way. Each playthrough will follow the same general path. The twist at the end tho changed the way I thought about the story during my second and thrid play through.\n\nThe story and music were delightful. The only real complaint I have is that there isn't enough art. There are a total of 6 backrounds and you will spend most of that time looking at a slightly changing Ai. There are a few interesting parts to the story that I would have loved to see. For such a short story with such limited content this was a true missed opportunity. All in all I really enjoyed this first attempt and I look forward to how Eyzi, the developer, grows from here.","December 24, 2015","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will really enjoy it. It's short, it's free; you don't have any excuses. I can't tell you any reasons because it would spoil the whole game, so you will have to trust me here: you should deffinetively give it a chance.\n\n\nSpoiler-loaded review:Despite looking like a simple idea at first glance, the point is that it works. There could be 50000 visual novels that talk about seizing the day through the experiences of their characters, but only in this one the line that differences between the character and you is so thin that is dfficult to draw. This is not an inspiring pre-recorded message, it's a slap of reality aired live.\n\nThe problem is that the target audience of this game, the people who can synergize with it, is very narrow. The only people who will really catch the message are those fans of the visual novels, anime and manga that take their hobby a step further in a bad way.\n\nAnd yes, we could talk about that all this could have been executed in a better way; in the end what we've been reviewing until now its the idea per se, not the product offered here. The point is that it could seem that a better execution could have permitted that this game, this message, arrived to a wider audience, but I don't think so. The message this game wants to send us is very simple. You don't have to adorn it more because the public it aims for is rarely talked about this theme. A one on one conversation about this conflictive topic, from a position that usually inspires safety and comfort: it's the only thing you need to get this message through.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a niche piece, executed in a simplistic way (but let's no forget that this is the author's first work, Eyzi, who happens to be an indie developer that works by him/herself), but very interesting and that will surely work with a lot of people. Deffinetively very worth of checking out.\n\n\n!Disclaimer! This is my first visual novel and my first steam review, so I might be full of sh♥t. But my intention is that this review does justice to the game, the public and the author, so I will gladly appreciate any critique to it; thanks for reading.","February 17","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Similar can be said about writing, simple, easy to read, but it lacks certain something to make it more appealing :)\n\nSince this game is free and it has only one achievement (for achievement hunters, easiest pray :), cool premise and ending, with not much cons about it (ok, we can argue about sound and writing), it is recommended to try this short story out..\n\nP.S. and yea, this is my first 100% achievement completed game XD","March 23","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not that hard to figure out before the ending hits you, but I didn't try to, because I didn't know I needed to, plus the writing is pretty good, so I was immersed into the world pretty quickly. For a short graphic novel and just all in all for a game it's definitely 10/10, maybe 9/10 if you count "being too short" as a con. My god that ending was unexpected, but cool. Just like the game.

I like the concept, and I'd like to see it revisited with more gusto and foresight.\n\nThe game asks you to take a moment and contemplate what exactly you're accomplishing while sitting around and playing games (and mayhap more directly—"gal games[en.wikipedia.org]"), so keeping it short and to the point does not taunt the player as much. The tradeoff of having a more fleshed out plot and actually trying to get the player invested would yield a much more effective result; albeit, an initial negative reaction.","December 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a good way to make the time pass and the wording was kinda clever *SPOILERS :P* "A side I only see when we play at home together" and also at the ending when *SUPER SPOILERS* u see what she is, ur like "Oh.

The game is short but the way it's written is just perfect. I think visual novels are hard to write as a writer myself because dialogue can seem so forced. In this it seemed brilliant. It had an overarching meaning to it as seen in the end. If you don't notice it in the beginning you might very well seem depressed for a few minutes. It also hints at it subtly in the story. They never overdid the suggestion besides one, that we all know now. Still, that does beg the question: What are we doing with our lives? That's kinda deep.

That said, I enjoyed this brief experience.\nI feel like the ending was a little heavy-handed but was certainly a twist and even a little self-aware/satirical. On the whole, the writing wasn't phenomenal, and is a skill the developer will need to work on if they are serious about working within this particular genre.\nThe character design was pretty good, I liked the hairstyle. All in all I'm not a very 'visual' person so I can't provide too much feedback in that regard (as I'm writing this I'm realising I didn't even pay attention to the backgrounds). One thing I would have liked to have seen implemented though was for Ai's graphic to have changed when she tried on a new outfit; it was kind of weird when she asked ~"How do I look?" and I'm thinking "Uh, the same?".\nThe music playing through most of the story was a nice and upbeat, and fit the mood of the story. Transitions were abrupt though, and I did not dig the title screen music at all.\n\nI suppose I come across as a little negative; I'm trying to be constructive :3\nIt is a pretty coherently designed first work and I expect the dev. to go onto some bigger and better things (hopefully having come across the review at some point).","December 14, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Which reminds me of the simple truth that opposites attract and yet such differences also cause friction.\n\nDisliked:\nI simply didn't understand why Jung would question, what he was doing with his life after his Ai girl friend crashed. I had noted that Jung appeared to enjoy her company, despite the considerable limitations of their relationship. Why should his relationship as it was, with some manner of synthetic (software) individual be judged as anyway inferior to any other relationship, real or imagined, synthetic or otherwise?\nIt is evident that many people live their lives in a very lonely fashion, yet PC (Personal Computer) uptake appears to be considerable. Therefore the thought experiment that the game explores, namely human beings developing relationships with Ai software has considerable merit. Many lonely people with access to PCs and such software could develop relationship within the technological constraints of such. I argue then that numerous people's lives could be bettered by the ubiquitous use of such Ai. I suggest that far be it from questioning his own life, Jung, could improve his Ai and eventually with persistence, make a lot of lonely people happier. Maybe even himself.\nThe implied notion that there is a perfect (or even any) partner just waiting for each of us to approach in real life, is naive and I argue, the greatest fantasy associated with this game.\n\nGood gaming,\nAlter\n\nI suggest that we all enjoy our fantasies, they may be all we have, they may be all we will ever have. I recommend against denouncing them as somehow inferior or unworthy and suggest instead embracing them as part of who we are.","December 2, 2015","false","0.2"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","16","31","4","0"
