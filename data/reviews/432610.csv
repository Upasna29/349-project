I don't believe I'm color blind, so I did not understand what was up with that.\n\nOverall, it's an interesting game but the puzzles are far too complex and tedious to solve, I would only recommend this to the most hardcore of puzzle-solvers.","March 16","false","4.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","11","13","3","4"

Not a complete waste but still left me disappointed.","March 24","false","2.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Video capture software that hooks into the fullscreen have crashed the game for me too, but screen capture still works. Walking around feels a bit jittery at first, but that feeling faded away from me as I kept playing. The UI, although a really neat design idea, is sometimes tedious to use.\n\nThat said, it offers a large variety of puzzle concepts, some of which I've never seen before. My absolute favourite is probably the Pneumonics door lock you encounter early in the game (most likely because I love puns/word play). A few puzzles could be more obvious though, like the voice activated door that I found no hint for being that.\n\nDespite its shortcomings, I think that this is a fantastic game, with some puzzles being harder or easier for you than for other people, but certainly not impossible in conjuction with the built-in hints system.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSlXcBSylaM&index=18&list=PL3gilQXLG8aDbeSGGUENLz-knPJWUAbGE","May 19","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think the developer tried, and succeeded, in making it so frustrating it is not fun to play.  I got hooked on puzzle games with the Myst series and loved them all.  Then puzzle games seemed to disappear from the stores.  I was so excited when I found out steam had some of these, I tried Talos and it was OK but nothing compared to Myst.  Then I bought Monumental and was totally disappointed.  For example the hints are not helpful, there are hardly any clues to solve the puzzles, the game is jerky and slow, on the disco puzzel a slight mis-step and the wrong tile activates so you have to start over.  I have given up on it. To frustrating.  I have given up on steam also if they don't check out these games before selling them.","April 21","false","16.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I haven't played much yet but I fiddled with the options menu and tried a bunch of different resolutions, and the game didn't crash once. My pc runs with an AMD Radeon HD 6800 graphics card, in case that's useful info.\n\nI'm too early in the gameplay to comment on the actual game, but for now it looks good and it seems to be working just fine, so if you like this kind of first person exploration/puzzle game, give it a try - in my experience the game did not crash.\n\n","January 23","true","0.2"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","0"

Controls are a little iffy and there seems to be some input lag problems but the story seems decent and the puzzles are pretty good. Graphics are also not too bad most of the time but there are some parts that look horrible but hey they are usually in places where you are not usually looking to be fair. If you want to see more i would appreciate if you watched my video on it :)","January 27","true","3.3"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","0"
