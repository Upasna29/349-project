It very much reminds me of many old home computer games from the '80s, complete with droning, looped music. For some reason, Zorro and Dr. Who on the C64 come to mind, but It's not a lot like either of them. There's something about it that reminds me of games like those.\n\nYou can morph between 4 forms, each with a special ability to get past obstacles. It takes one heart of HP to switch, so this makes it a bit puzzle-y to get past some parts without being stuck in a form that doesn't help you proceed.\n\nIt could do a better job of explaining what's going on. I'm running around and picking things up with no idea what some of them are for.\n\nI can't get it to go full screen, just a maximized window.\n\nI'll post more once I've put more time in it.\n\nEdit:\n\nI finished it in 4 hours, 20 minutes. I feel like it took me longer than it should have taken. I had to redo a couple of parts many times because I kept making the same mistakes.\n\nIt was definitely fun for the most part, but was quite frustrating in a couple of places where you have to quickly switch between two forms while in the air. There are also several places where it drops things on your head that you can't see are there because of the timer at the top.\n\nIt relies heavily on jumping off the edge of a ledge and curving back to a ledge above you. It's easy to miss this jump and have to climb back up a few ledges.\n\nYou know that one enemy in a some games (usually bats) that are super annoying and you absolutely hate them? This game has about 3 of those kinds of enemies.\n\nOverall, it was a lot of fun and I do recommend it if you are ok with a few frustrating parts.","January 19","true","4.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Music is somewhat catchy but extremely short loops, scrolling isn't smooth despite the serious hardware I'm running on, and difficulty is more a function of distance from a save point than any other factor. It's tough to rate the central morphing mechanic, as the game regularly provides multiple paths suitable to more than one morph (and a few optional spots that you need two morphs in quick succession), yet in practice you'll end up playing in one particular morph without switching (given that the game wants you to try to avoid switching).  Overall, sadly cannot recommend.","January 19","false","1.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"
