I will try to review Chronicles based on its quality relative to the other classic games in the series (i.e. the ones developed by Core).\n\nCompared to the first four classic games, Chronicles is fairly short and (for me) probably the easiest out of the five "Core classics". I enjoyed the varied settings in the game's 13 levels, and I think the developers did a great job in creating a suspenseful atmosphere despite a dated graphics engine relative to that time period of PC gaming. To support this atmosphere, there are plenty of varied puzzles (although they are nowhere near as difficult as Tomb Raider 3's puzzles), good use of ambient sound effects to set the mood, an emphasis on exploration and, for a number of levels, a fun avoidance/stealth-based mechanic where the clunky combat is non-existent.\n\nChronicles is split into four locations and unfortunately I feel that only the first location (Rome) has that traditional tomb-raiding feel which I so dearly love. I don’t mind the occasional “modern-day” level; however I felt that Chronicles was a bit too heavy on modern-day exploration (more than half of the levels are in modern-day settings). This is a matter of taste, but one of the things I really appreciated about some of the older Tomb Raider games was getting immersed in the lore of Ancient or lost civilizations. So, while the atmosphere of Chronicles is overall still suspenseful and well-crafted, I felt that the game lacked that “epic feeling” that certain levels of previous Tomb Raider games provided (I’m looking at you, Temple Ruins of Tomb Raider 3 and St. Francis’ Folly of Tomb Raider 1).\n\nTLDR: Chronicles is a decent “classic” Tomb Raider game, despite it being relatively short and easy, and lacking a certain epic atmosphere that all 4 previous games possessed. I would only recommend it if you have played some of the other classics (i.e. 1-4) and are just looking to add to your collection for a very cheap cost ($6.99 for approximately 10 hours of gameplay). If you’re completely new to the series and are looking to start your Tomb Raider experience, start with Tomb Raider 1, or, if you can’t tolerate the outdated graphics of the Core classics, start with Tomb Raider: Legend developed by Crystal Dynamics.\n\nJust for reference, here’s how I would rate Tomb Raider 5: Chronicles relative to the other Tomb Raider games I have played, from best to worst:\n\nTomb Raider 1\nTomb Raider 3\nTomb Raider: Anniversary\nTomb Raider: Legend\nTomb Raider 2 (Read my review)\nTomb Raider 5\nTomb Raider: Underworld\nTomb Raider 4\n\n(I haven’t played Angel of Darkness or Tomb Raider 2013)","August 14, 2014","true","12.8"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","6"

Will the fifth part of the franchise meet the expectations?Hint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR section.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●\nIt is the year 2000, five years have passed since the first Tomb Raider game was developed by Core Design and published through Eidos Interactive. Five years of changes in its development, gameplaywise and graphicwise, marks one of the most known franchises. But something just did not went the way it should have, so it seems.\n\nMonths after Lara's adventure in egypt she still has gone missing and is now presumed dead. After a memorial in her honor, the bereaved sit together and relate about some of her biggest adventures. Four small stories await the player: the hunt for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome, the Spear of Destiny in Russia, a short trip to the haunting places in Ireland and a thievery in a high-tech office complex to gain the Iris artefact again, that Lara has found back in Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation.\n\nCompared to Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation nothing much has changed. The graphics and also the engine are carried over from the previous game. Still, Lara got even in this small follow-up new movements, which refresh the gameplay a little bit. She is now able to balance on tightropes, swing around on a horizontal bar and perform a somersault out of tight spaces.\n\nThe stories are self-contained, which means that everything the player collects in the sublevels will not get carried over into the next story. This counts for weapons incl. the ammunition, as well as for medikits, what makes hoarding them pretty much useless. Yet, with the different armories the player has now the opportunity to play with the Desert Eagle and the Revolver in one game.\n\nLevel design and also the "puzzles" are mostly very confusing and seem not well-conceived. This ends not unusually in frustration, since the player gets stuck more often in a level than in the previous games - with the need to get a hand on a guide.\nThe difficulty rises up harshly and since there is no way to change the difficulty at all, the players are either forced to clench their teeths and play through the hardest parts with/without a guide or to give up near the end.\n\nTomb Raider V: Chronicles could have been a great space filler between TR IV and TR The Angel of Darkness. Sadly, it could not even reach the greatness from the past classic Tomb Raider games.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nThe high expectations I had on Tomb Raider V: Chronicles while following the journey through the very first level were cut down rapidly. On its release I skipped it for several reasons without knowing what could stand behind the fifth game of this big franchise. The whole game itself felt more like an add-on for Tomb Raider IV than an actual follow-up, created in a hurry. The idea behind the stories was great and interesting yet poorly executed and after a while very boring. Tomb Raider V: Chronicles is compared to the other classic games only a weak tail light and does not show the actual intensity of the earlier games.\nAlso the difficulty made me rage more than one time, since many solutions were not clear and did not make much sense. In the very last story - I have to admit - my patience and passion just passed away and I did not mind going any further. The fact, that I had to use guides did not satisfy me and in the end I had to uninstall the game unfinished.\n\nSadly, I can not recommend it, not even for fans of this franchise.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n\n[✔] Interesting idea of self-contained stories\n[✔] Each story has its own armory\n[✔] New acrobatic moves\n[✔] Contains a level editor\n\n[✖] Confusing level design and puzzles, plus hardly possible to play some parts without a guide\n[✖] Items don't carry over into the next story\n[✖] Game feels more like an add-on than an actual follow-up\n[✖] Clunky keyboard-only controls\n[✖] Graphics still primitve compared to todays standards\n[✖] Fixed camera, only possible to move Lara's head\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celestial-stasis/recommended/225000/","celestial-stasis","SanctionBless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celestial-stasis/","100 products in account","Tomb Raider Chronicles received mixed reviews and was criticized for the fact that "it started becoming more of the same" and I agree; both this and TR4 utilize the same game engine and TR2 and 3 utilized a similar engine, this is very easy to notice in game. Although I agree with this, I will be reviewing Chronicles as a game in its own respective right and disregard its predecessors.\n\nThe game on the whole acts as a memorial tribute to Lara Croft who is presumed dead (after the events of TR4). The game is comprised of 13 levels which are split into 4 "acts". Each act tells a story of one of Lara's many past adventures, reminisced by her butler and past friends. Her adventures vary from her quest in search of the Philosopher's stone in Rome to infilrating a high-security tower block in New York to steal the Iris. There is a fair amount of variety in the game that stops it from getting bland and boring.\n\nThe vital, important aspect that's always held up well in the Tomb Raider games are the puzzles in them; whilst the puzzles in Chronicles aren't as complex and mind-boggling as the puzzles in the previous games (especially TR4) there are still there and keeps you constantly thinking and questioning in the game.\n\nIn terms of the graphics in the game, there isn't much to say, as mentioned it utilizes the same engine as TR4 and therefore looks exactly the same in terms of graphic detail. For a 2000 game, it really doesn't look that bad.\n\nSound was another aspect of Chronicles that was criticized, with it being viewed as mediocre; I personally slightly agree with this, the sound in Chronicles doesn't exactly stand out, it is very ambient and takes the "back seat" for the majority of the game, only in particular flybys or boss fights that there is distinctive music. A lot of music has also been reused from The Last Revelation, which is slightly disappointing.\n\nThe game itself is very short compared to the previous games, it took me only 5 hours to beat however I have played the game countless times in the past (I grew up around this game) so it may take a new player slightly longer. Is there a lot of replay value in the game? Not really, there are secrets in each level which are quite hard to find/gain access to and finding all of them will unlock some special features from the menu. However, finding all secrets would require you to play through the entire game again if you miss one as there is no level select and finding them all only unlocks concept and cinematic art, so is it really worth it?\n\nDespite the mediocre sound and shortness of the game, I would recommend this game. Is it my nostalgia recommending it? Yes and no; I believe new players will find the game engaging and puzzling from start to finish there's quite a bit of variety and challenge in the game, don't be expected to just gun the bosses down, there is some challenge involved and skill needed and I feel that makes it worthy of the £4.99 that it costs.","December 13, 2013","true","9.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcasleite/recommended/225000/","mcasleite","Cpt.Ziltoid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcasleite/","137 products in account","In this game you play 4 different Lara's adventures: her search for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome, her hunt for the Spear of Destiny (imo, this is the best level of Chronicles), her adventure on the Black Isle (only puzzles on this one, 'cause you play with a younger Lara who doesn't use guns yet) and the final level is her infiltration on Werney Von Croy's high-tech complex to retrieve the Iris Artefact (the one you see at the beginning of The Last Revelation).\nEven though TR: Chronicles isn't as good as its predecessors, it still is a great game. Chronicles uses the same engine from The Last Revelation, which improved Lara's movements, making it much easier to play, but the graphics are still the same (not a bad thing, it's really good for a PS1-era game). The variety of the scenarios got my attention here: you go from the Coloseum to the deep of the ocean to the island of Lost, among others. I highly recommend this if you're a fan of the series, but if you're just starting to play the old TR games, check out TR 2 and The Last Revelation first (I know some people don't like TLR, but it was my first TR game so it has a special place in my heart). The only really bad thing is the save bug on the last minutes of the game, so make sure you don't save only on one slot and search on the internet where the bug starts to cause problems and you'll be good to go.","December 12, 2013","true","12.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucassm/recommended/225000/","lucassm","Darius Vulkius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lucassm/","818 products in account","Tomb Raider: Chronicles, as it name said, was a Tomb Raider game launch for PC and PS1 with a try to explore many different Lara's adventures. But did he made it? Well, we will discover it on this review.\n\nFirst, i need to say: When i firstly played this game, i found it pretty good. But by the time i've played it i was way younger. Today, my opinion as changed a bit. Let's go to the topics.\n\nGraphics: This game uses the same engine from Tomb Raider 4: The Last Revelation, with a little improvement over the textures. Overall, they're pretty good to look at and does it job for a Tomb Raider game.\n\nSoundtrack: Overall, pretty forgetable. The only music i could remember was the menu music. And that's it. And i really mean it. Music is almost not present on gameplay, most of time you will only hear ambient sounds, like in the previous game. But at least i felt that in the previous title, it felt more present. The only times i heard music were during the cutscenes, but most of them were "suspense music" and not really catchy. Witch let me down since Tomb Raider is a game known for it's orchestred music track.\n\nGameplay: It pretty much remained the same from the fourth title, it only added a few new moves. Lara could run, jump, climb almost everywhere, and fall down through vents while crouched and looking forward (In the old game, you could only do that if you rotated 360).\nGunplay is the same from the fourth title, featuring the manual aim from the combination of Revolver + Laser Sight. But not only it. As the game tried to bring new weps, guess what...DESERT EAGLE IS BACK! Yeah! After a whole game without it, i can't express how i missed it so much. It kills enemies with one shoot, holy mackina. Finally.\nAlso, many other new guns were introtuced, especially at the VCI levels. And in these levels, were present a stealth mode. For the very first time in a Tomb Raider game, you could only kill enemies without being detected (Because you lost you weapons at these levels). Different from other levels were you got no weps, you could at least make your way to kill all the enemies.\nNew enemies were introduteced, as well a new level of teen Lara. Everything works fine and it's well constructed. This game is more puzzle-like than the fourth one. But if i can say something from this game is that its SHORT.\nIt could be bigger and i will tell you why at the end of the review.\nAlso: Secrets are back. But finding them is a pain. Because your statistcs are not per stage, but global. You can't know witch stage has a secret neither how many one level has. If this game wasn't that short, it would be a pain getting it all.\nI can't remember if TR 4 was like that, so i can't say anything about it.\nCheats in this game are a little different from the fourth one and harder to do. But they still exist.\nA stage consists of getting to point A to B or completing certain tasks to do so, not many problems. There are mini bosses throught some stages and they aren't that challenging. No real boss at the end tough (Trapping him feels the same as trapping Seth), witch felt a bit empty.\nThere are a few unlockables at this game as you find the secrets, they all had screenshoots of the next gen of Tomb Raider witch was...TRAOD. Damn, it just ain't worth when you already know the finished product.\n\nStory: Here was the weakest point of this game. At least, for me. The CANON MAIN TIMELINE of Tomb Raider pretty much remains UNTOUCHED. The only thing revealed at the end of the game, surprise, surprise, Lara is still alive. In the CANON NOT MAIN TIMELINE, pretty much nothing is explored from Lara's past, except for the young stage. But even there, not much is explored. It just feels that they put Lara's on random adventures with an excuse. And this game also has a big hole conection between him and TRAOD. Vernom was the one who discovered Lara was alive, searching for her all the days of many months. But when you start TRAOD, Lara says: "You left me on Egypt". HOW?! Damn. Another thing that's never explained is how Lara survived from the TR4 ending. At least in the game. In the book series, there's one book that explain how. I never read it, so i can't say anything, but it's there.\nFocusing on the adventures on Lara's "chronicles", it divided in four acts.\nThe first one, Lara is looking for the phylosophy stone, with a little "help" of Pierre and Larson. The only strange thing on this chapter is the Pierre fall. How the hell did he survived it? We already knew in Tomb Raider 1 that Lara knew Larson and Pierre from a long time before, that matches. But Pierre falling to his death...What the hell?!\nThe second one, Lara is in a russian ship looking for the spear of destiny. See what they are doing? Random stories. The only good thing at this chapter was the ship's captain. I felt bad for him at the end. Damn.\nThe third one, is the young stage. Lara sneaks into a Winston's friend boat to uncover a secret from a cursed island. Even if the premises looks idiot, this one has the most well constructed atmosphere, mostly because of you being without your weapons, like a true adventurer.\nThe fourth and last one was about how Lara stealed Iris from Van Croy. It was the mostly overrated stage and it was all worth it. It was so shorth tough that i felt bad when i was about to end it. Damn. Really.\n\nThe Level Editor: This is where this game could've been a lot more revolutionary. You see, random stories for random levels with random enemies. Sounds like a thing you do while doing mods or maps for some game, doesn't it?\nThe PC version got a exclusive Level Editor that allowed the players to make their own levels and even full games. If you acess a site called "Lara's Level Base" you will see there's a lot of levels made by players. And they are still being made until today. Why is it bad? Read again: PLAYERS.\nPlayers made the community, players made their site for their levels/new items for the engine (Witch you could add) and players made this whole "Let's make a Tomb Raider game ourselfs" worth.\nThe devs couldn't see how much the community could have used this more. There was no real support for the Level Editor and after its launch, there were no patchs whatsoever. If the player base din't kept it alive, nobody would be using. But if the devs gave the right attention to it, it could've been something BIG and NEW. Nobody ever tough of making his own Tomb Raider adventures, and that would bring something new. Mostly because the engine is not hard like Unreal or Source (And not easy as Portal 2 PTI i might say) and, for its time, it was still a good engine. They missed a big oportunity here. The game was rather sort and they din't even bothered giving a extended lifetime, at least on PC. When they launched the Level Editor for free, they pretty much gave up. Because you CAN use the engine to PLAY ALL THE LEVELS made by players WITHOUT NEEDING TO OWN THE GAME!\nI guess for today, this is fine. But, the engine was released for free in the same day that the game came out. Jesus.\nI remember the purple "Level Editor" disk that came with my original TR 5 CD, i felt so special by having something like that at my hand and was sad to see it was free on the new. Legaly. With a manual too. Jesus, why?\n\nOverall, TR: Chronicles is the mostly forgetable Tomb Raider and the shortest of all, but it was a fun game to play...While it lasted.\nGetting all the secrets and playing with the Level Editor will keep youself busy more than the game itself, sadly. But it's not bad, it could've been better. They just missed a good oportunity here. Only if they gave more support to the level editor...\n\nIf you want to play this game, be preapared for fun and disapointment, at the same time.\n\nPS: Why did these "Next Gen Screens" looked so promising back there? Damn.","February 2, 2014","true","12.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

It features the same visuals as Tomb Raider 4 and also includes some new moves.\nChronicles tells us four stories about Lara's previous adventures (the events before The Last Revelation). The Rome is set before Tomb Raider 1 (1996), Russia is somewhere in the middle, Ireland when Lara was 16 (same age as in TR4's Cambodia levels), New York (when she decided to steal Cambodia's Iris from Von Croy).\nThe game is somewhat notably shorter than the previous parts, but it features some variety. Rome was similar to TR2's Venice style adventures. Russian submarine was similar to TR3's modern vibe. Ireland is quite a unique experience, you could even tag it as survival horror. VCI headquarters is more similar to The Angel of Darkness concept of modern Tomb Raiding.\nUnlike TR4 the TR5 is completely linear, you can't go back between the levels and on top of that each time you finish a chapter (on of four) all your items are gone. On the bright side that prevents item hoarding. The game has 36 secrets. Collecting all unlocks game's concept art.\n\nTR5 has native widescreen support.

I've encountered incredible amounts of bugs, making me unable to finish.\n\nIn the last areas:\n- Lara does not aim at enemies with her weapon (she has only one in these levels by the way), needless to say this bug makes it annoying to shoot at enemy with rafle mode selected, ending up wasting ammo;\n- Lara got stuck in a cinematic, making her unable to get her weapon back;\n- Lara got stuck in the elevator area, leading to death up or down;\n- The first cyborg got immortal, revealing his electric arm and releasing water didn't kill him;\n- Basically, saving and loading in the last area is VERY bad idea, most of spots are bugged.\n\nOther than that, I really do love this game, especially the Rome area, because we get to kill giant statues. We love moving statues. And when we get to play Lara as a teenager. A terrifying set of levels, with no guns and creepy creatures.\n\nThere are few ways to go past these bugs if you look around on the internet (check out Stella's website for example). But I still haven't figure out how to solve the problem with the gun automatic aim.\n\nI do recommend it though!

The original Tomb Raiders can really drag sometimes, but this one has good pacing, an interesting story, and there's just enough variety to keep you interested.   It does have a few bugs, though, which can be a pain, but they're easily avoided if you keep a walkthrough handy.

We learnt she wanted some of Harry Potter's Philosophers Stone, a trip on a Russian sub, flashbacking to grim Ireland to talk to the demons with a priest who treats exorcism like a tea party and she spites old Von Croy in a wheelchair in the good ol' US and A in his own company HQ! We globetrot with our favorite female icon through stories told by old friends sitting around a fireplace after the memorial, getting steadily drunker.\n\nIt's a gentle and perhaps thankfully easier pick up and play title after the titanic epic of The Last Revelation and a breather from the relentless TR3, perfect for novices or those who want to breeze through the game without too much difficultly. That said, although the difficulty isn't too high, it boasts the hardest (and buggiest) final level to date; the perhaps ironically named Red Alert.\n\nHighlights for me are the Italian levels with their lovely visuals and beautiful scenery injected with some good humor from series stalwards Larson and Pierre from TR1, now a bumbling comic duo that set to try and thwart our heroine but fail horribly! The Russian levels are very tense, particularly in the Deepsea Dive and Sinking Submarine levels. Ireland does well with the grim, macabre setting to instil a creepy atmosphere (Labyrinth gets props for being eerie) and as Lara is unarmed, it adds to the drama! The final stages are very hi-tech, a huge contrast to the rest of the game act as a thrilling hi-octane conclusion!\n\nI recommend you play this after you play the first four so you get a good feel for the Core Design era before Angel of Darkness plunged it into....uh darkness. Such a shame they rushed AoD, it would have been interesting to see what future installments that could have been. But to fully live the Core Design era, start at the beginning and have yourself a TR marathon.\n\nTRC has a special place in my heart even to this day!","October 10, 2014","true","3.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It uses the previous Inventory system as The Last Revelation so not exactly the best one.\n\nPros        Cons                Episodic: Unique strategy of gameplay each episode.        Small bugs still appear in the game and sometimes prevents to proceed further after saves.                Sounds: Still work fine and music plays out without much glitches        Not really a con: Controls remain the same like the previous four games.                Settings can be adjusted before playing: 1920x1080        FMV's still shrink the screen to 640x480\nI'd recommend for players new to the Tomb Raider series but also prefers games that is quite short then this is the game for them. For those who likes long games and lots of puzzles to solve around then I wouldn't recommend this game.

It's not structured like a single complete game, instead it's more of a collection of smaller almost expansion set worthy adventures. While these adventures were short, I thought they were at least interesting and most importantly fun. The Ireland levels were particularly memorable because they were spookier than any others in the TR franchise. Each story is quick and fun, and each reveals a bit more about Lara's past and character. So I welcome this game as a worthy addition to the franchise, even if its structure isn't ideal.\n\nUnfortunately, like TR2 & 4, this game is forced into a window in Windows 8...so I won't recommend it... otherwise I would.","January 18, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I won't go into details, but if you play this game you must continually save in staggered save slots because when you save a game and then load it again, it doesn't always load in the same state you saved it in. Neccesary enemies may not spawn, switches may not be activated any more, water may not be drained...the last level is the worst for this.\n\nJust DO NOT overwrite saves unless they are old.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/recommended/225000/","synthsequence","synthsequence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/","442 products in account","Tomb Raider: Chronicles started off so promising, so well set up. The opening cutscene had me hooked. Is Lara really dead? Who knows? Winston finally gets a role other than cannon/freezer fodder, opting to recount Lara's past expeditions around the globe to Father Patrick Dunstan, after a memorial service for her is held. Meanwhile, Werner von Croy, Lara's mentor and rival, continues excavating the Temple of Horus in hopes of finding her after the events of The Last Revelation.\n\nBut after the opening cutscene, I've made a stunning revelation myself: this game is utterly soulless, lazy and devoid of heart. In my reviews of Tomb Raider II and III, I made comments addressing that I found them to be more effective as expansion packs rather than sequels, but still good games. Chronicles, however, feels more like a map pack created by someone who had the Tomb Raider concept hastily explained to them in 2 minutes.\n\nThere's only 13 levels this time around. To boot, a lot of them are incredibly short. The amount of puzzles has been reduced, an addition that I really loved from the Last Revelation, instead opting to return to key, switch, door and backtracking from Tomb Raiders I-III. The levels are also annoyingly easy, except for the final level, which is ridiculously hard and total change of pace from the previous 12. Here's a breakdown of the levels:\n\n1-4: Reskinned Venice levels from Tomb Raider II with a hint of the Greece levels from Tomb Raider I.\n5-7: Painfully unoriginal snowy Russian base and submarine levels. Cause that's never been done before.\n8-10: Okayish levels pretty much stolen from Shadow Man/Medievil. Seriously.\n11-13: Why is Lara Croft stuck in the Matrix now? Why didn't you take the blue pill?!\n\nLara's new techniques include: tightrope walking and swinging from horizontal bars. As usual, these additions are barely noticeable as they appear about 3 times each throughout the entire game. Because the level system jumps around to different time periods, Lara's inventory is reset at the beginning of each set, which is actually a pretty good addition. Secrets have been replaced by golden roses which, upon collecting them all, unlocks an artwork menu (yay). If you miss one, you miss out, but it really doesn't matter. It's not worth it. There's also no vehicle sections either, other than a crappy underwater mission which is irritatingly short (literally 2 minutes).\n\nNot to mention that it's filled with some irritating bugs as well. Using hotkeys for medkits depletes your supply, but doesn't actually heal you half the time. Weapon hotkeys don't work anymore. A couple of times Lara just refused to draw her weapons, whether I used the draw key or equipped it from the inventory menu. Saving also screws up for a lot of people, but thankfully I never encountered this issue. The final level is ghastly in its bugginess.\n\nPlotwise, well, what plot? It's four completely random episodes thrown together. This entire game is totally unnecessary in the overarching plot from Tomb Raider through to The Angel of Darkness. The concept is good, but it's executed so poorly that it's just sad. The only connection that Chronicles has to past entries is, at the end of the game, Werner von Croy finds Lara's backpack. It would be a spoiler, but come on, we know she's still alive, and playing through this dreck really isn't worth such an equally pitiful ending.\n\nThe sound is just average. I don't know what happened to Peter Connelly's great soundtrack from The Last Revelation. Most of the music is gutted, reused or remixed from previous entries. Egyptian-themed music from The Last Revelation is used, for example, in the depths of water beneath a Russian submarine. It doesn't flow and it's just freaking lazy. Voice acting is just bad all around. Stereotypical Americans, Frenchmen, and Russians flood the cutscenes, of which there are inexplicably many, consistently interrupting the little gameplay that there is. Voice volume is also far too low, leading to important dialogue, such as hints given by Zip in the final 3 levels, being missed.\n\nOh, and the camera! My God, the camera. The fixed angles are revolting, obscuring your view and disabling the use of the look function. Meaning that, unlike in previous entries, if you wanted to return to your normal view, you just pressed look or draw weapon. Here, nope! Enjoy this beautiful tilt while you fall to your death, or this stunning pan while you get the ♥♥♥♥ shot out of you by  a helicopter!\n\nThe game somehow looks worse than The Last Revelation. Lara's model remains unchanged from the previous year, and only a small amount of levels actually take place inside a tomb, the rest of which are cities, military bases or submarines. I'm all for variety, but it is called TOMB Raider. Why the sudden aversion to one of the core (no pun intended) elements of the game? Human models other than Lara look downright awful, especially Father Patrick's. Time Crisis on PS1 had better models than this game. The only above-standard thing about this game is the pre-rendered cutscenes, and even they aren't up to scratch with other games released in the same period.\n\nI suppose one other good point about the game is its disappointing length, which means that it's over quickly, even though it feels like an eternity. I passed Tomb Raider: Chronicles in five hours. FIVE HOURS. It's one of the most disappointing games I've ever played. And if you're afraid of missing out on some plot details, don't be. This game is worthless in every aspect.\n\n2/5.","October 26, 2014","false","10.4"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","4","15","0","0"

However, the background story is absolutely horrible, illogical and barely understandable. The last level was so difficult that I ran out of medics and could not complete it. A large part of the game relies on the player's ability to master the long jump to the cm, and after breaking Lara's legs for the hundredth time I had enough of it.

THAT happened after TR VI (Angel of Darkness) due to the developer switch (gladly, Tomb Raider: Legend fixed that...).\n\nSo TR V gets a lot of hate for some whatever reason. I never really quite understood why it got the hate. I've never encountered any bugs and the story line is just amazing imo. The soundtrack is just phonomonal and it will never cease to surprise me. Tomb Raider V had such a heavy and sad tone to it- but I LOVED that about it.\n\nTomb Raider V starts off where Tomb Raider IV left off, so I URGUE YOU TO PLAY TOMB RAIDER IV: THE LAST REVELATION BEFORE PLAYING THIS GAME. Otherwise, the story will make NO SENCE to you.\n\nSo I'm going to tell you how it starts off, but if you have not played Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelations- don't worry- I will make this part unviewable unless you hover your mouse over it.\n\nHere goes- So, after Vernen leaves you in the temple, Lara is presumed dead and a memorial service is held for her- even though she is not officially dead. Winston quotes,"Let us hope she may return to us" in the intro scene. So Lara is going incognito for most of the game (not sure if she actually shows herself or not, never finished the game) if you haven't caught on yet.\n\nGameplay: It's almost exactly like Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation, so if you didn't like TR IV, then don't play Chronicles unless you want to follow the storyline. It's not BAD by any means, it's just quite different if you're used to the original Tomb Raider I, II, and III games because it's based off a new game engine.\n\nGraphics: It looks amazing- the new engine for TR IV and TR V looks goregous, but it can look pretty bad mixed in with low-res textures as present in some levels. The good part about TR V is that the graphics, resolution, and many more options are changable unlike TR I, and II.\n\nConclusion: 2nd most favorite Tomb Raider game to date. Definintely has more harder puzzles to solve, but are solvable without walkthroughs. 9/10","February 20, 2015","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
