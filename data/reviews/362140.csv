See more here:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/recommended/362130/\n\nThen I almost immediately started AoI2, thinking that "if I'm ever gonna try it, might as well do it now, while I'm still in the spirit of the universe of the game".\n\nIt started (more) promising (than its prequel), with nicer graphics, battles not being as easy and stuff like that. But it soon went downhill all the way to the center of the earth!\n\nEverything that was bad in the first game is still bad (some look briefly as if it had improved, but nothing really did).\n\nWhat was worse:\n\n- Battles went from easy to insanely hard, with very long dungeons, low items, leveling up make little difference and requiring A LOOOOT of grinding etc.\n- The side-quest system was bad before, but now it didn't even work for me (I had triggered one side-quest which didn't show on my Quests menu, and I couldn't finish it because it was waaaay too hard for the point I was in the game.\n- One of the first things you get is a veeeeeery slow boat that gives you access to at least 90% of the world, but you can't enter most towns and dungeons. (and there's a bird stuck on the edge of the map)\n- Game is basically a series of very long and boring maze dungeons (no random encounters, as its prequel), almost no character to interact. Heck, once I got to a city and there was a castle that had about 10 screens and about 4 NPC you could talk to (and one of them quickly left the castle).\n\nJust avoid it.  It's understandable that it's cheaper than AoI1.","November 6, 2015","false","6.6"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

He is given a half werewolf (Landon) to travel with, and so begins the adventure that will take them throughout the world.\nYou will visit several locations (towns, woods, mountains, tunnels) with various clues as to what is going on, and they all feature assorted treasures to discover, monsters to fight, characters to deal with, and quests to finish.\nIt is, however, never confusing, and the path to follow is pretty straightforward (there is even a boat to use to speed up your travels and a quest log) ---- and this is the way it should be when the story is well told ---- as this one is. The game captures your interest quickly, and it becomes one of those stories that you want to just go to one more place, meet one more person, or finish just one more quest.\n\nLike the 1st game of the series, this one uses a system of acquiring skills as you level up, then you must decide which skills to equip. Skills can be offensive, defensive, rare, or unique so you have to decide how and when to use them since there is a maximum number you can have at any given time. The various combinations can affect battle outcomes considerably.\n\nThe game features very nice artwork, runs smoothly, and sound effects and music add to the game experience.\n\nI've not gotten far enough to see how much it will tie into the first game, but I have seen a couple of characters from the previous game that might play a part in upcoming events. Guess I'll have to keep going to find out.\nBut overall, I believe it is an excellent entry to this fun and entertaining series about werewolves, hunters, vampires. and other mysterious characters. Recommended for sure.","August 30, 2015","true","3.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","1"

Frankly the game runs really bad on my laptop.  THe same laptop had no problem with the first one and obviously the graphics here arent pushing any boundaries.\nI'd also appreciate more control options.  I know its rpg maker, and those games usually give you really bad options but this is pretty pitiful.\nStory and characters seem interesting so far.  Going to play later tonight on my desktop.  HOpefully that will resolve performance issues.","August 28, 2015","false","1.8"," 15 of 47 people (32%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","32","15","47","7","3"
