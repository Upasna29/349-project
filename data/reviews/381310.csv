Playing this game in room scale on the vive and using the tracked motion controllers is truly how this game is meant to be played. This games shines on the Vive.\n\nMy only suggestion to the developer is to make the default paddle control the hand controllers so I don't have to squeeze the side button to activate them. You can also back down the haptic feedback to occur only when a paddle makes contact with a ball.","May 25","true","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
