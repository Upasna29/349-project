Absolutly if you dont mind the obviously dated graphics. I bought this game for two reasons, 1) its one hellava game and 2) over the years my original cd had quite a bit of use and was rendered unplayable. I can honestly say that i put easily over thousands of hours into this game, since it first came out till this day, and you can bet your ♥♥♥ those hours will continue to go up. i should also mention that since this is a game that came out in the 90's the controls are akward, when you start the game dont go pressing wasd thinking you will move as thats not the case, to move you have to use the arrow keys. the audio is not to bad either, i mean its not Battlefield's Ear porn but its still not to bad.","September 21, 2014","true","13.5"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","2"

I appreciated it for its in-depth destructible environment, realistic bullet physics, and menu music. What other game has live penguins, killer fish, endless map areas(in 1999?), underwater weapons, AI vehicles and teammates. Rescuing hostages and blowing stuff up, from any angle with any weapon. It's a shame nowdays that nearly all singleplayer mission experiences are about campaigns with one approach and limited weapon types. There are games similar to DF2 now, but none close enough to take its uniqueness. I sometimes go back to it to enjoy that feeling of how it managed to expand the FPS genre.","August 14, 2012","true","5.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

To accomplish a mission, players can assault directly, sneak around or cooperate with friendlies. As a special note for the campaign, if mission briefing is read carefully, you will find the plot is somehow interesting - terroritsts can even deceive Delta intelligence, for example. Frustratingly, bugs such as enemies shooting through walls are troublesome.

And they're killable too!"\n\n"A superb classic shooter that puts modern Call of Duty games to shame". 7/10 (scored for modern times).\n\nNOTE: this does work on windows 8, after an automatic install of something.\n\nWhat makes a good FPS? Fear, tatics, and a community of actual men rather than badly brought up 7 year olds. This game does all of these. You can't just brush off millions of rounds to the face like in most FPS's. One shot, and you're gone. FANTASTIC! :D\n\nOf course, the grphics are 15 years old now, same as Gran Turismo. But this makes the enemies hard to point out making the game a lot of fun. Obviously the AI are quite stupid but can be well hidden.\n\nI eventually remembered how to start the campaign, and I have enjoyed it so far. Yes the AI won't attack from behind if you halt for too long, but, like I've said, are well hidden and won't hesitate to one-shot kill you after a stupid rookie mistake of not checking both sides of a room after entering it.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who wants a realistic FPS, not one with space battles and overrated lens flares.

Other than that the game is awsome minus the ai that gets hung up on walls and has "eagle-eye" vision that can shoot you from a kilometre away.\n\nAlso note that if you have a modern operating system, just be aware that the game crashes a lot and the hardware support for this game is abysmal in every way possible. Only a handful of chipsets will run this game properly in Direct3D mode (providing that you also have the right drivers with it).\n\nIn software mode the game just looks like puke garbage with half of the polygons on the character's weapon model missing while buildings sometimes disappear in plane f****** site; that also includes enemies.\n\nIf the above doesn't stop you from playing, then it's a great game and you should play it.","June 19, 2014","true","29.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This game was the first FPS I ever played. Put simply, there aren't games made today like these anymore. Difficult and brutal these games were, they do not hold your hand like games today. Missions were long, and usually placed you, at the very least, against a whole base of enemies. The worst part being, no saves. You could die at the extraction point of a 30-minute mission and have to re-do the entire mission over. Usually a few shots will kill you, maybe even one if you are unlucky enough. Stealth and movement are important least you find yourself end up getting shot up by 20 hostiles. Getting shot at gave you a terrifying feeling, and fear of have doing everything for naught. Today, games will not give you such a challenge in fear of fustrating the player.\n\nThe release of Delta Force marked the beginning of realistic shooters (games like OFP and ARMA) and even today is still an enjoyable game.","April 28","true","4.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

I remember a certain mission, an ice mission, where an enemy, just visible through the scope of the sniper, was running back and forth between two structures. I fired one shot, I couldn't see where it landed, but I could hear the small sound it made as hit the building. I then took aim. I shot. The enemy was still running back and forth, it took the bullet quite a while before it hit my target. The enemy. I was never in doubt that I was going to hit. I knew. So whenever a game is without ballistics I am unable to hit anything. This is all because of Delta Force 2.

With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yij/recommended/32630/","yij","Yij","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yij/","391 products in account","SHORT REVIEW...\nDelta Force 2 is one of my most favourite games of all time. Fairly realistic military shooter with MASSIVE environments and freeform gameplay:  snipe enemies from a mile away with a high powered sniper rifle, go in guns blazing with a heavy machine gun, use stealth and pick enemies off 1 by 1, or anything in between. Gameplay wise, think of a realistic military version of Far Cry. Features excellent multiplayer with insantly fun coop. Unfortunately the graphics are quite poor and there is a few glitches, but nothing major. Overall, Delta Force 2 is lots of fun, providing you can look past the poor visuals and polish, and I would also highly recommend it for it's coop features (assuming it still works).\n\n\nLONG REVIEW...\nGood old Delta Force 2 was made all the way back in 1999, where there was a massive market for 3D games  as it was the latest craze back then. Make no mistake, Delta Force 2 was extremely rough round the edges, but one thing that made it stand out from other first person shooters was it's terrain, MASSIVE draw distances and realism, plus multiplayer features.\n\n\nGRAPHICS/AUDIO\nOk, graphics. Well, it wasn't a pretty game back then, and it certainly isn't now.  3D acceleration only worked properly on a few select graphics cards, and now doesn't work properly at all, so just leave it off. The maximum resolution is a glorious 1024x768. Thanks to the voxel engine, the world can appear quite blocky, though thankfully it's not an eyestrain and adds a retro-charm to the game. Soundwise, it's pretty good and gets you into the game. There must only be a single music track in the entire game and that's in the menu. Enviroment noises are generally minimal but immersive, with wind in the background and sound ques from birds. Once the action kicks in, expect to hear screams and shouts from foreign soldiers speaking in their native languages, and the rich sound of gunfire from every angle possible.\nThe landscapes are truely epic and stretch for miles and miles.  There was hills and mountains, trees and rivers, deserts, grassland and snowy enviroments to battle in, which was very unique for the FPS genre at the time, whom were generally corridor shooters in outer space. You will also get to explore a great variety of strongholds, from oil refineries, to military bases. The landscape plays an important role, as it's generally wise to set up a sniper position on a tall hill overlooking an enemy encampment, or hide in the undergrowth when trying to sneak around.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nGameplay is where Delta Force 2 truely shines.  You have alot of freedom in the game, especially compared to other titles that came out at the time. You can choose your weapons, ranging from sniper rifles to take enemies out from a kilometre away, to a silenced SMG for clearing out buildings quietly, as well as additional pistols, grenades and explosives. Once you're let lose in the map, you're given a mission objective but generally allowed to complete it how you want. Sniping from across the map, using the grenade launcher to completely decimate enemy bases, getting in close and personal with the assault rifle + shotgun combo, or going Rambo and just running around with the machine gun and shooting everything to pieces. Delta Force 2 is the 1999 version of Far Cry when it comes to freedom of gameplay.\nThe game is pretty realistic. Apart from the real world settings and weapons,  bullets were physical objects, affected by gravity, distance and wind, so shooting a target 400m away would not only require compensation for bullet drop, but also time to hit the target (and wind on custom difficulty settings). You can only one or 2 shots before dying, so not getting shot is top prority. Also some buildings are able to be destroyed with heavy ordnance, be it a few grenades or airstrike. It's quite a joy to leave an enemy base smouldering in ruins.\nHaving said that, the game is realistic enough to make it a refreshing change  compared to other FPS games, but not so realistic enough that it becomes frustrating or unfair (much).  The game can be fairly arcadey, such as your weapons have zero recoil and isn't effected by movement at all: you can sprint up a hill, jump in the air and literally perform a 360 noscope with the rocket launcher.\n\nDelta Force 2 also featured multiplayer, the coop simply being the best of the bunch.  Tackling the campaign missions with your friends was an absolute blast and there was nothing like it back in the day. Sniping enemies from ontop of a hill a mile away whilst your friend charges into the base with his assault rifle, then you shoot him in the ♥♥♥♥ just for fun, then after he respawns he blows you up with a rocket launcher as payback... It was one of the few serious coop games where playing pranks on your team mates was actually quite fun. Hilarity aside, it was pure fun to play the game alongside a friend, especially since your AI team mates are useless.\n\nBUGS AND GLITCHES\nLike I said, Delta Force 2 was far from perfect even after all the patches.  Graphics flicker and disappear, models are extremely low poly and glitch out, first person weapon doesn't move at all even when reloading, your character doens't aim up or down, the game can occassionally crash for no reason. The AI is absloutely abysmal, generally running backwards and forward for no reason, completely ignoring you, running into walls, and generally either COMPLETELY missing you at point blank range, or nailing you halfway across the map with a single shot. On the subject of 1 hit kills, they also die with a single rifle round to their little toe, the weak ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\nDespite this, I find the problems aren't really that bad  nor effect gameplay much and can be even quite charming, especially when playing today and looking back at the first generation of 3D video games.\n\nSUMMARY\nDelta Force 2 should have failed, for it's simplistic gameplay and severe lack of polish,  especially compared to other FPS titles at the time (such as Half Life and Unreal). But against all the odds, it somehow remains extremely enjoyable, plus spawned numerous additional titles and a strong cult fan base.  So what do I think of the game?\n\nI fell in love with the game when it first came out,  playing the 200mb demo over and over again, more so than the Half Life demo on the same CD! I still remember parachuting in, killing everyone in the nearby tents, then moving onto the enemy base with defence towers, AK47 tracers flying over your head as you picked off pixels in the distance with 3 rounds from your M4. Purchasing thefull game was truely a treasured moment, and it was one of the most played LAN games me and my friends would enjoy.\nI would say Delta Force 2 has been one of the best games I have ever played, even better than the later Delta Force games that came after it. The graphics and glitches are brushed aside once you get into the game, and at the end of the day, what counts is how much fun you're having, and Delta Force 2 is so so much bloody fun.","December 17, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
