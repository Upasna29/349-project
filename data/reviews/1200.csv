"http://steamcommunity.com/id/savv/recommended/1200/","savv","Savv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/savv/","130 products in account","Favorite FPS overall. I still prefer it to Red Orchestra 2. I wouldn’t say it’s popular, but it isn’t completely dead either: there’s at least one active European server that gets full every day. There’s one in the U.S. too. Even the development process isn’t entirely dead. Modders from  The Darkest Hour  team have just released a massive update and they plan to keep improving the game in 2016.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC3M--ik25U\n(video by Joe Smhoe)\n\n\nPros (compared to RO2)\n\nSlower pacing. People don’t tend to run around at breakneck speeds quite as much. Twitch reactions are not as important, and this game is noticeably easier to play for me.\n\nWeapon balance. Weapons have a lot more recoil and sway when shooting from standing or crouching position. This means that resting your weapon on random objects for support is very important and players tend to use cover more. Simple bolt-action rifles are incredibly powerful: they do a lot of damage and are significantly more accurate than semi-autos. You can either have good rate of fire or good accuracy (RO2 semi-autos, by contrast, give you both, and an SVT-40 is almost always better than a Mosin). One could argue that this isn’t very realistic, but it makes playing as a rifleman fun, whereas in HoS it can be very hard and frustrating. Or maybe I’m just hopelessly bad at playing rifleman in RO2.\n\nNo spawning on squad leaders. You have to actually walk or ride from spawn to the capzone. It increases the value of your life and value of life of your enemies. When you kill someone, he’s not going to respawn in vaguely the same place in 10 seconds. You won’t see him again in at least half a minute (or more for large maps). And it helps to avoid the situation where if you spawn on SL, you're likely to immediately die, but if you don’t, you’re not in the capzone, you’re not helping your team cap, you’re not protecting your SL. Survival in situations like these depends largely on luck: if you happen to spawn behind cover, you’re good, but if you spawn in the open where one of the enemy machine gunners can see you, you’re boned and will have to try again. This can be very annoying in RO2.\n\nDarkest Hour (a mod) has one of the best spawning mechanics I’ve seen in this type of game: MDVs (Mobile Deploy Vehicles). Basically, an MDV is an APC with a spawn point inside. You can park it anywhere, but it’s bulky and noisy — hiding it behind enemy lines can be tricky. When you spawn in it, you can have a look around and hop out when you think it’s safe-ish. Or, if it clearly isn’t, you can try moving it to a better position. It’s vulnerable to satchels, panzershrecks and whatnot, so the chance to die immediately after spawning is still there, but at least it’s not random and it’s very rare.\n\nNo stat grinding or unlocks. When you start playing, your weapon is identical to the ones used by players who have played this game for years. They won’t have faster running speed, faster reloads or resistance to suppression. Joining a winning team won’t make you level up faster, and blatant team stacking is fairly rare. Most matches feel more balanced.\n\nNo UAVs. You can use vegetation and ruined buildings to hide for a long time and nobody’s going to find you unless they see or hear you. Unfortunately, people can still fly around as spectators when they’re waiting in a spawn queue. There’s a mutator that blacks out the screen when the player is dead, but most servers don’t run it nowadays.\n\nPlenty of large combined arms maps with open design, including some really huge tank-centric maps. There’s an achievement for destroying a tank at 2000+ meters. And popular servers actually run these: it’s not like Counter-Strike or TF2, where there are thousands of community maps available, but most servers stick to stocks like de_dust2 and cp_dustbowl.\n\nHuge variety of weapons and vehicles. You can play as Soviets, Germans, Americans, Brits, Australians, Canadians, Romanians, Italians, Hungarians, Poles and Finns. Some of the vehicles included: BA-64 (aka the clown car), Panzer II Flamm and OT-34 (flamethrower tanks!), ISU-152 (152 mm self-propelled gun), Sturmtiger, Sturer Emil, Marder III Ausf. M, SdKfz 234/2 “Puma”, BMW R71 motorcycle (with or without sidecar), ZiS-3 truck, Willys and Volkswagen Kübelwagen, STZ-5 (although it’s used as an infantry transport) and even a farming tractor. Not to mention a good number of Italian and Hungarian tanks (even World of Tanks doesn’t have these). There are AT and FlaK guns, boats, planes you can paradrop from, mortars you carry around and setup wherever you like. You can also use tanks to transport infantry.\n\nTank crewmen can get out of their vehicles and get back in. It adds immersion, allows you to park your tank in a safe place, get out and gather intel with your binoculars (silhouette of a person with binocs is nowhere near as noticeable as a tank on the horizon). It also makes it possible to bail out and continue fighting on foot or join a different crew when your tank is damaged. Tank crew frantically getting out of a burning tank is something you’ll never see in RO2.\n\nTeam-tanking is fun and useful, whereas in HoS you’re often better off with bots even if you use voip. It’s just faster to press W and have your tank move forward immediately. In RO:Ost, it is faster to switch to driver and press W too, but you won’t be able to reload the gun at the same time. Or keep an eye on the enemy. So, a fully crewed tank with voice comms is likely to outmaneuver a solo tanker, which isn’t true in RO2.\n\nI love the way you have to turn the tank turrets using keyboard, not mouse. Having to control each axis separately is more immersive than just pointing at the target with a mouse cursor. It feels more like turning two separate cranks.\n\nYour character won’t give away your position by making random loud remarks while you’re trying to sneak.\n\nThere are doors you can open and close. Even Wolfenstein 3D had this feature, but RO2 doesn’t.\n\nCons (compared to RO2)\n\nLow population.\n\nAutomatic weapons arguably have too much recoil and are hard to use.\n\nWeaker physics. Bullets and shells don’t penetrate objects. Vehicles can occasionally get stuck on flimsy obstacles like picket fences.\n\nNonadjustable sniper rifle scopes.\n\nNo squads, no fireteams, no tactical view. You can’t mark enemies on the map.\n\nMany of the really cool features are only available in  DH, and most popular servers for this mod are in the U.S. (high pings for players from Asia).\n\nTank interiors are not as detailed, there’s no animation for individual crewmen.\n\nNo way to kick people out of your tank if you don’t trust them.\n\nNo Japanese, no maps set in the Pacific, no jungle. No flamethrowers for infantry, swords, booby traps.\n\nEvery character on your team has the same voice, and the number of lines they can say is very limited.\n\nP.S. I’m not saying Red Orchestra 2 is a bad game, it’s definitely worth getting too.","January 26, 2015","true","117.8"," 57 of 57 people (100%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","100","57","57","8","6"

Run and gun rambos need not apply.\n\nRecoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time then you will have a pouch full of half full mags.\n\nYou can't run forever. If you sprint for a while your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath.  Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing. Its better while crouched and even better while prone or rested on an object. The is no magical zoom button. What you see is what you see unless you have an optic.\n\nTheres nothing like having your weapon shot out of your hands as you run to take cover behind some sandbags. Then wondering if you should risk going back to try to retrieve it or wait and try to find a weapon from another fallen soldier.\nThe graphics are dated and the bots are very dumb, but the multiplayer gameplay is still so good it makes up for it. The tank warfare can be fun too but much of my time was spent with my boots on the ground.\n\nSteam only shows 41 hours on record for me on this game but I had many hours on this game prior to when steam began tracking game time. So many late nights. The thrill of a short range firefight between 2 rifleman, both run dry and with no time to reload they rush to stab or butt-stroke(lolz) the other. So many great moments with nothing but an M44 in my hands and some panzerfausts I had found laying about as I waited to ambush a passing german tank. I had so much fun playing with the humble bolt action rifles I ended up buying a real M91/30 and M44. I was mighty fond of that lovely SVT40 though......\n\nPlay this game","March 24, 2015","true","40.8"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","38","39","3","1"

Back in the days of UT2004 I didn't really care too much for the mod because it didn't explain what you are supposed to do. This version is much better while retaining the same feel of the original mod so this version of RO is kind of a small nostalgia trip for me. RO is a WW2 shooter like no other. You capture objectives and or you kill all the enemy forces until they have no more reinforcements. The game is extremely realistic. There's no crosshair and when hip-firing your bullets do not go to the middle of the screen. The gun moves freely in hip-firing. Best way to get accuracy is to aim down the sights. The guns all feel fantastic and the sound design is wonderful (although I can't stand the music). For COD fans, I can't recommend this game because it doesn't suck and it isn't casual. It's pretty hardcore. I love it.","August 31, 2014","true","2.8"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alekss227/recommended/1200/","alekss227","Comrade Alex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alekss227/","266 products in account","Part 1.\nSuper game. The most realistic game of all time, there are shoals of small, but otherwise the game супер.Very much types of guns, tanks etc.\nThe predecessor of Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is a modification of Red Orchestra: the Combined Arms for Unreal Tournament 2004, created by enthusiasts, who later organized the company Tripwire Interactive.\nModification participated in the contest «Make Something Unreal», conducted by Epic Games, creators of the games «Unreal». Due to the subsequent victory, the command Tripwire Interactive received the prize pool and a license for commercial use of the game engine, Unreal Engine 2.5. Later it was decided to move the modification of the format of individual games, elaborating some elements.\nThe game takes place on the Eastern front during the Second world war and covers the period from 1941 to 1945. The player is given the opportunity to participate in the reconstruction of events as for the Red Army and Wehrmacht troops. The game is targeted primarily at the network mode, but there's a single-player game against the bots. Each location (map) is a real historical area.\nIn multiplayer mode, the player can take any direction - both Soviet and German soldiers. In addition, there are several types of slot classes with their own unique capabilities and skills for the use of certain weapons. There is a possibility to manage a real military equipment, such as tanks, mobile artillery, artillery guns, armoured troop carriers.\nFor Red Orchestra was done many custom modifications, such as the sets of cards, a variety of game content or full total conversion.\nBelow is a list of published or under development projects:\nCarpathian Crosses - focuses on the participation of Romania in the Second world war. No longer supported by developers.\nMare Nostrum - focuses on the Mediterranean theater of operations.\nDarkest Hour: Normandy 1944 - focuses on the capture of Normandy.\nAfter-Hourz Community - includes several new vehicles, new tanks and anti-tank weapons.\nDefence Alliance 2 - ported by the authors of UT2004.\nPart 2.\nRed Orchestra concentrates mostly on the multiplayer aspect of the game, although there is a singleplayer "Practice" mode available. Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 features an advanced ballistics system for both small arms and tank rounds - incorporating bullet drop, flight time, and tanks with more realistic armor properties than most games (featuring: penetration and deflection, in relation to range and projectile trajectory angle). The player's movements are realistically modeled, giving them the ability to lie and move prone, sprint (while standing or crouching) and to deploy machine guns on objects.\nRed Orchestra is notable for its emphasis on realism in comparison to other World War II-based FPS games. There is no "crosshair" for a player to aim with in the middle of their screen; instead, the player must either aim down the three-dimensional iron sights, or aim from the hip using the game's free-aim system. The former requires compensating for the breathing of the character and natural sway from holding the gun, while the latter is much quicker but accurate only at very short range. The player must also keep track of their ammo usage mentally unlike many other FPS games, most of which use an ammunition counter. Additionally, the player's health status is not represented by "health points" as many other games use, but by a diagram of the player's body with reddened sections that show where he or she has been wounded; there is no way to recover from wounds, although after a brief period of time, the player will function at 100% again. Receiving wounds will temporarily slow the player down, especially if they receive a wound to the legs or feet; receiving a wound to the hands causes the player to drop their currently held weapon on the ground. Rifles usually kill players in one shot if they connect with the torso or head.\nVehicle support is also a prominent feature of the game. The player can operate the combat vehicles as one of the crew members. Most tanks, for example, can accommodate up to three crew members (a driver, a commander and a machine-gunner) to make them fully effective in close city fighting, however it is easy to crew a tank solo and simply switch to different positions as needed. When grouped together in a vehicle, all players in the vehicle receive points for their actions and for the actions of their fellow crew members; for example, if a player is driving a tank and the tank commander destroys an enemy tank, both the player and the commander will receive the appropriate number of points for that kill. When operating a tank solo, the player can only perform one of the roles at a time; this prevents a solo player from being able to fire, move and reload all at the same time (reloading is a task performed by the commander). The game also features artillery support in some maps which can be utilized by both squad leaders and tank commanders.\nThe game received generally favorable reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Game Rankings, the game had an average score of 81% based on 22 reviews. On Metacritic, the game had an average score of 81 out of 100, based on 22 reviews","October 15, 2013","true","81.9"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","26","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pavnikvol/recommended/1200/","Pavnikvol","who dis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pavnikvol/","264 products in account","Red Orchestra is without a doubt the quintessential World War II PC game, one that not only provides a satisfying and authentic shooter experience, but also involves players in the seldom seen part of the war: the horrific and bloody Eastern Front. It has a slower pace than your common shooter; players must plan their shots, take cover when necessary, and use teamwork to successfully capture objectives. The community has been amazing, with modders creating the Western Front (Darkest Hour), the Romanian Front (Carpathian Crosses), and the North African campaign (Mare Nostrum). Red Orchestra II has unfortunately failed to capitalize on the successes of its predecessor, and therefore the original game still remains one of the best World War II games of all time.","October 30, 2014","true","40.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Its quite old, so there are just a couple (about 300) people still playing it and because of its age the graphics arent the best too (for me its ok but thats a subjective point). Then its very realistic and slow so you just cant rush somewhere in CoD style, instead you need tactics and a good communication (wich can be a pro argument if you like stuff like this) to make a good round.\nOne of the good points is the atmosphere: especially in the maps of the destroyed germany where the last germans fight for a already lost war, defending the last strongholds eg. the Reichstag, you really can believe how much war sucks, so the game doesnt give the view of a war that is cool and spread with heroism, instead you can die already by 1 shot. Another good thing for me is that there are no perks or sth like that, so the enemy is always totaly equal to you, you will survive or die because the you or the enemy just was BETTER in shooting and not because he hacked or payed allot of bucks to get benefits.\nSo Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is a very special game which the ones like and the ohers dont. If you want to play fast game where you can rush all the time this game wont be the right game for you. If you instead are interested of a very realistic WW2 shooter and shouldnt be interested of RO2 or just want to chekc out the first game of the RO serie, this game can be really fun\n\npros:\n-athmosphere\n-allot of weapons\n-giant maps with epic tankbattles\n\nneutral (you can decide for yourself if its a pro or a con):\n-no perks\n-very realistic\n-hard recoil for all weapons\n-you nearly always die after 1 hit\n- very slow gameplay\n\ncons:\n- low graphics\n- small community","May 10, 2014","true","94.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","6"

A strong emphasis on realism and historical accuracy.\n\nThe closest comparison to this game might be Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, but Team Fortress and Counterstrike are in the same genre. Basically you've got two teams and you've got to attack/defend various objectives within a time limit. But those other games are far more forgiving; if you get shot you can just use a medkit, if you get a baddie in your crosshairs just pull the trigger.\n\nWell, in Red Orchestra there are no crosshairs for most guns, and there is no health regeneration. If you get shot even once you're probably dead. Expect to die a lot in this game. Fortunately the respawn times are short!\n\nOther realistic aspects include significant recoil and reload times for most guns. In Team Fortress you'll be spraying bullets everywhere without worrying about aiming or ammo. In Red Orchestra you've got to make every bullet count, because there's no auto-aim and ammo is limited. Even if you end up with a machine gun you'll get much better results firing short controlled bursts rather than spraying bullets everywhere. Realists rejoice!\n\nThere's a large number of maps to choose from, all of which are based on or at least inspired by real World War 2 battles between the Germans and Soviets. A great amount of work went into making sure the uniforms and equipment were historically accurate, and even that the interiors of the tanks looked realistic.\n\nTANKS! Yes, there's more tanks than you can shake a stick at in this game. Tanks are very hard to destroy and can easily mow down waves of attacking infantry, but they are not invincible. On many maps the gameplay will involve trying to destroy the other team's tanks, or getting your own tanks to the objective.\n\nTank armor is strongest in front, weaker on the sides, and weakest in the rear. So a lot of tank battles involve trying to sneak up on enemy tanks from the sides or rear. It helps that tank crews have a restricted field of view, so it's easier than you might think to ambush them!\n\nThere are some other vehicles too but they are mostly transports with a secondary anti-infantry role.\n\nThe realism may put off some players. As a WW2 history buff I know that a Tiger tank is much better than a Panzer III tank, but a casual gamer offered the choice of getting into one tank or another couldn't be expected to know that. The fact that there are so many tanks and they mostly look alike compounds the problem, although it is realistic.\n\nDid I mention this game is complicated? There's a key to fix a bayonet to your rifle, a key to change the barrel of your machine gun if it overheats, a key to pop open the hatch of your tank to get a better field of view...need I go on? Expect a steep learning curve.\n\nMy main complaint is that teams can become unbalanced rather easily. A game with 8 players vs 6 will see the smaller team struggling to survive. I guess I got spoiled by the auto team-balancing mechanic of ET:QW and TF; I just always assumed a game in this genre would have it. On some servers bots can be substituted for people to balance teams, but bots are a bit of a wild card. They can be awesome marksmen as infantry, but they're hopeless when driving any kind of vehicle.\n\nThere is no single player component. The soundtrack is appropriate and non-intrusive. I got this game practically for free in a sale; buy it if it's $5 or less.\n\nIf you're a World War 2 history buff or you liked Enemy Territory: Quake Wars then you'll like Red Orchestra.\n\n","June 11, 2013","true","50.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The driver and gunner have to work in perfect unison to survive against another tank and reloading times can be a killer.\nThe maps are big, without feeling too oversized.\nI've yet to play the Darkest Hour modification but am downloading it at this moment.\n\nIf you can't run the second, or missed out on the free day I highly reccomend spending the 10 bucks on this.

It has been significantly improved over the years, the bugs were ironed out and new maps came, and occasionally are still delivered by the community. There aren't many players yet the battles can reach an epic scale of a maximum of 50 soldiers per map. It's a game thar needs more time investment then Call of Duty or Battlefield in order to learn all of it's mechanics. The maps are huge in comparisson to Battlefield(not as huge as ArmA's or Operation Flashpoint - that's a nigtmare). Oftenly you'll be running to the control point for 10 minutes just to be pinned down by some sniper hiding in the woods or a building, whatever you prefer. There are also vehicles in the game which are most effective when teamwork and trust between the crewmembers is applied(yes you need more people to drive and shoot at the same time).

Great graphics, sounds, well done guns and great gameplay. Unfortunately, the multiplayer is dead nowadays, as almost everyone moved to RO2, which is a great game too, but became slightly more casual  and hence less fun. I do not recommend RO, although I vote "positive", because while it's a great game, almost no one plays it anymore.","December 2, 2015","true","7.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The emphasis of the fighting gameplay is rooted in gritty, challenging, tense realism rather than the flashy superficial blandness of so many recent and better-known military shooters.\n\nAlthough there aren't many servers on Steam with a high number of only human players as opposed to bots, the ones that exist will provide you a gripping multiplayer battle experience.

I've only found bots on servers so far , no real people. I didnt play this game in its hayday so I really cant give you a accurate decription but I still see traces of its fading glory. I will say its incredibly lonely/ depressing to join a server with only a few bots on it. The game was ment to have 64 players on each made and now theres only 20 bots bumbling around and driving their tanks into random spots. I cant find it in my heart to give this old war dog a bad review.\n"WW2 games dont die, they just fade away"- General MacArthur.\nThe graphics arent amazing, there just okay but your proably not playing a red orchestra for that reason.\nI havent delved too deep into the game as of yet but the mods look promising\nI'd recomend this if your a WW2 History buff or want to see what the seris was originaly like.\nIts not a bad game.\n\nEdit: As for the Mods....\nMare Nostrum is very cool has alot of good maps but is completely dead, only 1 server up and there hasnt been anyone on it when ever I check.\nDarkest Hour--- Has alot of promise still in it. The 29th infantry's server is almost always active, so you can join a good game there. It has more features than the regular game or Mare Nostrum as well. Its alot of fun and very immersive IF you can find a good game. Would recommend.\n\nOverall I'm not sure if I'd recomend getting this game, its mostly dead. Darkest Hour is alot of fun and theres still a group of faithfuls playing it. Its up to you, if you like WW2 and tough war games get it on sale but know there isnt enough servers for you to join at anytime into a good game, its in a constant state of flux.","December 11, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game takes place on the Eastern Front of World War II and covers the period from 1941 to 1945. The player is given the opportunity to participate in the reconstruction of events in the Red Army and also for the Wehrmacht. The game is targeted primarily at the network mode, but there is a single-player game against bots. Each location (map) is a really existing historic district. Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 features an advanced ballistics system for both small arms and tank rounds - incorporating bullet drop, flight time, and tanks with more realistic armor properties than most games (featuring: penetration and deflection, in relation to range and projectile trajectory angle).","November 16, 2012","true","46.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not CoD, or BF style. Just you, your rifle and your life in your hands. One shot and you are possibly dead. You've spotted tank? You are possibly dead. You rush enemy's trenches? You are possibly dead. You found good place to hold defence? A random grenade can ruin everything. A game where it is EXTREMELY hard to survive, but in fact it shows you the realities of war. Feel what your relatives, participated in WW2, felt. Also with RO1 it comes mod about US vs Germany and I also found moddb page about African warfront. So by purchasing this game you actually purchase full war story of the WW2.

Multiplayer is pointless try-shoot-em-up with objectives, winning or losing depends on which team has the most talent or communication. The whole point of the game, I think, is the gritty experience of getting stuck into a trench with a deadly rifle, daring to pop your head up to get into the fight. Shooting can be brutal, constant deaths, or finding a good spot and getting several kills. I once got into a bayonet scuffle with a player in a room, my heart was pounding when I saw him storm in. It was one-on-one, I don't remember who killed who in the end, I just remember that my hands were shaking, and I loved it. Tank combat mixing with infantry is done well here, worth it if it's on sale and you enjoy experience gameplay, this is definitely not arcade fun.","August 15, 2012","true","28.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has all the classics (that was a pun!) like Tchaikovsky, Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and (unfortunately) Wagner, and it also has some more snappy modern stuff like Shostakovitch, Mahler, and stuff Mozart wrote when he wasn't 12. I feel like this would have been better as a Wii game or a Kinect game or something, because using the mouse to conduct feels weird, but it does support joysticks and frankly it's so well done that I don't see why anyone would complain.

The problem is that this game is only multiplayer, the community is dead, the maps are only filled with bots, the achievements are broken as they require a certain number of human players and work only on official maps. I gave it several chances over the months but in the end it saddens me to tell that it fails to deliver that awesome concept of realism. I can only recommend it if you have a high number of friends to bring and play together with them. Only then the game would be more enjoyable and I have my doubts about that too. You can play with the bots your own hosts of game ,but their AI is just plain horrible and it throws away any sense of coordinated teamplay realism that you might have,even with the team commands.I have my hopes up for Red Orchestra 2 which aparently killed the entire community in RO1 now","October 18, 2014","false","3.9"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","10","24","0","2"

Hmm. It certainly shows it s age. While it is fun for a while it hasn't grabbed me in the same way as the ARMA series which are more tactical and graphically far superior. With the WW2 mods available for ARMA knock spots off RO. RO is a multiplayer only game so there is no single player campaign. There is a practice mode that allows you to play all the maps but apart fom a few bots there is very little to hold your attention. Would I recommend RO? In all honesty no, go for ARMA and you can play from a WW1 mod (which I have yet to try) up to modern land sea and air combat","June 28, 2014","false","3.6"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","13","0","0"

This game is one of the best I would say and a must have for WW2 fans.\n\nPros: Good amount of authentic weapons and maps (however the limit counter is annoying sometimes), realism, team sizes are good, authentic feel and good environments.\n\nNegatives: Class limits, some maps don't offer some weaponary, lack of field weapons such as anti-tank guns and flak guns, and sometimes, not very often, bullets don't seem to register with target or the gun doesn't regiester when you fire it; however this occurs rarely.\n\nOverall a great game I say.\n","August 31, 2011","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are too many FPS on the western front, but the truth is that every 8 out of 10 divisions of nazis destroyed the Soviet people.

Despite these historical truths, most games where Soviet Union taking part seemed to be mocking Red Army.

THE BEST gunplay I have ever seen in an FPS. Shooting a gun in this game feels almost real. Iron sights look realistic and automatic weapon recoil is just monstrous. My favorite feature is the ability to rest your weapon on any object in the game world for more accuracy and stability. I find it a lot better than some ridiculous sticky cover. Everything You do influences Your weapons accuracy: Your stance, Your character`s fatigue, Your health, etc. If you try to shoot when your hands are wounded, you`re tired from sprinting and you`re in an upright stance, then you`ll probably miss because of huge weapon sway.\n\nRed Orchestra is generally pretty awesome but the WW2 theme starts to get tiresome after some time. I wish there was a modern day combat mod for this :(\n\nImportant note: This game is not very popular, and sometimes it`s hard to find servers with people on them. The game also enforces some serious restrictions when choosing a class ( for example: There can be only 1 or 2 snipers in each team ) so be prepared to fight as a bolt action rifleman when joining a server with many people on it.","July 19, 2014","true","116.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unless you're used to ARMA 2 or a game like that, prepare to die, and die, and die some more. Be pleased if you don't finish a game at the very bottom of a server. But it is worth it.\n\nIt sounds great, it feels great, and the fact that you have a lot of Russian players shouting at you over the voice chat somehow enhances the realism!\n\nBUT: Since the release of RO2, the number of people on RO2 servers has fallen dramatically, at peak time there will be a full Panzer server (where the players are impossible to beat imho!) and maybe a couple of infantry servers, but this'll continue to fall. The game offers a single player vs AI training mode, which is useful to learn about the maps but the bots themselves are appallingly useless.\n\nThe realism of this game is great though, only in ARMA 2 have I been more afraid of dying! It is very exciting to play, and can involve some great teamwork:\n\nYou spawn, you run to the nearest half-track, joining your comrades in the back you speed through the fields towards the front. Artillery rains down around you. An enemy tank is seen in the distance and fires. Bailing out the smoking vehicle, you dive into the hedge. Crawling along this, you meet a support trench that takes you closer to the action. Bullets zip above your head. Where are they coming from? You wriggle up to a fellow machine-gunner, and resupply him with ammunition. Whilst he changes the smoking barrel, you fire off a few rounds with your semi-automatic rifle to keep their heads down. More friendly riflemen join you. Fixing your bayonet, you leap out of the trench and sprint towards the nearest building. A bullet catches you in your hand, causing you to drop your rifle, leaving you defenceless. You pause momentarily, and an enemy sniper hits you. Cue shot of your body falling to the ground. Repeat x many.\nBut was it fun? YES","May 26, 2015","true","85.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The maps are huge and realistic; there is an arsenal of historically accurate weapons that are simply not portrayed in WWII games, such as the MP41, different variants of the Mosin-Nagant, the PPD-40, and the Panzerfaust is finally made equippable in multiplayer (no more lugging around heavy launchers!); and don't get me started on the vehicles! Realistic interiors, incremental throttle, tanks requiring more than one player to operate! Bullets ricochet and weapons can even be shot out of your hands! There is no magical ammo pool, magazines must be manually checked and reloading before one is spent can waste precious ammo. You also have to actually pick up weapons and ammo  instead of just walking over them and inexplicably having them in your inventory. This may not be for everyone, and if you think you are good at Call of Duty, (no hard feelings, I love that franchise) don't be shocked if you suck at this.

Although its texture quality is low reolution, the game is great. It reminds me of how the first call of duty was. The only part of the game I found broken was the bot mechanics. Unless there is a direct route for the bots to follow, they will just sit at the spawn. You can command the bots, but this is also a bit broken. However, Red Orchestra is not made for bot play, but to test your combat intelligence against other players on the battlefield. If your the type of person who enjoys run-and-gun, shoot'em up kind of games, then Red Orchestra is definetly NOT your game, fo this game is fairly realistic, and player strategyon the battlefield is a must, or you will find that you will be shot in the face, repeatedly. I must also add that the aiming mechanics are a bit clunky, so dont expect to be gunning down guys a hundred yards away.","July 20, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Vehicular combat is expertly portrayed, with a proper crew being a must for effective employment and a balanced, but powerful presence. Infantry combat truly shines however, the details everywhere - overheating MG barrels, an ammunition feeder and a squad leader with communication equipment, interesting cover and ironsights mechanics as well as stamina and modular health system all contribute to a sense of accomplishment with every fragged opponent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mazzyandmilk/recommended/1200/","mazzyandmilk","mazzyandmilk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mazzyandmilk/","192 products in account","The original Red Orchestra that some may not have heard of. Personally, I think this game is almost perfect in its execution and complexity for a game released in 2006. There is so much content in this game: tons of maps and tons of weapons and vehicles; more than Red Orchestra 2. This is comparatively not a bad thing - as Red Orchestra 2's focus is on infantry rather than on combined arms combat as the first game is.\n\nThe graphics may not be excellent, but it portrays the game's hopeless feel. You are a single soldier fighting amongst up to 63 other players in World War II. Death is inevitable, and the game's gloomy, dark feeling adds to the atmosphere. That is not to say that a single soldier cannot do anything by himself, however. If he is good, then he will be able to provide a large influence in the battle.\n\nIt is a shame that this game does not have many players. Personally, I have found great difficulty getting into the game as the only populated servers are inhabited by Russians who seem to only play this game. Thousands of hours they have poured into the game; they know everything about it, and they will annihilate poor little me (with 60 hours at time of writing) without a second thought.\n\nThis game is unforgiving, and that is the reason why it is so fulfilling. There are no visual aids; no silly unlocks like in Red Orchestra 2 (grr, I hate that unlock system) and you will die in one hit. The wound system mostly works and portrays the weakness of a soldier to a bullet well, but I have had times where I have been shot by a full calibre rifle and not died.\n\nThe tanks... they are interesting. The game attempts to hide the HP system of the vehicles, but it does not work. Typically, your tank will only take one shot before being destroyed. Some tanks are objectively better than others (why would you take a StuG III if you can use a Panzer IV H?).\n\nApart from that, I think the game is balanced. The submachine guns are impossible to use at long range (this is probably on purpose - but it has been changed in Red Orchestra 2), which personally annoys me. Therefore, the most viable weapon is the bolt-action rifle. You can never go wrong with one.\n\nI have not mentioned the excellent mods. Darkest Hour: Europe 44-45 is the most prominent one... in fact, the only mod that is played. It is based on the Western Front after Operation Overlord, so it provides a refreshing experience and change from the Eastern Front for Ostfront 41-45. Also, I think the tank gameplay is better.\n\nThere is also Mare Nostrum, but nobody plays that one. Therefore, I have not had a chance to play it, but its premise seems interesting. North Africa - the British against the Germans and the Italians. A game based on a setting that I have not seen before.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that Red Orchestra Ostfron 41-45 is well worth your time. It is the best WWII shooter I have played (apart from Red Orchestra 2; I'm not sure which one is better) and perhaps the best shooter I have played ever.\nPlease buy it, because I don't want to see it die before Rising Storm 2 releases.","June 1, 2015","true","61.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now RO2 (Red Orchestra: Heroes of Stalingrad) is coming out this year, gonna be a hoot. I hope, if someone actually reads this, that you give it a go. I have high hopes they have fixed some of the issues that RO:O has - and even with its flaws, it is still the best.\n\nAnd I have typoed my avatar.
