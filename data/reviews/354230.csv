(The ability to mouse over units to see who they are and what their current star count is)\n\nThe quick response makes me confident in the future of this game and hope to see it do well with a growing community and a developer that cares.\n\n\n\n<Original Review Below>\nI only played about 30 minutes of this but that's all I could manage.\n\nHave you played a game where you start with 'x' units and must expand across the 'Insert Game World' and try to have more units than your enemy to win territory?\nWell, It's that essentially.\n\nYou are an 'entity' and can combine with other entities to harvest stars faster than your enemies and other upgrades. Stars are like the enemies in those other games. So the more stars you absorb the stronger you are. So be stronger -> Fight enemy -> Profit?\n\nThe world is pretty and calming, the mechanic of combining your entities into better versions is unique to the type of game.\n\nHowever, what kills me the most is the lack of on screen stats. It's hard to tell if you are stronger or weaker then your opponent without clicking on yourself or them to compare. Where most of these games would say hey your guy is 20 units and his is 10, so you should totally try to take that ♥♥♥♥. It doesn't do that.\n\nI really do see what the developer is going for here, with a little more discretion then most of these games. But, it's not for me, I wanna see my stats and not be clicking and guessing. I was confused for the most part and unless something changes later on the mechanics are a poor version of base attacking RTS's.\n\nI can tell that the game gets a little more in depth with the entities over time but the core mechanics just couldn't keep me interested to get to that point =/\n\nHere's a link to the First Look so you can check it out for yourself - (It's still uploading)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7t7CdNuPO3Q\n\nFor more Reviews and bi-weekly podcast check www.EarlyAccessPodcast.com and youtube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast","April 4, 2015","true","1.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

After everything gets set up in the beginning, the various controls, how the game works and the all important vague back story, you realize that you've just stumbled across an amazing find in the realm of video game gold. Devouring Stars is built for, what I think, is a very select group of people; those that like back story but don't feel it's the win-all for a game to be great. This game has a very vague story to it that really makes you pay attention to it in the beginning and then seems to just drop it all together whilst you play the game. But in truth is more of a subconscious, behind the scenes telling that really, in my opinion, makes this game so great. The premises of Devouring Stars, without giving anything important away, is that there are tribes of Ancient Titans living in the deep of Tartarus, which is the Ancient Greek form of deep dark hell. And these titans take many forms; from the smallest once based around the elements, Earth, Fire, Water and Wind; to the greater titans like Chaos itself. The tribe you follow is the tribe of Chaos and its story of death and hopeful rebirth. In the beginning of the game you see your grand titan Chaos being destroyed by the other tribes. You then learn that all that survived of this once great tribe, was a lowly fire titan. Which you now must use to enact the rebirth of Chaos. This in turn leads to the discovery of other Chaotians still living in various parts of the universe, and of mysterious beings that may or may not help you on your journey. At the end of the day, if you don't think that story alone is enough for you to buy the game, check out some game play of it on YouTube. It will take a bit to get accustomed to. Not everyone is good at throwing stars at black holes trying to kill them..\n\nAnd here is that game play I was talking about!:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7jyM_7oIE4E\n","August 19, 2015","true","3.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You don't have to controll to many units but still it has enough tactical depths due to the merging of entities to keep you playing the game for some time. Which is supportet by the randomly generated levels.\nYou every run with a few standart units you can select, and when you finished a map (consisting of serveral levels) you move on the the next on and unlock new slots so you can bring more entities into the next level. Plus you are able to keep the advanced (merged) entities if you dont loose them in battle. Thus, over time you are able to build a small army to fight you enemies.\nThere are several different scenarios you can find yourself into, like a trap or fights for portals (which bring you to the next level).\nI quiet enjoy the artstyle of the game and the background (beeing an entitie which can devour stars is kind of cool :P)\nAlthough the main reason i bought it was the freature to get new units by combining basic ones. That is kind of cool, but i hope in future development it will be more nessecary to switch between the different advanced units more, however it might also be that i'm not far enough into the game to realy make that nessecary.\nPotenitall buyers should keep one thing in mind: Eventhough it says "multiplayer" right now this is local only (and even that is not the real game). I hope they will be able to work on a real multiplayer cause the features this game offers for that are great and i would love to battle other players with and devour their part of the universe :P","April 4, 2015","true","5.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

The concept is cool and the controls are easy.\nYou can feel it's an alpha on some places however.\nA little tweek here and there and we are golden! There\nis a LOT of potential and there are so many combinations\nto make the game interesting.\n\nAlso it's just great to look at, the stellar map truly makes you\nfeel like you are gazing upon existance like some cosmic being,\nor god. The little captions inbetween destinies, and at the beginning\nof battles do tell a story. Even great cosmos eating entities wage war, and\nclaim territory, they fight among eachother even as they hunt you.\n\nWhich makes you think, are the gods, or the titans, or great devils and\ncreators in the unverse, truly so different than us?","June 6, 2015","true","4.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

Either they didn't catch my attention or there was just too much to manage for me to handle. Devouring Stars was different. It captured me with its uniqueness by creating a game surrounding Greek titans as well as having a beautiful OST and artstyle. Crafting units is easy and isn't too much of a big hassle in my opinion. The game, however, is a bit short and I would love it to have a much more deeper plot but it is fine as it is. There are secret levels that can pose a challenge to those who seek it (There is a guide on how to get there). After I saw a gameplay of this game, I just had to have it. Would really recommend for those who want a casual, well-done RTS game.","October 3, 2015","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is very fluid and beautiful, with no choppiness at all.\n\nThe gameplay is good, though it can feel somewhat stale at times, though not always. Even after it starts to feel repetitive it can easily be refreshed by the next section of the game where you may be forced to play with different entities.\n\nThe story is unique and very good, and many times the characters you play as (or entities you control) can and will die (permadeath, in a sense of that unique individual) and need replacement, but otherwise they carry on. It creates a feeling of attachment, then loss, when an entity has been with you on a number of different chapters in any given destiny, and then dies due to your poor tactical planning.\n\nThe game runs perfectly, I don't have an FPS counter but I could easily say I've been at 60FPS the entire time with no lag spikes.\n\n\nOverall the game is great. I bought it as a time passer and am thoroughly engrossed to my surprise. I do think it is a worthwhile buy and recommend it to those reading this.\n","November 25, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Many others put their skill into making long, complex unit trees and buildings with two or three resources to be managed and collected. Not so with Devouring Stars. Here there is a simple idea. You control a set of senitent singularity-like beings and then use these to gather stars that are used as ammunition to  crush other such entities and rip space asunder to calming piano music. All to reclaim your lost glory.\n\nCurrently, the game has a great singleplayer. Multiplayer is still in the works. However, the singleplayer is really quite fun. Well worth ten bucks or a sale price. The dev is quite active and will try to help with any bugs you encounter. There are a few such bugs, but they are quick and easy fixes.\n\nGameplay is simplistic in its elements, you can combine and split entities to make new/more entities, share stars, and attack/move but the metagame is really new or odd depending on your take.
