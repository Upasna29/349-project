I just wanted to review this game as soon as possible, so here we are.\n\nThis is a cute little visual novel with puzzle mini-games and stat-raising as the gameplay. Puzzles were definitely fun for a time, but I admit it got a bit repetitive down the line. If puzzles aren't your thing, I remember the option for disabling it during the beta, so plus points to this game for catering to the varying tastes of the audience.  The writing was well done as well (I can't say anything more specific as I don't want to spoil any detail of the story) and I ended up liking all the characters shown on screen, which is always a good thing. As for the routes, I really can't say as frankly I bought this game for full price, twice (once during the beta, and then here on steam), solely for the yuri route. That particular route is very adorable in my opinion, so I left the game pretty satisfied with my overall experience.\n\nTl;dr : Spent $40 for this game solely for the yuri. No regrets.","April 22","true","0.1"," 45 of 55 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","45","55","7","0"

Period. I enjoyed every exchange, enjoyed the little bits of French and Flemish, enjoyed how the characters existed outside of what Mel saw. The cast is truly diverse and the romance was so well done, I was squealing half of the time. The setting is also so well done! Kudos, kudos, kudos <3\nNow for the routes... they are all so great I have to cherrypick an order. Kyler is just my type, tsun tsun, so I'm biased towards him. Hendrik is also such a cutie, oh my God. Punny and blabbering all the time? Sign me up for it. And if you're talking about cute, Shoji and Joan are runner-ups. They're similarly sweet and shy, but with Joan it's the language barrier to cause it. And when that goes away <3 Deandre's route was also so good, he positively surprised me because he's genuinely a good person.\nFor those worried about the stat rising, it was very light and super manageable. Nothing to stress about.\nThe minigames are either 1) one similar to sudoku or 2) one similar to blackjack apparently? I was really digging (AH!) the sudoku one then I got a 15x15 grid and I kinda gave up before attempting it. I will! Soon. I liked how they became progressively more difficult. The second minigame is luck based and I'm terribly unlucky, so there you have it XD still enjoyable.\nThe art is very good, those chibis are adorable! And I really enjoyed the quantity of CGs. Although I did... cheat... use a guide found on the WW forums...\n\nBottom line: YAAASSSS! This game reminds me of Roommates for the great writing, adorable cast, cute art and lite stat system. Keep them coming <3\n","April 24","true","10.5"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

Upon arriving in Belgium, Melissa gets to meet her mentor as well as the other adults in charge of the internship program.  Of course, she gets to meet the other students participating and as this is a dating sim, there are a total of four dateable guys and one girl that Melissa can either romance or become friends with.  There's also an alone ending as well as a bonus friendship ending if Melissa manages to become friends with everyone.\n\nIn terms of story, there really isn't a plot here.  Simply put, Melissa goes to Belgium to participate in an internship program but there's no drama or anything like that other than learning what the other students or teachers are like.  However, the art is pretty (it's in the anime style and I certainly don't mind chibi art although I can see how it can be off-putting for some people) and the music is appropriate for the game's theme.  There are optional mini-puzzles that enhance the gameplay but if you'd simply rather not do them, there is an option upon starting the game to turn them off so you can play it like a visual novel.  However, I always chose to do the mini-puzzles and that's why my game time is quite lengthy.\n\nIf I do have to address one complaint, it is in regards to the mini-puzzles.  Even though there is a tutorial that explains how to do the mini-puzzles, I felt like it did more of a "tell me" rather than "show me" how to do them.  I felt like I could have better understood how to do the puzzles if the latter approach had been adopted.  Fortunately, there are only two different types of puzzles and once you get the hang of them, they are pretty doable, even if some of those latter excavation puzzles look daunting.  ;)\n\nOverall, I enjoyed C14 Dating and I'm happy that I had a chance to play it.  I'd recommend it if you're looking for a light-hearted fun otome game.  ^^","May 29","true","55.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/octobig/recommended/451640/","octobig","Octobig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/octobig/","36 products in account","C14 Dating is a very cute dating game with an archaeology theme, something that I have not yet seen before. It has some stat raising mechanics, mini games, and a very diverse cast of characters to befriend and romance.\n\nYou are Melissa, 3rd year anthropology student on an archaeology summer course/internship in Belgium. Your fellow classmate couldn't make it on the trip, and so it's just you and your professor from California. That means you have to overcome language barriers, cultural differences & other boundaries to become friendly with the other students -- but at least there's camping, s'mores, and lots of cute guys and girls around!\n\nPros+ Its theme, centered around archaeology & geology\n+ The characters' diversity (disabilities, different body types, etc)\n+ Pretty artwork\n+ The ability to turn off the mini games & change the font\n+ Lots of save slots\n\nCons- The mini games can get tedious, but you can disable them\n- Some of the luck-based mechanics for the games & stat raising\n\nIt's obvious that the writers of this game knew a lot about archaeology, and I learned a lot as well! It's an interesting theme to which the mini games add some extra fun. The games themselves are light (one sudoku-like game & one luck/guessing game), as is the stat raising (you create a weekly schedule with activities that raise certain stats). Its overall atmosphere is very summer camp-like: sleeping in tents, cooking together, partying & setting up a festival.\n\nNext to its archaeology-focus, the best part for me is the incredibly varied & diverse cast. You've got four guys and one gal on a "secret" route:\n\nKyler, aloof neighbourhood tsundere with a cochlear implant\nDeandre, friendly & easygoing rugby player\nHendrik, pun-loving geologist with a prosthetic arm\nShoji, shy & chubby gamer with an artistic talent\nJoan, French flutist struggling with communicating in English\nAnd I really loved all of them!! They are vibrant characters whose background is expanded upon in their own route, in other people's routes, and during location/random events (either when you're working in the lab or in the cave). Most of them are also from different countries & speak different languages. It's such a varied and cute bunch of people all connected to archaeology in some way, and all trying to help out Melissa, the protagonist.\n\nWould 100% recommend this if you're looking for a cute, diverse dating/otome game that doesn't have a standard story or theme. I thought it was a great experience :)","May 7","true","8.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The art work is fantasic, the characters each are unquie and each stand on their own. Joan is pretty cute, while I personally can easily relate to both Kyler and Shoji. The puzzles are a lot of fun, though I must admit I enjoy the cave puzzles more than the lab. All-in-all a great game and I look forward to the next one game from Winter Wolves.\n\nPlot - 7/10\nCharacters - 8/10\nAudio/Visual - 10/10\nOVerall Score - 8/10","April 28","true","20.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Way too easy to build bond with Joan which might be interfering with other routes, and I couldn't even romance her (I realize it's possible but my bond with her was almost as high as I think it could get. And why not Chantal? That seems random). I've played through twice now (second time trying to pursue Kyler, choosing every opportunity to work with him and making sure to choose the answers than increase bond) and I've gotten the friendship ending both times. Also, the minigames will take probably almost half the time you're playing, so keep that in mind. I don't know... For over $20 (CAD) this was a big dissapointment. Maybe a guide will come out, then once the endings are more accessible it'll be worth while. Also, it's really annoying that there's NO info on the characters before buying. I took a risk because the designs were promising, but I usually never buy anything without knowing I like the characters. Unless you like ShyDude™, TsundereDude™, GenericDudes™, and GenericButCuteGirlThatBreaksLesbianHeartsEverywhere™ the characters are pretty boring save for some unique physical qualities (Deaf/Cochlear implant, prosthetic arm, chubby). Sorry for the bad review, but I've been playing this for 7 hours and I'm not the least bit satisfied.","April 25","false","7.2"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","8","18","4","2"
