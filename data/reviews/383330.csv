It has promise, but may not be worth your time.\n\nPros:\nCheap.  At the time of purchase this only cost 15 cents.\nDecent help.  The help screens if you flip through them do a pretty good job of explaining how to play.  Some of the art assets are OK.\n\nCons:\nThis is a very rough around the edges product.  There is a lot of polish missing.\nSmall spelling errors throughout ("sacrifise", "3 enemies is approaching", etc.)\nGameplay itself is both easy and boring, and yet also tedious.  You start off slow and will be hitting the end turn button a lot.\nThe map does not scroll with you which gets annoying as soon as you can move faster.\nThe art is pretty bad in many cases.\nThe font is too large.  The whole game feels designed for a phone and not for a PC.\nThe later gear does not have clear descriptions, and there are no pop-up or context menus on anything.  This means that figuring out what new gear does is a matter of trial and error.  Now you CAN flip gear back and forth for free, so this helps.  Sometimes I noticed no difference from equipping a new piece of gear.\nA story is told, but you have no input, and I found myself quickly skipping past the screens.\nNeeding to quit a level and "lose all progress" to spend skill points quickly gets annoying.\n\n\nAt the end of the day it isn't bad for someone's first try at a game.  This is not the sort of project that should be sold, unless you like paying for someone else to learn game design.  The game is boring, easy and tedious with poor artwork.  It feels like a school project.\n\n3/10","September 27, 2015","false","5.1"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","25","31","2","0"

Your ship's level/EXP and already gained skills stays..You can customize your already gained skill every time under the game menu.\n\nThere are about 6 different equipment slot that each dedicate for different equipment you get by killing/looting from enemy ships you destoried. You can equip more equipment that use a differet equipment slot(like an extra weapon using scaner slot) by skills under the game menu.\n\nMusic is basic mono with no surpises and repetitive. Sound Effect is decent. Graphic is sub par unity engine. Game is easy to learn and easy to master.(just gota figure out when and where to direct energy from shield to weapon/engine).\n\nOnly challange you will have is last level.(or level 2 if u don't move away from the enemy destoryer.\nThe ending is not very satisfactory.\n\nFor a game that nearly don't cost anything at all.. it's would be a basic learning experience for the developer and offer enough enjoyment and thinking for a few hours only.\n\nAchivements are quite easy to get though out the game and they are quite hard to miss even...\n\nA get a few solid hours of enjoyment and worth the 1 dollar I send for this.. Nothing more.. nothing less.\n6.5/10 is my final rating for this dollar indie game.","April 7","true","6.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

There are lots of spelling errors, fairly simple graphics, and issues with controls. However, all that being said, I spent a good deal of time playing it. Though I didn't play it exclusively. I spent most of the time playing this game watching TV shows on Netflix as well. So keep that in mind.\n\nGame play is fairly simplistic, but as you progress you keep that progression of your character. I don't believe it's possible to complete the game on the first play through, similiar to Rogue Legacy. As you progress, your character gets stronger and takes their traits with them for the next play through.\n\nEach time you start, you begin with basic equipment, and as you take down enemies you loot their technology, giving your ship an advantage. The AI is pretty simplistic, so don't expect great tactics from the enemies. The more you play the more you undersand how the enemy ships work.\n\nThe achievements will take some time to get as you need to become strong enough before you can attain some of them.\n\nThe ending I've seen wasn't the best, and the story was very simplistic. Either way, it's still a fun play while doing other things.\n\nOverall: 6.2/10 - It's worth the dollar cost, though you can get it on sale or in a bundle.","May 11","true","22.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Gearing up is kinda fun for a few sectors.

The goal is to find a new homeworld in enemy territory and each level throws a wave of enemies at you. You can choose to complete the objective or just find the exit and escape to the next level.  On the way you find equipment for your ship and earn experience to improve your base abilities.  Your abilities carry over to future games, so you should do better with each attempt.\n\nThere are a few things I'd love to see improved:\n1. The enemies have terrible pathing.  They always take the most direct route to you unless blocked by another ship. This means they won't surround you when they should.  To be fair, some levels have so many enemies that if you were surrounded, you wouldn't last long.\n2.  When you level up you actually have to quit the game, return to the main menu, and select a new ability, then restart. This is unnecessary.  It would be nice if it let me pick a new ability before continuing with the next level.\n3. The difficulty ramped up quickly, or at least the instructions for the bomber level weren't explicit enough.  After having only a mild challenge, I was suddenly killed in one hit.\n","September 27, 2015","true","2.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

When I purchased such a cheap game, I expected much less from it.\n\nI love strategy games and this one is fairly basic on the surface, but there's more than meets the eye.\n\nThe game does have some flaws, but overall it's quite solid in my opinion. I didn't think the game was tedious; I thought the missions made sure there's enough variety to keep things interesting. There's some griding involved, but that didn't phase me too much.\n\nThe equipment you find is also interesting. There's not a ton of weapons, but each weapon has its place. They're different enough that there are certainly different tools for different jobs. Once you figure out what the weapons do, you'll know that you need to keep several spares so you can swap them around when needed.\n\nI recommend this game, especially for such a low price. I would love to see a second Star Chronicles game, or a DLC that extends the story.","March 20","true","14.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I wouldn't say it's a bad game, it has some interesting elements to it, but there is no real tutorial to speak of and the instructions aren't very informative.  That makes getting started on this game really difficult.  At first, I thought the game was pretty frivoulous with handing out items until I hit chapter five and just about everything on the map was hostile toward me for no particular reason.  The game is terribly balanced in the favour of the AI/enemy, especially when you get swarmed and the best of gear can deal with maybe one attack, let alone 4 or more of them at once.  Hopefully some sort of balancing feature in the future will fix this, or perhaps making some aspects of the game more logical.  Give it a try and hope for improvements is my overall assessment of this game.","July 21, 2015","true","1.0"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

The gameplay is solid and the design doesn't over reach, keeping the game tight and focused. the instruction slideshow showes everything you need to know about playing the game, the rest is simple strategy and resource management.\n\nThere is some very interesting elements going on thought out this game, but I could have done with a little more to do other than turnbased combat and looting, as the constant cycle of enemies gets repetative.\n\nStill, a fun time and worth playing again.","April 11","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
