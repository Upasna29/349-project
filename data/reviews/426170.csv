It's easy to be seduced by the promise of phat loot, leveling, and those lovely rare drops. Unfortunately, it takes me a few hours before I realize that a lot of these games don't offer any other compelling aspects. Defragmented is a welcome surprise. It has the elements of a typical action-rpg, but its unique game-design and appropriate pacing, really help it stand out.\n\nLet's start with a subject I normally don't consider: the graphics. In the age of youtube long-plays and 4K screenshots, there's hardly any reason to comment on something anyone can see for themselves. Still, I want to take a moment to discuss just how well Defragmented's graphics work. This is a lo-fi game, but it's also an intense shooter with elements of stealth. It's visually consistent, so you can focus on determining routes, making shots, and dodging bullets. The look of everything is very slick and refined, and you'll never be distracted by bloated and unnecessary details.\n\nNow just because I mentioned "stealth elements" does not make this a core part of the game. It's something to consider, depending on your play-style, but... let's take a step back and determine what your play-style is. There are three classes in the game. The Cyberzerker is a bruiser. Their starting weapon is a shotgun, and their talents include a powerful area of effect blast, and a temporary strength buff. The Railrunner relies on decoys to draw the attention of enemies. Their ability to enhance their speed and dodging ability for several seconds is also massively useful. The Ascended uses a shield and a couple other techniques to carefully pick apart their foes.\n\nEach mission consists of rooms and hall-ways with armed guards patrolling them. Your missions involves killing everyone or accessing a data-terminal. The catch is that even a Cyberzerker can't just rush blindly into battle. The only real advantage you have is your own agency. You decide the route and you have all of the time in the world to plan your attack. As is typical of AI opponents, everyone has better aim and reaction time than you. A lot of the early-game is going to be spent understanding your abilities, finding some decent weaponry, and getting overly familiar with the (r)etry key.\n\n\nDue to the myriad of circumstances that can occur in every mission, the best advice is to never stick with just one type of gun. A sniper rifle is perfectly fine when you have the opportunity to make an accurate shot, but a shotgun is necessary for a frontal assault. It's important to adapt your movements to your weapon. Trying to counterbalance the inaccuracy of a SMG by standing still is going to get you killed. The speed of a bullet is a factor to consider as well. Laser pistols are extremely slow, but you can time your shots so that enemies run into them as they're rounding corners.\n\nIf all else fails, you can grind until your numbers are just that much better than the enemy's, but this becomes increasingly less viable as the game progresses. Once you hit new game+, your progress is going to be halted if you don't reconsider your strategies and your gear. Aside from tougher enemies, NG+ also adds to their numbers. This adds new depth and forces players into situations they hadn't considered earlier. The best part is that these missions never really become frustrating. They're all very short. If you're that good (or that over-leveled) you'll clear almost all of them in 30 seconds each. Granted, these same missions can also take well over 30 minutes apiece to figure out. There are a few difficulty settings for players who are having trouble, or for those craving a little more danger.\n\nWhile this game is on the lean side, it also doesn't make any attempts to overstay its welcome. The story is functionally adept, the action is fulfilling, and you hardly ever get the feeling that you're merely grinding the hours away. This is what I mean about when I talk about appropriate pacing. All too often, an action-rpg is compared to the likes of Diablo, Marvel Heroes 2016, or another title that practically requires a huge time investment. Defragmented shares similarities with these games, but also has the good sense not to extend far beyond its means. This game could use a handful of additional missions, and maybe even a way for players to build and upload their own levels. At the same time, I respect that it doesn't try to pad itself out. There are three classes with a few abilities between them, a handful of weapon-types, and really only two kinds of enemies. Basically, this game takes what it has, uses everything to its fullest extent, and that's perfect.\n\nSpeaking of, the soundtrack to this game is also perfect. There's isn't a weak link anywhere to be found. The songs always fit the mission, and the developer made sure that the music doesn't restart everytime the player dies. Yes, it is a minor detail, but I really appreciate it.\n\nHonestly, I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I started this game. Aside from Defragmented looking like something from the earliest 3D games, I also wasn't exactly floored with its tutorial missions. However, as soon as it clicks, everything comes together quite wonderfully. All in all, I think that this is a quality title; one worth setting aside a weekend or two for.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 12","true","13.3"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","38","47","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/recommended/426170/","djsoulfck","DJSF - off @ twitch.tv/sinlike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/djsoulfck/","416 products in account","I stumbled upon this game on Reddit and was very impressed with the quick progression of its development over 18 months with a mainly two-man team. I received a review copy and was excited to play because it reminded me of Hotline Miami (HM), but with a sleek cyberpunk feel. Despite dying countless times, I was pleasantly satisfied with my gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like overhead shooters in the vein of Hotline Miami, lots of loot, cyberpunk themes, role-playing elements, and great electronic music (particularly synth), then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are great - the amount of detail in the environment is good, and the artstyle during cutscenes is very nice; the world feels vibrant and alive. Running on max settings is not too intensive on your rig, and the flashiness of everything can be quite entertaining and pretty to look at. With a upbeat electronic soundtrack supplemented by visualization in the game world (the black areas of the level pulse different colors in tune with the beat), the music adds immensely to the cyberpunk, action-intensive atmosphere. The story is interesting and well-written - I like the conflict of clones vs. naturalism in a previously-struggling society. You can skip cutscenes and fast-forward through them (also includes the option to toggle them off), which is something small, but still very appreciated.\n\nThe controls are easy to learn and the tutorial is very helpful at orienting you to the game mechanics, however, I would strongly suggest you use a controller. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, and the most challenging part of the game will probably be either managing the camera and/or accepting the amount of caution and planning required to complete each level. On a keyboard and mouse setup, the camera switching did not feel as smooth compared to when I used a controller - and quick orientation is essential to success because if you fall off the stage you will die and have to restart. Similar to Hotline Miami, the enemy AI can be very brutal, discouraging a guns blazing strategy (at least initially). Scouting the area and learning enemy movement patterns is critical to beating each level. It is easy for you to be killed, however, the game is much more forgiving than HM because when you die you restart, but also keep any experience and money gained - I've actually levelled up a few times by repeatedly dying in a level that I was stuck on.\n\nGameplay involves you entering an area and killing everyone found within. Every character has a laser pointer that shows current aiming direction, however, other elements to consider when firing are distance, weapon accuracy, and bullet spread. There are three classes to choose from, each with two unique skill trees and abilities - like creating a ghost decoy, manifesting a small bullet-negating shield, and healing yourself based on stacks accumulated. Guns are categorized into heavy, light, and energy - each having upgradeable ammo capacity. Furthermore, you can increase your weapon mastery with pistols, submachineguns, rifles, shotguns, and energy arms (adding 2% damage per mastery level) by killing a certain number of enemies. Equipment is further varied by rarity, with orange-colored items being extremely high-valued. When you are in the pre-mission setup interface, you can also go to a store, however, there are different storekeepers in a number of the stages.\n\nDuring each level, you will have to assess the situation carefully - unless you enjoy dying and restarting numerous times. Enemies will chase you if spotted and investigate weapon fire if nearby. One tactic I favored in HM - shooting at things to lure enemies into my killing zone - remains very effective at thinning down the enemy count. You can change up your equipment and have 3 slots for different active weapons (you can still keep others in your inventory). Included in your equipment are 1 grenade and 2 program core (passive abilities like increased dodge chance) slots. I found that both the variety in weapon types and class skill trees made each playthrough unique enough to enjoy. To encourage multiple playthroughs, you have access to a storage container accessible by every character you have.\n\nI really enjoyed the brutality and unforgiving nature of HM, however, that savagery is missing from Defragmented because you still retain your experience points and loot. That being said, you will still die quite frequently and each level is highly entertaining. My favorite element of the game is the fantastic soundtrack, followed closely by the flashy presentation of everything. I really do feel like I am in a cyberpunk world whenever I play a stage.\n\nOverall, the game plays really well and is a lot of fun if you are interested in intense action in a cyberpunk world. I do not know if there is an item/weapon that addresses this, but one thing I would like is a way to scan enemy health because it is exceedingly easy to die if you do not double-tap (continue firing/attacking) when an enemy has more health than the damage you dealt. One ability I like using teleports you to a nearby enemy (very short casting range) and unleashes a melee attack, however, performing such an action on a shotgun-wielding and/or high-levelled opponent will usually cause you to instantly be killed. With a 30 level cap (more of a soft cap because you still gain experience points) and three different classes to try, replayability is fairly high. If you enjoy top-down action shooters with rpg elements, then definitely give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","February 12","true","4.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/recommended/426170/","randomiseuser","RandomiseUser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randomiseuser/","284 products in account","Defragmented is a difficult game with the similar mechanic to Hotline Miami - work your way through a level murdering everyone, mindful that if they see you they'll probably kill you. And when you die, you get rapid restarts so you get straight back to the murdering.\n\nYou need to be stealthy, you need to work out their movement patterns, and when things go south you need to be deadly accurate.\n\nYour first weapon will not be accurate, so you'll die over and over. But every level is full of random loot placed in lockers, bins and on the bodies of the people you murder. Eventually you'll find a weapon (or two) whose stats you are happy with - maybe a sniper, maybe a full-on assault rifle. You'll start to feel more confident.\n\nMost importantly, you keep everything when you die. You even keep your XP, so the more you play, the more of a beating your character can take.\n\nPost-tutorial gameplay from chapter one [pre-release build]:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrY9eV1ylr8\n\nCrucially, it never becomes easy. You'll always need quick reactions, you'll still need to figure out the cleverly constructed levels, and if you murder somebody in earshot of other enemies, you'll still be chased by a mob and almost certainly get wiped out. So you can't grind your way to success, although it does help.\n\nSome neat additional skills give you extra tactical possibilities. Possibly the most useful is a decoy that marches forwards and draws enemy fire for a few shots, useful if there's a heavily armed guard facing the direction you want to go and who you can't get behind.\n\nThe game camera takes a bit of getting used to. The top-down view goes a long way but for precision shooting (and working out fields of vision) you'll need to use the temporary 3D views. In a tight spot, predicting which way the camera will point when you press the camera button isn't easy. And using these views while actively moving around isn't usually a good idea. A few times I fell off the level into a chasm because the camera did a sudden 180.\n\nThe story happens between levels and adds context to the game, is well-written and skippable. It does feel a bit separate from the action, though; it feels like you could rewrite the story completely and the game itself would be identical.\n\nComplaints? I didn't like the menu system. In going for an 80s cyberpunk terminal feel (to fit in with the rest of the game) it ends up being confusing and hard to read, particularly at first. The grinding aspect can be off-putting when you start to worry you can't complete a level until you've raided the same locker 50 times. And yeah, I shouted a lot at the aforementioned camera.\n\nThat's it. Defragmented is unforgiving at first, but rewards you for persistence (and repetition). If you can get past that, dig the neon cyberpunk aesthetic and enjoy rummaging through bins for loot, you'll get a lot out of this game. It's satisfyingly frustrating all round.\n\n* More gaming videos by Randomise User","February 13","true","5.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

And as I played it through (and, of course, had some nice moments) I give it a thumbs up.\n\nThe thing with Defragmented is that it reminds you how great Miami Hotline was and why that is. I guess the main thing is focus - Miami focuses on the shooting, and Defragmented adds these RPG elements that don't always make sense. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose - but with a dexterity-based game like this it should be your own fault to lose, not because the dice roll said so.\n\nAnyway, overall the game worked nicely enough, even with the somewhat strange controls and camera.

It has many tropes common to arpg's: loot, leveling up, abilities etc..., but its combat is refreshingly different than most arpg's. I have not gotten too far into the story yet, but wanted to give it a positive review because the combat is so different.\n\nMissions are brief, usually kill everyone or retrieve data. There are usually between 3-6 enemies per mission (so far). Just like in real life, no one in this game survives more than one or two shots. Instead of facing down hordes of foes spamming heal potions, the goal of every enemy encounter is to ambush the enemy, picking the approach that gives the best odds of surviving quick, brutal gunfights where even just one bullet can put you down. In fact, it is best to never take any opponent head on.  Flanking, waiting for patrolling guards to turn around, and the element of surprise are essential for success.\n\nIt can be frustrating at first, but there seems to be no penalty for dying. Once I got used to the pace of the gunfights, I learned to approach each enemy tactically, using the environment to maximize my odds, and the game became quite fun.","March 6","true","2.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Clear out rooms of enemies in fast paced combat then loot boxes to find a host of randomised weaponry. The cyberpunk theme is fun, with the story delivered in Visual Novel scenes between levels. The visual novel bits have a great art style, though maybe a little limited in character poses, and the story had me thoroughly engaged in this world and its characters by the end. It's all tied together with a fantastic soundtrack throughout.\n\nA few mechanics of the core gameplay loop perhaps don't stand up to extended play, you can learn ways to exploit mechanics of enemies and the world making the game artificially easier, but for a single play through it's perfectly enjoyable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043327708/recommended/426170/","76561198043327708","IndieHangover - JMW","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043327708/","231 products in account","Thie Review Originally Appeared on IndieHangover.com on 2/29/16 -  For the full review; http://www.indiehangover.com/review-defragmented-by-glass-knuckle-games/\n\nWhen I first heard the announcement that Glass Knuckle Games, creators of the fabulous Thief Town (seriously, Thief Town comes in a VERY close second behind Knight Squad in my list of “Greatest Indie Party Games of all time”) were doing a Cyberpunk RPG. I was excited. It gets said a lot, but Cyberpunk is an often underrepresented genre in media and in gaming. I think that we could see Cyberpunk dethrone Steampunk from its places as the most popular geek sub-culture in the near future, but currently, seeing a good Cyberpunk game release is a relatively rare thing, particularly if you discount Shadowrun.\n\nDefragmeneted is here to help scratch that Cyberpunk itch.\n\nDefragmented knows what it is aiming for, and it hits the mark. It’s a fast paced, loot-based top down Run-and-Gun RPG, and while it is not without a few missteps, the mechanics are tight, and lend themselves to hours of mixing and matching guns and abilities, trying to nail down a combination of stats that’ll let you run and gun your way through the bright neon levels as long as your reflexes are fast enough.\n\nThe RPG elements of Defragmented are well implemented, if basic. When you begin the game, you have the choice of one of three classes, and have two trees of abilities into which you pump skill points as you level up. My main play through was as an Ascendant, and all my abilities felt powerful, if situational. I was able to use Fracture, a short range psychic melee attack, Ascension, which was a sort of stacking damage buff earned through kills, and Intervention, a psychic shield that drained my energy over time. However, once I got a couple good guns in my loadout, I didn’t end up using my abilities all that often. They simply didn’t feel as important while I was toting around a shotgun that could obliterate anyone I pointed it in the direction of. This very well may be a case of mismatched play style and class though, so take this critique with a grain of cyber-salt.\nThe best part of Defragmented’s gameplay however, is the random loot. Loot drops aren’t super common in the game, but happen often enough to keep you excited for the next one. Since weapon stats are randomized in both drops and at the in-game DEAL-EO shops, you’re on a constant hunt for a great new shotgun or SMG to use. And boy, is it a good feeling when you get a good gun. I almost think that gun power is tuned a little bit too high in Defragmented, as getting one legendary gun with the perfect stats can change the course of your gameplay. Yet,  your so squishy to enemy attacks that I think this isn’t a substantial issue, and doesn’t break the game or your enjoyment of it.\n\nHowever, somewhat frustratingly and somewhat brilliantly, this sword cuts both ways in Defragmented. Enemies also have their weapon type and qualities randomized in each level. On your first attempt in a new level, you might go up against a standard rapid fire turret, only for it to become an epic shotgun turret death-machine in the next run. This can feel a bit unfair at times, creating situations in certain levels where you don’t really have a chance, but I like it. It keeps you on your toes, forces you to pay attention, and helps levels remain fresh when playing them over and over again.\n\nWhich you will do. Because you will die. A lot.\n\nDefragmented is a tough game, and after the first couple introductory levels there is a MASSIVE ramp up in difficulty (the game actually warns you about this, which I laughed at like a fool the first time I saw the PSA). I like this kind of challenge, but I’m sure there are many gamers that will find this a bit too harsh. And that’s okay; different strokes for different folks!\n\nIn regards to the look and feel of the game, Defragmented NAILS the cyberpunk aesthetic when you are inside the levels. Each level is a mix of bright neon lights, angular lines, and cold futuristic hallways. The pulsing synth soundtrack is one of the best electronic game soundtracks I’ve ever heard, and perfectly sets the stage for running and gunning in the Cyberpunk world that Glass Knuckle Games has created. I could go on, but I really don’t think I have to: the aesthetic of Defragmented’s levels speaks for itself.\n\nHowever, in between these levels of run-and-gun madness are short narrative sequences. These felt very jarring to me from an artistic standpoint.  I liked the story of Defragmented, which was full of conspiracy and terrorism, and a wonderfully imaginative cyber death cult,but the art style used in these scenes is vastly different from the art style you see when you are inside the gameplay levels. Inside these levels, there is a Tron feel to everything; bright neon lights, lots of angles, and low poly models. However, in these narrative sequences, the art style is done in a much more classically animated style; bright primary colors, crisp lines and plenty of detail. Both, individually, are done very well. However, side-by-side, they are so radically different that it takes me out of my immersion in the cyberpunk world of Defragmented.\nWhen all is said and done, I’d recommend Defragmented to anyone looking for a fast paced, if at times punishing, game. Any fan of the Cyberpunk genre should certainly check the game out, if at a bare minimum for the soundtrack, and the few very minor missteps in design don’t in any way effect your enjoyment of the story, or of the absolutely fantastic gameplay. Glass Knuckle has delivered a very solid loot based RPG that promises hours of enjoyment and a great deal of replayability.\n\n","March 11","true","20.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You'll be thoroughly spanked by the enemies as you do your best to please your mistress, Mai.  With a story that's absolutely titillating, the ending really left me in a bind (shhh, i watched a stream so i know how it ends).  What really drives me wild is the fully destructible environments, knowing Mai would be pleased that i absolutely trashed the bases of her enemies.  The game's relentless onslaught really leaves you begging for more.","February 24","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/426170/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","Target Audience:  80s scifi fans who have a high frustration tolerance and a willingness to accept defeat over and over and over again.\n\nFirst Impressions Video: https://youtu.be/K6GnhtuIPHs\n\nSummary:\nA game that wants to live in the 80s scifi lifestyle....and plays like a game that may have been made in the 80s. The game strongest element is its intriguing scifi storyline. While we've seen plots of government vs freedom before, the addition of the personal element into it is well done here, and it's not a simple good vs evil story line. The soundtrack complements this, and presentation wise, the game does a reasonable job. It's the gameplay that falls flat on its face. While you'd think it'd be straight forward, long lines of sight added to some enemies that can snipe you from afar makes a deadly combination that puts the frustration factor not only on high, but on infurating. This on top of some poor level design decisions that don't complement the gameplay in question either. See that's the key word in all this: Frustration. It's a game that can't escape that frustration, whether it be a bad accuracy system that goes against the small time to die game play, or literring the floor with movable boxes that impedes the players progress, and blocks his line of site. In the end, I all I wanted to do was walk away from the game, never to look at it again.\n\n\nLists:\nMy Positives:\nThe 80s story themes do pretty well overall, as it does remind me of good government versus free will stories of the past. It's not just straight up good versus evil, there's detail and nuasence added to this tale.\nSound track is pretty rockin, with good electronic music that fits what the game is going for in most cases. High action, and good fun all around.\nFor the most part, the UI is clean and functional, minimal but giving you the information that you need.\nThe ammo upgrade system is nice.\nThe core gameplay rewards creative thinking, which is basically finding out how to exploit the AI.\nMy Negatives:\nDesign, Design, Design. There's a couple of mechanics that could work in this game, but when they get combined together, it's a disaster.\nEnemies have deadly accuracy, even with weapons considered to be close range (shotgun). Best clip is in the video where I walk through the door, and get blown away from an enemy off screen in one shot. Speaking of....\nThe camera fights you as you won't be able to see what you need to actually fight the enemies at times. Combine that with some deadly accuracy, and you've got a situation where it's just not fun to get your ♥♥♥ handed to you. Especially when....\nThe accuracy stat on guns was a bad idea in a game with such a short time to die, especially when enemies don't seem to be affected by it.\nWhy the ♥♥♥♥ on the ground. It is one of the most annoying things in the fact that it can actually really mess with the mechanics of battle. Why. Why do this. Especially when you can actually hit that ♥♥♥♥ with your gun at times.\nGame needed better level design all around. While there's some variety, it doesn't play to the game strengths, especially with long corridors, or some kill zones that you can't avoid.\nHaving numbers for abilities at the bottom of the screen without something relating the ability is an oversight.\nThe game lacks punch, impact. Sometimes throwing a mine can get a cool rush of fun, but most of the time, you're doing the same thing over and over again.\nThe AI is pretty dumb at times. Once I figured out that you can melee around corners....yeah the game became a bit easier. Not in a good way.","February 16","false","4.7"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","14","27","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxxcrash/recommended/426170/","maxxcrash","Markusnl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxxcrash/","254 products in account","In its current state, this game is not worth the asking price of €15. Granted the music is absolutely awesome and the game has a nice atmosphere to it, but the so-so cutscenes and the horrible UI make it feel amateuristic at best. That's forgivable. But the major gripe I have with this is that the camera controls are awful - what could be a fast and frantic shootfest is severely hampered by the constant struggle with the camera view. I've only played this game for twenty minutes - as soon as I encoured more than two enemies in one room, I gave up.\n\nObviously, this game is like a 3D version of Hotline Miami. But there's a good reason that the original is in 2D.\n\nI'm happy to see that the developer is working so hard on this game, crunching out patches every few days and replying to reviews and comments. My message to you is to keep up the good work, focusing on the camera and the UI. And in the mean time you may want to consider making this game Early Access or alternatively lowering the price whilst making it clear to everyone that it is still under development.\n\nI for one will be coming back to take a look every now and then.","February 28","false","0.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It's unique art style for both menu and cut scenes takes my attention, even if the options menu is a bit confusing to navigate.\n\nThe art in the cutscenes is clean and stylized, with tons of character and little details being put into place to draw the attention to the entire scene. Though there is no spoken dialogue, and the cutscenes play like those you'd expect in a dating sim, the art style really sells it here.\n\nFollowing you get dropped in the game proper... and there my issues start and don't really end.\nThe graphics are a very stylized polygon based ..something. I cant put any reason behind it, as the best i can describe them is "unfinished". the textures are poor, the models are very simple and frankly, quite ugly and the character animations are clunky and don't translate well to the 3D medium. On top of some levels just not having a backdrop at all and only displaying a rotation number of colors while the level floats in the air...\n\nThis weird top-down-3d creates a lot of problems that needlessly make the game harder than it should be with line of sight not being blocked (or enemy bullets) but your player bullets are. Where certain objects are static and non movable, but others are... somewhat. The entire render & art mostly just leaves me sad, because I've been taken in by a well styled and themed introduction and then thrown into a pile of manure.\n\nAnd i could probably get past all that for the enjoyable implementation of the leveling, character progression and loot mechanics... were it not that the main "strategy" of the game is surviving the RNG of your weapons accuracy. Yes, in a tactical shooter... the game has accuracy that is a random weaponstat. Which means all your planning in a level is thrown out the window in the vain hope "maybe that mob wont dodge my lazergun this time and shotgun me to the face 5 times"\n\n\nThe levels are pretty varied in terms of layout, but all aspects of enemy types (gun/etc..) and unit models (or lack thereof) and graphical aspects are simply... not.\n\n\nFor a game that sounds absolutely phenomenal, it is heavily let down by it's graphics & randomized hit-chance. Creating frustration, annoyance and confusion where it should create adrenaline, satisfaction and tension.","February 12","false","18.0"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","11","27","3","0"
