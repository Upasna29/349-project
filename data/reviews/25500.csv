Beautiful scenery not unlike Crysis, voice acting on par with the Metal Gear Solid series, and powerful, intricate cricket gameplay to round it out into the only true 10/10 game I have played in a long, long time. There is no reason why you should not own Cricket Revolution at this point.","November 29, 2013","true","157.1"," 52 of 82 people (63%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","63","52","82","28","9"

Still, it works, and is moderately fun.\n\n\nI did also play the demo for this so, despite the low playtime on my library now, i have actually tried it out properly.","November 27, 2013","true","1.2"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

The gameplay is both incredibly simplistic (fielding is all automatic and bowling is very toned-down) and needlessly complex (many, many ways to swing, each with their own button combination.)  There's not a whole lot to do but just play games with the teams they provide you (no customization or anything like that) so even if you can get past the controls, there's not much to do.  Worst yet, the game isn't supported anymore and you can't create accounts for it, so setting up multiplayer requires using external programs like Hamachi.\n\nA bunch of my friends bought the game for each other as gag gifts, and even the people who liked cricket couldn't find much to enjoy.  The game's probably not even be worth it for $2.99.","February 17, 2014","false","4.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The problem with this is it is almost impossible to know when the game starts timing you as to when you should press your shot selection! Press too early and it does not register as the bowler is still classed as running up, or press too late when the ball is in flight and about 1/3 of the way down the pitch (i.e. when you would actually start making your shot in real life) and the batter misses and gets out.\nNo where is there a timing gauge (like the EA cricket games have) which would let you get a sense of when to time the ball. In the practice nets there are criptic written proms which say 'too late' or 'too early', but This does not help as the speed of bowling naturally varies from ball to ball so it does not let you get an idea of when you should have pressed the buttons. There is no system to tell you how well you timed something in the matches at all, and as the ball often appears to sail through the bat without making contact it is impossible to know what you did wrong!\nAt least once I have been out LBW when the ball did appear not hit the batter but all the fielders appeal as if it did, and obviously the umpire just triggers you. I can only assume the reason there is no 'action replays' in this game is because this would highlight these frustrating incidents.\n\nLike most games of this type, the bowling is dull and the AI batters can play insane physics defying shots which defeat the point of setting fielders.\n\nAvoid this game.\n","December 14, 2013","false","3.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

The name "Cricket Revolution" made me think it'd be like A Bug's Life, except with crickets and more hardcore. When I began playing the game, it instead looked like a sports game of sorts. I didn't really get what it had to do with crickets, but I started a new game anyway. It put me in some stadium and had me play some stupid version of baseball where you roll the baseball on the ground and hit it with a paddle, kinda like golf but baseball. I decided to go with it, because I thought maybe in the middle of the game the crickets would revolt and set the story for the game. I played the match out to the very end and didn't see a single damn cricket. This title is incredibly misleading, and Valve refused to give me my money back.
