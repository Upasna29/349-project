Once the rather contrived supernatural aspects are accepted even the "weirdness" that occurs is amenable.\n\nThe Story:  Vera receives a cryptic phone call from her estranged younger twin Arthur asking/begging her to come back to their childhood home, Pilgrim's Hook, a remote ex-whaling island village off Nantucket, Massachuesetts (USA).  (This fictional place would be off the coast of Boston, Cape Cod, or Martha's Vintage in Massachusetts for trivia lovers.)  By the time she gets there her brother is missing and she must find him.  Relatively typical storyline, except for the fact she finds him by chapter two.  Meanwhile, an evil lurking Cthulhu-like octopus starts talking to Vera through water puddles and flat reflective surfaces.  Creepy, and just exactly why does it want Vera?  This is actual storyline: the mystery of island and why it is there.  The evil denizen of the deep is left rather open to interpretation, however, its motives are not. It clearly states them.  However, why it considered Vera to be a good candidate is well ... simply a poor choice of its part.\n\nThe gameplay:  This is where the gamer will love or hate the game.   If a straight forward linear hunt, search and find is your thing, then this game is not it.  The gameplay is "open world".  What I mean by this is the gamer can go anyway, look, hunt, search, find objects, and do puzzles in no given order.  What can be done is limited to the clues given, items found and objects available in the inventory.  This will cause "confusion" for linear thinkers, and complaints from those who dislike "wandering".  (There is a built in walkthrough that is set up in a linear progression and a fast travel map.)  The game "bottle necks" at certain points and the player can not progress until all objects needed to be found are found and the tasks needed to be done are completed.  (Personally I consider these points to be self checks, if I cannot proceed I missed something somewhere.)\n\nPuzzles: There are two types of HOs.  1) Straight forward HO scenes with at least one cleverly hidden object. (Not the type that makes one say "jerks" but the type that make one say "oh there it is, wow how did I miss that"  2) Find x amount of objects.  Usually 3 different objects of different amounts.\nThere is a variety of other puzzle types some harder then others, one requires a lot of patience and one ultra classic I have not seen in years.  (Some of those oldies will stump today's audience and this one will probably stump some players.)\n\nThere are two sets of Hidden Finds: Castor's Collection (fading in and out sea life) found throughout the main storyline, and the Whale's Bones, only available after finishing the bonus chapter.\n\nOverall: Not a deep storyline and one that leaves a lot of room for intrepretation and unanswered questions if one thinks about it too much.  "Open world" game style.  A variety of puzzles (at least one ultra classic) and HO scenes.  This a relatively short game, too, compared to more recent games.\n\nOne last thing: Achievements.  All in-game achievements can be achieved in a single playthrough and some achievements are quite different from the usual achievement fare.  If steam achievements and trading cards is the only reason you play then do not play this game, this game has neither.  However, if you play HOs for the sheer joy of playing a decent story with decent HO scenes and puzzles then play this game.","September 1, 2015","true","8.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","1"

And Pilgrim's Hook turned out to be fine for that - the puzzles aren't trivial, but nothing that'll really stump you either. Artwork is well done and atmospheric. The plot is thin, as is the logic behind many of the "adventure" components of the game, but neither were so bad as to actually put me off the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a diverting, Cthulhu-esque adventure romp that keeps you entertained for 4-5 hours, Pilgrim's Hook is worth picking up (though probably not at full price.)","November 8, 2014","true","6.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Now moved by the need to save him, she returns there to discover that there is a surnatural entity that wants her...\n\nThe plot of the game is well-written: you're first there to save your brother Arthur and you end up to be wanted by a surnatural entity that is terrorizing somewhere the inhabitants that stayed. You don't know why it wants you but it's not set at all to kill you... Given the fact that you're the only one that is resisting its power, maybe it thinks that you may become an apprentice or something like that.\n\nAnyway, it promises a dark setting and indeed, between the village kinda dead, fogs or even abandoned houses (yours among them), the scenes are really well drawned. The soundtrack is good too.\n\nBut I've kinda a problem with the gameplay. I mean, it's great to find items but in some scenes, you have to move so much stuff that it can be quite boring after a while. Besides, as I played in French, some words used weren't familiar to me. I took minutes to find a single item, resorting to click on any items. And some of them weren't really easy to spot. But the puzzles are well balanced.\n\nAs it's a CE, it means bonus. So, you have a bonus chapter, concept arts, etc... Also, there are in-game achievements that could have been without problems on Steam, as they're the usual ones: finish a scene in less than a minute, don't use hints, find Cestor's creatures (kind of beyond objects), etc..\n\nIf I find 15 euros a little too much for the games as there are some of the same type (Collector's Edition) that are a little above in terms of quality and that are less expensive, it's still worthy of your wallet.

Previous game in this series: Livingston\n\nGame Visual/Audio\nThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're amazingly well done. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGameplay\nThere are three different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual, Expert and Hardcore.\n\nThere are fifteen different achievements can be earned during gameplay. Some of these achievements do have certain requirements before they can be unlocked.\n\nThere is a notebook holds all story events that had happened in the game.\n\nThere is an objective panel inside the notebook. Click on the tab it will bring up the objective panel.\n\nThe interactive map allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates there are tasks that needs to be done at certain locations. The map can be accessed through the notebook and outside of it. Please note that the map isn't given immediately when the game started.\n\nMost of the hidden object scenes consists of find "x" amount of an item and traditional word list. Some of them do require little or no interaction.\n\nMost of the game's puzzles are rather easy to solve without much difficulty. For most of these puzzles there's a reset button. However, there's definitely a skip button, for all of the puzzles. These two features are only present in "Casual" game difficulty mode.\n\nThere are twenty-five collectible sea creatures. They're scattered throughout the entire game.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, there's a bonus chapter, but it can be unlocked only after the main story of the game's completed. The bonus chapter is the pre-sequel to the main story.\n\nThere's a built-in strategy guide for the game. It can be access anytime during gameplay.\n\nMiscellaneous\nIn the Bonus Content section: nine concept art; six wallpapers; collectibles: whale bones and sea creatures; Arthur's Journal; Achievements and Bonus Chapter.\n\n[Please note that Arthur's Journal and Whale Bones sections can't be accessed right away.]\n\nFinal thoughts, I definitely enjoying playing this game all the way through to the end. However, there's one thing that would make traveling less tedious is having a map that fast travel ability. As for the replay value I would say is low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.","November 14, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

It may be unoriginal, but it is also a solid hidden object puzzle title.\n\nLong version:Small Town Terrors 2 is the kind of hidden object game that tries to remain in the genre’s comfort zone, which works as much to its advantage as against it.\n\nThe story offers little surprises: while searching for a loved one you find yourself in a small town haunted by something evil, which of course you promptly destroy before the end credits. There is next to no supporting cast, and the voice acting is kind of a hit and miss.\n\nSame goes for the puzzles: we don’t meet a single one that wasn’t seen before, but they offer a large variety and a good difficulty curve– although the hidden object scenes tend to rely on the ‘find x amount of said object’ gimmick. The only really conspicuous flaw is the usual dumb adventurer syndrome, where you instantly throw away a useful object even if you would need it three scenes later.\nDespite these small issues Pilgrim’s Hook is still a good pick that won’t really disappoint any hidden object game fans.","November 25, 2014","true","4.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Meh.  But, since there's no middle-of-the-road option, I've got to recommend it.   However, while here writing this review, I noticed the list price for the game:  just about $15.  No.  Just no.  I got 5.3 hours of tolerable gameplay out of it (4.6 hours in the main game and 0.7 hours in the bonus chapter).  Under no circumstances is that worth $15.  I happened to have bought the game in the 8-item Sinister Bundle for a total of about $8 (call it a dollar a game).  Now, that's worth it.\n\nThere's nothing special about the game.  The graphics, puzzles, Hidden Object Games (HOGs), and voice acting are all acceptable for the genre.  Personally, I found the gameplay to be just a bit more difficult to get through than in other similar games.  One thing that did strike me is that near the end, the logic of the gameplay seems to fall apart:  I had to resort to the Strategy Guide just to figure out WHAT I was supposed to be doing (not necessarily HOW).  Also, the game is awfully weak in explaining what the bad guy is trying to do.  At the end of the bonus chapter, it explains it's the standard "Pinky and the Brain" "try to take over the world" thing.  But, if I've got the chronology right, the bad guy spent about two centuries tormenting a handful of people until his sphere of influence was reduced to about 5 people and an isolated town.

It got to the point where I just stopped playing them when I got to Price for Our Sins, and didn't even bother playing this game.\n\nI made a huge mistake. I randomly decided to try this game out because I was bored, and found it was just as good, if not better, than every other game of the bundle. The puzzles are challenging, the story is very good, and it honestly scared the crap out of me.\n\ntl:dr version: If you love point & click games and can only get one from this bundle, buy this one and stay as far away as you can from Shadows: Price for Our Sins.","June 30, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
