Got a few hours under my belt of playing so I guess it's a good time.\n\nWhat makes this game fun?\n\n-Guns. Lots of guns. For lack of better description, it's diablo with guns set in a apocalyptic world.\n-Unintentional Humor. The poor translating of the game text has caused for some hilarious quotes from NPCs.\n-Community. The number of people playing isn't huge which could be a negative, if it didn't cause for creating a very tight nit like community where a lot of people know each other and know of each other causing the game to feel more friendly and rewarding to log onto. It's kind of like that bar in Cheers. You want to go where everybody knows your name.\n-Music. The soundtrack for the game is actually pretty good. I enjoy it a lot.\n\nWhat makes the game kinda hard/boring/ maybe bad?\n\n-Grindy. While I don't mind, some people might find the game grindy and boring because of it. Once you hit level 50 you kind of run out of quests to do and have to grind dailies and just mobs to get xp to get to the cap level of 60. Kinda rough, but some people actually enjoy this.\n-Limitation to your character. Nobody really tells you when you start to watch how you spend your skill points because when you want to respec, you will have to pay real money or start over new character. Well now you know, so maybe it takes one bad thing away.\n-Outdated Graphics. Once again, something that doesn't bother me, but might others. A lot of people seem to voice concern of the graphics looking similiar to that of the original Diablo, which can be said they are poor and outdated. However in the time and age of nostalgia, where people are playing 8 bit games on super gaming PCs and not complaining, this seems like a ♥♥♥♥ poor excuse to complain about a game.\n\nOverall. This game is super fun and can get you hooked if you're into this style of games. At the same time, it's not a cup of tea for everyone to share, so give it a try and see if you enjoy the sip.\n","October 9, 2015","true","631.3"," 80 of 89 people (90%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","90","80","89","11","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFattestCoporateCat/recommended/362070/","TheFattestCoporateCat","CoporateFatCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFattestCoporateCat/","700 products in account","YET ANOTHER DECENT GAME GETTING BAD REVIEWS BY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT PUT ENOUGH TIME INTO SAID GAME TO WRITE A FACTUAL REVIEW. As short as this game currently is, at least a few hours would show some credibility.\n\nDO NOT LET MY STEAM TIME FOOL YOU. Steam will never reflect my true time in this game, I would much rather continue using the standalone client.\n\nReview Update 10-17-15\nAs my opinions of the game itself have not changed, I do have some gripes with the current DLC. In short, I do not consider cash shop content to be DLC, & I find it silly to be sold as DLC.\n\nI have been playing this game long before they decided to put it on steam. When the starting point was inside of a tent rather than a medium action heli strike. And currently I hold 3 characters 2 which have already reached current endgame status. <Correction it has been a while since I have played the game and did not realize they raised the cap again. So I have 2 characters sitting at 50. Current end game status is now at 60.\n\nAs many have said this game follows in the veins of Diablo (if Diablo had guns). But also I would like to include Shadowgrounds, Alien Breed, Space Siege, Torchlight...I think you are getting the idea...\n\nOne of, in the small handful of, true MMOARPG games out. If you have played Dekaron, Dragon's Nest or Defiance, then you are already familiar with how a true MMOARPG should feel. Fast fluid action & reaction, giving you the feeling you are almost chaining skills & attacks. Much like a platformer fighting game it makes you feel you should be watching for a combo meter when attacking.\n\nSome misconceptions already out there.\n\n1. Cash shop items. Only thing that may be desirable...costumes or a vehicle. Honestly neither are desirable. It's a gun game...you will get shot riding on your vehicle anyway as it is not fast enough to outrun bullets and you cannot shoot from your vehicle. Other vehicles are already available in game through a vendor & better PERMANENT costumes can be unlocked with "miles" just for playing the game. Even exp bonus/premium status is abolutely unnecessary even for those of us who work that cannot play everyday.\n\n2. No actual gear can be bought in the cash shop. No crafting boost items can be found in the shop.\n\n4. If you run out of ammo...then you really did not look at the game. Or you are a horrible shot. Every character can hold 3 (+1 Single use/mission specific) weapon slots max from the very moment it was created, even in the lacking intro tutorial you have this ability.  Each weapon type has it's own ammo pool. Shotguns only use shotgun ammo, rifles only use rifle ammo, etc...etc...starting pools are: Single Use Weapon 192 Max/ Pistols 772/ Rifles 970/ Heavy Machine Gun 100/ Shotgun 20/ Sniper 10/ Flamethrower Fuel 100/ Rocket Launcher 8. This is before bonuses on equipment and class specialization.\n\n3. Rocket launchers are not supposed to be accurate like guns, they are splash damage weapons.\n\n4. Again best things in life, or in this case, game...are free. And that is how they have built this game. The best weapons, armor, & recipes only drop. You will not find any of these in the cash shop. And this is a loot friendly game. Enemies are walking piñatas and drop loot like candy.\n\n\nNow for some of the good:\n\nCompared to many other MMO's the interface is ridiculously simple.\n\nQuests will carry you all the way out to current endgame status.\n\nLoot, loot, loot...\n\nAll gear uses an RNG method for assigning bonuses to the gear when dropped, much like Borderlands & Defiance. So it gives you true tailorization of your character to fit your playing style.\n\nIf you want to play with a controller, well the option is not there unless you have programming software...but if you do you can play this game like a twin stick shooter.\n\nVery laid back, sit in your chair and enjoy killing stuff type of game.\n\nLower tier equipment can be just as good and in some cases better than top tier equipment. This way you do not have to spend a good chunk of your life grinding for top tier items just to keep up with other players.\n\nAccount wide storage. There are 2 storage types, personal & account. Both storage types can be decently upgraded with game earned currency. Much like any other F2P game that uses storage to increase it massively will require real cash but, with the RNG bonus stat system and drop rates I doubt you will be storing much. I feel the account wide storage would see more use than personal. But that is just a personal opinion. More so, it's something you would have to see and experience yourself.\n\nTrue character buidling, each class specialization can be built in different ways to fit how you play vs the old "one build rules all" most games with classes and character building accidentally fall into.\n\nNow for some of the bad:\n\nThis is definitely not a "dedicate some time to" type of game. The grinding in quests can get repetitive. It's more heavily gun based than balanced between guns & skills. So if you are good with games of this type you can easily solo areas that were meant to be partied in. This is more of "have fun demolishing enemies with firepower when you want to with friends" type of game.\n\nYes, control can feel slightly sluiggish on any PC.\n\nThe game, though playable, has not even reached a 1.0 status yet, so the graphics engine could use some major tweaking. In short, I have seen full 3D games with much more immersive graphics run much faster than this more simpled 2.5d title, which is pretty sad.\n\nThere is my personal concern that, one particular class build is semi-godly overpowered to the point that it makes the strongest enemies look like paper, regardless of weapon level. Fortunately as long as I have been playing this game I have not seen anyone use this build so that information I will keep that to myself(No, I have no affiliation with this game, it was just the first character I built that I unwittingly found this unbalance on). The game is easy enough for anyone to play with just guns alone, so do not ask about it. I will put you on permanent ignore.\n\nCurrently, very short game for an MMO, I think I reached endgame on 2 characters in a week. But that week was also spent dedicated to this game. And it's why I do not suggest dedicating daily time to it. It is too quick to reach the current endgame status. But please bear in mind this game has not been out very long, even prior to it's steam release.\n\nClasses vs Backgrounds - At the beginning you will see each character background has a bonus & once you reach the level to choose a specialization, it will not matter. If you are good at these types of games all the classes will feel the same unfortunately. Since I had mentioned earlier about being more gun based than skill + gun balanced, you will most likely forget you have skills and just gun everything down.\n\nOverall as short as this game is, I wholeheartedly recommend it as a time filler. But I cannot yet recommend it as a must try.\n\n\nForgot to add, if you guys like this game there is another game like this that did not have a grand/well known release, not on steam yet either, called Bounty Hounds Online hosted by Subagames. It's another fairly new game. But has the tiny population problem this one also suffered from before steam. Because of not enough advertisement. Similiar to this, but with more of a classic MMORPG feel & full 3D camera. I'm hoping that game will also make it to steam.\n\nOLD PLAYERS TO LOGIN WITH YOUR ORIGINAL ACCOUNT\n\n1. Right click the game in Steam Library. Choose properties>Click Local Files tab>Then Browse Local FIles.\n\n2. Launch the game from MRLauncher.exe (or make shortcut then launch). It will launch the standalone client menu and allow you to login with your jcplanet login.","September 21, 2015","true","146.2"," 108 of 142 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","108","142","9","14"

If you're easily amused like I am you'll just laugh it off. Nothing's really game-breaking so far and they're not charging me anything for it.

Thank god it's not mouse only movement like diablo. This game is simple/easy but addicting because of the loot mechanics where any mob can drop legendaries(although rare), unlike some other mmos(i'm looking at you Defiance).  There are only four classes, however the skillpoints you get are few each level so you must be careful on deciding which skilltree on each class you want to choose. It's also a game where you need some reflex if you're going to play some type of class, like sniper.\nMy biggest gripe is the travel time. In the start, the places you need to go are not too far so it's okay, however as you progress in your quests you would need to go to far away places and there is no quick travel to get there. The only quick travel available is to go back to main town, not the other way around. At level 16 make sure you get the free vechicle in town so you won't bored out of your mind traveling to far places.\nAnyhow, It's great so far and I've gotten 3 chars to level 20 (max is way above, i 50+?).\nThe cash shop provides boost(exp, luck) and custom clothes. I haven't tried pvp yet since I'm a pve player,.. even then this game would last you a long time, it gets a little grindy after lev 30, then again many mmos get grindy at later levels.\n\nedit: nevermind about the quick travel comment, there is indeed a quick travel system in the heliport, don't know how i missed that. thank you commenter","October 3, 2015","true","811.9"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","41","48","8","3"

Can provide hours of gameplay since it's a dungeon crawler with varying classes that may use certain weapons. The translation is laughably bad, and the story isn't that really interesting. There's nothing special with the Cash Shop nor is there anything worth buying really, since inventory and bank space can be bought with in-game currency. Fun to play alone, or with friends.\n\nPros:\n--------\n- Fun and casual game for those not looking to play something hardcore and just want to kill time / relax on.\n- Simple and easy controls / combat / UI\n- Casual drop tables, meaning that rare items and up will drop often if you spend some time playing the game, rewarding players for just playing and killing mobs.\n- Free mount at lvl 16\n- Free gifts just for staying logged in\n- Doesn't require a strong computer, so lower-end computer uses can enjoy the game as well\n- Instanced missions that can be done with other players and will always give rare rewards at the end depending on how many points the entire team scored.\n- Plethora of weapons to use, including chainsaws, rocket launchers and heavy machine guns\n- Character customization and wearable armors to make your character look unique to others.\n- Can buy more inventory and bank space with in-game currency (CRI).\n- Game is not Pay 2 Win\n- You can recall back to town, and teleport back to your previous location via the helicopter\n\nCons:\n--------\n- Cash shop at the moment doesn't really have anything appealing to buy (Mostly just mounts, costumes, and %magic find potions).\n- Hilariously awful translations\n- I have no idea what's happening in the story nor do I care\n- Game is probably TOO easy for those looking for a challenging dungeon crawler\n- Have to buy ammo (but it's cheap and can be found off mobs)","September 20, 2015","true","12.1"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","21","24","4","0"

Fully recommended if you want an extremely simple and satisfying game that is reminiscent of DIablo, with guns.","September 21, 2015","true","11.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

You must read translationed text in game, they are short but very interesting written.\nMy favourite line is "children are safe but 2 children are not safe, please find them instead of me".\n\nOn a serious note, this MMORPG is unlike your usual ones.  At first, seeing the game trailer and screenshots and looking at the review score, I was immediately turned off by how gimmicky yet another F2P game on Steam seems, and I never would have wanted to touch it were it not for my friend who requested we play it.\n\nUpon a glance it may seem like a third-rate cheap budget game but it has a unique engine unlike anything I've seen before. It's 2.5D and it also has physics (dead bodies and loose objects can interact physically against terrain of the world), and I've never seen any engine reproducing any aspects of physics in any MMO, but this one does it well. I believe this game is newly released based off a Korean company and it has some ways to go but it's a very promising and solid game as it stands which is fun to play with friends, at least for a while.\n\nIt's basically a very funky and "strange" game with many weird unconventional things but you can still easily see the effort and love that the developers seem to have put into the game. The art is astounding, and world models varying based on your equipped items, which is more than some free MMOs can ask for. The translation is absolutely horrible and grammatically always incorrect in every single line of text but is still so easily understandable and thus humorously lovable.\n\nI recommend a shot at this game if you're having a hard time deciding. This is one of those "wtf" games that you can't stop laughing at yet relaxingly enjoy with friends.","October 8, 2015","true","6.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","0"

It is a Free To play MMORPG from the East so yeah its kind of grindy maybe. But the grind sometimes worth it since the weapon and armor is also randomly dropped and sometimes you would get a legendary(purple) traits weapons or armor which can have freaking high stats and bonuses. Well anyways if you like Alien Shooter, or something like that but much easier and with Ammo limitations, well this would be the game maybe.\n\nI had to say its worth a try. At the beginning you'll be shooting everything like a MLG pro since most early mobs takes little shots to be killed lol.\n\nAlso I think the PVP would be based on the player's latency sadly. So it'll be pretty bad in PVP i think if the player is from faraway regions and play the game. Oh well just check it for a while and dump it as you wish.

I put in almost 15 hours and got to almost level 30. To be safe I will say i got a character to level 25 as a sniper class. You can pretty much solo nearly all the content up until level cap from what im told, which I think is lv50. I havent made it that high so I wouldnt know.

The suggest using it but you can get by without ever needing it.\n- controls are clunky in the style of Twin Stick only working with mouse and keyboard. Would work better with Controlelr support.\n- Animations**\n- Movement Animations are very clunky and dated, especially with vehilce mounts and mission oriented vehicles.\n- Skill & combat animations are not as precise as they could be. Not saying im looking for the accuracy of a AAA game, you will notice if you play that using certain weapons or skills that they tend to miss while landing dead on pretty frequently.\n\nFor what the game is worth I grant it a PLAYABLE  6/10\nFrom there take it as you wish.","October 17, 2015","true","14.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You're a member of some rebel group of survivors or something... that's about all I could make out from the terrible Engrish during the "cutscenes." (Which are mostly just panning pieces of art.)\n\nThe game itself feels like someone decided to make a Diablo style game with a different setting, and guns. The gameplay feels pretty solid, it is enjoyable running around mowing down big groups of guys and collecting oodles of loot.\nThe downside here is that there's not really much more to the game than that. Everything you do feels about the same as everything else. Quests come in 3 flavors: Kill X number of this, go interact with x number of that, or collect x number of whatevers. Just about every quest in the game is some form of that. On top of that, there's an ammo system, which feels totally unecessary, and will require you to go back to town every so often to refill.\n\nGraphically the game isn't bad. It's not amazing, but the graphics do the job well enough. Things look like you would expect them too, and it ties together well, though the enemies could use a little more variety.\n\nLoot is plentiful, and fun to collect, true to the ARPG style, however the loot list seems quite shallow. I found myself collecting about 4 or 5 of the same item from a set over the course of an hour. The difference in weaponry is also negligible, outside of the damage output. Basically, just grab the rarest weapon you can find for your class because it will do the most damage. It's a bit like celebrating getting a new Porsche by taking it for a spin, only to discover that everyone else bought themselves a Porsche as well. There's almost no point to any of the weapons except the two highest rarities, because nobody will want them.\n\nSound is about average I would say, with the exception of the music. The music is great!..... the first time or two you hear it. From what I can tell though, there are only 3 songs in the entire game. One for the menu, one for town, and one for NOT in town. Which just repeats.... and repeats. As much as you might enjoy it at first, you'll turn it off soon.\n\nOtherwise the game has a few more things that kind of bothered me.. one is the spawn rate. Dear LORD the spawn rate. You could literally stand in one place at points and complete missions because of the sheer number of mobs that spawn in so quickly. Things will respawn in seconds!\n\nAnother MAJOR problem with the game is the Engrish. It's HORRIBLE. I've played games in languages I don't even speak that were more intelligible than this. What's the plot? The storyline? I don't know, because I couldn't make sense of the stuff on the screen. Google translate could probably do a better job here if not at least as good.\n\nLastly, the game is EASY. I mean, ludicrously easy. I was able to run through group mission areas that I was underleveled for, solo, without so much as losing a single HP. It's almost to the point where it's a casual game, because let's face it, about the only way you're going to die is if you go AFK in the middle of a pack of mobs.\n\nTLDR\nAll in all, the game is fun for a bit, it's not something I would stick around long term and play, but if you want something that's close to a casual action RPG, that you can play without too much time commitment,  give it a shot! If nothing else the head-scratchingly-bad Engrish is worth a laugh or two.","September 20, 2015","true","4.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChillbroSwagins/recommended/362070/","ChillbroSwagins","Chillbro Swagins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChillbroSwagins/","21 products in account","PROS:\n\nWoW-style servers where everyone shares one world with different maps for each area.\nDiablo-style graphics, loot, and camera angles.\nSimilar playstyle as the arcade zombies from call of duty.\n\nThe loot system is GREAT. 5 stars on this front. It's if Diablo 2 met Diablo 3 and they had a baby: if you are in a party (which goes up to 3 players unless your in a special mission), then there is a shared loot system. If you are not in a party, other players in your server can see your drops - but they cant pick them up. Nothing is bound on pickup other than items from quests ONLY. Most rare/super rare/legendary/set items are bind on equip, which means... you guessed it...\n\nThere is an Auction House. Lovin' it. If you get tired of grinding, you can always try to take control of the AH. Theres is a decent yet small enough community where the prices fluctuate a lot but things still sell easy enough so long as you are smart about it. Many times if you need that 1 last set piece, it wont be there.., BUT.... theres the same chance it will be there. It's a 50/50 chance really. Yet something of some sort of help will always be available until you reach high end levels, so long as you've got the CRI (which is the free ingame currency). If you like playing the AH like me, you can easily become rich fast here. I'm not - I liquidate everything cuz I'm too impatient - but someday perhaps ^_^.\n\nRushing characters is not possible. At all. Two thumbs up. You MUST play through the game. ... I like it.\n\nTypes of customizable gears include armors/legs/boots/helmets/gloves/plate which is like a shield/neck/rings/weapons/etc. Types of weapons are pistols/shotguns/machine guns/flamethrowers/rocket launchers/snipers/chainsaws/rifles. Any of these can be crafted, but it's not viable until later on in the game.) Additionally, you can get gear called avatar from certain quests or from the coin shop (real money shop) that will alter your ingame appearance and may have some large boosts for dmg, def, move speed, etc. This is a separate tab and is worn "over" your regular gear. Enjoy! =)\n\nYou build and level up a character of one of 4 classes. Not difficult to grasp. Each class has its skill tree specific to it,\n\nYou can dodge (ninja-roll) which is surprisingly effective.\n\nCONS:\nNot much information for this game is available on the web.\nThe game is a little choppy/buggy - not too bad for me yet, but it's happened to others from what I've heard.\nGraphics could be better - but this could also be seen as a PRO because you don't need a super video card or processor to run it.\nMonotonous grinding aspect to the questline.\nBad translations - which can be funny at times, but can also be confusing at times. "If you don't give me delicious, I'll be at play." ...... what?\nGame gets progressively more difficult, inspiring it's users to pay money for temporary buffs from the coin shop - however this isnt entirely necessary. Could be seen as a PRO because it inspires you to try harder aswell and get more skillful.","November 6, 2015","true","41.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

Don't get me wrong. I find the gameplay to be simple and easy. You've got guns, guns, guns, more guns, and some skills as well. It's good as far as ARPG aspects go. However, it's nothing special. The English translations are awful (you'd think they'd bother finding a native English speaker to correct the grammar) and the story is kind of stupid, if it's there at all.\n\nAn added element that I DID like was some basic customization for your character in the beginning.

I was glad to hear N2games exported it overseas. I spent the last few hours levelling some characters and testing out the main features of the game.\n\nThe game is unintentionally hilarious, and I like it so.\n\n\n\n-Graphics are horrendous to the point where even a well-made modern smart phone game would easily topple Metal Reaper in terms of aesthetics. The launcher would advertise all the classic sexy bunny and maid costumes worn by... Half disfigured women whose faces were comprised of a grand total of 5 polygons.\n\nA better lightning may have helped hide some of the ugliest textures, but since more than half of the stages takes place in daylight, you will have the uncanny chance to enjoy the vast and colorful wastelands of the Nix Empire at full view!\n\n\n\n\n-English is... Oh.\nHaving korean origins myself, I know for a fact they absolutely hate using google translate or the likes, leading to have million wons-costing huge neon signs mispelled in ways that would make you lose sight, not because it was too bright, but because you have yourself decided to gouge your eyes out, an almost natural reflex man would have when, for example, one is facing an ancient god of the depths in its wake.\n\nThen again, you will most likely not bother reading the quests because of how generic they are. And it's far from being broken to the point where you can't understand ♥♥♥♥. Though I do find it quite amusing when a gigantic camel-riding mad man called "Raider Sniper Leader" attempts to stab with his... Halberd.\nIf you are to ever play on a korean CS:GO servers, beware of polearm users. They are really the worst.\n\n\n\n\n-In terms of features, Metal Reaper hardly differs from all the good (and terrible) asian MMORPGs. It's mostly about grinding quests and mobs, occasionally venturing is small ♥♥♥ dungeons to defeat a big boss with the reaction time of a millenia-old snail on prozac.\n\nThere are a few "PVP" events I didn't have the occasion to formally test out, but some of them are really simple in concept, such as the zombie mod, not the CoD one but the CS one. Quite less entertaining due to engine limitations.\n\nThe best (read: not bad) part is probably mob bashing. You'll be doing this a lot because, as mentionned, the game gets grindy reel-fo'in-fast. You get to choose between 4 "branches", such as the classic pistol/sniper marksman, the chainsaw-flamethrower wryyyy combo, the machinegun/bazooka hulkogan or the quaint pump shotgun and medpack support. Guess which one I tested out first. Blasting hordes of scorpions and tribals away with a shotty reminded me of my fond times in the West coast of the wastelands trying to get past the enclave troopers to quick-loot Navarro. The controls being quite smooth and with the ability to roll all game long (no stamina bar per se.), you'll find yourself enthralled into this fast paced monster-exploding game.\nI did mention everything seems to fly the ♥♥♥♥ away once you finish riddling them with boolets. This would more than make sense if you are using the rocket launcher or a similar heavy duty weapon, but shooting my tiny 9mm at a fat mutated zombie and seeing him ragdoll through the world with greater haste convinced me that this might as well be the best game I have played for years.\n\n\n\nOverall, nothing remarkable about this game I'd say. It's a simple, fast paced "hack-and-slash" MMORPG most of you may easily grasp the concept of. If you can get past the terrible engrish and the even more horrendous textures and models, you may find this game to be a lot of fun, for... Oh wait! It's free! What are you waiting for?\nI know I did, albeit most likely not in the ways the devs intended us to.\n\n\n"10/10 The Slaughtering Grounds but actually playable" - Daisuke","October 17, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is pretty fun. That's it. The quests are very generic, the NPC design is pretty bad, you run into the same enemies all the time-scorpions and people with guns. The class choices aren't too different, except for the Panzer (melee one), and the fact that you can't see what  a talent does until you are high enough level to skill into it is just wrong. I got to level 10, at which point i could finally start crafting things. Unfortunately, the crafting is just badly designed, requiring very rare materials for even the easiest, most useless item. It's pretty easy to farm those materials inside dungeons, but dungeons take some sort of energy to run, which you will quickly run out of. You can AFK in the hot springs to get buffs and regenerate energy, but do you really want to spend your time AFKing in a game or having fun in some other game?","October 17, 2015","false","7.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's not without a few problems; poor localization, occasional bugs, and limited ability to configure the ui.  Still, these can be forgiven and don't detract too much from the game itself.\n\nThis is a game ruined by it's business model.  Not only is it pay to win at it's very worst (selling costumes with large stat increases) but even lauds this as dlc.  They imply that a pay to win costume and some xp increases is the same as the Dragonborn dlc in Skyrim or Old World Blues in New Vegas.  You're paying more for this pay to win "dlc" then many games in their entirety.\n\nAt best this serves as a display that these kinds of games are still in demand.  Perhaps some other publisher can pick this up and salvage the situation, but for now this is a game to be wary of.  You may have some fun here, it's worth checking out at least, but I could not in good conscience recommend paying any money for it.","October 17, 2015","false","10.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You have to grind hard to get blueprints and just as hard to get the materials... and you are rewarded less than half of what you'd expect in crafting experience.\n- Lack of inventory space and f2p customization rewards.\n\n7/10","October 20, 2015","false","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fair, easy to get into, not badly pay to win, and easy to play with friends. Progression is gradual and never leaves you starved for things to do, and the class system is fun and easy to grasp. Imagine Runescape with guns. The translations are pretty bad, but the game is legible and the quests are self-explainatory enough that it doesn't take away from anything. Lots of variety and weapons, fun customization options. The quests do start to feel a lot of the same after a while, but the gameplay is fluid enough that it'll keep your attention longer than a lot of other free to plays.\n\nPros\n+Easy to understand, easy to grasp, easy to follow\n+Dungeons, missions and lengthy story\n+Fun to explore, maps are varied\n+Not pay to win\n+Small download, easy to run on most computers\n+Looting is fun and rewarding, you never feel like you can't get your hands on something you want\n+Good customization and weapons list.\n\nCons\n-Bad translation, feels like the dev threw it in google translate and called it done.\n-Quests can get repititive.\n-Sometimes glitchy, many enemies on screen at once generates copious lag in some places.\n\n\nVERDICT: 8/10","May 17","true","31.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
